Women have participated in numerous ways, and in a variety of complex cultural contexts, throughout the histor y of jazz in New Orleans. While we do see traces of women's participati on in extant New Orleans jazz histories, we seldom see women presented as central to jazz culture. Therefore, they tend to appear to occupy minor or supporting roles, if they appear at all.

I am grateful to Tami for her continued generosity in sharing her research skills beyond that per iod and throughout the two-year span of this project. Special thanks to Julia Goodfox, my research assistant for the summer of 2002, who set up an incredibly efficient databas e and into it typed hundreds of entries into manageable form. Independent researc her Garnette Cadogan of New Orleans came to the rescue at numerous critical junctures. Roy Tucker brought a genealogist's methodology to bear on this project, great ly enhancing the biographical data on little- known artists. Norman Vickers helped out wi th Pensacola research. Jazz researcher Maxine Gordon volunteered her assistance in Ne w York. I owe a very special thanks to Kay D. Ray, who shared footage of intervie ws with New Orleans musicians from her forthcoming film project, Lady Be Good: Instrumental Women in Jazz . Kay's film will go a long way toward correcting the omission of women from our historical knowledge of jazz-and she accurately recognizes the impor tance of New Orleans women throughout the history of jazz.

Margie, this is for you-and for the women who have been part of the history of New Orleans jazz in so many ways. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 1 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women Introduction This Research Study uses a feminist perspective to focus historically on women in New Orleans jazz, and to learn mo re about how gender factored into the development of jazz in New Orleans. The goal of this study is to increase our knowledge of women involved in New Or leans jazz, roughly between 1880 and 1980, and therefore, to increase our knowledge of New Orleans jazz history. Why Study Women in Jazz? If women were so important to the history of New Orleans jazz, why conduct a special study on them? Wouldn't they simply show up in any well-researched survey of New Orleans jazz? Isn't it counter-p roductive to conduct a separate study? It would be ideal, of course, if all se rious historical inquiries automatically considered women as well as men as historic al actors. Yet scholars of women's history have found that this has usua lly not been the case; and jazz history is no exception. In fact, feminist historians have pointed out that unless researchers ask \"where are the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 2women?\" they are more likely than not to miss significant contributions of women. In order to have a more complete underst anding of women and how ideas about gender affected people's lives, feminist histori ans have conducted specialized \"women's histories,\" not to separate women out from history, but to find them , and then to expand the boundaries of what counts as history to include new, more complete ways, of understanding history. Because gender\u2014or the array of soci al meanings associated with femininity and masculinity\u2014have a knack for seeming natural , instead of as cultural and historical, it is extraordinarily easy to miss its operations when conducting a research study of an area believed to be a history of men. During the 1980s, as part of a surge in inte rest in women's history (brought on by the women's movement of t he 1960s and 1970s), several books on women in jazz were published that revealed the active presenc e of countless people, places, and musical activities that had been excluded or minimized in books on jazz history up to that point. Thanks to scholars such as Linda Dahl, D. Antoinette Handy, and Sally Placksin, we now have access to areas of knowledge abo ut jazz history and women's history that may otherwise still elude us. 1 We now know that women participated on every instrument, in every genre, in every period of ja zz history. We also know that they often participated differently, or in different areas , than are ordinarily considered historically important, such as in family bands, all- woman bands, or as dancers or teachers, and that these areas typically becam e minimized in jazz histories. According to women-in-jazz historians, se veral factors have led to the low profile A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 3or out-and-out absence of women in jazz from jazz history books. Interestingly, the primary reason is not that the authors of earlier jazz hi story books intentionally excluded women. Oftentimes, as in other areas of so cial life, women did not have access to roles that historians are accustomed to using in their criterion for historical importance. Women may have been excluded from the most prestigious activities, for example from playing cornet in 1920s jazz bands, but may have been critical players in other areas; for example as singers, non-soloing pianists in 1920s jazz bands, or as cornetists at private parties, in all-wom an bands, or in vaudeville shows. They may have been important contributors in even more forgotten areas of jazz history, such as dancers, party givers, club members, or music teachers. Wom en's careers may not have been documented to the extent as were men's during the times in which they lived , so historians relying on evidence such as record ings may be simply replicating the biases of social life, rather than critically includi ng those sex-specific differences as part of the experiences of people, both m en and women, in history. Congo Square, a case study In 1975, a graduate student named Susan Cavin publish ed one of the earliest scholarly articles calling for more attenti on to women in jazz history. Her article, entitled, \"Missing Women: On the Voodoo Trail to Jazz,\"2 is perhaps the first to argue that women played roles in jazz history ot her than that of classic blues singers. In her article, Cavin urged jazz histori ans to examine their \"benign neglect\" of A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 4women that contributed to t he wide-spread belief that only men were important to jazz history. As evidence, she revisited one of th e most often-cited origin points of jazz: the dancing and drumming on Cong o Square in New Orleans. Congo Square had long appealed to jazz hist orians as a unique site of cultural mixing that prepared the stage fo r early jazz to develop. It was where slaves, free people of color, Europeans, and Native Americ ans gathered on Sundays to sell and buy goods. Congo Square provided rare opportuniti es for enslaved Africans and their descendants to congregate and to socialize in a relatively \"free\" manner. It was a setting whereby African culture (primarily from the Senegal River basin at first; then via Haiti; and increasingly blended with vernacular culture developed in America) survived, transformed, and became uniquely African Am erican, uniquely New Orleanean, and a culturally rich springboard for early New Orleans jazz.3 Cavin reasoned that if the vodun (voodoo) related practices of dancing, vocalizing, and drumming on Congo Square in New Orleans in the 1700 and 1800s were critical to the creation of jazz; and if scholars of religions of the African Diaspora were correct in observing that women held powe rful roles in West African, Haitian, and African American vodun circles, then jazz historians were surely missing a beat when they comfortably asserting masculine prono uns when discussing pr e-jazz musicians of Congo Square. The only historian she found who addressed \"the sex variable\" was Christopher White, who observe d that \"no research had been done analyzing the sex of drummers of Congo Square.\"4 Yet in their references to the connection between Congo A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 5Square and jazz, historians consistently cl osed off the possibility that drummers, or other important participants, could have included women. In retracing the researchers' steps on the \"voodoo trail to jazz,\" Cavin found evidence-in the same newspaper and colonial reports that other historians had studied- of women's involvement as dancers, spirit ual leaders, and even dr ummers. Benjamin Latrobe had, for instance, reported on a wom an drummer in Congo Square in 1819, but jazz historians who had utilized Latrobe's a ccount had not picked up the \"sex variable\" and one-no doubt unconsciously-even switched t he pronoun to \"he\" while citing that very passage!5 Cultural exchange between \"African\" and \"European\" \"elements\" caught the attention of jazz historians who look ed to Congo Square, but sex was overlooked as a significant cultural factor. Cavin wrote: \"What these jazz historians do not consider is specifically: who were the people involved in voodoo in New Orleans, what segment of the black and white populations were involved in this cultural exchange?\" 6 Furthermore, argued Cavin, if what is important to jazz about Congo Square is the mixing of African and Eur opean cultures in an African vodun context, then the significance of Congo Square may be overstated . Congo Square, after all, was a public space. Vodun ceremonies were not held in the open square in the 1800s, but in more secluded areas, and were often pr esided over by black women of African and/or Haitian descent, as \"voodoo queens.\" These less public gatherings were attended by diverse groups of women, including white women, much to the consternation of local authorities. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 6If jazz historians are interested in Congo Square as a culturally complex launch-pad to jazz, argued Cavin, then wouldn't it follow t hat they would also be interested in those more private spaces where diverse women and men acted as practitioners, clients, or spectators of vodun ? Much more research would need to be done to develop this hypothesis, she ceded, but reas oned that the task seemed worthy of the attentions of jazz researchers. While Cavin was clearly addressing all jazz researchers, not ju st the historians of women in jazz, the latter is the group that heeded her call. As noted earlier, in the 1980s, several books on women and jazz were published that continue to serve as important resources for contemporary resear chers. The authors of these books, like Cavin, also revisited evidence thought to be important to jazz hi story, followed up the clues about women's participation, and document ed women's existence in jazz. They also asked question, \"where are the women? \" and allowed the sometimes surprising answers to expand their definitions of w hat counted as important in jazz history. What does it mean to study gender? When Cavin wrote her import ant article in 1975, it was a bold move to suggest that competent jazz historians may have ov erlooked women. Twenty-five years later, researchers of women's history are less lik ely to use terms like \"missing women,\" or even \"sex variable,\" and more likely to focus on \"gender.\" Analysis of gender are interested in studying ideas about masculinit y and femininity as socially produced, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 7rather than as the natural, inev itable consequences of being born male or female. Such scholars are less likely to try to \"add in women\" to existing notions of history, and more likely to study how ideas about masculinity and femininity shaped peoples lives. What Cavin calls the \"benign neglect\" of jazz historians who omitted women, feminist historians today would analyze as a function of \"gender\" in common ways of thinking about jazz. If this distinction seems irrelevant, just ask people to describe who comes to mind when they think of the figure of the \"jazz musician.\" Some people may think of singers, such as Billie Holiday, and perhaps of pianists, such as Mary Lou Williams, but most people will think of iconic jazzmen. If this pattern was simply a matter of \"lost women,\" then it should hav e been resolved with the publication of women-in-jazz history books in the 1980s. A gender analysis explains why information about women in jazz hasn't changed the co mmon understanding of jazz as a masculine and manly preserve. Contemporary feminist scholars advocat e the study gender as a complex, ever- changing, and never acting alone. Ideas about femininity and masculinity intersect with other social categories, like race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and nationality. Social groups will struggle to define t heir own identities through t hese categories, while other social groups define these differently. Social groups will also seek to define each other, often in ways that are to someone's disadvan tage. Through black-face minstrelsy, for example, performances that make black m en seem less masculine than white men, and make black women seem less feminine than white women, comprised significant parts A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 8of the racial stereotyping in such shows. Culture has also been a powerful battleground for those who would affirm and those who would resist constructions of women of color as sexually available and white women as chaste, which have been used to shore up the ideology of white supremacy and white racial purity in the U.S. To complicate matters, in a culturally diverse setting such as New Orleans, many distinct social groups, each their own changing sets of ideas about gender, relentlessly come into contact with each other. As thes e strikingly different sets of ideas about gender meet, they affect each other in a variet y of dynamic ways. They challenge each other. They vie for dominance. They may influence, even change each other. When a generation seeks to define itself as different from its predece ssor, it often turns to new gender definitions as a means for modernizing itself and creating new identities. The flapper of the 1920s, for example, was a new expression of femininity that relied on some markers previously considered masculine\u2014short hair, \"boyish\" figures, athleticism, drinking, smoking, sexual fr eedom, etc.\u2014that expres sed modern identities for the women and men of the social groups for whom it was important. For white flappers, listening to black music was another form of transgression that served to differentiate them, and their generation, fr om that of their mothers and fathers. Music is one of the places wher e people learn gender, where ideas about masculinity and femininity (intersected with ot her categories, such as race, etc.) are learned, taught, debated, consolidated, and chall enged, as a part of social organization. Some of these musical places may include styles of music (for example, in jazz circles, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 9\"hot\" has been widely associ ated with masculinity, and \"s weet\" with femininity), instruments (trumpet a ssociated with masculinity, piano with femininity), musical roles (instrumentalist, singer, dancer, musician's spouse, for example). These \"norms\" will not tell us the whole story, but they will tell us something about how music is operating in a broader struggle over social distributi on of power. Historians expect conflict when they study power, and this is no different for historians of gender and music. Knowing the \"norms,\" will help us to know when some one, or a group of people, is challenging those \"norms,\" and to track when struggles and change take place. It behooves us then not only to \"write women into jazz,\" but to conduct historically and culturally specific resear ch that explores how people us e music in their lives, and how these uses participate in the social construction of gender. Such a study may include questions such as: Which sounds, instruments, and musical activities are considered appropriate for women at this pa rticular time and place? Which women? Which musical activities are considered appr opriate for men? Which men? Do these \"norms\" differ across race, ethnicity, cla ss, religion, neighborhood, or other social factors? Do they change over time? This Research Study attempts to bring these insights and questions to bear on a focused c onsideration of New Or leans jazz history, through a survey of the one hundr ed year period between 1880 and 1980. I have already mentioned that ideas about how to study women and gender have changed since Susan Cavin wrote her article in 1975. The same could be said for ideas about how to study New Orleans jazz history. Historians no longer view the cultural A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 10exchange that led to jazz as simply black a nd white, or African and European, or even as black and white and Creole, but far mo re complex, multiple-differentiated, and changing. More attention is paid to specific diverse identities and histories, including those of Haitian, Cuban, Me xican, French, Italian, and Je wish musicians; of Creoles of color, including those with Italian and Spanish, as well as French heritage. Historians are less interested in pinning people do wn into coherent group identities with predictable abilities and tastes, than they are in studying how these group identities are forged at various levels of society. Such st udies, then, must look at everything from laws and census categories that legally classified groups of people from above, to the cultural and social ways that people s ought to define and redefine themselves for reasons of heritage, survival, alliance-building, and in response to social, legal, and political restrictions, as well as in how individuals and groups identified themselves. Complex analyses of racial, ethnic, linguistic, national, religious, and class differences are increasingly deemed necessary for understanding New Orleans jazz history. More historical study of how gender operates in all of these categories will enrich our historical understandi ng of the many social factor s that contributed to the history of New Orleans jazz. Gender complexi ty is a part of that cultural complexity. Some scholars believe that one of t he defining elements of jazz is its unique capacity for incorporating cultural and aesthetic differences. Olly Wilson, an important scholar of music of the African Diaspora, has argued that cultural variety is not only important to the historical origins of jazz, but to the aesthetics of jazz and other forms of A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 11African American music.7 According to Wilson, an African American musical tradition exists that it is uniquely characterized its aesthetic approach to cultural variety. He describes this aesthetic as \"a comm on approach to music making in which a kaleidoscopic range of dramatic ally contrasting qualities of sound (timbre) is sought in both vocal and instrumental music.\" In other words, when instruments play in unison, this ideal values individuated simultaneity w here the listener can pick out the \"distinct\" and \"contrasting\" voices rat her than hearing the sound as a blend. When one voice or instrument plays alone, this value of \"difference\" in sound is heard in the variation of timbre, the usage of speech-lik e sounds, shadings, moans, etc.8 If cultural variety is important to jazz as an endless source of \"difference,\" then this is another excellent argument for the importance of consider ing gender difference, along with race difference, class difference, religious difference, language difference, and so forth, when exploring jazz history. How do ideas about \"sounding feminine\" or \"sounding masculine\" contribute to timbral variet y in jazz aesthetics? How did the roles that women most commonly filled-as vocalists , pianists, educators-contribute ltural variety contribut ed to the \"sound ideal\" on which jazz is based, and if culturally-specif ic ideas about gender comprise one of the ways that people come to understand themselves as distinct \"peoples ,\" then a study of New Orleans jazz must include gender and women. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 12Goals of this Research Study Just as Susan Cavin's article on women of Congo Square constituted a step toward taking gender seriously as a cultural fa ctor in jazz history, and issued a call for finding ways to re-frame ja zz history so that gender and women are visible, this Research Study constitutes a step toward re-thinking New Orleans jazz history from 1880 to 1980 as significantly affected by women's participation and shaped by ideas about gender.9 This Research Study, theref ore, should not be seen as conclusive or exhaustive, but as a serious step within a vast, largely untapped area of study. This study builds from Cavin's work, and from work not available to her in 1975. Yet this Research Study, too, is a call fo r more research and more study. It is an exciting time to re-think New Orleans jazz history through the lens of women and gender. Recent scholarship on women and gender in New Orleans jazz includes Jeffrey Taylor's analysis of the New Orleans piano styles of Chicago pianists Lovie Austin and Lil Hardin Armstrong, in which he argues that without a gender analysis of power and music, we cannot appre ciate certain aspects of their musical contributions (i.e. accompaniment) that we re defined as \"feminine,\" and routinely devalued by jazz historians. Charles Cham berlain's work on female jazz pianists in New Orleans incorporates a gender analysis of jazz, the piano, an d respectability. 10 Laurie Stras has been working on a race and gender analysis of the Boswell Sisters and what they meant at national and local New Orleans levels.11 Lynn Abbott and Doug A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 13Seroff's meticulous revisiting of early vaudeville and minstrelsy provides us with unprecedented data on women in these important sites of early jazz development.12 This Research Study also benefits fr om recent scholarship on gender, race, sexuality, and ethnicity in related topics such as quadroon balls, creolization, Mardi Gras, Storyville (both prostitution industry and anti-prostitution reformers), and tourism in New Orleans. All of these works shed lig ht on women's history, jazz history, and histories of the many ways that people und erstood, lived, defined, and redefined gender in New Orleans before and during the time when jazz was being developed.13 The carefully tended and ever-expanding pool of increasingly available documentation of early jazz in New Orleans archives provides a rich archive for revisiting history with an analytical intere st in women and gender . Though New Orleans jazz histories have not generally emphasized women and gender, we are fortunate that serious collectors of New Orleans jazz histor y, such as William Russell, Richard Allen, Barry Martyn, Jack Stewart, and Tad Jones, have included women in their quest for information. Archivists such as Bruce Boyd Raeburn, Lynn Abbott and Alma Williams Freeman at the Hogan Jazz Archive have made a concerted effort to make knowledge about women in jazz history available. T he resources are plentiful for exhibits, educational programming, and future research projects on women in New Orleans jazz. The New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park has already contributed invaluable educational programming on women in jazz at the Visitor's Center, and is poised to stand as a major for preserving, producing, and presenting historic al knowledge about A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 14women and gender in New Orleans Jazz. The goals of this Research Study incl uded revisiting source materials on New Orleans jazz available in 2004 with a fo cus on women and gender, as Cavin revisited the sources on Congo Square in 1975, and to compare them wit h both the written histories of New Orleans jazz in general, and with the women-in-jazz histories written in the 1980s that were not specific to New Orl eans. To that end, I attempted to compile a compendium of women's activities as related to New Orleans jazz history. For the purposes of this study, I ha ve focused on the one hundred year period between the time Cavin left off and the recent past, roughly 1880-1980, with an emphasis on the earlier years. I am well awar e that the latter year s of this study are short on younger players, privile ging histories of the later ca reers of women born prior to 1935. This imbalance is based on the need to narrow this study to a manageable scope. I prioritized my focus to earlie r women, and was less ambitious about more contemporary times, decid ing that this material is more readily available, though no less important. There are many women jazz musicians in New Orleans today whose stories need to be collected, and that work is yet to be done I have defined \"New Orleans jazzwomen\" as those who contributed to New Orleans jazz history, whether or nor they lived in New Orleans. Therefore, I include women like pianist Lovie Austin, who contributed to New Orleans jazz from Chicago; trumpet player Ann Cooper, traveled from Ch icago to play in New Orleans; and bassist Olivia Sophie L'Ange Porter Shipp, who wa s born in New Orleans, but spent her entire A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 15career in New York; as well as pianists Dolly Adams, Emma Barrett, and Jeanette Kimball, whose lengthy careers were based in New Orleans. I also wanted to include non-musicians, as well as musicians, such as garden party entrepreneur Betsy Cole, religious figures such as Mother Cather ine Seals, and jazz fans, jazz club members, and revivalists such as Myra Menville. I also wanted to include educators, church musicians, musicians who worked with jazz musicians, or who were influenced by jazz, but played other musical forms. Another goal of this Research Study was to put all of this data into a historical and social context that considered gender as one of the factors shapi ng what different women and men did in New Orleans jazz. This proved enormous as well, considering the complexity of social and historical chang e, differentiated by race, class, ethnicity, language, family history, neighborhood, and, of course, gender, that occurred in New Orleans between 1880 and 1980. Feminist historian Elsa Barkeley Brown uses the New Orleans term, \"Gumbo Ya Ya ,\" to describe history as \"everyone talking at once,\" comparing this to jazz. History, she writes is like jazz in that ther e are \"multiple rhythms being played simultaneously. The events and people we write about did not occur in isolation but in dialogue with a myriad of other people and even ts.\" What historians do, then, is \"to find ways to \"isolate one conversa tion and explore it, but the trick is then how to put that conversation in a context wh ich makes evident its dialogue with so many others-how to make this one lyric stand al one and at the same time be in conjunction with all the other lyrics being sung.\" 14 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 16 Barkeley Brown provides an outstandi ng model for writing about New Orleans jazz women in a historical context, since there were, simultaneously, so many messages, or \"lyrics being sung at once,\" of ten conflicting, about what women could or could not do musically; about which women \"fe ll\" from pedestals by playing jazz, and which women \"succeeded\" by becoming recognized as jazz musicians. More challenging was the task of taking the enormous pool of information and analyzing the historical dialogues in detail. For instance, for some wom en, jazz employment provided upward mobility and increased opportunities, often even an escape r oute from domestic work, share cropping, or poverty. For other s, jazz meant rebelling against religious, familial, or other social restrictions. For ot hers, it meant a serious risk of class status that could affect life chances. For some women, classical piano meant respectability and class status, but racism prevented employment in classical music, and working-class economic status made it necessary to earn a living; for such women, jazz employment could be experienced as a kind of mixed bag. For others, jazz participation became of way of being m odern, of participating in new musical forms, new technologies (such as radio, recordi ng, motor vehicle travel), and new gender possibilities at once. These different re lationships held by women to jazz in New Orleans co-existed in close proximity facilit ated by migration (both out and in), travel, religious diversity, ethnic diversity (and changing definitions, identifications, and legal restrictions). Therefore, it was less likely for New Orleaneans to see gender norms as an unchanging fact of life than it would be in a more monolithic cultural setting. Gender A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 17norms were powerful, but other visions of w hat social life of women could or should be were always in view. I have sketched what I think are promising possibilities in this Research Study, but I also want to emphas ize that the meticu lous collection and analyses of specific historical dialogues remains the exciting purview of future researchers, students, historians, educators, and curators. This Research Study is comprised of two major parts. The first part discusses women and gender and New Orleans jazz in a cultural and historical context. The second part presents biographical research fi ndings on some of the women who have participated in New Orleans jazz historically. Part One opens with a time-line of New Orleans jazz history through a view- finder that focuses on women's participation. We may not be able to see clearly the historical dialogues that Elsa Barkeley Brown would want us to develop, but we can certainly see that throughout this one hundred year period of New Orleans jazz history, women were well represented among t he many people \"talking at once.\" The time-line is followed by a historical overview of women's participation in New Orleans jazz. While this section in some wa ys elaborates the time-line, it also becomes more thematically oriented at times, em phasizing particular roles and activities and places in New Orleans jazz history in wh ich women's participation was especially prominent. In some cases, these areas are t hose that are often seen as marginal to the development of jazz. This Research St udy, however, takes a different position on \"women-appropriate\" spheres of New Orleans jazz history. Rather than seeing these A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 18areas of jazz history as incidental or unimpor tant, this study will see areas of women's involvement as places that must be reclaime d for a more complete view of New Orleans jazz history. Like other studies of women's history, the study of women in New Orleans jazz history makes it possible not only to locate women in New Orleans jazz as-we- know-it, but to increase our knowledge of both women and men in entire areas of jazz history that have been historically deval ued. These include: church musicians, vocalists, music education, theatrical perfo rmance, dancers, and \"all-girl\" bands. Inevitably, overlaps exist between this c hapter and the biographical entries that follow. Some of the women whose biographies are included in Part Two are already relatively well-known to enthusiasts of Ne w Orleans jazz, and are subject to a fair amount of documentation. T hese include pianists \"Sweet Emma\" Barrett and Billie Pierce. Others, as danc er/entertainer Neliska \"Baby\" Briscoe, pianist Margaret Kimble, entr epreneur Betsy Cole, are relati vely unknown, and scarcely mentioned in historical account s. Some entries, therefor e, primarily compile known information, while others present original re search. While far from comprehensive, this collection of entries is important in that it assembles historical data on individual lives of a diverse selection of New Orleans jazzwom en. There are many more women whose biographies deserve space in this report, but to include them all is beyond the scope of this project. Given the co mmitment to researching women in jazz shown by the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park, my hope is that opportuniti es will arise for another Research Study at some point that may continue this project. There is more A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 19than enough information for biographies of many more dozens of women significant to New Orleans jazz. I have included a list of women who should be included, realizing that even that lengthy addendum is incomplete. Questions I have asked here, and that must be asked in future studies, include: In what ways were women involved in the new musical forms that we re so important to New Orleans culture? Which women were involved with which aspects? Which musical sounds, practices, and roles were considered appropriate for women, and which appropriate for men? How did these vary across race, ethnici ty, class, language, religion, and New Orleans neighborhoods? How did these change over time? What happened when women, and men, fo r that matter, made musica l choices that conflicted with their society's notions of gender-appropr iate music-making? Did changing ideas about gender contribute to the development of jazz? How did ideas about gender affect how musicians, both men and women, participat ed in jazz at various moments in New Orleans history; as well as how they were perceived, remembered, or forgotten? How do historical ideas about gender and race and other social categories affect how we think about New Orleans jazz today? This re search study does not finally answer these questions, but does, I hope, open up some productive directions for other historians to extend the research compiled here, to consider the questions raised, and to produce comparative analyses.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 21 PART ONE: HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT This section presents a view of one hundred years of New Orleans jazz history (1890-1990) that includes women and gender. As a quick visual tool to begin re- populating the sweep of New Orl eans jazz history with women, I provide a time-line of women's jazz activities in a context of hist orical events that affected them, particularly the women who were born prior to 1935. The time-line demonstrates that New Orleans jazz histor y is replete with women, as well as men. From local musical activi ties, to traveling bands, to migrations to Northern urban centers, the west coast, even Europe; migrati ons into New Orleans from elsewhere, to recording opportunities-women have been actively present and involved in New Orleans jazz history. The time-line also shows that women musicians did not always act in isolation as \"exceptional\" wom en, but worked in historical and cultural contexts with other people, women includ ed, who participated in New Orleans jazz.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 36 Historical Overview As a cosmopolitan Caribbean hub, turn of the century New Orleans comprised many kinds of ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious, class, a nd national identifications-and with them, many kinds of music, and many def initions of proper roles for women and men. This historical overview organizes evidence of women's participation in New Orleans jazz chronologically, in order to better understand the biogr aphical entries that follow. The broad sweep of this overview also helps us to locate gender as one of many important elements in the rich history of cultural exch ange that contributed to the development of jazz in New Orleans. \"Cultural exchange\" has the ring of fair ness about it, of gi ve and take. It is important, however, to acknowledge that cult ural exchange is rarely power-free, and that not all of the cu ltural exchange that provided the context for the emergence of jazz was elective or equal. Indeed, jazz emerged in New Orleans during a time of drastic legal and political shifts that would affect the ways that people thought about themselves, their neighbors, their allegiances, and would greatly affe ct their rights and life chances. Each set of new rules impact ed people differently according to ethnicity, race, class, gender, and other factors. W hat did the emergence of jazz mean to people responding to such momentous changes as shi fting colonial legacies, Americanization, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 37sea changes of immigration, multiple wars (including the Spanish American War, Civil War and World War I), and the rise of Jim Crow? And, specifically, what did it mean to women , whose relationships to the music ar e so often left out of the story? According to Bruce Raeburn, among the im portant things one must consider in order to understand \"the origins of jazz in New Orleans\" are: how concepts of ethnicity infused with racial valences (such as Creole of color, Sicilian, and Hispanic) were subjected to a process of radical transformation in the early twentieth century, how much cross-cultural exchange had already occurred before the rise of jazz, and the degree to which these terms were malleable, especially in the hands of young people seeking to construct American identities for themselves through jazz.1 In a sense, this report seeks to focu s these considerations on the women who crafted identities and livelihoods through jazz. It also seeks to gather clues into the roles that gender played in the ways that peopl e of a wide variety of ethnic identities and racial classifications used jazz to construct themselves as American, as modern, and, in many cases, as survivors of Americanization and modernity. It seems fitting, then, to begin this historical survey of women and New Orleans jazz well before 1900. Pre-Jazz New Orleans We have already seen that women were among the drummers, vocalizers, chanters, and spectators at Congo Square, a site of cultural exchange among African and African-descended slaves and free people of color, as well as indigenous Americans and Europeans beginning in the late 1700s. Mary Gehman and Nancy Ries add that indigenous women \"from the Chocktaw , Houmas, Acolapissa, and other tribes A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 38peddled baskets of fruits, herbs and pelts at the market.\"2 We have no way of knowing the extent to which this exchange include d music, but certainly indigenous people engaged in cross-cultural listening at Congo Square. We also know that intermarriage took place, and that some tribes sheltered sl aves. In fact, the bl ack people who identify as Mardi Gras Indians, and who perform at the Jazz Fest and Mardi Gras every year, are paying tribute to the i ndigenous people who harbored slaves. Music may certainly have played a role in facilitating the forma tion of such alliances at Congo Square. New Orleans was occupied by many colonial governments during the decades preceding the emergence of jazz, and the ongoing an d cumulative effects of these shifts in rule had their effects on musical life, gender, and race. Certainly, the brass band music that accompanied changing national ru le and heralded a succession of martial presences influenced jazz, and no doubt contribut ed to persistent associations of brass instruments with masculinity. Military band music exerted a highly public presence, replete with the repertoire and styles of vari ous and competing nations. In short, New Orleans was under French colonial rule from 1731-1763; Spanish rule until 1802; followed by American territorial rule in 1803. Louisiana became a (slave) state in 1812, seceded from the Union in 1861, and wa s occupied by Union army from 1862 throughout the Civil War. The ma rtial history of New Orleans in the 1800s includes the Battle of New Orleans (1814-1815), the Civ il War, and its port location meant it immediately felt t he military effects of the Spani sh American war (1898). Throughout these massive military and governmental changes , battles over national and cultural allegiance took place at all levels, including musical ones. Monique Guillory writes of A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 39the \"friction at balls\" in the 1800s when arguments over whether to dance French dances or the English quadrille would incite passionate style-wars that were very much about identity and power and not just about aest hetics. Changes in nations of rule meant changes in local rules affecting slaves and free people of color. Women were affected differently, depending upon their national, ethnic, and so cial status, but many of these effects were gender-specific. For in stance, Gehman and Ries write that during the French period, free women (white and of color) had the right to \"sell, lease or rent their own property and to contract large build ing projects in their own names. They were also more apt to divorce or separat e from their husbands than women elsewhere in America, since they had financial security.\" 3 Enslaved women \"had the possibility of buying their freedom or being freed upon t heir master's death, \" an option that contributed to the la rge numbers of free women of color that were not to be found in other cities of what woul d become the United States.4 Spanish rule brought with it somewhat more liberal laws regarding slaves and free people of color at first, though these ti ghtened after 1785. When the Spanish rule began, slaves could petition for freedom under a variety of conditions, including those who had been living independently for ten years, who had married free people of color, and one law specifically grant ed freedom to female slaves whose masters had \"hired them out as prostitutes.\"5 This relative leniency of the Spanish laws turned around in 1785 with a new governor and with increased anxieties about slave rebellions. New restrictions included the pass age of a series of laws designed to discourage romantic and sexual unions across race. In the 1780's, dancing and public meetings among non-A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 40white people were restricted to Congo Squar e. Another law forbade enslaved and free women of color from wearing jewels or ornam ents in their hair. Such rules were meant to lessen the attraction of French and S panish men to non-white women, and the practice of formal concubinage known as placage . Through this arrangement, free women of color entered into long-term relati onships with white French or Spanish men who supported them and their families, without the ties of marriage. In this way, many free women of color acquired property, ra ised families that carried their names, and enjoyed relative autonomy.6 This was also during this time peri od that free people of color built strong communities known as Creole of color. Shirley Thompson defines Creole as \"a chameleon of a term, maski ng and exposing the anxieties over place, language and race.\"7 The term has meant many things in New Orleans, including people of \"Old World parentage, born in the New World,\" and mixed Spanish, French, Italian, and African heritage. The emergenc e of the powerful group identit y, Creole of color, also known as les gens de couleur libre , produced a francophone free black community that was separate from both white Creole and black. Creoles of color published their own newspapers, took interest in intellectual and political developments in France and the French West Indies (including the Fr ench Revolution, 17 89-1795, and Haitian Revolution, 1791-1804, which had profound imp lications for conceptualizing freedom and citizenship). In the years prior to the Civil War, ma ny Creoles of color faced increased restrictions as whites feared their potential alliances with black slaves, many shipping out to Mexico and Haiti. Mary Gehman writes than many returned after the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 41Civil War, but another out-migration took place in the 1880s with the Rise of Jim Crow.8 Creoles of color tended to be well-educated, middle-class, and, according to Joseph Logsdon and Caryn Cosse Bell, assertive and self-confident.9 Education, skilled labor, class position, and property ownership, intertwin ed in the production of this powerful new ethnicity, and, not surprisingly, included powerful cultural dimensions as well. Musical training for both girls and boys became an important and ongoing aspect of Creole of color identity-formation. Piano and voice training were considered especially important for girls, though musical accomplis hments did extend to other instruments as well, especially in musical families. Many of the women in this study were descended from Creole of color families. Olivia Manetta (born 1877; later Douroux, mother of Dolly Adams ), was accomplished on the trumpet. She grew up in a famous Creole of color musical family that included her brother, Manuel Manetta, then married into another musical Creole of color family and often played her trumpet at private gatherings in duets with her husband Louis Douroux. The Nickerson Ladies Orchestra was an elite nine-piece ensemble founded by a Creole of color violinist and influential music teacher in New Orleans, William J. Nickerson. His students included Jelly Roll Morton, Manuel Manetta, and Emma Barrett . William J. Nickerson's daughter, Camille Nickerson , born in 1888, was already the pianist in the Nickerson Ladies Orchestra at the age of 9. She became an important music educator, and wrot e one of the first histories of Creole of color music as her MA thesis at Oberlin in 1932. 10 Entitled Africo-Creole Music in Louisiana , Camille Nickerson's thesis noted the im portance of the French opera for Creoles of color of the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 42wealthiest classes, but focused on the dist inctive and more class inclusive folk music that combined influences of Afri can, Spanish, and French folk forms.11 One characteristic of Creole of color folk music that she identified as distinctive from both French folk music and black American folk music was the frequent rhythmic use of triplets, which she believed to a Spanish influence. She also found the influence of Habanera rhythms in much of the Creole of color folk musi c that she studied; Habanera being a result of combined African and Spani sh influences that emerged in several Spanish colonies with Afric an slaves in the Americas.12 Nickerson's work did not address jazz, per s\u00e9 (except to note that Creole of color bands comprised of wooden pipes, pebble-fi lled gourds, bones and drums played for Creole dances at Congo Square in the 1850s, and to offer the casual opinion that these bands seemed \"a fore-runner of our modern jazz.\")13 However, there are scholars who have studied Creole-specific contributions to jazz. Sybil Klein has identified musical effects of Creole linguistics. One characteristic, involves w hat she calls a \"'snap' at the beginning of a song and the use of syncopated rhythm throughout.\"14 This particular approach to syncopating the melody, she argues, carried over to the tendency to come in on the second rather than on the first beat of the melody in early jazz. The singing of pianist Emma Barrett exemplifies this approach, acco rding to Klein. Bruce Raeburn points out that Creole of color mu sicians developed a piano style of habanera rhythms fused with blues, of which pianist and singer, Mamie Desdunes, about whom we shall soon hear more, played an important role. 15 Americanization in 1803 brought with it a whole new set of rules and attitudes A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 43about race, gender, and sexuality. The new rulers of New Orleans had a much more rigid notion of separation of slaves and non-slaves, between people of African decent, and themselves, as a newly independent nation built on ideals of freedom and democracy-and on the economy of slavery. Yet, the New Or leans that the Americans acquired in 1803 was populated by a majority of people who were either slaves or free people of color, many of whom identified as Creole of colo r. A sizable percentage of city property was owned by free women of color. Such a concept was beyond the scope of property-owning American white men, for whom servility and African-ness had become ideologically linked, and for whom mastery over the women of their own race, as well as the slave race, was conceived as a prime component of justification of the right to rule. Soon after the Americans bega n their rule, the Haitian revolution became the first successful slave revolt to result in an independent black nation. This increased American anxieties about its own slave revolts-and they did occur-and also resulted in an influx of Haitians into New Orleans, doubl ing the overall populat ion of New Orleans, and quadrupling the city's population of free people of color. 16 When Louisiana entered the Union as a slave state (1812), more re strictions limiting the rights of African descended people, enslaved and free, were impl emented. Restrictions would increase in the antebellum period (1830-1860) in respons e to acceleration of the abolitionist movement. Congo Square, for example, an important site of meeting, dancing and drumming since the late 1700s, would contin ue to serve as a weekly respite for enslaved people, a site for temporary freedom , socializing, and economic opportunities, until the 1830s, when it became highly policed. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 44 English speaking black slaves and their descendants, referred to as \"American Negroes,\" by Creoles of color, brought with them a powerful religious vocal music, the spiritual, which is generally listed as a prec ursor to jazz, and a music that was sung by both women and men. After the Civil War, other African American musical forms contributed to the development of jazz include blues, ragtime, and gospel. While none of these forms originated in New Orleans, all of them traveled to New Orleans early on, via traveling musicians, tent shows, and minstrelsy; and via traveling New Orleans musicians who encountered t hese forms while on the road.17 As we shall see, women were key players in these forms as well, particularly blues and gospel. Other cultural exchanges that preceded jazz include Latin American and Caribbean influences flowing into the Port of New Orleans from Cuba, Mexico, Haiti, and other locations. Jazz historians have begun to pay more attention to Latin American and U.S. cultural ex changes, and their effects on jazz. According to Raul Fernandez, the first meeting between mu sic of the Caribbean and the U.S. was probably in nineteenth-century New Orleans, when musicians from Cuba and Mexico traveled and played together in port citi es throughout the Caribbean. John Storm Roberts has identified the unique sound of New Orleans music over time to its historical give and take relationship with Caribbean cross-rhythms. A pan-Caribbean music called danza became the habanera and traveled with musicians and other travelers and migrants during the early 1800s. In the late 1800s, at the same time that ragtime was flourishing in New Orleans, another outgrowth of danza occurred in Cuba: the popular, slower, couples dance music form called the danzon . Cubans were playing jazz in the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 45early 1920s and New Orleaneans were playing danzones . New Orleans and Havana were both busy port cities with strong Euro pean and African cultural influences, and powerful musical traditions that could blend in interesting ways.18 Don Rouse has pointed to this continuation of rhythmic and melodic ties between New Orleans Creole and Caribbean recorded music of the 1920s.19 Women participate in danzon and ragtime in both Cuba and New Orleans as dancers. Ragtime composers incl uded women, and among them M. La wler (\"The Classy Rag,\" 1917).20 And at least one woman instrumentalist would play a key role in the Caribbean/New Orleans musical exchange that contributed to the emer gence of New Orleans jazz. Mamie Desdunes was the pianist and singer that Jelly Roll Morton often credited as in fluencing his approach to the blues in the early 1900s. This approach was distinguished by the aforementioned fusion of blues with habanera or clave rhythm favored by Creole of color musicians. We may never know exactly what Desdunes's role was in this development, yet we do know that she had an influence on Morton w ho, in turn, popularized the style.21 Desdunes and Morton were both descendants fr om the influx of Haitian refugees that fled to Cuba after the revolution in the early 1800s, and then migrated to New Orleans in 1809. The 1830s is historically remembered as a rich time in the musical life of New Orleans, for people of all classes and ra ces. Indeed, the city had three opera companies, each offered seating for free people of color and for slaves. Public music abounded via street parades and festivals, notably Carnival. Brass bands, both black A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 46and white, paraded through the streets. During the 1830s , the Negro Philharmonic Society was founded, attrac ting over one hundred members.22 Yet these antebellum years (1830s-1860) also saw the rise of legal restrictions for slaves and free people of color. These new laws made it expensive for slave owners to fr ee a slave and required freed slaves to leave the state of Louisiana. Anxieties about racial mixing were expressed at all levels of t he law, including a city ordinan ce that affected cultural and musical life. A city ordinance in 1837 levied fines on people who allowed black women and white women to attend the same balls during Carnival.23 In the 1840s, police raids and arrests at Congo Square became commonplace. And, as Susan Cavin has brought to our attention, white women were arrested and fined for attending vodun ceremonies presided over by black women. When white women were policed, it was under the guise of protecting them-and their race-from \"contamination,\" and therefore upholding the ideology of white supremacy. Under the myths that passed as \"racial science,\" and that legally defined race in the United St ates at the time, onl y white women could produce \"pure\" white children and thus ensure the continuation of the \"white race\"-black women's children were black, even if the father was white. The anxieties about vodun music entering white women's bodies, and corrupt ing their purity, prefigures later moral outcries that would focus on protecting whit e women from the supposed ill effects of jazz. Such symbolic uses of white womanh ood are recurrent in the history of public controversies about black music in the United States. In 1861, Louisiana, a slav e state, seceded from the Union. However, New Orleans was seized by Union troops in 1862, and occupied by the Union throughout the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 47Civil War. When the war ended, slavery had been abolished, and t here were increased rights (if not economic guarantees to exerci se those rights) for people of African descent. Federal troops policed the south in 1867, resulting in actualization of promises, such as the right (of men) to vote. However, as in the rest of the south, the withdrawal of federal troops s pelled the demise of Radical Reconstruction in 1877 and the rise of Jim Crow. Re sistance would be waged by Creoles of color and African Americans in New Orleans throughout t he 1870s. In 1876, the Committee of 500 Women, founded by a black woman named Ma ry Garrett, fought for equal rights and advocated migration north as the best hope for black New Orleaneans.24 An organization called the Comite des Citoyens , or Citizens Committee began bringing Civil Rights cases forward, focusing on inferior segregated transportation and other public accommodations as would the Civil Rights Movement eighty years later. (An interesting side-note is that one of the powerful lead ers of the Citizens Committee was Rodolphe Desdunes, father of Mamie Desdunes.) One case in particular made its mark on U.S. race relations, though not in the way intended by its plaintiff and his supporters in the Citizens Committee. Homer Plessy, a Cr eole of color man from New Orleans, challenged the law that insisted he must be either black or wh ite, and that he must sit on the appropriate side of that line while riding the train. Un fortunately, he lost his case; the court had confirmed that ra ce in the U.S. a black or white matter, and the rules that applied to that black/white designation were legally relegated to the whims of the states, including states governed by former slave owners. The context of cultural exchange, fr om which jazz would emerge, was full of A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 48contradictions and battles over identity that were waged at all levels: political, legal, social, and cultural. Jazz was not only the pr oduct of cultural exchange, but a product of people's struggles for cultural survival . Jazz was not only a set of exciting new musical forms, but a new set of musical ex pressions and practices that people would use in various ways as they attempted to develop identities, livelihoods, and desirable relationships to modernity for themselves and their loved ones. 1890s: Emergence of Jazz Several events in the 1890s affect ed New Orleaneans' identities and the relationships of those identities to social standing and life chances. Especially pertinent to a discussion of women and jazz are 1) the ri se of Jim Crow as a legal and mandatory system of unequal segregation (which resulted of massive in-migration of rural southern blacks escaping economic and racial violence , and the re-classification of Creoles of color as black); 2) resistance to economic an d racial violence, with the rise of black institutions, such as the black press and black schools; 3) the devastating economic Depression of 1893 which exacerbated social tens ions of all kinds; 4) social anxieties about women's increasing presence in public s pace; and 5) the redistricting of Storyville in 1897, an event that is oft en painted romantically, but that is actually very complex, and deeply interconnected with the other drastic changes just listed. The rise of Jim Crow saw the rights of black people stripped away throughout the U.S., especially in the south. The same y ear that Plessy vs. Fergusson was passed, a controversial state election took place in Louisiana, in which a populist platform made A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 49up of a cross-racial Republican coalition wo n the popular vote, but the election was \"stolen by ultra-conservative Democrats.\"25 Soon, black people in Louisiana were systematically disenfranchise d through grandfather clauses (which stated that one could vote only if one's grandfather had voted), and poll taxes. Between 1896 and 1898, black voter registration in Louisiana dropped fr om 130,444 (44% of total) to 5,320 (4% of total). By 1922, the number would drop to 598.26 Compared to rural Louisiana and Mississippi, New Orleans offered hopes for better economic circumstances and relative safety from racist terror, and so thousands of Afric an Americans throughout the south migrated to the city. Vast numbers of bla ck women left agricultural work for domestic work during this migration, which is highly pertinent to the participation of black women in entertainment, which offered a ticket of mobility for many working class black women. New Orleans was an attractive destination fo r black people from elsewhere in south, not because they could enjoy unlimited options, but because they could exercise more choice in low-paying jobs. However, bla ck workers arriving in New Orleans during the rise of Jim Crow in the late 1890s did so during a lingering economic depression, which exacerbated hostilities of whites in New Orleans who blamed black workers on their own depression related-losses. The political climate gave lic ense to retribution. In 1896, Louisiana set national record for lynchi ngs; and in 1900, New Orleans exploded in the catastrophic Charles race riot.27 The consolidation of Jim Crow radicall y changed racial classification under the law, if not in the ways that people saw them selves. Creoles of color, often French speaking, Catholic, and middle-class, were now categorized legally in the same group A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 50as English-speaking American black former slaves and descendants of slaves. Not only did these groups not necessarily identify with one another , but for Creoles of color, this merging resulted in a drastic drop in social status. The sight of middle-class Creole of color women enraged white Americans indoctri nated in a rigid black/white split, and in definitions of race that depended on white womanhood as distinct from black womanhood, and that depended on that distinction to maintain concepts of white racial purity. As more and more white middle-cl ass women entered the public workforce in New Orleans, anxieties and hostilities mount ed, as demonstrated by this letter-to-the- editor of the Daily Picayune , June 2, 1900, signed, \"a Woman Worker,\" in which a white woman wrote, [w]hen one of these light colo red mulatresses (sic) flounces in the car, dressed in all her finery, and almost sits on some wh ite woman, it does indeed make one's blood boil.\"28 At the same time, maintaining middle- class gender identity became an extremely important civil rights tactic for Creoles of color, as did the respectability politics employed by black women through the cl ub movement. Musical training was an important indicator of such identities. In turn-of-the- century New Orleans, it was customary, and considered to be a sign of respectability, for middle-class white, black, and Creole families to have thei r daughters learn to play piano. According to Charles Chamberlain, the piano was seen as the \"pri mary vehicle for genteel musical education\" for girls.29 This will become an important factor at the stage in early jazz history when the piano comes aboard, and bands need experienc e players with knowledge of correct chords from which improvisers could collectively take off. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 51 Some scholars have argued t hat Creole of color identity was displaced by Jim Crow, as a process of Americ anization in which definitions of race as a black/white binary replaced the multiple categories t hat had existed in French (and Spanish) colonial New Orleans. Other scholars, incl uding Shirley Thompson, see Creole of color as a continuing challenge to Ji m Crow definitions of race . Thompson writes of the changing definitions of this group identit y category as a hist ory of how people negotiated the radical changes in racial clas sification in New Orleans over the past century and a half. Bruce Boyd Raeburn, Thompson, and a small but growing number of scholars are more likely to see Creoliz ation as an ongoing process (as opposed to a coherent, stable identity) through which identities change th rough mixing. Raeburn has argued convincingly that hard and fast rule s such as \"Creoles = Francophone\" or \"Creoles of color are downtown black people,\" or as Creoles of color were the \"reading\" musicians who brought European elements to jazz history, mi ght serve as \"guidelines for understanding jazz history,\" but as \"facts,\" they ar e oversimplified.30 In this study, for example, pianist and bassist Dolly Adams , was from a Creole of color family of Italian descent, with roots in the Algiers section of New Orlean s, rather than downtown. The first generation of Creole of color jazz musicians that appear in this study were born in the period in which these chan ges were taking place. Their parents may have been recognized as Creoles of color, but they would be legally identified under the category \"colored,\" regardless of how they or their families identified. Knowing the rules of what it meant to be considered black by the state was important to survival. Equally important, was the ability to main tain cultural identities that were meaningful, productive, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 52and dignified. Music and enter tainment were powerful factors in both sides of what W.E.B. DuBois called \"double consciousness .\" Racist stereot ypes circulated in entertainment and affected how people th roughout the U.S. t hought about non-white people. And performances that disrupted t hose stereotypes, such as black women's ladies orchestras that played classical musi c, or the emergence of powerful new forms such as ragtime and jazz in a nation ruled by Euro-Americans who had not yet successfully figured out how to musically separ ate from Europe, were two of many ways that people defined as inferior by the ru les of Jim Crow resisted and survived. Jim Crow, incidentally, had taken its name from a character of black face minstrelsy, the popular form of entertainment that Freder ick Douglas described as a theft \"of complexion ... in which to make money.\" 31 Minstrelsy had been a dominant form of entertainment since we ll before the Civil War; it continued to thrive after the abolition of slavery, and retained its mainstream popularity much longer than most Americans care to remember; well into the twentieth century, when the Civil Rights Movement made it difficult to ignore the troubling implications of the form. In her oral history, Claire Perry Black, a white wo man who grew up in the Irish Channel neighborhood, recalled that her uncle and aunt had performed in black face, as did she and her sister Lois, a jazz drum mer, for church benefits in New Orleans as late as the 1950s. 32 The caricatures enacted in minstrelsy portrayed black men and black women as comical and sub-human; often constructi ng race stereotypes through grotesque depictions of gender and sexuality. Black men were often emasculated in these A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 53performances; black women hyper-sexualized . Fantasies about black culture were played out through plantation songs that ro manticized the Southern past. Fans and performers of minstrelsy often believed themse lves to carry great affection for the black people. Ironically, it is thr ough minstrel shows that mainstr eam U.S. popular culture first fell in love with what it in terpreted as black culture.33 Minstrelsy was initially enacted by white performers, but after the Civil War, when traveling in entertainment troops provided one of the scarce ways in whic h black people could ear n a living, black performers also darkened their faces and traveled on \"colored minstrel shows.\" White and black women participated in mi nstrelsy, though most of the literature on female performance in minstrelsy has fo cused on white men's burlesques of black female characters.34 Mabel Elaine was a white wom an who performed in black face with New Orleans musicians. She seems to have been based in Chicago, functioning as a solo act that would pair up with a black New Orleans band and tour vaudeville. She appeared with King Oliver's band at one time.35 Eddie Garland recalled that the second New Orleans band to go to Chicago (after Freddie Keppard) was billed as \"Mabel Elaine and her New Orleans Band.\" A ccording to Garland, Elaine was a white woman who appeared in blackf ace and danced in wooden shoes.36 A photograph in Rose and Souchon's New Orleans Family Album (page 262) shows her (listed as Mamie Lane), performing in blackface with New Orleans musicians Roy Palmer, Sugar Johnny Smith, Lawrence Duh\u00e9, Herb Lindsay , Louis Keppard, and Montundie Garland. The form of vaudeville blues known as \"c oon shouting,\" derives from minstrelsy. Edna Hicks and Lizzie Miles , both of the generati on that was born \"Creole of color,\" but A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 54would be legally classified as black by the time they went on the road, both worked in black minstrelsy and were known as \"coon shouters.\" When tr ying to understand why women of color would perform in minstrel shows, it is important to remember that these entertainment circuits provided mobility and autonomy for women whose options otherwise were limited to domestic work, share cropping, or prostitution. Traveling in shows could, and for some women did, lead to stardom. Though blues did not \"originate\" in New Or leans, local and traveling artists alike rendered the blues in the Cresce nt City. Blueswomen have fi nally received attention in jazz scholarship for their profound contribut ions to the music, for their musical collaborations with jazz instrumentalists; fo r influencing the sounds and phrasing of jazz instrumentalists, and for headlining on m any of the earliest jazz recordings. 37 Classic blues singers more often emerged from rura l south, but some blues singers did hail from New Orleans, including Ann Cook , Mamie Desdunes, Esther Bijou, Mary Mack, and Lizzie Miles . Many others traveled through town regularly on the TOBA (Theater Owners Booking Association) as the black vaudeville circuit was called. Acts that traveled through New Orleans on black vaudev ille likely played at The Lyric Theater, where Margaret Kimble was the pianist in John Robichaux's pit orchestra. 38 In the early teens, Gertr ude \"Ma\" Rainey, known as the \"Empress of the Blues,\" often spent the winter in New Orleans, a fter the minstrel shows she toured with had finished with their Southern tours for the season.39 According to trumpet player Punch Miller, many trumpet players \"got the styl e\" from accompanying singers, like Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith as t hey traveled through town.40 Pensacola born pianist Billie A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 55Goodson Pierce counted among her earliest professi onal opportunities working in the chorus of Bessie Smith's show and playing with numerous New Orleans bands as they came through Florida. Venerated jazz and ro ck drummer Earl Palmer got his start in the music business dancing in an act with hi s mother and aunt, the Theophile Sisters, touring with the black vaudeville troupe headli ned by blues singer Ida Cox in the 1930s. Some scholars have looked to blues lyrics for clues as to black women's experiences of, and perspectives on hopes and di sappointments of migration, and other social commentary. 41 New Orleans women singers contributed to recorded blues that addressed the social concer ns of the day. One of Lizzie Miles's first recordings, \"Cotton Belt Blues,\" told t he story of a woman who had been \"lured by a man,\" only to be abandoned in \"that cold, cold minded North.\"42 An excellent study would be a comparison of blues material favored by New Orleans blueswomen with material t hat has been documented about blues singers nationwide. While travel has been a widel y discussed topic in blues scholarship, it seems to me that there ma y have been more references to the Caribbean in New Orleans blues repertoire. Lizzie Miles sang \"Haitian Blues,\" which she co-wrote with Spencer Williams, also from New Orleans; Es ther Bigeou sang \"West Indies Blues\" (not actually a blues in form, but still a fascinat ing inclusion in Bigeou's repertoire). The lyrics of \"West Indies Blues\" spoke of leav ing \"this worthless job\" as an elevator operator to go home to Jamaica, but the speaker promised to return in a big way: When I come back to this great land You better watch me, Harvey, 'Cause I'm gonna be a great big man A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 56 Like my friend Marcus Garvey!\"43 Garvey was, of course, the Jamaic an-born founder of t he Universal Negro Improvement Association, and proponent of the back-to-African movement in the 1920s. He was extremely influential for his international approach to black freedom struggles when Bigeou recorded \"West Indies Blues\" in 1923. It is important to mention that not only the musicians on these circuits contributed to the development of early ja zz, but so did other theatrica l women: the dancers, the comedians, the actresses, the versatile perfo rmers of circuses, tent shows, variety, minstrelsy, and vaudeville. Such perfo rmers traveled through New Orleans from elsewhere, and women from New Orleans joined such groups and claimed musical careers and mobility ( Lizzie Miles , Edna Hicks , Olivia L'Ange Porter ). Social this experience for di fferent women. When Olivia L'Ange joined a vaudeville show as a pianist in 1900, she changed her surname to Porter so as not to shame her Creole of color fat her by dragging his family name into show business. Theatrical women had long been a ssociated with prostitution, and so the idea of women on the vaudeville stage represented a loss of respectability for communities unaccustomed to seeing the theat er as a step up from drudgery. 44 Throughout jazz history, women musicians have often had to balance a sense of themselves as jazz musicians with the palpable awareness that audiences are likely to see them as sex objects and novelties. In response, they have developed performance strategies that mitigated between the two. A phenomenon with specific ramifications in A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 57New Orleans is the historical obsession with Creole of color women as particular kinds of sex objects and fantasies about se x, gender, and race-a legacy that women musicians have negotiated in a number of ways. Many jazz scholars have noted the tendency of bands and musicians to emphasize \"Creole\" identity, and-when traveling out of New Orleans, to claim it whether they were Creole or not-in or der to benefit from culture capital that did not accrue to \"colored.\" The most famous example is King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. Oliver was not Creole, but the name \"Creole\" was a selling point, especially outside New Orleans, where it took on an added appeal as \"exotic\" to its cache of class. As we have seen, generally, Creoles of color had a higher economic and social status than English-speaking or \"A merican\" black people. \"Creole,\" however, had different connotations nation wide for women than for men. Jayna Brown's excellent dissertation discusses how a literary obsession with mixed-race Creole women becam e a theatrical obsession in 1890. This was the year when Sam T. Jack's black female revue, The Creole Show , toured the Eastern states. While the players and producers were not New Orleans-based, the popularity of this revue and its spin-offs featur ing light-skinned black women performing as \"Creoles\" offers some insights into national and even international popularity of fantasies about New Orleans mixed-race women. Brown points out that spectacles such as the Creole Show offered some black women, Creole or not, alternatives to the narrow confines of minstrelsy.45 The popularity of er otic fantasies about \"quadroons\" had been stimulated by New Orleans tourism since well before the Civil War.46 Monique Guillory's study of \"Quadroon Balls\" traces the histor y of these fantasies to the \"fancy girl\" trade at slave A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 58auctions, for which New Orleans was famous; followed by the quadroon balls, where elite white propertied men wit h roots in the French colonial period secured quadroon mistresses. Literally, the term \"quadroon\" would mean someone who was one quarter black. However, Guillory points out that terms like \"quadroon\" and \"octoroon\" were not used for the sake of mathematical accuracy, but as erotic categories.47 Just as the women in The Creole Show capitalized on performing the ex otic \"Creole Beauty,\" some women musicians from New Orleans-some who actually did identify as Creoles of color, some who did not-were no doubt perce ived through a lens of \"the exotic\" when they performed for tourists or when they wo rked for touring shows. Whether or not it was their intention, Creole of color women capitalized on this historical fascination when they traveled and recorded as \"Creole Songbi rds,\" as did singers Esther Bigeou and Lizzie Miles . Miles's performances of Frenc h-Creole songs contributed to her popularity in France and England , as well as in the U.S.48 And some women's performances clearly played off of the popular ity of fantasies about black women in New Orleans as exotic and light-skinned-the obsession with \"quadroons\" coincided with the legacies of \"colorism,\" in which light-skinned women were perceived through the historical damage of anti-black racism as more beautiful than dark women. Redistricting of Storyville Another result of the economic Depression of 1890 and the rise of Jim Crow was the anxiety of how to maintain the separat ion of \"respectable\" women as signs of privileged class stability, as middle-class women increasingly entered public spaces, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 59and became less distinguishable from theatrical women. The association of women entertainers and prostitutes was an old one. The separation of \"respectable\" women from \"fallen\" women was a pa ssionate project of white mi ddle-class men who reserved the right to associate with \"f allen\" women without themselves falling in class position. New Orleans had been legendary for pros titution long before the creation of Storyville. In 1895 alone, 20,000 guidebooks to New Orleans brothels were distributed to tourists.49 Alecia P. Long's brilliant dissertation (now a book, entitled The Great Southern Babylon:: Sex, Race, and Respec tability in New Orleans, 1865-1920, Baton Rouge: Louisiana University Press, 2004 ), illuminates the relationship between the economic depression, the rise of Jim Crow, and the redistricting of Storyville in 1897, which effectively zoned women who worked in the red light district into one area of town. Interestingly, the ar ea selected for the city's pros titution center was a working- class African American neighborhood. The only school in the district set aside for Storyville was an African American school. A lar ge black church lost its congregation as rents skyrocketed in the economic boom that was achieved in condensing the vice district.50 Popular wisdom has it that jazz was born in Storyville, t he famous red light district of New Orleans; delivered into a stea my ambiance of exotic Octoroon prostitutes by a handful of irrepressible and ingenious male musicians. Piano men , such as Jelly Roll Morton, are credited as the musical progenitors who created jazz as the bawdy background music for the city's booming sex industry of the early 1900s. While this familiar origin story holds some truth, it also over-simplifies and distorts the entwined A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 60histories of early jazz and St oryville on a number of levels. Obscured, for instance, are concurrent sites of musical alchemy (including churches, family bands, brass bands, etc.), that also led to the music that would become known as jazz. A focus on early jazz that cannot see its way out of Storyville br othels feeds a problematic tendency to always equate jazz with sex-an association with racist underpinnings that needs to be carefully examined, not uncritically reproduced.51 This \"creativity-born-in-a-brothel\" narrative obscures the complexity of the hi story of New Orleans sex industr y as well. It is difficult to see power imbalances, economics, and po litics when the commodified female bodies of Storyville are seen only as a sexy backdrop to sexy music. With that caution, we can proceed to a consideration of Storyville as one of the places where women participated in the ear ly years of jazz as fans, proprietors, and musicians. Most of the workers in the \"Distr ict,\" after all, were women, and given the multiple musical cultures that thrived in turn of the century New Orleans, it should not be surprising to know that so me prostitutes and madams were also musicians, including Antonia Gonzales , who advertised herself as the \"only cornet playing madam in Storyville,\" pianist/vocalist Mamie Desdunes who influenced Jelly Roll Morton, and vocalists, including, notably, the barrel-house blues singer Ann Cook . Not all women who played music in Storyville brothels doubled as prostitutes. It was a selling point, in fact, to have musicians who simply entertained. Lulu White advertised that, in her brothel, there were \"always ten entertainer s who get paid to do nothing but sing and dance.\" 52 In 1917, thirteen year old Dolly Adams began playing piano in her uncle Manuel Manetta's band.53 Pianists Camilla Todd and Edna Mitchell played in A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 61Storyville as musician non-residents.54 Wilhelmina Bart de Rouen appears on Rose's list of \"jazz musicians who perfo rmed in the legally constituted tenderloin district known as Storyville between January 1, 1898 and November 17, 1917.\"55 A fascinating record has been left by pianist, song writer, and vocalist Rosalind Johnson , a formally trained musician who preferred playing in St oryville brothels than in theaters. Women also were powerful culture br okers in Storyville. Madams not only selected, hired, and advertised the prostitute s who worked for them; they also selected, hired, and advertised jazz musicians and other entertainers. Jelly Roll Morton proudly recalled having his piano playi ng talent requested by all the \"highest class landladies,\" naming \"Willie Piazza, Josie Arlington, Lulu White, Ant onia Gonzales, Hilma Burt, and Gypsy Schaeffer.\"56 Antonia Gonzales, the famous cornet-playing madam, hired Tony Jackson and played duets with him. Willie Piazza hired Ann Cook . Gender and instruments The long history of military bands in Ne w Orleans contributed to the association of brass bands with masculinity and men; and perhaps even shored up the long history of the piano as a sign of middle-class femini ne respectability for women and as a sign of \"sissy\" for men.57 Yet, like so many other genera lizations, these gender associations were far from static in tu rn-of-the-century New Orleans. While it is true that women were less likely to play brass instruments in New Orleans marching bands then men-some did. A question deserving research would be one focused around the question: which wom en? New Orleans jazz historian Karl A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 62Koenig, who has made a concerted effort to include women in his studies, found that in Houma, Louisiana, a small town southwes t of New Orleans, the town band included a number of women.58 A local study of gender and musi c in Houma (in comparison with towns whose brass bands did not include wom en) would be one place to look for clues about one cultural trajectory of women's musi cal participation and stat us. While little is known about them, four women appear in a 1928 photo of the Tonic Triad Band, an African American New Orleans brass band.59 Sylvester Francis reports that women did not appear in brass bands until after World War II, after which they did so infrequently.60 The topic of women in New Orleans brass bands deserves further study. Oral history and photographic research may turn up more leads. Interestingly, women have appeared in traditional New Orleans brass bands in recent years. Diane Lyle-Smith, trumpet and flugelhorn, who taught at Xavier University from 1980-85, became the first woman to play in the Young Tuxedo Brass band. 61 In 1992, students at St. Mary's Academy started an all-female traditional br ass band. While still in high school, the Pinettes Brass Band played the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, as well as weddings and funerals. Several years after graduating, they regrouped, recording their CD, \"Who You Gonna Call? ... the Pinettes Brass Band!\" (AGB Records, 2002), and appearing both locally and internationally. 62 I have mentioned that Dolly Adams 's mother, Olivia Douroux, was a trumpet player. It seems significant that her br other, Manuel Manetta, played piano, but was only able to take lessons (from music t eacher Laura Albert) when his sister lost interest.63 She, in fact, played trumpet duet s with her husband Loui s Douroux, at A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 63private parties. While it was acceptable for Louis to play his trumpet professionally, and not acceptable for Olivia, it is significant that it was acceptable for both to play trumpets at gatherings, and that their daughter (bor n 1904) would become a jazz pianist and band leader who doubled on bass and drums. The gender organization of instrument and genre seems more nuanced and dynamic in the Manetta and Douroux families than an analysis that said simply that it was not considered proper for women to play brass instruments or jazz in Creole- of-color communities. Olivet Depass (daughter of Lucille and Arnold DePass) played trumpet, but was discouraged from playing in public when her mother didn't like her to travel in the wee hours of the morning. 64 Antonia Gonzales played the trumpet in the brothel she operated. Mot her Catherine Seals played trombone in the church services at which s he officiated. Irma Young (born 1912), sister of tenor saxophonist Lester Young, also played the saxophone, and lived in New Orleans as a child. Though not primarily based in New Orleans, the Young Family Band, which included Lester and Irma's mot her and aunt, did play there frequently.65 Women and piano in early jazz bands When Karl Koenig asked why there were so many women pianists in the early jazz bands, Sadie Goodson replied: Well, I think it was because they needed pianis ts. At that time there weren't as many men playing piano; they wanted to play a trumpet or another wind instrument. It was considered more masculin e to play a wind instrument. A lot of women, to be socially acc epted, learned the piano as part of their upbringing. The men in the band liked the chords I pl ayed. Many of them depended on the chords to be able to play their part.66 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 64 African American, European American, and Creole-of-color women were, without question, more likely to play piano and or gan than brass instruments. Women who played piano in early jazz bands often came from church music backgrounds, and were more likely than men to have taken piano lessons, both of which made them more likely than men to read music. As pianists, and as reading musicians, women contributed important elements to jazz when the bands were no longer limited to m obile street units, and when band leaders desperately needed so meone in the band with knowledge of chords, who was able to teach new charts to non-reading members. While Lil Hardin Armstrong is often acknowledged as an \"excepti onal woman\" for performing this role in early Chicago-based New Orleans bands, but t here was already a precedent for this practice in New Orleans before Joe \"King\" Oliver hired Hardin for his jazz band. 67 The timing of this convergence of pianos and women musicians in jazz bands is significant. Where we see women piani sts entering jazz bands in large numbers coincides with a period in which jazz was enjoying a period of increased social acceptance among middle-classes in New Orleans, not as art, but as \"all the rage\" as a pleasurable dance music. This included the popularity of jazz bands at such spheres of social prestige as country clubs, hotels, and even debutante balls. 68 Louis Armstrong recalled playing in Ander son's Restaurant on Rampart Street in 1918 with a band that included New Orleans pianist Edna Mitchell and her husband drummer Albert Francis.69 Emma Barrett studied with Professor Nickerson, but was playing jazz professionally with Oscar \"Pap a\" Celestin's and \"Bebe\" Ridgeley's co-led Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra in the early 1920s.\"70 Camilla Todd was the pianist in A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 65John Robichaux's Orchestra at the Lyric Theatre, and later the Maple Leaf Orchestra, Hyppolyte Charles's Orchestra, A.J. Pi ron and Kid Ory. Mercedes Garman (Fields) played with Papa Celestin and Alphonse Picou. When Lil Hardin left King Oliver's band durin g the west coast t our of 1921, Oliver replaced her with a woman piano player from New Orleans, living on the west coast: Bertha Gonsoulin. When Papa Celestin lost his pianist, Emma Barrett, to Bebe Ridgeley, he replaced her with a series of fema le pianists before hiring Jeanette Salvant (later Kimball). Not all of the women who played piano in early New Orleans jazz bands were from New Orleans. Se veral important players hailed from towns along the Gulf Coast, through which New Orleans bands regular ly toured. Celestine found Jeanette Salvant in her home town of Pass Christi an, Mississippi. Sadie, Billie, Edna, and Ida Goodson all worked with numerous New Or leans bands that passed through their hometown of Pensacola, Florida. Nellie Lutcher, born in Lake Charles Louisiana in 1915, became the organist for her church at the age of eight, and later left high school to play with her father, bassist Isaac Lutcher, in the Imperial Orchestra, Clarence Hart's band, touring Louisiana and Texas in the early 1930s. She stayed with Hart's band for six years, and then joined a band called the Southern Rhythm Boys, a band that included several members from New Orleans, including Paul Barnes.71 Olivia \"Lady Charlot\" Cook recalled being in demand as a reading pianist for men's bands, but also that male band leader s were ambivalent about her skills. \"They liked that I could read it, but they hated that it was a woman.\" 72 Was this \"like/hate\" relationship that male band leaders had with the skilled female pianists they hired A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 66common? Was it something that affected the ca reers of women of all cultural groups in New Orleans? Did gender bias and the co mmon inclusion of women musicians affect solo conventions that limited pianists more than reeds and horn players, as exemplified by Joe \"King\" Oliver's denial of Lil Hardin 's \"urge to run up and down the piano and make a few runs and things.\"73 Paradoxically, while gender ty pically defines power hierar chically within a culture, gender constructions are also common wa ys by which cultural groups define themselves as different from one another. In other words, the dominant groups' ideological definitions of gender frequently function to define their culture as superior to all others. Leisurely women, non-working women, women with time to learn a lady-like \"accomplishment,\" were not only ways of being women, but they were class markers for the men in their families. Women outside dominant cultur e membership are affected both by the gender construction of their cu ltural group, and by the social \"norms\" defined by the dominant culture and from which she may be excluded. For instance, even as the dominant culture may have exerted a strong message that it wasn't ladylike to work for wages, many women, of c ourse, needed to work. It may not have been ideologically \"ladylike\" to play trombones or trumpets, or to enter the realms where jazz was played, but for some wo men, playing jazz was considered a viable way to earn a living. African American women who played cl assical music often found that careers in jazz were more open to them than careers in classical music, despite the fact that classical music may have been considered more \"lady-like,\" even in her own cultural group. Pianist and organist Olivia \"Lady Charlot\" Cook is just one African American jazz A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 67musician whose dream was to have been a classical concert pianist.74 Jazz, however, as masculinist as we may think of the musi c today, was available to her, while classical music as not, and she became (and still is) a celebrated New Orleans jazz musician. Some of these pianists took improvis ed solos, but many did so only minimally, and some did not solo-however, it is also im portant to note that band leaders often did not want their pianists to take improvised solos. The role of the pianist in these 1920s bands was often seen as \"laying down the right chords\" for the other musicians.75 As Bruce Raeburn explained, to film-maker Kay D. Ray, \"[u]sually what you want the piano player to do in collective improvisation is co mp and fill,\" maintaining the chords so that the other instrumentalists coul d hear them and to improvise on them, and to \"fill\" the in between spaces in support of the improvising brass and r eeds, who are collectively featured. For pianists working in this cont ext of early collectiv e improvisation, the opportunity to solo was limited.76 Did gender have anything to do with this division of labor between soloists and supporting roles as keepers of the chords and rhythm? This theme will be further developed in the biographical chapters on specific pianists. Jeffrey Taylor suggests that while playing the piano in a jazz band was not considered more appropriate for one sex than the other, that \"accompanying\" wa s considered appropriate for female players in early jazz in a way t hat soloing was not. Soloing, on the other hand, had a different gender trajec tory, as the domain of \"piano men,\" \"professors,\" and \"ticklers,\" such as Jelly Roll Morton, who were re-defining the piano from \"sissy\" instrument to ultimate symbol of heterosexual masculine fr aternity in the jazz world.77 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 68Women as jazz entrepreneurs Lawn parties, like house parties and fish fries, were parties where whoever hosted the event would provide food, hire musicians, and charge admission to guests. According to band leader and multi-instrument alist \"Papa John\" Joseph, a fish fry would be advertised by putting out a lantern. Anyone who saw the lantern could pay to get in. But a lawn party was by invitation. 78 Manuel Manetta recalled that lawn parties were open to the public, unless a club had booked t he lawn party as a private affair.79 Blues singer Lizzie Miles recalled lawn parties and fish fries as places where she began her performing career as a child.80 While both women and men held lawn parties, it appears that women held significant roles in this enterprise. Law n parties provided certain women who had access to large yards a way to add to their financial well-being wi thout leaving home. The money to be made from lawn parties exceeded what one might make as a laundress or other in-home o ccupations open to women of color in early twentieth century New Orleans. The skills required to build a lawn party's reputation included a reputation for hiring bands that would draw regular crowds and repeat customers. A lawn party entrepreneur, therefor e, held considerable power in rewarding favorite bands with regular bookings and, therefore, played a significant role in the development of jazz audiences, in facilitating pairings of musici ans and dancers who inspired one another; to the development of musical practices and therefore to musica l sounds, and to the development and maintenance of the local jazz economy. 81 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 69 Betsy Cole was among the most famous and successful such entrepreneurs. The site of her lawn parties at Josephine an d Willow is considered so important to the history of New Orleans jazz, that it appears in the New Grove Dictionary of Jazz under the listing: \"Nightclubs: United States of America: New Orl eans,\" as a place where \"jazz bands played ... regularly for dancing\" in t he 1910s and 1920s. Betsy Cole's lawn also has its own entry in Rose and Souchon's ch apter, \"Where's Where in New Orleans.\"82 Her parties took place in Central City, one of the oldest working class neighborhoods in New Orleans, where many jazz musicians li ved, including Buddy Bolden, Kid Ory, and King Oliver. Oral histories of musicians who played in the teens and twenties often mention her parties, including the fact that there was no la wn, but a pavilion, lit by flambeaux, and that the ground had been danced upon so often that the earth \"was packed into a nice surface.\"83 Ample space supported a host of activities. John Joseph remembered that along with music and dancing, there would also be baseball at Betsy Cole's lawn parties.84 It is hard to say when Betsy Cole's lawn parties began, but certainly they were in full swing before 1916, when bassist McNeal Breaux was born next door. The family rented their quarte rs from the well known lawn party entrepreneur, known to Breaux as \"Mrs. Hebert Cole.\" His father , Theophile Breaux, sometimes served as the bartender.85 Breaux recalled that his landlady was \"very well noted in her days.\"86 Lillian DePass recalled that Betsy Cole did well financially from her parties, as well as from her other enterpr ise: taking out life insurance on people just before they died. As a party-giver, she cert ainly knew many people and their states of health, and as a spiritualist, she had an extra edge. According to DePass, Betsy Cole is A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 70responsible for a law being pa ssed preventing people from ta king out life insurance on someone without their permission.87 One of the claims to fame attributed to Betsy Cole is her regular booking of Kid Ory's band. According to bassist Ed Garland , Ory played at Betsy Cole's lawn parties \"for years.\" Cole apparently liked the band so much that s he wanted it to play at her funeral (indeed, Cole was perha ps the first one to receive a jazz funeral , or \"funeral with music\").88 Clarinetist Albert Nicholas recalled t hat when he was 12 or 13 years old (circa 1912-1913) he would attend Miss Cole's lawn parties to hear his hero, Johnny Dodds, play clarinet with Kid Ory. He also recalled that on Sunday s, \"Miss Cole held penny parties,\" affordable versions of the adult lawn parties, for children.89 No doubt, these youthful opportunities to hear Dodds helped to prepare him fo r the day he would replace Dodds in King Oliver's band in Ch icago. Drummer Al fred Williams also had childhood memories of going to hear Kid Ory's band at Betsy Cole's place.90 Betsy Cole was not without competition-in fact, many musicians noted that there were many places to hear music in the vicinity of Willow and Jackson. Notably, Napoleon \"Toodlum\" Johnson had a thriving la wn party on LaSalle (then Howard) and Gravier.91 Cornetist Hypolite Charles, who so metimes played at Betsy Cole's, found that lawn parties \"didn't pay enough\" compared with other venues available to him, such as the Francs Amis Hall, an elite Cr eole of color club on North Robertson.92 (Incidentally, dances were sometimes put on and bands hired at the Francs Amis Hall by another New Orleans jazzwoman, pianist Wilhelmina Bart de Rouen .)93 On the other hand, Manuel Manetta stat ed that the two dollars and fi fty cents that musicians A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 71could make at a lawn party gig lasting fr om 8 pm until 4 am, was about the same as they could make playing for balls.94 According to Lillian DePass, her husband Arnold DePass disliked playing for \"uptown\" lawn parties, and found t he people who attended them \"tacky.\"95 Her commentary points to diffe rences and biases existing between \"downtown\" Creoles of color and \"uptown\" African Americans. While Betsy Cole held \"uptown\" lawn parti es in Central City, attended primarily by English speaking working class African Am ericans, Lillian DePass held parties and dances for downtown Creoles of color. The 1920 Census shows Lillian and Arnold DePass living at 1906 St. Philip St reet, near Roman, in the Tr eme District. In her oral history, DePass recalled t hat her husband, drummer Arnold DePass, who led the Olympia Orchestra (1927-1932), played at the Fairgrounds, he would tell her to stay away, that the music and the crowds would be below her class status. She recalled that \"young ladies\" of her social group were not supposed to drink. She gave many dances and lawn parties, however, and made a good deal of money that way. She would either hire the Olympia Orchestra, or, if her husband's band already had a gig, she would hire a different band. She recalled that she hir ed guitarist \"Blind Charlie\" Hays [Hayes] for her last lawn party. 96 Another place where women \"called the tune,\" so to speak, or at least hired the band, was in social clubs that gave dances. Lillian DePass recalled that her husband's band was popular with several wo men's social clubs. Musician and restaurateur Dooky Chase grew up in a hous ehold where his mother gave house parties and penny parties in Treme. Leah Chas e described the difference between her husband Dooky's childhood in the Treme, and her own just across Esplanade in the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 72Seventh Ward. She recalled that t he Treme area had \"more music, more entertainment, people who lived a different life styl e, really a different kind of life style. They were more alive to me than they were in the Seventh Ward.\"97 . Jazz funerals Jazz funerals, or \"funerals with music,\" as they are often calle d in New Orleans, are an African American tradition that began around the turn of the cent ury. They were extremely popular through the 1920s, enjoyed a renewed interest in the 1950s, and continue to this day. Many people believe that this practice comes out of West African funeral traditions; others cite French musica l burials as antecedents. William Schafer notes that while jazz funerals were most common in black communities in the first forty years of the twentieth century, funerals wit h music also occurred in German, Italian, French and Irish communities in New Orleans. 98 According to Karl Koenig, jazz funerals were primarily associated with African Amer ican New Orleans culture, until the renewed popularity of jazz funerals in the 1950s rendered them widely symbolic of New Orleans jazz history.99 To have a funeral with music is still considered an honor by many New Orleans musicians, despite the historical dissonance between mourners and tourists sampling the \"local color\" promised by guide books. Sylvester Fran cis, founder of the Backstreet Cultural Ce nter in Treme, has done a great deal to educate the public, and respectfully document the cultural history of funerals with music. 100 Jazz funerals have historically been sponsored by social clubs and benevolent A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 73societies to which the deceased belonged. A ccording to Jacqui Malone, the earliest black benevolent societies appe ared in New Orleans in the 1780s, but \"by the 1860s, social and beneficial clubs were c entral to African American life.\"101 Such clubs often had informal savings plans that formed as a kind of insurance for members. If a deceased member had requested a funeral with music, these clubs would sponsor it, unless the family refused, which might happ en for reasons of decorum or economics. The role of the band or bands in a jazz funeral is to band play mournful music from the funeral home to the church; then to lead mourners from the church to the cemetery. A grand marshal leads the procession, followed by the band. The band does not play jazz during this part of the ritual, but rat her-to quote Mahalia Jackson-plays music \"as solemn as a choir or a big pipe organ.\"102 At the cemetery, the band leads the hearse and mourners through. When t he body is interred, or when the hearse reaches the cemetery, the grand marshal signals the band(s) to head back to the meeting hall(s) or other gathering place of the sponsoring club. As a respectful distance, the grand marshal signals the shift to upbeat music. The group of enthus iastic, high-stepping dancers known as the \"second line\" follows, ce lebrating the life, and the release from the troubles of life, of the deceased.103 Historically, funerals with music have been more often given for men. Men have also been more visible in leadership roles a nd in the brass bands that march and play the solemn then happy music that facilitat es the mourning and send-off. However, women have also been an active part of this tradition, as mourner s, sponsoring club members (or auxiliary member s), second-liners, and sometimes in prestigious roles as A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 74grand marshals (after 1975), and even as t he deceased who is honored with a jazz funeral. Many early benevolent societies that sponsored jazz funerals had women's auxiliaries, such as Young and True Fri ends, and some women's social aid and pleasure clubs had, and increasingly continue to have, a presence in second lines. Among the women honored wit h jazz funerals are Betsy Cole, \"Mama\" Johnson, Blue Lu Barker , Billie Pierce , Allison Minor, Ellyna Tatum, White. Some women, including Ellyna Tatum, Wanda Rouzan, and Lois Andrews have served as grand marshals.104 African American women have al so been prominent in the mortuary business in New Orleans. Erma Henderso n Gibbs and Julia Blandin became the first black female funeral home directors in 1931.105 According to chef, author, and long- time Treme resident, Leah Chase, the burials for the \"big jazz funer als\" were performed by Gertrude Geddes on Avenue.106 Geddes ran the Geddes Funeral Home for sixty-five years, first with her husband, then, when he died, she kept it going. In 1941, she founded the Gertrude Geddes-Willis Funeral Home and Insurance Company.107 Geddes was active in the Ladies Auxillary Council of the Knights of Peter Claver.108 Banjo player and historian Danny Barker, once noted that attitudes toward social class, and desire for class mobility, coul d explain why some black New Orleans residents rejected the \"funeral wit h music\" tradition and others carried it on. According to Barker, \"Those who accept and ask for burial 'with music' are secure in their status ambitions and don't feel threatened by doing so mething labeled as too 'earthy' by some insecure persons in the middle and upper classes of the community.\"109 \"They never had a band behind a minister or an unimpor tant man,\" observed New Orleans born A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 75gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who explaine d that a \"secret lodge man or a sportin' man\" who received a jazz funeral was obviously well-respected in his circle; however, not all well-liked men would be accorded the ki nd of \"earthy\" respect associated with the presence of a brass band at his funeral.110 Patriarchal definitions of \"importance,\" as well as middle-class concerns about the \"earthiness\" of jazz funerals could ex plain why so few women have received jazz funerals. While jazz funerals have been a sign of respect in some circles of New Orleans lodge members and musicians, a sign of devotion to New Orleans jazz for traditional revivalists, and a si gn of \"authenticity\" for touris ts to New Orleans, the jazz funeral has never been a sign of middle-class respectability. As we have seen across race and ethnic lines, women's adherence to cu ltural ideas about female respectability has often been pivotal to middle-class affilia tion. For many women identified with New Orleans jazz culture, however, to be honored with a jazz funer al is a sign of recognition, respect, and belonging. Perhaps the first woman honored with a jazz funeral was Betsy Cole , well- known uptown giver of lawn parties . Cole's lawn parties were famous for featuring jazz bands, such as Kid Ory's with Johnny Dodds. Giving lawn parties involved hiring music, food, and amble space for dancing, and charging admission. When \"Miss Cole\" was remembered in oral hi stories, it was either for her parties or for her funeral. Eddie Garland, who a ttended Miss Cole's lawn parties, remembered that she liked Kid Ory's band so much she w anted it to play at her funeral-an unusual wish, certainly, if not unprecedented. 111 Yet, Miss Cole did hav e her funeral with music. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 76Lillian DePass remembered that Cole's funeral was large, with two bands.112 Joe Rene, who played at Cole's funeral, believed that it was the only funeral with music that had been held for a woman.113 Apparently, there was al so a funeral for a woman remembered as \"Mama\" Johnson, but it was later on. Several large jazz funerals have been held since the 1970s for women, including the celebrated funeral of Carrie White . On July 18, 1974, the States-Item carried the headline: \"A Dirge for Miss Carrie. \" \"In her youth she worked as a maid for the famous Storyville madam, Lulu White on Basin Street, in her middl e years she was a cook at the old Savoy Restaurant,\" wr ote reporter Jim Amos, and in her last years she was \"the sharp-tongued old lady in a chair\" in front of her house at 924 Orleans Street. It seemed that Miss Carrie had \"one great wish: a jazz funeral and a service in St. Louis Cathedral. To that end she saved $3,000. Today her wish was fulfilled ... It was a people's funeral in the best sense. Miss Ca rrie had no known family, so the mourners were the people of the French Quarter.\" 114 Miss Carrie had a spectacularly attended French Quarter funeral with two bands, Ki d Sheik and the Olympia Brass Band. Later that year, on October 3, 1974, Billie Pierce , one of the famous piano- playing Goodson Sisters, received an enormous jazz funeral, less than a year after her husband and musical partner, De De Pi erce has his own four-band funeral.115 Another large jazz funeral was hel d in 1998 for singer, Blue Lu Barker.116 While jazz funerals are primarily held for New Orleans African American men, and some African American women, whit e people have also requested and received jazz funerals, including some white women. However, when New Orleans Jazz Club A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 77president and founding member Myra Menville requested a jazz funer al, her prominent family would not allow it. Born Myra Eula lie Semmes Walmsley Loker, Menville's family tree, as described by Bruce Raeburn, \"included a Confederate senator, a Rex, a president of the prestigious Boston Club, and a mayor of New Orleans.\"117 Instead, her devotion to New Orleans jazz was recognized by musician friends who honored her wishes by playing at the m ausoleum the following day.118 Allison Minor , a New Orleans jazz devotee and arts administrator , who was actively involved with the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Cont emporary Arts Center, the Louisiana Jazz Federation; a president of the New Orleans music and Entertainment Association, and manager of Professor Longhair, Rebirth Brass Band, Kermit Ruffins, Eddie Bo, and the Wild Magnolias Mardi Gras Indians , received a jazz funeral in 1995.119 In 1985, a staff member from Preservation Hall, Dodie Simmons, toured Japan with a traditional band, and was struck by the level of respect accorded New Orleans jazz. Not only were people enthusiastic abo ut the music, but th ey already knew and cared enough about New Orleans traditions to a ccord them a place in the curriculum. \"They teach traditional jazz and grand mars haling at the University of Waseda,\" she commented. \"Most musicians in Japan learn the music in school. Girls are taught to be grand marshals, with umbrel las. It's incredible that we don't have anything like that here.\" 120 Two points seem to have struck Simmons as \"incredible\": that New Orleans jazz traditions were taught in school; and that girls were taught the prestigious role of grand marshal. Indeed, this role has most often been filled by men, though women have increasingly presided as grand marshals in recent decades. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 78 Gospel and jazz singer Ellyna Tatum was the first woman grand marshal for jazz funerals. Though she began as a singer, she, in fact, became famous for her second- lining with the Magnolia Jazz Band. According to her resume, on file at the Hogan Jazz Archive, the opportunity came in 1975, when she was hired to sing in a band led by Joe Gordon and Brian Finnigan that had gotten a \"cont ract to play time -outs and half-times for the New Orleans Jazz Basketball team). So that I could remain with the band I became the Grand Marshall, a first as a lady, of the Magnolia Jazz Band....\"121 Her second-line dancing and marching can be seen in the James Bond film, Live and Let Die. When she died of Lou Gehrig's disease in 1986, she received a large jazz funeral of her own.122 Presiding as grand marshal for Tatum's funeral was singer Wanda Rouzan, who continues to serve as a grand marshal for New Orleans jazz funerals.123 Another contemporary woman gr and marshal is Lois Andrews. Lionel Batiste, Sr. listed Ellyna Tatum as one of his influences when he described the role of the Grand Marshal in a New Orleans funeral. \"To lead a jazz funeral procession as a grand marshal takes a special demeanor, one of respect and dignity. With the sadness of the occa sion filling the air and the musi c stirring the emotions, a grand marshal must stand apart from his or her personal feelings.\" 124 As the person who signals the band, and therefore the mood, from dirge mode, to accelerated tempos and the sounds of celebration, the grand marshal has a tremendous responsibility to mourners and to ri tual survival of the meaningfulness of jazz funerals.125 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 79Religion, women, and jazz Mahalia Jackson was a member of t he Mount Moriah Baptist Church, but counted as an influence the Sanctified Church t hat she lived next door to as a child in New Orleans. \"Those people had no choir and no organ. They used the drum, the cymbal, the tambourine, and the steel triangle. Everybody in there sang with their whole bodies. They had a beat, a powerful bea t, a rhythm we held on to from slavery days, and their music was so strong and expressive it used to bring tears to my eyes.\" Not only did Jackson consider the Sanctified Church to be a major influence on her own approach to sacred music, but she believ ed that \"the blues and jazz and even the rock and roll stuff got their beat fr om the Sanctified Church.\"126 Religious diversity in New Orleans--and the close proximity of different sacred music practices--contributed to jazz history. We have already not ed the presence of women at Congo Square. Zora Neale Hurst on wrote that the danc es on Congo Square, though Haitian, were not \"hoodoo,\" reporting t hat hoodoo dances were private, and that the dances on Congo Square were for pleasure.127 We have also noted Susan Cavil's suggestion that vodun ceremonies in less public settings may be another place where women contributed to a musical mix that paved the way for jazz. The importance of the Catholic Church in New Orleans jazz includes the sponsorship of dances at venues such as St . Katherine's Hall, and the sponsorship of brass bands. The rich musi cal life promoted by churches such as the Holy Ghost Catholic Church in New Orl eans, turned out many jazz musicians. Jeanette Kimball is A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 80just one of many New Orleans musicians who credited the Catholic church as an early musical influence.128 Lizzie Miles began her professional singing career, interestingly, in her catechism classes, performing at first at lawn parties, fish fries, and later in halls, parks, and theaters.129 Non-Catholic musicians benefited from the Catholic sponsorship of dances, since dancing was often prohibited by Protestant churches. Pianist Nellie Lutcher, who was Baptist, recalled that a lot of the work for the bands in her home town of Lake Charles, Louisiana, was sponsored by the Catholic Church, which allowed dancing and jazz, except for during Lent.130 Scholars have noted the influence of Protestant repertoire for brass bands. \"Perhaps the single largest source of musi c for the brass bands was the church. Hymnals of Baptists and Methodist churc hes and many fundamenta list sects provided an inexhaustible font of music familiar to the bandsmen and their audiences.\" 131 Often noted is the musical similarity between spirit uals and gospel, from the black Protestant tradition, and blues and jazz. Women have been prominent in gospel and other sacred music traditions in church, and so metimes in public performance. A cappella jubilee quartets were organized at New Orleans Univer sity as early as 1914, but the tradition was \"primarily male dominated,\" writes Joyce Marie Jackson, until the 1930s and 1940s. One of the first, and most highly acclaimed female gospel quartets was organized in 1934 by Alberta French Johnson, whose brother was banjo player Albert \"Papa\" French, who played with Oscar \"Papa\" Celestin's jazz band. 132 In the late 1910s and early 1920s, when m any Christians considered jazz to be music of the devil, a religious movement flourished in New Orleans that sometimes A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 81incorporated jazz in services. While the Bl ack Spiritualist Church did not begin in New Orleans, the New Orleans version of this predominantly women-le d religion combining trances and summoning of spirits of Afro-Car ibbean voodoo, the saints of Catholicism, and the faith-healing and witne ssing traditions of evangelic al Protestantism found a special niche in New Orleans black neighbo rhoods, where it continues to thrive. Because of the prominence of women's leader ship, and the women-led ministries that welcomed jazz, the Spiritual Churches can be seen as another place where we find a unique relationship between women and jazz in New Orleans. While the Spiritualist Churches (shorted to Spiritual Churches by the 1940s), were often presented as quaint \"local colo r\" in both tourist literature, and in much historical writing (including the Federal Writers' Project reports, according to Claude Jacobs), there were nearly \"100 of t hem among New Orleans' estimated 600 Black churches\" in the 1930s, and did not see themselv es as \"exotic,\" but as a powerful voice in civic affairs. Not a passing fad, there c ontinue to exist about 100 Spiritual churches in New Orleans today.133 According to Yvonne Chireau, these ministries have been \"paradigms of female religi ous empowerment,\" as well as civic empowerment. The churches expanded public roles for wom en, increased their ec onomic status (by providing spiritual training and the right to charge fees for healing and other spiritual services), and provided leadership roles not available in the gender organization of most denominations or in other realms of civic life.134 One of the earliest Spir itual churches was founded in Chicago in 1913 by an African American woman named Mother Leafy Ander son. After establishing her Eternal A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 82Life Spiritualist Church, Anderson traveled wid ely, founding missions fr om city to city. She eventually moved to New Orleans (possi bly 1919), selecting the Crescent City as her home base. Mother Anderson incorporated jazz bands into her services at a time when jazz and blues were considered by major denominations as the devil's music.135 One of the musicians who played for her services was cornetist Chris Kelly, who also played in parades, concerts, and dances, as a member of the Eclipse Brass Band.136 One researcher for the WPA wr ote that Mother Anderson \" had a red hot six piece swing band that played the hymns in jazz time and style.\" He cont inued, quoting another spiritualist leader, Mother Dora Tyson, whom he had interviewed, \"Mother liked her music and swing it down when she preached.\"137 Mother Anderson's services attract ed converts who became religious leaders themselves. One of these was a poor Kentucky transplant named Catherine Seals (born Nanny Cowans). After starting, then outgrowing, her first ministry on Jackson Street, Mother Catherine founded her Temple of Innocent Blood (also called the Manger) in the Ninth Ward, where she focu sed her ministry on unwed mothers and their children. She continued Mo ther Anderson's tradition of incorporating jazz to summon the spirits. Her minist ry (1922-1930) appealed to poor people across race and ethnic lines, among them musicians. Bruce Raebu rn points out that Ernie Cagnolatti, an Italian Creole of color who was raised Catholic , \"became an initiate of Mother Catherine Seals ... and performed jazz at her services in the guise of t he Archangel Gabriel.\"138 Harold \"Duke\" Dejan, leader of the Olympi a Brass Band played at Mother Catherine's services, as did another New Orleans musician, Frank Lastie, who served in her church A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 83as a drum-playing deacon.139 On her visits to the M anger in the 1920s, Zora Neale Hurston noted, \"Unlike most re ligious dictators, Mother Catherine does not crush the individual. She encourages originality. Ther e is an air of gaiety about the enclosure.\" She also noted that Mother Catherine \"encou rages music.\" This could be observed in her surroundings. \"Mother Catherine holds cour t in a huge tent. On a raised platform is her bed, a piano, instruments for a ten-piece orchestr a, a huge coffee urn, a wood stove, a heater, chairs and rockers and tables.\"140 Lyle Saxon reported the prominent place of music in Mother Catherine's comp ound, writing, \"The large blanket-covered objects are band instruments. On a table is an enormous brass trumpet; on the floor are the drums: a tom-tom, ba ss and kettle drums. An automatic piano stands in the center accompanied by a rack of rolls.\"141 Mother Catherine Seals was known to play trombone in her church services. Jason Be rry points out that m any New Orleans jazz musicians had early musical experiences in Spiritual Churches, in cluding saxophonist Donald Harrison, Jr., whose aunt is a minister in a Spiritual Church.142 Great Migration The common place of New Orleans in jazz hi story books is as the \"birth place\" or \"cradle\" of jazz (language des erving of gender analysis, indeed!) According to this popular version, when New Orleans' famous red light district was shut down in 1917, jazz had nowhere to go but up--the Mississippi river, that is--to Chicago and Kansas City, before heading east to New York. More recently, jazz historians have been chipping away at that simple genealogy, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 84pointing out that jazz flourished in New Or leans not merely because of its exotic reputation as locus of sex and sin, but precisely because it was a cosmopolitan cultural hub with people and influences travel ing in and out. For that ma tter, jazz did not simply flow north on the inevitable logi c of its own aesthetic journey.143 Just as the influences of jazz traveled with people, the music that became known as jazz traveled with mobile populations, most notably with African Amer icans in the period known as the Great Migration, between the beginnin g of World War I and the end of World War II. In this respect, jazz musicians, like thei r audiences, were more likely to travel on railroads then on river boats, and did not only go to Chic ago and Kansas City, but to scattered destinations in the north, east, west, and even in the urban centers in the south, where African Americans hoped to find im proved working and living conditions. Chicago is certainly an important destination, how ever, not only because New Orleans musicians migrated there, but because of the open connection between New Orleans and Chicago that played such a pow erful role in the development of jazz. Between 1910 and 1920, the African Amer ican population in Chicago increased from forty thousand to over a hundred thousand, with the largest numbers of black migrants traveling by rail from the Mississippi Delta.144 With the migrants traveled tastes and markets for souther n black culture, including urban and modern southern black culture that symbolized hopes for impr oved living and working conditions of black migrants in the inter-war years. As the primary representative of urban, modern, southern culture, New Orleans jazz expressed the hopes of many southern migrants as they sought increased opportunities in Chica go, while maintaining cultural and kinship A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 85ties to the south. In jazz history, geography and style oft en share the same name, rendering it easy to use these concepts interchangeably or without definition. Both Chicago and New Orleans are cities with long jazz historie s, and both cities have styles named after them. \"Chicago style\" and \"New Orleans st yle\" are terms that hail bounded periods of time and particular sets of players and kinds of music that, of course, do not encompass all of the jazz played even in those cities. It is important to note that while a \"Chicago style\" developed in the 1920s, that this te rm has been primarily associated with the young, white musicians of t he Austin High Gang, and is not used to describe the New Orleans style of music that was popular in Chicago in the late teens and early 1920s. New Orleans jazz in 1920s Chicago was often played by African American and Creole of color New Orleans migrants, or people influenc ed by them. The active travel route of musicians from New Orleans to Chicago al so meant that thes e migrants appeared on many of the releases of the \"race record s\" division of Chicago's booming recording industry. New Orleans musicians who reco rded in Chicago exert ed a powerful influence on musicians and audiences for whom reco rds were becoming a primary avenue of musical activity, experience, and knowledge. Several women musicians were pivotal to the migration of New Orleans musicians to Chicago. Mary and Billy McBride brought many New Orleans jazz musicians to Chicago on the traveling show they will maintained for many decades, \"Mack and Mack\" (not to be confused with \"Mack's Merry Makers\"). Their specialty was New Orleans music. Mary McBride (nee Tha cker) was born in Algiers, Louisiana, and A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 86sang the blues. Lovie Austin, based in Chic ago, was responsible for the recording opportunities of many New Orleans musician s. Tennessee born Lil Hardin moved to Chicago in 1918, where she soon played her fi rst job with a band, which turned out to be a New Orleans band, and spent much of her career playing and recording with New Orleans musicians in Chicago. As in New Orleans, Chicago's South Side of the 1920s was a place where it was not unusual to find women as well respected pianists in jazz bands. In fact, Austin, and Lil Hardin (later Armstrong) held, between them, many of the most prestigious jazz piano jobs in 1920s Chicago: Armstrong at the Dreamland Caf\u00e9 and Royal Gardens and other locales, play ing with popular New Orleans groups, including King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. In addition to direct ing the music at the Monogram for twenty-five y ears, Austin was the house pianist, arranger, musical director for jazz sessions at Paramount Reco rds (1923-1926), which was, at that time, a virtual clearing house for recordings of black New Orleans musicians. 145 Another woman who worked with many New Orleans mu sicians in Chicago was violinist Mae Brady, who led the band at the Dreamland in the early 1920s.146 Even as many African Americans traveled out of the south in search of northern urban opportunities, still others moved to southern urban centers for the same reasons, migrating to cities such as Houston, At lanta, Birmingham, and New Orleans. It is important to note that while Storyville closed in 1917, the black population of New Orleans more than doubled between 1910- 1930, with greater acceleration after 1920. 147 True, jazz, with its musicians and audiences, was on the move in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, but it is also true t hat jazz never vacated New Orl eans altogether, nor did it A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 87freeze into the style named after that city. Due to the comple x circuits of mobility during those years, including back-and-forth travel (another less discussed aspect of Great Migration history), black populations of many urban c enters were connected through histories of chain migration, relocation, vi siting, and culture. Ne w Orleans and Chicago were so profoundly linked, that historians w ho study jazz history or black history in either city, one must look at the other. It isn't enough, in ot her words, to look at New Orleans as the \"birth place\" and Chicago (or Kansas City) as the \"next stage,\" but to look at many sites and their intersections as integral parts of cultural exchanges facilitated by traveling musicians and audience s, new technologies such as records and radio, and interconnected black communities. In these ways, current jazz scholarship is re-thinking the role of New Orleans in jazz history, not merely as a traditional \"sty le\" or \"period\" (Golden Age), but also as an urban center with a continuing jazz history, and its own historical relationship to industrialization, urbanization, mi gration, and new technologies. Both jazz history and Great Migration history have paid more attention to men than to women, so there are great gaps in what we know about the movements of African American women jazz musicians-especia lly those who played instruments other than piano. Did women musicians travel to the same extent as men? Did women musicians migrate for the same reasons? Did t heir status as musicians vary from city to city? Did they mean the same things to audiences from place to place? While much more historically grounded rese arch of specific musicians, cities, and circuits needs to take place before these questions can be answered, the movements of A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 88trumpet player Ann Cooper can, at the very least, of fer evidence of one female instrumentalist's participation in the circuitous routes of mobile musicians whose careers touched New Orleans jazz. As elaborated in her biographical entry in this report, she migrated from Chicago to New Orleans in t he mid 1930s. This decision seems to have been occasioned by an offer to play with Papa Ce lestin's orchestra, possibly instigated through her contacts with any number of Ne w Orleans musicians currently playing in Chicago. When she arrived in New Orleans , however, she was hired instead by Joe Robichaux, for his Rhythm Boys orchestra. Cabarets and theaters Dance historian, Jacqui Malone has written, The infancy of jazz coincided with extensiv e artistic and commercial efforts to get black musical theater established on Broadw ay. As a result, jazz musicians had a recognized connection with professional danc e acts prior to the thirties. From the orchestra pit, musicians backed pr ofessional dancers and singers in theaters across the country. Throughout the twenties, jazz musicians, singers, and dancers worked together in night clubs and cabarets; and they performed jointly in revues that toured t he United States and abroad.\"148 Just as New York borrowed from New Orleans fantasies, New Orleans borrowed from theatrical conventions hailing from Ne w York. Touring revues of light-skinned chorus lines such as the Brown Skinned Models and the Bronze Mannikins often came through New Orleans as part of their theater circuits. In 1939, the Bronze Mannikins performed the midnight show at the Palace T heatre with Alto Oates, \"Harlem's Queen of Song.\" Three weeks later, the \"Midnight Ra mble\" at the Palace was headlined by a local New Orleans entertainer known as Joan Lunceford (Daisy Lowe), a singer who A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 89often performed with Joe Robichaux's Rhythm Boys, this time billed as \"the country's new queen of swing,\" with a chorus li ne dubbed the \"High Brown Creole Models.\"149 Another dancer of the 1920s and 1930s that was an im portant member of Joe Robichaux's Rh ythm Boys was Baby Briscoe , who, along with singer Joan Lunceford, and trumpet player Ann Cooper, played in that popular band at the New Orleans Rhythm Club in the mid-1930s. The female members of Robichaux's band were added as part of his switch to a fourteen-piece orchestra after returning from a Brunswick recording session in New York in 1933. In preparation for taking the Rhythm Club (Jackson and Derbigny, the Central City neighborhood) \"by storm,\" Robichaux put together a big band fronted by Lunceford (nee Daisy Lowe) and Briscoe in tuxedos and batons. Both were popular female entertainers in New Orleans at the time. It is clear from the advertisements and revi ews of the Rhythm Boys, that Baby Briscoe was one of the primary draws for this band, which performed with a floor show. Briscoe and Lunceford wore tuxedos in the manner of other 1930s women entertainers such as Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, and J eni LeGon, who were not \"male impersonators,\" but w hose appeal was built on the novelty of women performing as women in men's dress. This is differ ent from another cross- dressing tradition known as \"drag,\" in which men impersonated wo men, and women impersonated men, though drag has also shared the stage with jazz. New Orleans born Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie began her career as a band singer, began wearing m en's dress to match her singing range, which was lower than most women's. She enjoyed the most fame as a male impersonator and singer with the Jewel Box Revue, in wh ich she was the only male A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 90impersonator in a traveling s how of twenty-five female impersonators. She is the subject of one of the lesser known facts of gay and lesbian history, as the lesbian who through the first punch at the Stonewall Rebellion in 1969, t he even that is credited with launching the Gay Liberation Movement.150. All-Woman Bands Most of the women who played instrum ents other than piano di d so either as members of family bands or as all-wo man bands. Maeceil Peterson, one of the excellent drummers from t he musical family of Ber nadette and George Peterson. George Peterson was a music teacher who t aught at least three women drummers, all of whom became professionals: his daughters Bernadette Peterson Kerrigan and Maeceil Peterson Silliker, and his niece Lois Perry.151 Many New Orleans jazz women, incl uding Baby Briscoe, Yvonne Busch, Ione Golden, Dixie Fasnacht, and Mickey Stevens , played went on the road with all-woman bands, and also the all-woman bands that trav eled through New Orleans, including the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Eddie Durham's \"All-Star\" Girls, Phil Spitalny's Hour of Charm (new Orleanean Maceil Peterson went with them as a saxophonist), the Harlem Playgirls (New Orleanean Baby Br iscoe became their leader), the Rays of Rhythm (Yvonne Busch played trumpet with them), Ada Leonard's All American Girls, and Ina Ray Hutton's Melodears. Dixie Fasnacht studied clar inet and Eb alto saxophone at the Nicholls school in the late twenties and early thirties, where s he knew Connie, Martha, and Vet Boswell. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 91All of these white women w ould become drawn to jazz. Fasnacht's opportunity came when a white \"all-girl\" band call ed the Smart Set got str anded in New Orleans. They stayed in a boarding house run by Dixie's si ster. Getting stranded was easy to do on the road, and especially so during the Depressi on. Dixie Fasnacht, in fact, found herself stranded with the Smart Set in Pensacola. She returned New Orleans in 1933 with pianist Betty Giblin when they were offe red an opportunity to appear with an \"all-girl\" band called the Bricktops. Later, s he would go on the road again with women musicians she had met through these networks, this time called the Sophisticates of Swing. New Orleans based al l-woman bands included the Harmony Maids in the 1930s and the Victoryettes in the 1940s. In the 1930s, when Lil Hardin Armstrong is to appear with an all-woman band at the Apollo Theater in New York, the organization founded by New Orleans-born bassist Olivia Sophie L' Ange Shipp, the Negro Women's Orchestral and Civic Association, supplied the musicians. 152 Sometimes the expectation of women to play in \"all-girl\" bands had its downside for professional women musicians. In a strange twist of gender bias, the recording company prevented the regular bass player , Johnny Senac, from appearing on the record. Apparently, there was no sense in recording women jazz musicians unless they fulfilled the \"all-girl\" band requirement. So instead of a bass, the band was recorded with drummer, Maeceil Peterson, an exce llent drummer, but not a regular band member, so the band was unable to reco rd in its usual configuration. Women who owned night clubs where ja zz was played include Dixie and Irma Fasnacht. In 1939, clarinetist and alto sa xophonist New Orleans- born Dixie Fasnacht A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 92came off the road from several years of playing in \"all-girl\" bands, to co-run a bar opened by her sister Irma. \"Dixie 's Bar of Music,\" as it was called, had a live jazz policy in both of its locations, with a co-ed band l ed by Miss Dixie. It would also become known as the first gay bar in New Orl eans, though Miss Dixie and Miss Irma did not necessarily think of it as such. The first location was on 204 St. Charles, across the street from the St. C harles Hotel. While Miss Dixie kept charge of the entertainment, it was Miss Irma who managed the business end.153 After World Wa r II, the sisters moved Dixie's Bar of Music to 701 Bourbon Street, where they operated the bar from 1949-1964. Bernadette Peterson Kerri gan opened a nightclub in Gentilly. 154 Educators Throughout the history New Orleans, women have been some of the most important music teachers. Early influential educators include Margaret Kimble, Mercedes Garman Fields, and Camille Nickerson. Al Kennedy's insightful study of the role of what he calls \"jazz mentors\" in t he public schools includes trumpet player and public school teacher Yvonne Busch . The mentors in New Orle ans that he writes about were often musicians with gigging experience, who taught in public schools, and developed mentoring relationships with students interested in ja zz. This is a rich field for studying women's participation in jazz. In Kennedy's words, \"Her legacy as a musical mentor in the public schools is an impressive roster of accomplished musicians. Some broke new ground as avant-garde jazz performers. Others formed the backbone of the New Orleans rhythm and blues explosion that caught the attent ion of the nation in A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 93the 1950s. Still others are preserving the sp irit of traditional New Orleans jazz.\"155 Yvonne Busch was born in 1929, and grew up in the Treme neighborhood, where brass bands were often heard in the street. As a little girl, Busch was afraid of the crowds brought by parades, but was influenced by them from the safety of her home. Though a nearby elementary school had a band with instruments, this was a white school which she walked past each day in order to get to her segregated black elementary school. She wanted to play an in strument, but family couldn't afford one and the school she attended didn't have any she could use. Her cousin was James Clifton Polite, who was a student at Piney Woods Country Life School, in Mississippi. He played in the all-male band, and was an assistant teacher for the all-female band. In the summ er of 1940, at the age of eleven, she went to Mississippi. She spent the first year lear ning to play alto horn and trumpet, earning a place in the Rays of Rhythm, and the sec ond year being sent around the country to substitute for ill members of the Internat ional Sweethearts of Rhythm. After the Sweethearts broke from the sch ool, the Swinging Rays of Rh ythm were sent out as the front line band. In the spring of 1942, t he Swinging Rays of Rhythm played the Gypsy Tea Room in New Orleans. She returned to New Orleans to live at the age of 13. Busch completed eighth grade in New Or leans. One of her teachers formed a band, which she joined, gaining more valuabl e experience. She went to high school with trumpet player Dooky Chase, and joined his young band in the 1940s, which was able to secure considerable employment since slightly older bands had lost their members to the draft and enlis tment of World War II. The Dooky Chase Orchestra A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 94broke away from the older New Orleans st yles to experiment with bebop. Along with Busch and Chase, the band included Calvin Labat (piano) and Benjamin \"Benny\" Powell (trombone). After high school, Bu sch majored in trombone at Southern University in Baton Rouge, where she was the only woman and the first trombonist in the university jazz band in 1947. Began teaching music at Grunewald's School of Music during her first year of university, then got a job t eaching band at Booker T. Washington Senior High. The school district forbade jazz and swing for public school bands, but she mentored students informally. She taught at Clark Senior High. and Carver Senior High, and retired in 1983 after 32 years of teaching in the New Orleans Public School District.156 Bassist/vocalist Germaine Bazzle taught at Washington High School in Thibodaux in the 1960s, Xavier Preparatory Hi gh School in the 1970s. New Orleans Revival The first New Orleans jazz revival occurr ed directly following World War II, with another revival following in 1960s. Women were involved in both revivals, as revivalists, and as the aging early New Orleans musicians whom the revivalists wished to \"revive.\" The New Orleans Revival may be described as a cross-cultural, cross-generational, participatory preservationism, in which younger fans and musicians, usually white, immersed themselves in learning about, documenting, seeking out, playing, recording, and educating the public about music of an earlier generation of musicians, usually African American or Creole of co lor. The revivals took plac e in the context of the Civil Rights Movement. Traditional New Orleans jazz appealed to white liberals as a \"folk\" A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 95music, and as a site of integration, but had less appeal for African Americans involved in the Civil Rights moment, particularly young peopl e for whom the old music represented memories of an unjust past that needed to be replaced with new sounds and visions that included new black music such as rhythm and blues and soul.. In all of its social, political, economic, and cultural complexity, the New Orleans Revival cannot be underestimated for its influenc e in shaping the post-war future of New Orleans jazz. Nor should we underestimate the role of collector s, usually (but not exclusively) young white men, when considering the subsequent historical narratives, archival holdings, recordings (both rei ssued and new), and the continuing impact of such recordings and historical narrative s on what we know about the music and musicians who created New Orleans Jazz. The Revival and revivalists affected New Orleans in numerous ongoing ways, including the culture and econom y of jazz-tourism, the repertoire of street musicians, and of the eventual civic and commercial interest in promoting jazz as a product and symbol of New Orleans. 157 Indeed, most of the sources for this study are available due to the complex cross-cultural, cross- generational relationships of both men and wo men during the New Orleans Revival. Bertha Gonsoulin was part of the first reviva l, when she appeared with Bunk Johnson in San Francisco in 1943. The daughter of a band leader and railroad worker, Gonsoulin was from New Orleans. She was living on the West Coast as early as 1921, when she filled in for Lil Hardin in King O liver's band, and was a respected black music teacher in San Francisco Bay Area in 1940.158 Another important contributor to the first revival who also resided in California was Marili Morden (Stuart Ertegun Levin). A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 96Morden, a white woman from Oregon, ran Jazz Man records, the center for New Orleans jazz devotees in Los Angeles in the late 1930s and 1940s. An active fan of jazz and blues, manager for blues guitarist T-Bone Walker, as well as an active integrationist, Morden negotia ted bookings for Walker in highly segregated 1940s Hollywood, and demanded mixed-race audience pol icies for Walker's performances at Billy Berg's. According to Bruce Raeburn, Floyd Levin, and Morden's last husband, Art Levin, it was Marili Morden who brought trombonist Kid Ory out of reti rement in the early 1940s. Ory had gotten out of the music busi ness, and was working as a postal worker and chicken rancher in Los Angeles. Mo rden encouraged him to play the trombone after a nine year hiatus, and brought him to t he attention of Orson Welles in 1944, when the film-maker enlisted Morden to find a traditional New Orleans band for his radio show.159 Members of Kid Ory's band, including Ory himself, later appeared in the film project that had been started, and then abandoned, by Welles, New Orleans (1947), which also featured Louis Armstrong and Bi llie Holiday. The main character of New Orleans, however, is a white woman opera si nger who appropriates the song she learns from her maid (played by Holiday in her only role in a feature fil m), and brings jazz to the concert hall with an all- white orchestra, jazz band (W oody Herman), and audience. The power imbalances depicted in this film are a striking illustration of what New Orleans jazz represented for dominant cultur e, and help to explain why many African American activists of the war-time and post- war Civil Rights Movement tended not to associate with traditional New Orleans jazz.160 This was not true of all African American activists, however. As we shall soon s ee, Dodie Simmons, a black woman from New A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 97Orleans, combined her activism in CORE (Commission of Racial Equility) with her active participation at Preservation Hall dur ing the New Orleans revival of the 1960s.161 Women whose careers received a boost due to the New Orleans Revival in the 1950s and 1960s include Emma Barrett, Dolly Adams , Billie Pierce , and Olivia \"Lady Charlot\" Cook . It is impossible to consider traditional New Orleans jazz from the 1940s on without understanding something about the revivalists, fans, collectors, and the serious devotees like William Russell, Richard Allen, and Larry Borenstein, and others, who recorded the musicians they lov ed, wrote about them, started the archival collecting that researchers still rely on today, and producing concerts. Among these devotees, were some women, notably Myra Menville and Helen Arlt, both active members and presidents of the New Orleans Jazz Club (founded 1948); and Menville was the founding editor of the club's journal Second Line, and a major figure in the struggle to have a statue of Louis Armstr ong erected in the city of his birth. 162 The NOJC was a mostly white organization, retic ent to rock the boat in segregated times, yet effective in bringing \"res pectability\" to New Orleans ja zz history that led to wider acceptance. The first African American board member of the NOJC was Charlotte McCullom Boutney who joined the board in 1972. 163 The Jazz Museum and Preservation Hall were both founded in 1961. Barbara Reid Edmiston and Sandra Jaffe both play ed key roles in founding and running Preservation Hall, as well as Mrs. Aline Wil lis (one of Larry Borenstein's secretaries), Sylvia Shannon (another one of Borenstein's secretarie s), Resa Lambert (Sandra Jaffe's sister, manager of road bands), and Dodie Smith Simmons. 164 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 98 Sandra Jaffe was born in 1938. She was already an Armstrong fan when she married Allan Jaffe, a fan of New Orleans musi c. When Allan realized that the business career for which he had prepared was going to make him miserable, he and Sandra quit their jobs and took to the road. They arri ved in New Orleans the spring of 1961, hoping to hear some of the artists they had been listening to on Folkways records. They arrived just in time for the founding of Preservation Hall, which was in the midst of a crisis over funds and politics. It was bei ng run by Larry Borenstein, Ken Mills, and Barbara Reid. In September, 1961, Mills left, and the recent arrivals, Allan and Sandra Jaffe, assumed the responsibilitie s of running Preservation Hall. 165 The Jaffes, and other workers and volunteers at Preservation Hall, were committe d to racial integration, during a particularly explosive time in New Orleans race politics. Sustained activism had achieved the integration of New Orleans libraries (1955) and buses and streetcars (1958), but state and local resi stance to school desegregation threatened to shut down the schools rather than integrate in 1960 and 1961.166 People who struggled for Civil Rights, or who even socializ ed across race during the post- Brown v. Board of Education (1954) years, did so at great personal risk. Preservation Hall is one of the integrated spaces at which people were arrested in New Orleans for congregating across race. Dodie Simmons became involved with Preservation Hall in the 1960s, at the same time that she was active in CORE. Civil Rights Activists and lawyers sometimes stayed at the hall in sleeping bags as a safe haven. 167 This period also saw the destruction of the thriving Claiborne Avenue black business area to make room fo r Interstate I-10. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 99Conclusion Jazz Fest '68 (1968), The New Orleans Jazz and Food Festival (1969), and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (1970- Present), are other sites where we find the participation of women, but are outside t he scope of this study, except to note the appearances of the women whose biographies appear in the following pages. This report has focused primarily on the earlie r jazzwomen, not because they are more important than those in more recent y ears, but because the more contemporary women's histories deserve in-depth res earch, and because the information is readily available for researchers in New Orleans. T he conclusion of this \"Historical Overview,\" therefore, is not meant as an ending, but as a prelude for additional scholarship on the contributions and historical and social c ontexts of such im portant New Orleans jazzwomen as bassist/vocalist Germaine Bazzle and clarinetist Doreen Ketchens.

There are many more women whose lives can enhance our know ledge about New Orleans jazz history. In hopes that this Research Study may serve as a launch pad for future research, I have added a suggested list (also not comprehensive) of women about whom biographical entries should be written and included. The biographical entries t hat are included represent a cross-section of women involved in jazz history in different ways. There is a preponderance of pianists and vocalists, which reflects the gender division of labor in New Orleans jazz history (and elsewhere, and the present, for that matter), but there are also women who played instruments other than pi ano, entrepreneurs, danc ers, band leaders, and educators. Each entry includes a bibli ography, and, whenever possible, a discography, a videography or filmography, and a list of available illustrations. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 116 Dolly Marie Douroux Adams (pianist, band leader, doubled on bass and drums) b. January 11, 1904 (New Orleans) / d. November 6, 1979 (New Orleans) Dolly Marie Douroux (later Adams) wa s born in New Orleans, January 11, 1904, into the third generation of a well-known Creo le of color family that was commended in the 1984 edition of New Orleans Jazz: A Family Album for \"supplying jazz, dance, and concert music in the New Or leans area for a century.\" 1 In addition to carrying on this tradition through her own fifty-year career as a pianist and band leader, Adams raised and trained her own musical family, who continue the family legacy. Adams's parents, Olivia Douroux (born Manetta) and Louis Douroux, were both musicians, popular for dual trumpet playing t hat showed off their precision triple tonguing technique. They perfo rmed their trumpet duets at priv ate parties, not in public. While Louis played his trumpet professionally, Olivia did not, in all likelihood because brass instruments were not considered appropriate for girls. Accord ing to Karl Koenig, while boys-Creole, black, and white-might grow up in late nineteenth century New Orleans hoping to play in a brass band, girls were not encouraged to play brass instruments in public, or to march in bands. The only acceptable instruments for girls to play in public were piano and violin. Yet, as the piano became important to early A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 117 twentieth century jazz bands, women with pi ano training--especially those who had acquired the knowledge of c hords that was invaluable to these early collectively improvising ensembles--began to be hired as regular members of otherwise all-male professional bands.2 Olivia's daughter Doll y would be a key participant in this historical shift. Olivia was an excellent mu sician, proficient on piano an d violin, in addition to cornet and trumpet. Had she been a boy, she may have gone down in New Orleans history with the accolades accorded her brother, band leader, multi-instrumentalist, music \"Professor,\" Manuel Manet ta. While \"Creole\" is usually assumed to denote French heritage, Olivia and Manuel Manetta, lik e many Creole of color musicians, came from a family with Sicilian roots.3 Manetta, the first band l eader to hire Adams, played and taught all of the instrument s for more than fifty years, and was known for being able to play trumpet and trombone at the same time in harmony.4 Louis Douroux, Adams's father, was a butcher by tr ade--not a bad day job for a mu sician, since he was off at noon. He played cornet and trumpet with m any of the brass bands in the Algiers vicinity, including the acclaimed Eureka and Excelsior Brass Bands. Growing up in family with such a strong musical history, it is no surprise that Adams grew up playing a variety of musical inst ruments. In her oral history interview on April 18, 1962, she told William Russell t hat she had yearned to play the piano even before her family acquired one. When the piano entered her household, seven-year-old Dolly began her life-long relation ship with the instrument, gaining some instruction from A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 118 her parents, as well as from her uncle Manu el Manetta. She continued her studies at St. Mary's Academy, but was adamant that she picked up how to play the piano on her own, and required lessons only in reading and scales. By the time she was nine, she was playing with her brother, a violinist, at private parties. At the age of thirteen, she began going to work with her Uncle Manetta, helping him carry his instruments. He soon became the first band leader to hire her to play piano. Manetta's band, with its impressive, though rapidly chan ging personnel, afforded her the opportunity to work with many of the finest musicians of pre-192 0s jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, Joe \"King\" Oliver, Kid Howard, and Alec Bigard. When asked how it was possible for her to obtain these opportunities in times when it was unusual for young women to go out to play, or even to hear, music, she explained how family connections mitigated social norms. \"I was always well chaperoned with Manetta, by my brothers and later, my sons.\"5 Although Manetta was already the pianist for his own band, Adam s explained that her uncle began playing clarinet in the band so that s he would have a chance to play.6 Her son, Placide Adams, Jr., had a somewhat different theory, telling film maker Ka y D. Ray that he believed Manetta hired his mother in part as self-p rotection. Manetta often worked in rough areas, such as brothels, including the famo us house of Lulu White. Placide Adams Jr. believed that his mother was hired, in part, because Manetta thought that no one would attack a pre-adolescent girl carrying money and instruments. 7 At age 15, she joined Peter Bocage's Creole Serenaders. She also played with Luis \"Papa\" Tio, Lorenzo Tio, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 119 Jr., and Alphonse Picou, and started her car eer as a leader around the same time, with a group that played at the Othello Theatre on South Rampart Street, playing for vaudeville acts. She played pian o for the silent films at th e theater as well. Her band included Dominque Remy, trumpet; Joe Welc h, violin; and Eddie Woods, drums. Around 1922, she married a contractor by the name of Placi de Adams, and took a 15 years sabbatical from the professional music world while she raised her own musical family. Throughout her career, Dolly Adams was usually hired to play the piano only, but, like her mother, she was a capable multi-instrumentalist. Pianist Jeanette Kimball told film-maker Kay D. Ray that, \"Dolly played the bass. She was good.\"8 Additionally, she could play drums, guita r, and trumpet, and was able to teach her seven children to play a variety of instru ments. Three of her sons would become prominent New Orleans musicians, Gerald (bass and piano), Justin (guitar), and Placide Jr. (bass and drums). Her ot her three sons and one daughter (Odollie) played musical instruments, but not professionally: Carl (t rombone), Odollie (piano ), Robert (piano) and Calvin (bass). Placide Adams Sr. played the piano for his own enjoyment, but was not a professional musician. Placide Adams Jr. recalled his father playing one blues number over and over \"when he thought no one was around.\" 9 In 1937, Dolly Adams returned to an acti ve professional play ing schedule again, this time in a band with her brothers, Law rence Douroux (trump et) and Irving Douroux (trombone). Placide Jr. told f ilm maker Kay D. Ray that his father didn't like the idea of his wife going out to play in a band, but because the family needed the money, he A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 120 tolerated her activities. Af ter Irving's death, Adams cont inued playing with Lawrence. Although she usually played only piano in public, Charles Love recalled that in addition to playing \"swell piano... . [w]hen Lawrence played the piano, she played bass.\"10 Eventually, she formed a new family band with her sons, Justin, Gerald, and enlarged it to a quartet when her son Placide Jr. came hom e from army. Placi de Jr. recalled that the band played mostly at West Bank clubs-t he Varsity, Gay Paree, and Moonlight Inn, and that their \"main competition was Kid Thomas and his band, who played at the Moulin Rouge.\"11 In 1961, Dolly Adams primarily played at Preservation and Di xieland Halls as leader of her own group, a band t hat included her sons. While playing at Preservation Hall in 1965, bass player, Papa John Joseph collapsed after his bass solo and died, falling on Adams's foot. Traumatized by this event, she slowed down her playing schedule. In 1966, she suffered a stroke that put a permanent end to her regular playing career, though she did occasionally appear at the piano in public. A note in the vertical files at the Hogan Ja zz Archive at Tulane indicates that she had telephoned the Archive on June 21, 1967, to announce that s he had recovered sufficiently from her stroke to play again, and expressing interest in locating a gentleman who had wanted to interview her when she was sick. Also in the files is a review, by Clive Wilson, of Dolly's playing in a band that included Manuel Manetta and her sons Justin and Gerald, for the Creole Spring Fiesta Associat ion Ball, at Corpus Christ i School on May 5, 1968. Wrote Wilson, \"Dolly Adams played the first few numbers on piano while Manetta A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazzwomen: A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 121 sat out. I was impressed with her drive and accurate chording, although she said she has not recovered entirely from her stroke which affected her hands.\"12 When Adams died on November 6, 1979 at the age of 75, New Orleans jazz magazine, Second Line , honored her with a cover featur e, and the New Orleans Jazz Club presented her family with a certificate commemorating \"the role she played in the history of Jazz in New Orleans.\"13 Notes 1 Rose, Al, and Edmond Souchon.

Feb 3, 1898 [or 1902, or 1900] (Memphis, Tennessee)1 / d. August 27, 1971 (Chicago, Illinois) Lil Hardin was not born in New Orleans , neither did she live there. Nonetheless, the Memphis -born, Chicago -based pianist, composer, and band leader made an undeniable mark on New Orleans jazz. Sh e was influenced by New Orleans musicians, worked with New Orleans musicians, hired New Orleans musicians as a leader, and influenced New Orleans jazz as a member of some of the most important bands in the New Orleans -Chicago connection that was vital to t he growth of jazz through the mass culture boom in the 1920s. She appears on some of the most important recordings of New Orleans musicians, including Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven Session s, and the 1926 New Orleans Wanderers sessions (which sh e organized). As a composer, she wrote many pieces that became standard fare for New Orleans bands to this day, notably Struttin' With Some Barbeque. Lillian Hardin was born in Memphis to Dempsey and William Hardin. Her birth year is sometimes publish ed as 1898 and sometimes as 1902, and, indeed, even the public records contradict each other . The Social Security Death Index gives her birth year as 1902. But because the 1900 Census lists her as a two -year old, it is unlikely that she could have been b orn two years later. And to make matters more complicated, Lillian herself, like her famous one -time husband, Louis, gave interviewers a different birth year altogether. Lil Hardin claimed 1900 as her birth year. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 125 According to Hardin, her father died whe n she was two years old. She and her mother moved into a boarding house down the street, but apparently there was a pump organ, as she recalled playing the keys as soon as she could reach them. A cousin helped out by crawling on the floor and pushing the pedals. In grade school when she began piano lessons. She first studied with a teacher named Miss Violet White, then attended Miss Hook's School of Music. In these lessons, she learned classical music, marches and hymns. She became known as a child pr odigy; and while this is no doubt so, it is also important to note that because she was small, and looked younger than her age, her reputation as a child prodigy outlasted her childhood. As with many women who became jazz musicians, Lil's first exposure t o jazz was through a male relative, a cousin, who played on his guitar a kind of music that her grandmother found vulgar. In her oral history with William Russell, she said that cousin's sang and played Buddy Bolden's Blues.2 She studied at Fisk University in Nashville for 2 \u00bd years on a special music program. Then, in 1918, like so m any African Americans in the south, she and her mother moved to Chicago, as part of the Great Migration. There, she obtained a job as a music demonstrator in a sheet music store on State Street, working for a Mrs. Jones, who also booked bands. It was the re that her oft -cited meeting with Jelly Roll Morton took place. After hearing Morton, the story goes, she decided to play heavy and strong, a factor that endeared her to New Orleans musicians, whom she said liked playing with her because she played loud and supported them.3 After a short time, Mrs. Jones dispatched her to an audition with a New Orleans A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 126 band. Lil got job, in a band that she remembered as including Eddie Garland (bass), Roy Palmer (trombone), Lawrence Duhe (clarinet), Sugar Johnny Smith (cornet), Tubby Hall (drums), Jimmy Palao (violin).4 According to Garland, personnel at the time Lil joined included Joe Oliver (trumpet), Roy Palmer (trombone, later replaced by Honore Dutrey), Johnny Dodds (clarinet), Minor Hall (drums), himself (bass), and Lil.5 Though she had only played notated music up to this time, she found herself comfortable with the band that did not use sheet music. The legend goe s that Lil had to sneak to her job because she was too young, but if she was born in 1898, she would have been about 20. In any case, playing in jazz bands at venues such as the Deluxe Caf\u00e9 in the South Side of Chicago, was an un - lady-like activity that s he knew would give her mother a fit, and so she told her she was playing at a dance studio. As she told one reporter, The way she looked at it, you either were or weren't, and playing in filthy cabarets or saloons, well, you weren't a lady.6 When her stepfather discovered her playing in the band, Lil's mother checked it out and selected Tubby Hall as her daughter's protector/chapero n. At one point, Sidney Bechet came through Chicago with Mack's Merrymakers and joined the Deluxe band for a time. Eventually, the band moved across the street to the Dreamland, where Freddy Keppard replaced Sugar Johnny. Wh en the band broke up, Lil stayed on as the house pianist for the Dreamland. When Joe King Oliver brought his band to the Dreamland in 1920, he was met by a New Orleans style pianist who had never set foot in New Orleans. While she admired Oliver, she also recalled resenting that he didn't allow her to solo. She often A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 127 told how he would tell her, We already have a clarinet in the band, when she would make too many runs. Even though piano professors or ticklers like Jelly Roll Morton were known for their solo pianistics, the piano players in New Orleans -style bands were expected to play the correct chords loudly enough for improvisers to hear them and take off on their own collectively improvised flights. Jeffrey Taylor has made an excellent case for developing appropriate a esthetic standards for evaluating this sort of piano style, since it tends to be ignored, or even denigrated in jazz criticism, yet was precisely what New Orleans jazz band leaders sought when hiring a pianist.7 When King Oliver went to the west coast on his ill -fated 1921 tour, he took Lil as his pianist. After six months, she be came discouraged by the lack of work, and jumped at an offer to return to Dreamland to play with violinist Mae Brady , another Chicago - based band -leader who worked with New Orleans musicians . Bertha Gonsoulin replaced Lil on Oliver's West Coast tour . When Oliver returned to Chicago in 1923, he opened at the Royal Garden with Gonsoulin on piano. Soon after Louis Armstrong came up from New Orleans to play second cornet, Lil rejoined the band and Gonsoulin went home. In one of his many memoirs, Louis descri bed Lil's playing in Oliver's band, I particularly enjoyed Lil that night, with that four (4) beats to the bar -for a woman, I thought she was really wonderful. She got her training from Joe Oliver, Freddie Keppard, Sugar Johnny ... in fact all of the pio neers from New Orleans.8 Elsewhere, he wrote, She was the best. She would give out with that good ol' New Orleans 4 beats which a lot of the Northern piano players couldn't do to save their lives.9 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 128 In April 1923, Lil recorded with King Oliver on Gennett. In 1924, Lil and Louis married. Her role in advising Louis to leave Oliver for Fletcher Henderson's band is another jazz legend, with Lil often represented as domineering , as have so many strong women in jazz history and e lsewhere . On numerous occasions, Louis spoke and wrote of his gratitude for Lil's advice, while chastising the critics who would make him appear hen -pecked. I listened very carefully when Lil told me to always play the lead. Play second trumpet to no one. They don't come great enough. And she proved it. Yes, sir, she proved that she was right, didn't she? You're damn right she did. The guys who called me hen -pecked -all the time they did. I know. They were broke all the time and I always had a p ocket full of money. When Lil spoke, that was it. And I don't regret it today. That was all the indication that the woman was in my corner at all times.10 While Louis was with Henderson in New York, Lil formed her own band, called Lil's Hot Shots. Louis returned to Chicago, and joined Lil's Hot Shots in 1925. The band record ed and played mostly in Chicago. You can imagine how glad that I was to join my wife Lil and her fine band. She had a damn good band. To me, it was better than Fletcher's. That's right.11 Lil's Hot Shots is the band that made the legendary recordings as Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives and Hot Sevens in 1925 through 1927. She sang and played on many of the cuts, and wrote much of the repertoire for these historic sessions. In 1926, a Columbia Reco rds executive asked Lil to put together a band and record with them. He asked her to write three numbers and for Louis to write three numbers. Lil wrote all six arrangements, but for the agreement with Columbia, put Louis's name on three of them. She fo rmed the New Orleans Wanderers band to A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 129 record the six tunes. The personnel consisted of George Mitchell (cornet), Kid Ory (trombone), Johnny Dodds (clarinet), Johnny St. Cyr (banjo). When the sides were released, the composition credits in Louis's name w ere enlarged to make it as though Louis Armstrong was playing on them. Louis was furious. Lil and Louis separated in 1931, and eventually divorced, though th ey continued to be close friend s until Louis's death in 1971. Lil continued to study music thr oughout her ear ly career. She earned a teaching degree from the Chicago Musical College in 1928, and studied at the New York College of Music. Lil had several bands in New York, including an all -woman band in 1932 that performed at the Apollo. Olivia Sh ipp, a bass player from New Orleans, and founder of the Negro Women's Orchestral and Civic Association in New York, supplied many of the excellent jazz musicians for this group, including Alma Long Scott (saxophone), Leora Meoux Henderson and Do lly Jones H utchinson (trumpets)12 In the late 1930s she led an otherwise all-male band that recorded with Decca. Sadly, no recordings exist of her all-woman group. In the 1940s, she returned to Chicago, where she continued to play the piano , but also beca me a fashion designer. In 1961 she ap peared on a TV -show, entitled, Chicago and All That Jazz (which is available on video and also includes a performance of the aforementioned Mae Brady). In August, 1971, she died of a heart attack while playing St. Louis Blues at a memorial for Louis Armstrong, who had died seven weeks previously. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 130 Notes 1 The 1900 Census lists her as two -years old, while the Social Security death index lists her birth yea r as 1902; I'm inclined to belie ve the former. 2 Lillian Hardin Armstrong, Oral History, July 1, 1959.

September 19, 1887 (Chattanooga, TN) / d. July 10, 1972 (Chicago, IL) Though Lovie Austin never lived in New Orleans, and in fact, spent most of her life in Chicago, she is an important figure in New Orleans jazz history. She is central to the history of recorded New Orleans jazz, as well as that of the broader music industry that arose in the dynamic movements of musicians and audiences between New Orleans and Chicago in the 1920s. Between 1910 and 1920, the African American population in Chicago increased from forty thousand to over a hundred thousand, with the largest numbers of black migrants traveling by rail from the Mississippi Delta.1 With them traveled tastes and markets for southern black culture, including urban and modern southern black culture that symbolized hopes for improved living and working conditions of black migrants in the inter-war years. As a primary representative of urban, modern, southern culture, New Orleans jazz expressed the hopes of many southern migrants who sought opportunities in Chicago, while maintaining cultural and kinship ties to the south. Like New Orleans, Chicago is a city with a long jazz history , yet which is associated with a particular style and period. \"Chicago\" and \"New Orleans,\" as jazz styles, hail bounded periods of time , particular sets of players, and kinds of music, that are, of course, not the only music played even in those cities during those periods. It is A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 140 important to note that while a \"Chicago style\" developed in the 1920s, that this term has been primarily associated with the young, w hite musicians of Chicagos Austin High Gang, and is not used to describe the New Orleans style of music that was popular in Chicago in the late teens and early 1920s. New Orleans jazz in 1920s Chicago was often played by African American and Creole of color New Orleans migrants, or people influenced by them. The active travel route of musicians from New Orleans to Chicago also meant that these migrants appeared on many of the releases of the \"race records\" division of Chicagos booming recording industry . New Orleans musicians who recorded in Chicago exerted a powerful influence on musicians and audiences for whom records were becoming a primary avenue of musical experience.2 Tennessee-born Lovie Austin was a pivotal figure at this rich juncture of jazz , migration, and new technology that links Chicago and New Orleans. Born Cora Calhoun in 18873, she received the nickname, \"Lovie,\" fr om her grandmother. Her father, Professor Calhoun, was \"a great musician, and a teacher in New York,\" she told William Russell, but she grew up in Chattanooga.4 According to some sources, Bessie Smith, the future \"Empress of the Blues,\" who was several years younger than Austin, spent part of her childhood growing up in the same household, or at least in nearby households.5 In an interview with William Russell, Austin said, \"Bessie Smith lived right next door to me. She was raised in my mothers house. We were raised together.\"6 In any case, they were close by enough as girls, that they would sneak through an alley and listen to Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey sing in a th eater, Austin told Chris Albertson.7 In her interview with Russell, she recalled sitting with Bessie Smith outside a carnival where A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 141 Ma and Pa Rainey were performing, since the girls did not have the money to go in.8 Both would grow up to have musical careers that touched that of their idol -Smith singing in traveling shows with Rainey -and Austin as the band leader and pianist on Raineys first eight recordings. The first of these was written by Austin, as well, entitl ed \"Bad Luck Blues.\"9 Many of the songs Austin wrote and recorded on Paramount in the 1920s, Bessie Smith would later record on Columbia. Cora \"Lovie\" Calhoun graduated from high school in Chattanooga, then went to Roger Williams College in Nashville. When the school burned down, she continued her studies at Knoxville College. Fisk University may seem a more obvious choice for an African American college woman wishing to study music, but, as Austin told William Russell, the reason she didnt go to Fisk, was because Fisk was affiliated with the Congregational Church, and her family was Baptist. She married a trombonist/cornet player by the name of Dudley10, and, together, they bought and ran a vaudeville theater. This marriage ended in divorce, after which she married a vaudeville entertainer by the surname of Austin. Joining her new husband on the road as the piano accompanist of his team act \"Austin and Delaney,\" Lovie Austin traveled the black vaudeville circuit known as TOBA (Theater Owners Booking Association) that was so grueling it was also known as \"Tough on Black Actors.\"11 Even after she had based herself in Chicago, Austin would sometimes take off on traveling shows, with acts such as the Sunflower Girls and her own band, the Blues Serenaders. The mobility of TOBA work put black performers in contact with one another, and with black audiences all over the country, and it is likely that Austin met and heard New A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 142 Orleans musicians on these circuits. When she settled in Chicago, her close association with traveling musicians continued as part of her long-term position as house pianist, musical director, and leader of the pit orchestra of the Monogram Theater, a major vaudeville theater. Austin told William Russell that she began her twenty-five years at the Monogram Theater in 1913. When she started at the Monogram it was located at 31st Street, then she moved with the theater to its new location at 35th. It was while working at the Monogram that she befriended New Orlean s \"piano professor\" Jelly Roll Morton. \"When Jelly first came there,\" she told Russell, \"he was with a little show- Billy Mack and Mary Mack, from New Orleans. Mary Mack always carried a little four-piece band with her show, and Jelly played in this band. \"12 Billy and Mary Mack (shortened from McBride) had a traveling show from 1908- 1959 which they called \"Mack and Mack,\" not to be confused with \"Macks Merry Makers\" (which was led by Thomas Mack, a trumpet player from New Orleans). Their specialty was New Orleans music. Mary McBride (nee Thacker) was born in Algiers, Louisiana, and sang the blues. \"Mack and Mack\" were popular at the Monogram, and wo uld settle in Chicago in the 1930s, as did many other New Orleans musicians that Austin, herself a southern migrant to Chicago, met and worked with on TOBA or while playing for acts at the Monogram and other theaters.13 According to Austin, her friendship and collegiality with Morton included helping him to transcribe the music he had composed in his head and at the piano, but hadnt been able to write down to his satisfaction. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 143 [H]ed come over to my house at 3316 Calumet and stay two or three hours, and I would take his music down on paper. That way he got copies he could have published. He wouldnt trust anybody but me ... He thought I was the finest musician in the world and the best friend he had, and I felt that same way about him.\"14 As in New Orleans, Chicagos South Side of the 1920s was a place where it was not unusual to find women as well respected pianists in jazz bands. In fact, Austin, and Lil Hardin (later Armstrong) held, between them, many of the most prestigious jazz piano jobs in 1920s Chicago: Armstrong at the Dreamland Caf\u00e9 and Royal Gardens and other locales, playing with popular New Orleans groups, including King Olivers Creole Jazz Band. In addition to directing the music at the Monogram for twenty-five years, Austin was the house pianist, arranger, musical director for jazz sessions at Paramount Records (1923-1926), which was, at that time, a virtual clearing house for recordings of black New Orleans musicians.15 Founded in 1917, Chicagos Paramount Records launched its \"race records\" division in 1922, enlisting the services of a black talent scout named Mayo Williams to hire and record black musicians. It was Williams who hired Lovie Austin as a music director, house pianist, and arranger, a move that helped to build Paramounts success as one of the top three \"race records\" companies of the 1920s (along with Okeh and Columbia).16 Before long, Paramount absorbed Black Swan records, the company that had once belonged to W.C Handy, further strengthening its position in the \"race\" market.17 During these years of high demand for Paramount to dominate production of New Orleans style jazz and \"classic blues\" vocals, Lovie Austins wrote music for, played on, and directed massive numbers of recordings that would later be considered A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 144 among the most historically significant recordings of 1920s jazz and blues. For New Orleans jazz musicians living in Chicago, Austi ns presence at Paramount was significant, in that she hired many of them for these influential trio and quartet sessions. Her band, the Blues Serenaders, included, at various times, clarinetist Johnny Dodds, cornetist Tommy Ladnier, and trombonist Kid Or y.18 Ladnier, one of the mainstays of the Serenaders, had studied with Bunk Johnson, and later played with King Oliver. A contemporary of Louis Armstrong, he used a mute and was known as the \"Talking Cornetist.\"19 These small groups were led by Austin, and often played her compositions and orchestrations. They also appeared on many early recordings of what is now known as the \"classic blues,\" in which jazz instrumentalists accompanied blues singers, usually women. The Blues Serenaders were very active in shaping this genre, recording with such singers as Ida Cox, Alberta Hunter, Ma Rainey, and New Orleans vocalist Edna Hicks . Austin composed and co-composed much of the repertoire of the \"classic blues ,\" including \"Downhearted Blues\" which she wrote and recorded with Alberta Hunter, and which was later a hit for Bessie Smith. In his insightful paper, entitled, \"With Lovie and Lil: Rediscovering Two Chicago Pianists of the 1920s,\" Jeffrey Taylor has suggested that accompaniment has been less valued by jazz historians as a desirable skill than it was by jazz musicians during the 1920s, and that different standards need to be adopted in order to appreciate the skills of pianists who were primarily expected to \"comp\" and \"fill\" with the \"correct chords.\" Taylor suggests that while playing the piano in a jazz band was not considered more appropriate for one sex than the other, that \"accompanying\" was considered A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 145 appropriate for female players in early jazz in a way that soloing was not. Soloing, on the other hand, had a different gender trajectory, as the domain of \"piano men, \" \"professors,\" and \"ticklers,\" such as Jelly Roll Morton, who were re -defining the piano from \"sissy\" instrument to ultimate symbol of heteromasculine fraternity in the jazz world. Working toward developing listening practices that can actually hear and appreciate the aesthetics of \"accompanying,\" Taylor described a recording on which Lovie Austin accompanied Butterbeans and Susie., with whom she had also worked at the Monogram Theater. \"What is immediately apparent is the sheer density of Austins style; she is an entire band unto herself. Yet, she never obliterates the featured soloists with technical artifice, as did many other pianists of the time.\"20 After the Paramount job, she continued working as the theater pianist, band leader, and music director for the Monogram Theater, playing for black vaudeville acts, many of whom were the same performers with whom she had recorded. She also managed and played with traveling shows, such as Irving Millers Brown Babies, a nd the Club Alabam show that traveled from New York in the mid-1920s. After the Monogram, she continued to work as a theater pianist in the Gem and Joyland Theaters. Her output during her years at the Monogram and Paramount was remarkable -she not only played constantly, but she wrote the music, and directed the bands. The great pianist and composer/arranger Mary Lou Williams remembered being inspired by Lovie Austin when she saw her as a young girl, drawing inspiration from the veteran pianist, composer/arranger, band leader. You can imagine my surprise and thrill to see a woman sitting in the pit with four A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 146 or five other male musicians, with her legs crossed, cigarette in her mouth, playing the show with her left hand and writing music with her right had for the next act to come on the stage. And was she a master of conducting the music.21 Austin worked as an inspector in a navy plant during World War II, but was back working as pianist for the Penthouse studios, home of Jimmy Paynes dancing school in Chicago, in the late 1940s. Austins correspondence with George Hoefer in the 1950s tells the sad and sadly common story of not being paid royalties due her for her Paramount recordings. Turning to Hoefer, who had written a feature about her in Down Beat (June 16, 1950, p. 11), Austin explained that she had received royalties of 25% regularly until the death of the owner of Paramount records, at which time, the reissues continued, but payments ceased, and the new owner even passed along the rights to other record companies.22 In 1961, she came out of retirement to be recorded with her old friend Alberta Hunter, by Chris Albertson for Riverside Records for the \"Chicago-The Living Legends\" series. She died at the age of 84 in 1972.

I have been trying to pin-point the period in which Lovie Austin and Bessie Smith could have lived in the same household. The 1900 US Census for Tennessee, shows Bessie Smith, reported as age 7, living with her own mother and seven siblings in Chattanooga. In 1910, she appears at age 16, living in a household on State Street in Chattanooga with her sister Viola Smith, and Violas daughter, Laura. She most certainly could have lived with Lovie Austin and her grandmother at some point between Census years, but I have been unable to verify this. 6 Lovie Austin, Oral History, April 25, 1969, Reel I, Summary, 14, Hogan Jazz Archive. 7 Chris Albertson, liner notes, \"Alberta Hunter With Lovie Austin and Her Blues Serenaders,\" Chicago: The Living Legends (Riverside RLP 418), 1961. 8 Lovie Austin, Oral History, April 25, 1969, Reel I, Summary, 14, Hogan. 9 Lieb, Mother of the Blues , 193. 10 I have not determined whether this is his first or last name. 11 According to an unidentified note in the vertical files at the Institute for Jazz Studies, \"one of her first professional jobs was with the Dudley Serenaders in Norfolk, Virginia.\" 12 William Russell, \"Oh, Mister Jelly\" A Jelly Roll Morton Scrapbook (Denmark: JazzMedia Aps, 1999), 351. 13 Russell, \"Oh, Mister Jelly,\" 342-344. 14 Russell, \"Oh, Mister Jelly ,\" 352.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 158 Louisa \" Blue Lu\" Barker (nee Louisa Josephine Dupont [Louise] [Lu Blue]) (blues singer, song writer) b. November 13, 1913 (New Orleans, Louisiana) / d. May 7, 1998 (New Orleans, Louisiana) Louisa Dupont, better known in her later years as Blue Lu Barker, was bo rn in New Orleans on November 13, 1913, to August Dupont and Louisa Hurley Dupont, both of whom were also born in New Orleans. In her oral history, she told bassist Milt Hinton, \"My mother is half -Irish and my father is half -French. Hes Negro and French , and my mother is Negro and Irish.\"1 During Duponts childhood in the neighborhoods of Treme and Gentilly, h er father sold bootleg whiskey from the small businesses he ran, which included, at various times, a grocery store, a pool hall, and a candy store. Her mother worked for the post office as a custodian. \"My cousin Clarice was working for some people, and they gave her a piano,\" she explained when asked how so many poor black people were able to obtain pianos in those days.2 Clarices place turned out to be too small to house the piano , so, by default, it wound up belonging to the Duponts. The family enjoyed music and had a number of amateur and professional musician relatives, friends, and neighbors who regularly came to the Dupont household to play music. Musician -relatives included Lus cousins , clarin etist Joseph Thomas, and drummer, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 159 Erthy Lazard.3 In a 1991 interview, Barker credited her mother with starting her along on her performance career. \"My mother had all these blues records, and we had this big armoire with mirrors on each side, and shed get on one side and Id get on the other and shed show me what to do.\"4 These blues practice sessions with her mother launched Louisa to local fame, when, at the age of seven, she became popular for singing bawdy lyrics that she didnt actually understand at neighborhood events, amateur contests, and parties. As she approache d puberty, her mother had second thoughts about her pre -adolescent daughter being known for such repertoire as \"Ive Got Everything that a Woman Needs to Make a Good Man Fall.\" She instructed her daughter to sing off key at rehearsals in order to emphasiz e her dancing abilities.5 This she did, and as a dancer, she worked with a semi -professional troupe called the Merrymake rs, with whom she performed at balls at the San Jacinto Club, the Lyons Club, and the Pelican Club. Her singing, however, is what remained in peoples minds. That very combination for which she was popular as a child -the sexual double -entendre lyrics, and an ironic and humorous delivery that inspired listeners to speculate as to whether or not she was aware of their double -meanings --became her trademark throughout her sixty year career. As columnist Lolis Eric Elie put it, \"Even though she sang those bawdy songs, she never gave the impression that she was the type of woman to hang out in places where they played songs like that.\"6 Banjo player Danny Barker, her future husband, found such evaluations insufficient , and instead, later described her as A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 160 a \"sweet, subtle blues singer,\" comparable to Maxine Sullivan.7 Louisa Dupont met Dan ny Barker just weeks after she turned 13, and married him on January 8, 1930, at the age of sixteen. Her new husband was a banjo player and guitarist whose career was taking off -and taking him away from New Orleans as well. Like Louisa, Danny also came f rom a musical family, including his grandfather, alto horn player Isidore John Barbarin, his grandfathers cousin, blues singer Esther Bijou, and his uncle (Isidores son), drummer Paul Barbarin. When Paul Barbarin, offered Danny a job in his band in New York, Louisa followed a month later, clutching her childhood doll, wrapped in newspaper, on her lap. As she told Elizabeth Mullner, the doll literally spoke to her own homesickness. \"When you turned it over, it said mama.\"8 She never sto pped thinking of New Orleans as her home, and the feeling was mutual. Even though she left Louisiana at the age of 16 and lived in New York and California throughout most of her recording career, \"Blue Lu\" Barker never ceased to be considered a New Orlean s singer. When her mother became ill in 1966, she and Danny would return to live in New Orleans. In New York, it took awhile for Louisas career to launch. While Danny Barker played guitar for major bands led by Lucky Millinder, Benny Carter, and Cab Ca lloway, Louisa Barker stayed home and cooked New Orleans style meals for displaced New Orleans musicians in the Harlem apartment they shared with Henry \"Red\" Allen and Paul Barbarin and their wives. At one point they lived with blues singer Lizzie Miles. She cooked up the tastes of home for countless New York -based New Orleaneans, with the agreement that the people she fed would do their own dishes. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 161 In 1935, Louisa and Danny Barker had their first and only child, Sylvia. And in 1938, Louisas professiona l singing career began in earnest. That year, she recorded \"A Tisket, A Tasket\" with Hammond organ on Vocalion. This led to a series of 24 -sides on a Decca contract, including her hit, \"Dont You Feel My Leg,\" a title that was deemed too risqu\u00e9 and chang ed to \"Dont You Make Me High.\" Even so, the song proved too shocking for the times. Yet, despite being literally pulled off the presses, it became her best known recording. It was at Decca when she began working under the name of Blue Lu Barker. She a ppeared at Kellys Stable on 52nd Street that year, and entered an active recording schedule that would lead to a total of 24 sides on Decca, followed by sessions on Apollo Records, followed by a contract with Capitol in the 1940s. After 36 years away fro m New Orleans, the couple moved back in 1966 when Sylvia was an adult and Blue Lus mother was ill. They formed a band, known as the Jazz Hounds, and worked locally, including regular appearances at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival from 1974 throu gh 1989, when health conditions forced her to retire. Blue Lus last performance was, in fact, the New Orleans Jazz Festival performance in 1989, which was recorded. The Barker s last years were full of honors. Blue Lus 74th birthday was celebrated wit h an hour -long special on her life and career on WWOZ -Radio, produced by an all -woman radio crew .9 Other honors include the Walk of Fame in front of Tippitinas Music Hall, the Henrietta DeLille Award, the Loyola University Presidents Medal, an award from the Treme Cultural Enrichment Program, three Lifetime Music Achievement Awards, awards from Offbe at Magazin e, the Big Easy, and the Amista d A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 162 Research Center, New Orleans Magazine s Jazz All -Star Award, African American Cultural Arts Awards, Gyarre School for Jazz Awareness, and a State of Louisiana award for outstanding contributions to Louisiana music . In 1991, she was honored for her contribution to jazz by St. Marys Academy, in 1991 with a performance featuring many New Orleans women musicians, including Germaine Bazzle, Marva Wright, and Charmaine Neville.10 Blue Lu and Danny Barker were married for 64 years. The New Orleans City Council honored them by declaring January 13, 1994 \"Blue Lu and Danny Barker Day.\" Danny Barker died in March 1994. Blue Lu Barker died of cancer four years later at the age of 84. She had a jazz funeral, with Wanda Rouzan presiding as Grand Marshal.

January 28, 1983 (Metaire, Louisiana) SWEET EMMA Former Pianist of the Old Original Tuxedo Band RINGING HER BELLS And Spanking the Ivories with Dixieland Jazz, at its best. Phone HU. 8 -1636, New Orleans, La.2 Business card, Sweet Emma Barrett One of the best known and most recognizable New Orleans musicians, with her ubiquitous red beanie and the signature bells that jingled from her garters as she stomped and played the piano, was Sweet Emma Barrett, whose sixty -year career began with Oscar Papa Celestin in the 1920s, and ended with a three -nights -a-week gig at Preservation Hall that lasted a quarter of a century. Sweet Emma, also known as the Bell Gal, became almost synonymous with the crowded French Quarter room dedicated to the preservation of traditional jazz as a living art. She granted one interview in 1968, from which much of this report is drawn.3 Most accounts agree that Emma Barrett was born in the Spring, though it is less clear if the month was March or April, or if the year was 1897 or 1898. Varying dates A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 169 appear, not only in secondary sources, but in public records. S he was named for her mother, Emma (nee Kennedy) Barrett. Her father, Captain William B. Barret t, was said to have fought for the North in the Civil War, and was a politician, and a Louisiana State senator. When Barrett was growing up, her father worked at the Custom House. She lived with her parents, seven brothers, and two sisters at 516 South D orgenois Street, in the Tulane/Gravier neighborhood of the Mid -City District, just south of Treme. She recalled a band led by a musician named Ulysses that rehearsed in her neighborhood as one of her first musical influences. We have seen that in turn-of-the-century New Orleans, piano -playing daughters were considered sign s of respectability and upward mobility for middle -class white, black, and Creole families.4 In that tradition, Captain Barrett bought a piano for Emma's older sister, but it was Emma who was drawn to the instrument . At age seven, she began teaching herself; or, as she put it, I just started pla ying.5 She began taking music lessons from the well -known music teacher, Professor Nickerson, father of Camille Nickerson, at his home on Galva Street.6 Even with this formal training behind her, during her career Barrett was never known as a reading musician, but rather one with a keen ear, a comprehensive knowledge of chords, excellent transposing skills (necessary for encountering pianos that were frequently out -of-tune), strong hands, and an infallible sense of time -not bad for a pianist who claimed not to practice. As sh e told Allen Jaffe, People never could understand how I learned to play so good because I never did practice or like to play in my house. But I always liked to go out to other places and play. In the same interview, she said that she started playing in bands at A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 170 the age of twelve.7 By most accounts, her first professional job was with Oscar \"Papa\" Cele stin's and Bebe Ridgeley's co -led Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra in the early 1920s, though there must have been many earlier jobs in the decade between when she said she started playing in bands and when she joined Celestin and Ridgely. Percy Humphrey recalled tha t before she joined the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, she played with a band at the Peking Temple Roof Garden.8 In any case, she was playing ear ly enough for William Russell to claim that she was one of the first known jazz pianists from New Orleans.9 Barrett, who would have been in her early twenties when she began playing with the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, recalled that Celestin promised her mother he would make sure she got home alright, and that he would pick her up and bring her back.10 This is the same arrangement Celestin would later make with Jeanette Salvant [Kimball]'s mother, after Celestin and Ridgely parted ways. The history of the Original Tuxedo Orchestra is important for following the Barrett's career in the 1920s. Trumpet player/cornetist Oscar Papa Celestin led a group at the short -lived Tuxedo Dance Hall in Storyville in 1910, but this was not the same as the Original Tuxedo Orchestra, which was co -founded in 1917 by Celestin and trombonist William Bebe Ridgely. By the 1920s, the co -led Original Tuxedo Orchestra was pursuing what were called society engagements, such as debutante balls. It is during this period that Barrett auditioned for the band and was hired, perhaps also marking a shift in the band's bookings in environments that increased the social acceptability of a female pia no player. She recorded with this band in 1925.11 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 171 Dissension within the group resulted in a split in the band in the mid -1920s. Many of the musicians, including Barrett, followed William \"Bebe\" Ridgely, who kept the name, Original Tuxedo Orchestra. Celestin formed a new band called the Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra, hiring Jeanette Salvant (later Kimball) as his pianist. Barrett stayed with Ridgely' s Original Tuxedo Orchestra until 1936. During these years, Barrett also played with numerous other bands including those led by Sidney Desvigne, John Robichaux, and A.J. Piron. She also played on the steam ships or steamers that traveled the river, in cluding the S.S. Sidney and the S.S. Capitol . On one of these excursions, she is said to have played with Louis Armstrong.12 Though this fact could not be confirmed, it is highly plausible, since she and Armstrong would have been in town at the same time, and traveled in overlapping circles.13 She played in small groups throughout the 1940s. In the 1950s, she became the Bell Gal when the owner of the Paddock Lounge on Bourbon Street suggested that she accentuate the rhythm she kept with her feet by wearing garters around her legs with bells a ttached. It was also around this time that she acquired the name Sweet Emma. Some accounts have her receiving this name because of her sweet disposition; others attribute it to irony -she was famous for being cantankerous, for charging for autographs, t hrowing water at people who tried to take her picture. As Barrett herself told one reporter who tried to learn her full name, Sweet Emma, the Bell Girl, is what everybody calls me ... and that's the way I like it.14 Throughout the 1950s she continued playing with small groups, making several records. She joined the band of trumpet player Percy Humphrey; then he joined hers, when in 1961, she became a band leader at Preserva tion Hall. Preservation Hall was, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 172 and still is, the labor of love of devoted jazz fans. It was established quite literally in order to preserve early jazz, and to provide a place for older jazz musicians to work. The history of Preservation Hall canno t be separated from the roots and folk music revival of the 1960s, nor can it be separated from Emma Barrett, who became a kind of mascot for the hall, as well as one of its most popular drawing cards. Barrett's knowledge of traditional music, as well as her famous eccentricities (she distrusted airplanes, banks, and doctors), found an affectionate home among the revivalists, who sought meaning in cultural expressions of earlier times, and who were equally ambivalent about modern technology and institution s.15 1961 was a momentous year for Barrett. Not only did she begin her important relationship with Preservation Hall as a band leader and one of its most popular artists, but she was recorded by a mobile unit from the Riverside label, which featured her on a two-disk set, New Orleans: The Living Legend (Riverside 356/7; stereo 9356/7). These recordings powerfully helped to stir national and international interest in living New Orleans jazz artists who still played earlier styles. As John S. Wilson pointed out, by concentrating on artists in New York and Chicago, the recording industry had perpetuated the misconception that jazz completely evacuated New Orleans in 1917.16 The Riverside disks did not portray jazz in New Orleans as cutting edge, or as modern, but rather as a living link with a colorful and timeless past. Again, Barrett's eccentricities , as well as her strong playing, occupied the attention of critics. Ralph Gleason noted that during the recording session, Barrett couldn't feel inspired until she went home and came back wearing her red beanie, garters, and bells.17 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 173 Critics could not help but write about Barrett's oddity, and the stories about her make it easy to see why. It is unfortunate however, that we know so much more about her as a character, than as a musician. We know that she kept her life savings in a bag, rather than a bank. Just before Christmas, 1961, this bag -and its contents of $2,500 -were stolen by a man who offered to help her to cross the street. She told the police she was carrying her life savings with her because she didn't trust banks.18 The jazz commun ity held a benefit concert for her at the Royal Orleans Hotel, charging only a donation to Sweet Emma, and raising $1,000.19 Unfortunately, most of that money was stolen from her two months later.20 She still trusted her bag more than a bank. Drummer Bob French was sometimes sent by his father Albert Papa French to pick up Emma and her wheel chair and bring her to Preservation Hall. He remembered that she would carry a sandwich with her, and wou ld eat it on her break. The break, of course, was also when fans that had come from all over the world to hear her play, would approach her for her autograph. She would demand five dollars.21 Her fear of flying made travel difficult, but the popularity of the Preservation Hall band brought opportunities such as a 1964 booking at Disneyland.22 Allen and Sandra Jaffe, prop rietors of Preservation Hall, arranged for her to take the train. Fear of flying may have complicated bookings, but it endeared her to many fans of traditional jazz. She became a favorite of the New Orleans Jazz Club who had her play for their Jazz on Sunday Afternoon concert series at the Royal Orleans Hotel.23 When she backed out of a concert scheduled at a Preservation Hall in Memphis, fans forgave her because she had a funeral to play that day, and a funeral is just something she can' t A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 174 miss.24 She played all sorts of bookings throughout the 1960s. In April 1965, her band played for the maiden voyage of an oil tanker.25 She played many benefits, for instance, a concert for Charity Hospital in April, 1965.26 She was plagued by health problems in the later 1960s. On February 16, 1966, the New Orleans Times -Picayune reported that Barrett had \"dropped a sizeable cake of ice on her foot.\"27 The next month, at a New Orleans Jazz Club meeting, Richard Allen noticed that her badly swollen legs were wrapped in bandages.28 She refused to go to a doctor. In January of 1967, her son, Ricard Alexis, (whose father was the trumpet player and bass player Ricard Alexis, but who Barrett had raised alone) tricked her into going to the doctor for her leg by telling her that if she didn't, he would have her committed. She complied and indeed, the doctor found that her leg was abscessed. Two days later, she suffered a stroke that left her para lyzed on her left side.29 Barrett had helped to organize an annual Jazz Jamboree benefit for the Heart Fund, and had, in fact, played at all four of the annual programs. So, in light of her stroke, the fifth Jazz Jamboree was dedicated to her.30 She was never able to regain the use of her right hand, but even this blow did not keep her from the piano. That winter, her return to the piano was described by jazz fan Helen Arlt, a president of the New Orleans Jazz Club, and printed in Thomas Griffin's Lagniappe column in the States -Item. It seems that while a Baptist church choir was singing at a Christmas party at the hospital, Emma had been persuaded to play a one- handed piano selection. The accompanist for the choral group played the bass and Sweet Emma played the treble. Together, they performed a repertoire of traditional A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 175 material, such as The Saints, and Didn't He Ramble. According to Arlt, Emma s aid that she surprised herself with what she was able to do.31 On March 4, 1968, the Time's Picayune announced that Sweet Emma was planning her return to public performance. She would played for the Heart Fund Jazz Jamboree, the first time she has played publicly since her lengthy career was curtailed by a stroke two years ago.32 After she played the benefit, she returned to Preservation Hall, and continued to play very strong one -handed piano from her wheelchair, three nights a week for the next 15 years. This includes, actually, a two year period when she took her services to another club run by revivalists, Dixieland hall. Barrett, angered by Allen Jaffe's opinion that due to her fragile health, she should play two nights a week instead of three, played at Dixieland Hall from 1969 to 1971. When that club went under, Barrett played a closing -night When the Saints Go Marching In, then returned, once again, to Preservation Hall , where she played three nights a week as much as she could until her death.33 At the Hogan Jazz Archive is a long list of song titles covering two sides of a sheet of paper. Under the heading, Songs that are the Big Hits, Sweet Emma listed shortened titles of her most requested numbers: Bill Bailey, Basin Street, St. Louis Blues, Bourbon Street, None of My Jelly Roll, Good man's Hard to Find, Sister Kate, Closer Walk, and dozens more.34 Her style has been described as strong, rhythmic, and as delivering the powerful and accurate foundation of chords, even when transposing to keep in tune with tonically -wandering bands -important skills in early New Orleans band styles that A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 176 featured collective improvisation. Said William Russell, For such a small lady, she had tremendous power. She sat on a low stool and in her later year s, a wheelchair with her hands no higher than her arms, yet she got all that power in there.35 On January 18, 1983, Barrett played her last engagement at Prese rvation Hall. She died ten days later at the age of 85. At her request, there will be no jazz funeral, said her son, Ricard Alexis.36 Twenty years after her death, she is still one of the most popular musicians at Preservation Hall, recalled in photographs, recordings, and stories. In August, 2001, she was commemorated in an art exhibit at the New Orleans African American Museum of Art. S aid curator Lolet Boutte, We are always recognizing these male trumpet players ... but little attention has been given to some of the females.37 Notes 1 Most sources have March 25, 1898, as her birth date, but the 1900 and 1910 US Census reports list the April 1, 1897 date. To complicate matters , the Social Security Death Index states her birth date as April 25, 1897. 2 Emma Barrett's business cards, MSS 536, cards, f. 140.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 187 Wilhelmina Bart de Rouen (pianist) b. circa 1900 (New Orleans, Louisiana) / d. October 21, 1969 (New Orleans, Louisiana) Little information has been published on Wilhelmina Bart de Rouen, though books and oral histories about New Orleans jazz musicians often contain fleeting mentions of her as a pianist who worked in New Orleans bands from the mid -late 1920s . Al Rose and Edmond Souchon estimated her birth year to be around 1900 , and claim ed that early in her career she worked with clarinetist Jimmy Noo ne.1 She also appears on Rose's list of \" jazz musicians who performed in the legally constituted tenderloin district known as Storyville between January 1, 1898 and November 17, 1917.\"2 Biographical data is scarce. Her parents were Madeline D'Hemecourt and William A. Bart.3 Emanuel Sayles remembered that she lived on Annette Street, near Claiborne, in the Seventh Ward, in the 1920s.4 Guitarist and banjo player Danny Barker rec alled that he was a child when he first encountered Bart in the early 1920s, and that she was \"a prominent jazz pianist, a lady much respected in the downtown Creole French (colored) section of New Orleans.\" She, in fact, hired Barker's childhood band, th e Boozan Kings, to play a concert at the elite Creole of color meeting place, the Francs Amis Hall, in the Seventh Ward. \"Playing A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 188 for Mrs. Bart and at the exclusive Francs Amis was quite an achievement for the novelty band.\"5 \"Much respected,\" as Bart may have been, Barker's own opinions about her seem to have been mixed . In his oral with Milt Hinton, he said that Bart grossly underpa id the Bouzan Kings ; after charg ing 25 or 35 c ents admission , she paid the boys a dollar fifty each when it was over, making a large profit since \"[i]t was a great big hall.\"6 Barker cited this disappointment as the impetus for leaving his boyhood band for more professional jobs -yet, Bart was the pianist at Barker's first professional job in Willie Pajeaud's band at the Alamo Dance Hall. Samuel Charters quotes Barker a s saying that Bart tended to nod off , eat lunch, and read the paper on the band stand, and sometimes didn't know what tune was being played.7 Barker also told of Bart's habit of \"promptly falling aslee p at eleven p.m., and, at times snoring louder than the band.\"8 In 1925, Bart was the pianist for the New Orleans Creole Jazz Band, o rganized by cornetist Amos White, a band that also included Barney Bigard and played at Old Spanish Fort, a popular resort since the 1800s, on Lake Pontchartrain. Charters includes this cryptic mention: \"There was union trouble and somebody threw a stink bomb at Willa, but the orchestra played through the summer.\"9 In 1927, she was at the Alamo Dance Hall on Burgundy and Canal, as the pianist in Willie P ajeaud's band . When Danny Barker left this band , George Guesnon took his place. He r emembered that the job was \"tough.\" The proprietor would say, \"Don't let me hear the echo of the last piece die out before you pick up another one.\" He also remembered that the job lasted from nine until three. Guesnon recalled Bart as a \"good, strong p iano player\"10 Alex Bigard recalled playing with her in Willie Pajaud's band at the Alamo.11 Lester A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 189 Santiago also remembered Bart from the Alamo.12 She was never recorded. A hand -written note in the vertical files at the Hogan Jazz Archive indicates that around 1960, she was living in Lacombe, Louisiana.13 She died in 1969.

When her sisters, Martha and Helvetia married and retired from their singing careers, Connie continued on with her own successful solo career, changing the spelling of her name to Connee in 1941.1 Less known, but of great interest to this study, is the local fame and musical contributions of Connie Boswell and her sisters earlier on, as a singing and instrumental trio in New Orleans in the 1920s. While not born in New Orleans, Connie and her sisters grew up there. The influence of the city's music as can be heard in the unique approach to vocal harmony for which they would become known. Jane Hassinger has written, \"With their inspired phrasing, advanced harmonies, blues intonations, melodic and rhythmic invention, and steadfast refusal to perform a tune just the way it was written, they helped bring Afro - American jazz elements in the mainstream of popular music in the 1930s.\"2 Inspired by instrumental jazz improvisation, which they heard and played in thei r youth, and black vocal styles in blues and gospel, which they heard on record, from street musicians at the French Market, and from the servants in the family home, the Boswell Sisters fused an improvisatory approach to vocal harmony that delighted the j azz musicians with A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 192 whom they played, and inspired singers including the Andrews Sisters (who even copied their Southern accents), Ella Fitzgerald, and Bing Crosby. Before moving to New Orleans, the Boswells lived in Kansas City, Missouri, and briefly in B irmingham, Alabama. Martha and Connie were born in Kansas City, in 1905 and 1907, respectively, and the youngest sister, Helvetia, known as \"Vet,\" was born in Birmingham in 1911. When the family moved to New Orleans in 1914, Vet was 3, Connie was 7, and Martha was 9. The 1920 Census finds the Boswell family living at 3937 Camp Street, in what is known as the Touro Neighborhood, between Uptown and the Garden District.3 The family was comfortably middle -class, with a managerial income, and employed several African American servants, whose singing the sisters would later recall in interviews when asked about their influences.4 Before arriving in New Orleans in 191 4, both Connie and Vet had already begun their training in classical music, expected of young white women of their class and times, and Martha was soon to begin piano lessons. Vet studied violin. Connie, who had contracted polio at the age of three, was given the cello, an instrument she could play from a seated position.5 At an early age (probably 7, though most accounts say 4), she studied with renowned cellist, Otto Finck.6 Connie also studied piano and painting, but never took singing lessons.7 The sisters' training in \"high -brow\" music continued, all excelled, and all three would play in the New Orleans Philharmonic. However, growing up in New Orleans in the teens and 1920s, they were especially drawn to jazz. We are accustomed to seeing historical accounts of young white men in the 1920s being \"bitten by the jazz bug,\" bu t the Boswell sisters give us access to a history A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 193 of young, white women, who found themselves energized and inspired by the new music. Vet picked u p the banjo, violin, and guitar; Connie the alto saxophone and trombone; and Martha \"jazzed up\" her piano style. In interviews, the Boswells often reminisced about jazz musicians jamming in the family home. They enjoyed musical associations with many New Orleans jazz musicians, including cornetist, Emmett Hardy; drummer, Arthur \"Monk\" players, Leon and Louis Prima; and most especially with pianist, bassist and orchestra leader Norman Brownlee.8 In an interview with Jan Shapiro, Vet recalled that she and her sisters \"actually just grew up with music. Well, mostly my mother was great on the piano and so was papa. But then, they had guitars and banjos. They had musical instruments around all the time.\"9 Their parents and aunt and uncle sang in a barbershop quartet, providing the sisters with intimate exposure to close harmonies. While both Boswell parents enjoyed music and encouraged their daughters' talents, it was their mother who supported their des ire to perform jazz in public. Connie recalled that it was her mother who took her to hear Mamie Smith, and other blues singers, in a black theater that held shows for white audiences on Friday nights.10 Connie's singi ng inspirations also included Enrico Caruso. \"I used to sit and listen and be amazed by his breathing. Then I'd try and do what he was doing. I'd take a long breath and hit a lot of notes.\"11 With the encouragement of their mother (and in spite of the discouragement from their father), the Boswell Sisters formed a vocal and instrumental trio and performed A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 194 locally. In 1925, they were recorded by a mobile unit from Victor. \"Nights When I'm Lonely\" and \"I'm Gonna Cry (Crying Blues), \" written by Martha, remain classic s, and an example of what the Boswell's sounded like before traveling on vaudeville. Once they took to the road in 1928, traveling to Chicago and California, they focus ed primarily on their singing. While performing on a radio station in 1929, they were heard by an artists' manager named Harry Leedy, who signed them on. Their recording career would coincide with their becoming almost exclusively a vocal trio, with the except ion of Martha's piano. They landed a contract with Okeh in October 1929. They signed by Brunswick in 1931, after performing at the Paramount Theater, New York, and were national and international stars for the rest of the trio's time together. Once they began performing and recording with big bands, they were no longer accompanied by Martha alone, but by bands and jazz musicians. Their first recording on Brunswick was with the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra. Even as mainstream recording stars, the Boswells were praised by improvisers for their ability to improvise and to foster a creative musical environment of interaction among singers and instrumentalists. John Lucas defended and praised the Boswells in a series of articles he wrote for Downbeat in 1944. He related that the sisters were \"taunted\" for their unconventional harmonies, but that they were supported by many musicians, including Tommy Dorsey. Their approach to harmony taken from jazz improvisation, they didn't write their parts down, but worked them out as head A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 195 arrangements, creating parts so appealing to jazz musicians that instrumentalists sometimes played the Boswell's parts.12 Their approach to lyrics incorporated elements of behind -the-beat jazz phrasing and blue notes. On many of their recordings, they \"emulated the sound of trumpets, trombones, and banjos,\" wrote Jan Shapiro, who observed that the Boswell's style was heard as \"black,\" by audiences, and challeng ed notions of white womanhood in ways that were both disturbing and titillating to white audiences.13 After five years of spectacular success as radio and recording stars, Vet and Martha both left their careers to get married. Connee married, also, to her manager -a marriage that would last nearly forty years -but she did n ot leave her career. During Connie's solo career, she changed the spelling of her name to \"Connee,\" after receiving a fan letter addressed to that spelling in 1941 , while appearing on the Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby.14 In Connee's later career , she worked steadily as a recording and radio star, and supper club entertainer. Her last performance was at Carnegie Hall with Benny Goodman in October 1975. She died of stomach cancer in 1976. In the late 1990s, the Boswell Museum was founded in East Springfield, New York.

April 7, 1914 (New Orleans) / d. August 25, 1994 (Cleveland, Ohio)1 Neliska Briscoe, better known as \"Baby\" Briscoe, was born on April 7, 1914. Her mother was Neliska Thomas, a laundress, whose father was born in Mexico, and mother was born in Louisiana. Thomas was the elder Neliskas maiden name; she had been married to a Joseph Mitchell in 1902. The younger Neliskas siblings, Hardy and Joseph, are listed as Mitchell in the 1930 Census, while their sister i s listed with the surname Briscoe . On Neliska Briscoes birth certificate, her father, Eddie Briscoe (sometimes spelled Brisco), was listed as a \"packer .\" He is listed as a laborer in a fruit orchard on the 1920 Census. This birth certificate also indic ates that Eddie Briscoe and Neliska Thomas were not married, though in the 1920 Census, they are listed as married, and living on 1905 St. Philip Street. In 1920, the household consisted of Eddie Briscoe (head of household), Neliska Briscoe (wife), Hardy Briscoe (son, age 10), and Neliska Briscoe (daughter, age 5).2 Joseph Mitchell Jr. would have been 12 in 1920, but is not listed as living with in this household at this time. The US Census of 1930 indicates that by 1930, Eddie Briscoe was not living with the family , and that the elder Neliska was going by Neliska Mitc hell, and listed as the head of household at 1721 Saint Ann, in the Treme neighborhood, with her two sons, Joseph Mitchell (age 21) and Hardy Mitchell (age 19), her daughter Neliska Briscoe A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 203 (age 16), and a roomer named John Edgarson. According to the 1930 Census, the younger Neliska had been married for one year (to an unknown party). According to Neliska Briscoes daughters, there had also been a sister, Lillian Rand Mitchell, who had died young. At the age of 16, the younger Neliska Briscoe was listed as an \"entertainer,\" a claim that is well supported by newspapers of the day.3 According to Briscoes daughters, Avon Howse and Debra Mouton, their mother began her career at the age of 8 or 9, when her mother, the elder Neliska, took her talented daughter to the Alley Cabaret (Claiborne and St. Bernard) in the Seventh Ward, where another relative was employed, about ten blocks away from their St. Ann Street address. By day, Neliska Thomas Mitchell was employed by St. Anns Church, where she cared for the convent and cooked for the priests and nuns. But after work she would take her daughter to the Alley Cabaret. As the only child entertainer in the floor show, the younger Neliska acquired the stage name, \"Baby\" Briscoe.4 According to banjo player Danny Barker, the Alley was \"a very popular gambling house and cabaret,\" where \"the doors never closed, day or night, while the gambling tables were always occupied by the most renowned hustlers and gamblers in the city. In the rear of the Alley was the cabaret, which stayed open all night, and the band would play as long as there were customers to listen.\" Barker recalled that the jazz band that played the Alley in the summer of 1925 was a \"very good jazz band,\" with Maurice Dumond on cornet, Big Eye Louis Nelson, clarinet, George Henderson, drums, Odette Davis, piano, Wellington Dowdon, banjo, a nd Nelisca (sic) Briscoe sang and entertained.\"5 Briscoe was eleven. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 204 De De Pierce told Bill Russell that his cousin \"Malisca\" [Neliska?] gave hi m his first trumpet when he was 17 and that she played in an all -girl band. If Neliska Briscoe gave De De Pierce a trumpet when he was 17, she would have been seven, but then again, she did begin her career as a child. It also possible that his memory wa s off by a couple years, or that Neliska had acquired a trumpet and had given it to him before her work with all -woman bands began.6 Later on in her career, Briscoe would appear with a trumpet in hand, though I have not been able to confirm whether she played the instrument. By the time she was a teenager, \"Baby\" Briscoe was well -known in New Orleans caba rets as an acrobatic dancer with a dynamic stage presence. A write -up on February 7, 1931 lists \"Baby\" Briscoe as one of the Astoria Cabarets \"regular entertainers,\" along with Myrtle Edwards and \"Green and Daniels.\"7 In May, another article stated that \"Neliska \"Baby\" Briscoe and Hattie Watts are back at the Astoria these days, along with Myrtle Edwards, while Rena and His Hot Eight serenade at each dance.\"8 By December of the same year, the Louisiana Weekly indicated that the artist, \"formerly of the Astoria [South Rampart Street], Entertainers [Franklin near Customhouse/Iberville], Owl, and St. Bernard Alley ca barets of this city,\" was now working in New York. The headlines of this item announced the shocking news: \"Baby Brisco Hurt When Gangsters Shoot Up Cabaret ,\" When gangsters staged their little war Miss Briscoe, in attempting to escape, was hurled by the m against a piano and as a result, has been confined to bed for two weeks. A friend entertainer, [sic] says Neliska was shot in the arm. She did not state, however, where the shooting scene occurred in Smalls Paradise or the other club in which she is e mployed9 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 205 There is a gap at the moment in the chronology of her career between her injury in New York, December, 1931, and her appearance in the ranks of Joe Rob ichauxs Rhythm Boys, the large band that Robichaux brought to the Rhythm club in 1933. I do not yet know when she returned to New Orleans. It is possible that she connected (or reconnected) with Robichaux in New York, where he was recording his small gr oup on Vocalion. When he returned to New Orleans he brought a larger band to the Rhythm Club. This incarnation of Joe Robichauxs Rhythm Boys included three women: Baby Briscoe, vocalist Joan Lunceford (Daisy Lowe), and trumpet player Ann Cooper. Her da nce career began to merge into a band directing career when Joe Robichaux returned from a recording session in New York to enlarge and remake his band for a stint at the New Orleans Rhythm Club. Robichaux, the nephew of the famous band leader, John Robich aux, was a pianist and band leader in his own right. From 1931 -1933, Joe Robichaux led a six -piece band that, according to Rudolph J. Hopf, typified \"the New Orleans sound of the Swing Era -a sound rarely captured on record.\"10 The band recorded five dates on Brunswick (issued on Vocalion) in New York in 1933. Brunswick wanted to hire them as a staff band, but the fact that they were an - out-of-town band created a union complication that could not be overcome.11 When Robichaux reappeared in New Orleans, it was with an expande d 10-piece band, which was soon enlarged to 15 -pieces, and the \"Rhythm Boys\" were no longer an all-male unit. Bassist and tuba player McNeal Breaux recalled, \"When he got back to the Rhythm Club he had the big band: he had Baby Briscoe ... Baby Briscoe -and A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 206 whats this other gal was entertaining with him? He had two girls entertaining, Baby Briscoe and Joan Lunceford.\"12 From photographs and oral histories, it appears that \"Baby\" Briscoe and vocalist Joan Lunceford (whose name Robichaux had changed from Daisy Lowe), and perhaps a third woman, wore tuxedos and \"fronted\" Robichauxs New Orleans Rhythm Boys at the Rhythm Cl ub on Jackson and Derbigny Streets in the mid -1930s. To \"front\" a band is to appear with the band as its director in shows, and to literally entertain in front of it, but without actually rehearsing the band and leading it as would a band director. This was the same band that included female trumpet player Ann Cooper. In his oral history, Robichaux described Briscoe as a \"fine female tap dancer.\"13 In the meantime, in 1935, a drummer by the name of Sylvester Rice was instructed by his father, band leader Eli Rice, to organize an all -woman band (called \"all - girl\" in those days) for his Minneapolis -based talent agency. The band was to be called the Harlem Play Girls and its front was to be Edie Crump. Rice hired the talent and worked with the band for a year. The original personnel included Ernestine \"Tiny\" Davis, Mary Shannon, and Jean Lee (trumpets), Leila Julius (violin at first, then guitar, then trombone), Elizabeth King, Marge Backstop , and Lula Edge, reeds; Pam Moore, violin; Orvella Moore (from Elis band), piano; Marie Backstrom (bass), Sylvester Rice (drums, director), Jean Taylor (front).14 Edie Crump did become the bands director at some point, though Ba by Briscoe would eventually be the bands leader. On March 5, 1938, when the band played New Orleans at Mardi Gras for the Exclusive Bunch Club, there was no mention of Baby Briscoe.15 A Pittsburgh Courier story indicates that Edie A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 207 Crump was still fronting (or leading) the band in May 1938.16 Howard Ryes meticulous research of traveling reports filed at the American Federation of Musicians finds that by June 1938, Crump was out, and Baby Briscoe had become their director. According to Rye, Briscoes tenure with the Harlem Playgirls lasted until July 1940.17 A November 1938 story in the Pittsburgh Courier stated that the Harlem Play Girls were appearing in Cleveland and \"are now doing great work under the direction of Baby Briscoe, versatile and flashy New Orleans band leader.\" The story continued, Formerly appearing with Joe Robichaux, Lil Armstrong, the Five Joy Clouds, the Four Coeds, and Troy Brown, Miss Briscoe has a great wealth of experience on the road. Miss Briscoe is rounding out her first year with the all -girls band and has enjoyed tremendous successes as the bands leader. Her ability to keep the girls in the groove while swinging out with their hot numbers, has won her a good reputation as a ba nd leader. In addition to directing, \"Baby\" Briscoe will soon play trumpet. For sometime now she has been studying the trumpet and will soon be heard blowing that instrument.\"18 Whether Briscoe actually played trumpet in performance is not yet known, though she did use it as a prop, according to her daughters. In later years, she would learn to play the alto saxophone. The Harlem Play Girls were in New York in time to play the 1938 Thanksgivin g show at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem.19 The Harlem Playgirls was a touring band, but with Briscoe at the helm, the bands New Orleans appearances became major events . The Louisiana Weekly , in January 1939, announced the bands forthcoming visit. Composed of 11 artists, and led by Babe Briscoe, New Orleans' dancing star, the famous aggregation always scores a hit here with Crescent City dance lovers, and the appearanc es at the San Jacinto Auditorium and the Tick Tock Tavern, Saturday and Sunday nights, respectively, are expected to pack 'em in, coming as an opening attraction of a gay Carnival season.20 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 208 The San Jacinto appearance was for a dance, sponsored by the Unique Club.21 Then they were back on the road, but back at the T ick Tock in April 1939. The holiday spirit will prevail again at the Tick Tock Tavern Easter Sunday and Monday when stellar dance entertainment is offered. On Sunday, during the day, there will be the usual matinee with plenty good music from 4:00 p.m. un til 9:00 p.m. Easter Sunday night the Harlem Play Girls, who are extremely popular here, will be featured with New Orleans' own Sweetheart, Babe Briscoe, directing 11 artists of swing.22 According to a subsequent article, the Harlem Play Girls (\"the swingingest aggregation of girls in the country) broke the box office record for their Easter Sunday appearance at the Tick Tock.23 (Their personnel list at this time includes a trumpet player, Bessie Comeaux, who may have been from New Orleans.) And several months later, the Louisiana Weekly again heralded that, The famous Harlem Play Girls, internationally -known band, which is led by New Orleans' own Babe Briscoe, invade the Tick Tock on Thursday night, November 30, to play the latest in swing arrangements. Composed of 11 real artists, the famous aggregation is well -liked by Orleanians and always packs 'em in. Admission to this gala dance is only 40 cents. There will also be a day dance.\"24 The band returned to the Tick Tock on Easter Sunday and Monday of 1940, this time s ponsored by the Autocrat Club.25 A Louisiana Weekly columnist on March 23, 1940, listed an impressive list of New Orleans visitors, including: ...Marian Anderson, the Southernaires, Tiny Bradshaw, the Four Ink Spots, and the Harlem Playgirls, and that's really dishing it up on a silver platter ...Nite Clubbing: The Jitter -bunnies will be jumping Easter Sunday night at the Tick Tock (Monday also) to the music of those famous Harlem Play Girls with Baby Briscoe, Crescent City Queen, directing.26 According to her daughters, Briscoe then worked with the International A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 209 Sweethearts of Rhythm, tho ugh this has not been confirmed . By the early 1940s, \"Baby\" Briscoe had settled again in New Orleans, and married David \"Val\" Mouton. Their daughter Avon was born on August 1, 1943. In 1946, a gas explosion at the St. Bernard Projects forced Briscoe to leap from the second story to the ground, pregnant with her second daughter, Debra. They all survived. Briscoe gave up her performing career to raise her dau ghters. They lived with her mother Neliska Mitchell on North Conti Street. Briscoe (now Neliska Mouton) studied cosmetology, and opened a series of businesses, including a boutique on Galva Street called Avon and Debras Gift Shop, and a small restaurant called the Chicken Shack. She was an accomplished seamstress, as well, and sewed ball gowns for Mardi Gras. With the left -over fabric, she made silk dresses for her daughters. She also exchanged her sewing skills for dance lessons for her daughters, a luxury she herself didnt have when growing up. In 1957, Baby Briscoe married Clarence Casimire, whom she had known since third grade. Casimire was an employee of the Oakwood Country Club in Cleveland, Ohio. The couple was married by Baby Briscoes brot her, Joseph Mitchell, co -founder of the Christian Mission Baptist Church in New Orleans. The Casimires left for Ohio the following day. Neliska Casimire took up the alto saxophone in the 1970s when she was in her sixties. Though she wasnt on the stage, she continued to entertain family and friends. On her seventy -fifth birthday, she did the splits to prove she still could. She danced on her 80th birthday. The day after, however, she began to complain about pain, which A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 210 turned out to be bone cancer. S he spent the next four months in the hospital, and finally, in a hospice. One day, her daughter Avon went to check on her in the hospital. The nurse told her that her mother had been pretty good that day. She helped fold some clothes. She sat up. But, added the nurse, she had also seemed a little confused, probably from the morphine. \"Why do you say she was confused?\" asked Avon. The nurse told her that her mother had started talking about how she wore a tuxedo and led an orchestra. \"That isnt conf used,\" said Briscoe Mouton Casimire died four months after her 80th birthday, on August 25, 1994. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of her death, her daughters set up the Baby Briscoe Scholarship Fund at Tulane University. Notes 1 Ancestry.com lists her birthdate as April 7, 1914 in the Ohio Deaths records; Ancestry Plus, however, lists her birthdate as April 14, 1914. Her daughters, Avon Howse and Debra Mouton, confirm the April 7, 1914 date. 2 Fourteenth Census of the United States: 1920, 5th Precinct, New Orleans, City, 6th Ward. 3 Fifteenth Census of the United States: 1930, 6th Precinct, New Orleans, 5th Ward, block 183. 4 Telephone interview with Avon Howse and Debra Mouton, July 7, 2003. 5 Danny Barker, ed. by Alyn Shipton, A Life in Jazz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), 66.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 215 Ann Cook (Johnson ) (blues singer) b. April 1886 [May 10, 1903] (Fazenville Road [Franzenville, Fazendeville, Fazenvuille] St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana) / d. September 29, 1962 (New Orleans, Louisiana)1 Born in 1886 [or circa 1888 or 1903], to Carl Cook, a laborer, and Rose Henderson, a housekeeper, Ann Cook spent her early childhood on Fazenville Road in St. Bernard Parish, which was then a rural area, and is now the sit e of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park. One of at least eleven children, she appears to have begun working in Storyville her late teens or early twenties. She was an extremely popular blues singer in the New Orleans, and spent the rest of her life in the city. Manuel Manetta recalled that Cook lived in the neighborhood known as \"The Battlefield,\" where \"women and men were tough,\" and that she sang the blues during the same years that the legendary Buddy Bolden played his cornet.2 The \"Battlefield,\" also called \"Back o Town,\" was the neighborhood where Louis Armstrong grew up. It included the area known as \"Black Storyville.\" Willie Parker noted that in addition to singing, Cook worked as a \"hustler in the District.\"3 As a singer, Cook worked on the other side of Canal Street in the more famous red light district of \"Storyville,\" singing for white customers and racially mixed and light - skinned sex workers in the house of one of the eras most successful madams, Countess Willie Piazz a. According to Alecia P. Long, Piazza was one of several light -A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 216 skinned and mixed -race women entrepreneurs who was able to build her fortune on white mens fantasies about \"Octoroons\" (literal meaning: one eighth black; the practical meaning: mobilization of myths about race and sex) as cultured and erotic women.4 To build on this atmosphere of cultivation and sexuality, Piazzas roster of entertainment had to span the gamut of white mens racial stereotypes about refined and educated white womanho od and passionate and sexual black women. The stereotypes of sexual licentiousness that were associated with dark skinned women, and the cultural associations with barrelhouse blues singing as low class and bawdy, lead one to speculate that Piazzas hirin g of Ann Cook may have served to fulfill the more explicitly sexual end of the range of white mens fantasies. In the 1920s, Cook sang in numerous cafes and bars in New Orleans, including the Red Onion Caf\u00e9 on South Rampart and Julia, and the Calliope Str eet Caf\u00e9. \"She would sing according to the temperament and moods of the customers and could sing endless verses to one song,\" remembered Clarence Williams.5 Very few black bands in New Orleans were able to record in the 1920s, but in 1927, Cook recorded two sides with trumpet player Louis Dumaines orchestra, the Jazzola Eight. At the time, Cook was one of the most p opular vocalists in New Orleans; so popular, in fact, that when she didnt show up for the session, clarinetist Willie Joseph had to go looking for her, and found her in a bar on Calliope Street where she had been singing the night before.6 That session was recorded in New Orleans, not by a local label, but by Victor, which periodically traveled through New Orleans to record musicians. Cook record ed her \"Mama Cookies Blues\" and \"Hes the Sweetest Black A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 217 Man in Town\" with the Jazzola Eight. Storyville pianist Rosalind Johnson remembered Ann Cook as a \"great entertainer,\" and noted that her Victor recordings \"stopped the traffic on Rampart Street.\"7 Years later, when William Russell offered her $10 to record a couple of songs, she told him that she had been paid $100 for the 1927 sides, an amount George Lewis found plausible, since \"Dumaines orch. was paid $285 for their date.\"8 She did eventually record for Russell in 1949, though the song was not a blues, but a gospel number, \"The Lord Will Make a Way,\" with a sextet led by trumpeter Wooden Joe Nicholas that included guitarist Johnny St. Cyr. A thank you letter from Cook to Russell indicates that she planned to re cord for him again, though an additional recording date doesnt appear to have happened.9 From the 1940s on, she sang in the church choir of Greater St. M atthew #2 Church in New Orleans. According to Al Rose, \"Most of her later life was devoted to church work and she refused to speak of her early years.\"10 She died in New Orleans of a heart attack on September 29, 1962. Her obituary gives little information on her life, but does mention that she was married to Willie Johnson; and was daughter of Carl Cook and Rose Henderson, and sister of Mr. Henderson Cook, Joseph Cook, and James Cook, Mrs. Millie Morris, and Miss Mary Cook. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 218 Notes 1 Sheldon Harris, in his entry on Ann Cook in The Blu es Who's Who , gives the May 10, 1903 birth date; Al Rose and Edmond Souchon in New Orleans Jazz: A Family Album has Cook born circa 1888 in Franzenville, Louisiana. I am more inclined to go with the 1900 Census, which states her birth date as April, 1886, and her address as Fazenville Road in St. Bernard Parish. Harris suggests that St. Francisville in West Feliciana Parish is the most likely birthplace for Cook, since neither \"Franzenville\" nor \"Fazeneville\" were cities in Louisiana at that time. Howeve r, Roy Tucker points out that Fazenville Road (sometimes Fazenvuille or Fazendeville), however, does appear on maps of the period in St. Bernard Parish, in what was then a rural area, and what is now the site of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park. If t he family lived on Fazenville Road at that time, it is likely that the census recorders would list \"Fazenville\" since the area was some distance from town or other roads. The family is listed at the same address in the 1880, 1900, and 1910 Census, though Ann Cook only appears in 1900. 2 Manuel Manetta, Oral History Digest, March 28, 1957, Reel III of IV, 11.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 222 Olivia \" Lady Charlotte\" Cook (Olivia Charlot, Olivia Charlotte, Lady Charlotte, Olivia Cook) (pianist, organist, leader, educator) b. May 11, 1913 (New Orleans) Pianist, organist, band leader Olivia \"Lady Charlotte\" Cook is a well -known figure to New Orleaneans and aficionados of New Orleans jazz. For visitors to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, she is an institution, a Jazz Fest fixture and living symbol of the history of New Orleans Jazz. A 2002 concert guide prepared festival - goers for her set, b y stating: Eighty -eight -year-old pianist Olivia Cook has played with a who's -who of the New Orleans music scene throughout her career, including the late legend Danny Barker and trad jazz brothers Bob and George French. Her Jazz Fest sets -- accompanied by a full band -- are a loving tour of traditional 20th century New Orleans music.1 Yet, as Cook has told interviewers throughout her career, her dream was to have been a concert pianist , a goal that was out of the realm of possibility for African Americans during her youth and throughout the prime of her career. Cook was born in New Orleans on May 11, 1913 to Roland and Rose Williams, though her father \"didnt stay with us very long,\" a s she told interviewer Jack Stewart.2 She and her mother lived with her mothers parents, William James Mayo, a church musician and Pullman porter, and Olivia Clayborn Mayo, a graduate nurs e and registered midwife. Her mother was a maid on the railroad and worked for the telephone company. Cooks grandparents owned both a piano and a pump organ, and A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 223 on them her grandfather taught her music fundamentals: scales and triads. She began playin g publicly at the age of six, primarily in church. Cook also studied with a private teacher, a Juilliard -trained musician by the name of Beatrice Stewart Davis. Every Saturday, she traveled to the home Mrs. Davis, where she studied classical music, perfe cting her favorite etudes and playing duets with her teacher. There was no doubt in her mind that she would someday earn her living as a musician. The only other career she considered was nursing, but witnessing first -hand some of the less savory demands of her grandmothers profession, she resolutely settled on music. Her mother and both of her grandparents were supportive in general, but the blessings of her mother and grandmother proved more limiting than those of her grandfather. When the opportunit y arose for Cook to pursue her studies at Juilliard School of Music on scholarship -an arrangement that had been made possible through her piano teacher -Cooks mother could not bear to part with her talented daughter. Her grandmother supported her desire t o play, so long as the repertoire was either church music or the classics -but was strongly opposed to jazz. Cook -whose grandparents belonged to Mount Moriah and Plymouth Rock Baptist Church on Adams Street --played church music her entire life, but if she was to work professionally in New Orleans, she knew she would need to learn other forms of music as well. Eventually, she would seize other local opportunities, and become sought after by leaders of jazz bands. By the age of 15, Cook was studying music a t New Orleans University. This was followed by studies at Straights College, where she earned at B.S. in Music, and Xavier University. She began teaching music, and married a Mr. Charlot when she was in her A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 224 early twenties. At some point, she began recei ving calls to play in Dixieland bands. \"The first time I went out to play with a jazz band,\" Cook told interviewers, \"my grandmother put up big fuss. She said, I think its terrible. Those men are gonna disrespect you.\" Yet, when her grandfather heard about it, she recalled, \"He loved it! I guess it was partly because he had gone to New York and seen a young woman leading an orchestra there.\"3 Her grandfathers job required him to travel a great deal, which seems to have been an important factor in securing his support for Cooks musical career. In another interview, she commented, \"If my grandfather hadnt been a Pullman porter, I never wouldve played jazz.\"4 She worked for a time with Dixieland combos, then, at age 35, received her first jazz call from Herbert Leary, who had heard that she could play well and was skilled at reading music. Leary was the pianist in his own fifteen -piece society swing band, and sought a replacement with strong reading skills; someone who could keep on top of his charts while he led the band. \"I could read anybodys manuscript,\" Cook explained. \"And thats the thing that they liked and they hated. They liked that I could read i t, but they hated that it was a woman.\"5 Karl Koenig writes that New Orleans jazz included a long tradition of women pianists being hired by male band leaders, a practice that he attributes in part to the belief that women were bette r able to play \"correct chords\" than men. Whether this assumption was based on gender stereotypes, or on social gender organization of activities such as formal piano lessons, and church music that required reading, many women, including Cook, were hired precisely for their ability to read. A reading pianist A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 225 was an important asset in collective improvisation among non -reading musicians. In addition, women were thought to be more reliable and less prone to drink.6 Cooks account of playing as the only woman in a mens band offers an interesting perspective on why some women musicians may have been less prone to drink than others. \"When I used to go out with Le arys band, Id be the only woman. So, you know I had to take care of myself. Youre walking down Bourbon Street -all Id hear is Hello, Miss Charlot. Everybody had respect for me. I played music. I got through. I came home.\" Drinking on the job ha d different ramifications for women than it did for men. It affected a womans reputation differently, and held different implications for her safety. \"I never ran the streets. I knew I was a woman. I knew the dos and donts and I took care of myself.\"7 Her marriage to Charlot, a gambler, did not last, and Cook remarried, this time to Albert Cook, an army veteran, and employee of Adlers jewelry store. She continued to play for Leary for many years, but left because she wanted to be more involved in the jazz scene on Bourbon Street, rather than the society engagements, such as balls, that were Learys specialty. In 1965, she started her own band, Olivia Charlotte Cooks Men of Rhythm. Even as she played on the Bourbon Street sce ne, sometimes in tourist spots such as the Famous Door, sometimes in strip clubs, often attending jam sessions after her own gigs, she retained her work ethic of respectability and sobriety and passed these along to her musicians. In 1977, she told D. Ant oinette Handy, \"Ive been leading my own combo for the last twelve years. When I say leading, I mean just that -no smoking and drinking on the band stand\"8 Throughout her Bourbon Street jazz career, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 226 she also maintained her careers as music educator and church musician, as a Times - Picayune advertisement from 1969 attests: \"Olivia Charlot, professional musician of piano a nd organ ... tutors gospel music privately or in classes.\"9 Cooks career has taken her on inter national tours, playing with bands in Germany, France, Spain, Holland, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland. As a music educator, she has taught piano, organ, trumpet, and clarinet, and was the music supervisor in the Jefferson Parish Public Schools for seven years. She served many years as the secretary for Local 496 of the American Federation of Musician (musicians union), and was cited twice by the mayor of New Orleans for her accomplishments.

Cooper was a well-regarded trumpet player who left Chicago for New Orleans in the mid 1930s. Her career, in many ways, chal lenges received wisdom on jazz history. While the most common role of women jazz musicians has been as vocalists and pianists, there were enough women jazz trumpet players in the thirties for the New York Amsterdam News to run a feature on them in January , 1938. According to this item, Cooper hailed from Indianapolis, where she grew up playing both piano and trumpet. While piano was (and continues to be) the instrument more socially acceptable for women to play -and certainly a sensible choice for black w omen who sought jazz careers in the 1930s --it was the trumpet that career landed Cooper prestigious jobs and favorable press notices in 1930s Chicago.1 Then, counter to most narratives of jazz history, in the midst of her Chicago success in the 1930s, Cooper left Chicago to pursue jazz trumpet opportunities in New Orleans. This decision seems to have been occasioned by an offer to play with Papa A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 229 Celestin's orchestra, possibly instigated t hrough her contacts with any number of New Orleans musicians currently playing in Chicago. When she arrived in New Orleans, however, she was hired instead by Joe Robichaux to join his Rhythm Boys. Despite the name of this popular New Orleans band, it emp loyed, at various times, at least three women, including vocalist Joan Lunceford and dancer Neliska \"Baby\" Briscoe . Robichaux's band, up to that time, was comprised of all men, and a smaller group, six to seven pieces. The female members of Robichaux' s band were added as part of his switch to a fourteen -piece orchestra after returning from a Brunswick recording session in New York in 1933.2 In preparation for taking the Rhythm Club (Jackson and Derbigny, the Central City neighborhood) \"by storm,\" Robichaux put together a big band fronted by Lunceford (nee Daisy Lowe) and Briscoe in tuxedos and batons. Both were popular female entertainers in New Orleans at the time. Robichaux reme mbered Ann Cooper as a \"dependable high -note trumpeter\" with a \"style like that of Louis Armstrong.\" He added that she could she could \"hold her own in jam sessions.\"3 Cooper's stay in New Orleans was brief. Robichaux recalled that the trumpet player left his band after a year when he tried to move her out of the regular section and into a feature spot in the show. While Robichaux sa w the move as a \"promotion,\" Cooper believed that she was being \"cut out of the band\" and quit. If Cooper envisioned the \"feature spot\" as a demotion, she would find good company in this history of female jazz musicians. Just as it was less disruptive to social norms for African American pianist Teddy Wilson to be booked as a \"special feature\" in Benny Goodman's Orchestra before black musicians were integrated into that previously all -white band, it A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 230 has also been more considered more socially acceptable f or female brass players to appear as \"special features\" of male orchestras, rather than as members of the regular section. Billie Rogers, white female trumpet player from Woody Herman's Orchestra in the 1940s, recalled that the male musicians were not thr eatened by her presence so long as she (along with the vocalist) sat in chairs separated from the band and only chimed in for \"special features.\" When Herman moved her into the regular section, Rogers was elated, as it meant contributing to the sound of t he band as a \"musician\" rather than as a \"woman musician,\" a shift that also resulted in new hostility from her section mates.\"4 Like Rogers, Cooper sought work and recognition as a trumpet player, not as a novelty or decoration. Rather than evacuate the trumpet section for the \"special attraction\" slot, Cooper left New Orleans for Detroit, before moving back to Chicago, and later, to New York. Her travels are absent from jazz history books and Great Migration narratives, but they can be traced in the black press, in union records, and also in oral histories of male New Orleans jazz musicians who later recalled to interviewers the various cities where they ran into her on the road. Robichaux recalled that a pianist named \"Bubba,\" heard Cooper playing in the area of Chicago known as the \"loop.\" It was during this period that the remarkable article on women trumpet players appeared in the New York Amsterdam News . The African American paper acknowledged Cooper's achievements, while noting her instrument choice as unusual. Cornet playing isn't quite the fad with womenfolk, but Annarette Cooper, who says she was weaned on a horn, stands out as one example of a woman who has gone places with that instrument.5 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 231 The article mentioned her stint with Robichaux, as well as other associa tions with Lil Hardin Armstrong, Mae Brady, Gertrude Long, a \"sensational tour\" with Major Bowes, an appearance at the Roseland Ballroom with Claude Hopkins, and noted that she was currently living in Harlem where she was \"debating offers to come to the co ast or to return to the stage.,\" and \"devising new arrangements and writing new tunes.\" \"She hits the C above high C,\" praised the article, which then went on to describe the talents of trumpet playing mother and daughter Dyer and Dolly Jones. Back in Ch icago in 1939, Cooper made the only known recordings of her career on two dates with the Chicago jazz -blues band, the Harlem Hamfats for the Vocalion label. The leader, Herb Morand, a New Orleans trumpeter and vocalist, had left the group at the brink of success. Rather than give up their hard -won opportunities, the remaining members hired Ann Cooper to replace Morand as trumpet player and Joe McCoy and Alberta Smith to take over the vocals. On two separate occasions in the spring and summer of 1939, the group entered the studio and successfully recreated the distinctive Harlem Hamfats sound, complete with its small but \"well balanced horn sound\" produced from Cooper's trumpet plus Odell Rand's clarinet, and sometimes the saxophone of Chris Reggell.6 By 1940, Cooper landed a job that the Chicago Defender described as \"a unique honor,\" as the only woman in Sir Oliver Bibb's Swing Orchestra. The Defender went on to praise her for being \"the only girl musician in the game today who actually holds down a chair in a man's suit. For, not only does Ann do specialty trumpeting and A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 232 singing, but she has her rightful place in the band and plays all the music along with the other swingsters.\"7 Two months later, Downbeat reported that she had garnered so much attention that she had left Bibbs to start a band of her own, taking with her all but two of Bibb's musicians. Her band enjoyed bookings in Chicago for a time.8 By 1942, she shows up in the black press and in traveling musicians re ports with the all -female band, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. She seems to have stayed only a short time, perhaps returning to Chicago when she was replaced by trumpeter Jean Starr. By the summer of 1944, the black press reported that Cooper w as the \"new star\" of another all-female band, the Darlings of Rhythm: Joining the band coming direct from Windy City triumphs, Ann Cooper, outstanding trumpeter, will be featured as soloist throughout their tour which will include Deleware (sic), Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and other key cities co -starring with Joan Lunceford, Helen Taborn and others. Clarence Love is concert master.\"910 As both the International Sweethearts of Rhythm and the Darlings of Rhythm routinely included New Orleans engagements on their road tours, and both Lunceford and Briscoe also traveled with these groups from time to time in their careers, it is likely that Cooper's New Orleans connections were maintained throughout this period.

In some interviews, Morton credited Desdunes with introducing him to the blues, and in others, he speculated that he must have heard the blues before, but that she was the first person \"who really sold me on the blues.\"3 In either case, he claimed to have been significantly influenced by the way that she played the blues. Two middle fingers of her right hand had been cut off, so she played the blues with only three fingers on her right hand. She only knew this one tune and she played it all day long after she would first get up in the morning.... I stood on the corner, my feet was dripping wet, I asked every man I met... Cant give me a dollar, give me a lousy dime, Just to feed t hat hungry man of mine.4 Morton would later record \"Mamies Blues,\" and publish the sheet music, but not without crediting Mamie Desdunes for authorship. After recording the song for General Records in 1939, Morton wrote to Roy Carew, \"Mamie Desdume wrote Mamie's Blues in the late 90's. I don't like to take credit for something that don't belong to me, I guess A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 237 she's dead by now & there would probably be no royalty to pay, but she did write it.\"5 That the man known by many as a braggadocio (who, in fact, claimed to have \"invented jazz,\" much to the fury of many of his contemporaries), frequently acknowledged Desduness musical influence, even in high profile interviews in Time and Downbeat , is significant. Pinning down what that significance may have been is another matt er. One clue as to the impact that this piano -playing neighbor had on Mortons career can be found in Mortons Library of Congress interviews with Alan Lomax. In Mortons presentation of \"Mamies Blues\" (collected on CD on Rounder Records, Winin' Boy Blu es: The Library of Congress Recordings , V. 4, ROUN1094), he begins by telling the story of how Mamie Desdunes played the blues \"like this all day long, when she would first get up in the morning,\" then illustrates her style at the piano. What is striking about this recording --in addition to Mortons lyrical approach to the melody of \"Mamies Blues\" -is the habanera rhythm he gives this rendition, leadin g some scholars to speculate that Desdunes not only sparked Mortons interest in the blues, but in the Lat in rhythms that he referred to as the \"Spanish tinge.\"6 It may not be possible to know for sure if Mortons enthusiasm for Mamie Desduness playing amounts to his first exposure to fusing blues with Latin rhythms, or whether Morton w as responding to something more personal or unique about her style within a broader context of musical change in which both blues and Latin rhythms were prominent. It is not surprising that Morton and Desdunes would find themselves playing blues and Latin rhythms, as both forms were plentiful in New Orleans, in the late nineteenth, early twentieth century. In fact, according to Bruce Boyd Raeburn, many A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 238 Creole of color pianists played blues with habanera rhythm during those years.7 Morton was a major popularizer of this approach, however, so his consistent citing of Desdunes as an influence could signal that she was an innovator in this style. While we may not know exactly what Desduness role was in jazz history, we may speculate that she is one of the musicians involved in fusing blues and Latin rhythms in a distinct Creole of color approach to piano jazz. More definitely, we may piece together the cultural context of the musical connection between Desdunes, Morton, an d other musicians who knew and heard them both in turn of the century New Orleans. As discussed earlier in this report, nineteenth -century New Orleans was one of several busy port cities with strong African, Latin -American, and European cultural tradition s that found interesting musical fusions.8 Musicians traveled from port to port - Mexico, Cuba, Louisiana, and other locations -which meant that pan -Caribbean forms could develop, and that New Orleans musicians both contributed to and benefited from these traveling influences. In this rich musical network, distinct forms could become popular in locations other than their point of origin, and diverse forms could influence one another to create new forms. One of the circuits by which Cuban music traveled to New Orleans was via Haitian refugees in the early 1800s. 30,000 people migrated from Haiti to Cuba as a result of the Haitian revolution, including white French colonial subjects, free people of color, and slaves. In 1809, when Cuba deported many of its Francophone refugees , 10,000 Haitian refugees in Cuba moved to New Orleans, doubling the citys total population and quadrupling the number of free people of color.9 While the facts are A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 239 blurry regarding the relationship between this history and those of Morton and Desdunes (Mortons because of self -perpetuated conflicting versions of his life story, and Desdunes, because of lack of documentation), both appear to have had roots in that mass migration and the history of cultural contact among Caribbean ports. According to Raul Fernandez, Morton \"traced his ancestry to Haiti through both parents, was raised by godparents of Cuban ancestry, and learned to play habaneras from his Mexican guitar teacher.\"10 According to Peter Hanley, Mamie Desduness mother was a black English -speaking woman named Clementine Walker and her father was one of the most well -known figures of Creole of color history, Rodo lphe L. Desdunes. Desdunes, who had his own wife and children across town, was later the author of Nos Hommes et Notre Histoire (1921), and a major player in the Supreme Court civil rights case, Plessy vs. Fergusson. Though the Plessy appeal was unsucces sful and brought about the disastrous ruling that ushered in Jim Crow laws, the intent of Desdunes and his fellow civil rights workers, was to expose the catastrophic folly of the black/white binary to account for everyone, and thus to invalidate racial segregation. How often, or if ever, Mamie Desdunes saw her father we dont know. Clementine Walker is not mentioned in the biographical data on Rodolphe Desdunes, though their names are linked in the birth records of Mary Celina Desdunes (Hanleys best gue ss at Mamies identity) and John Alexander Desdunes (probably Mamies brother). Creoles of color of Desduness social standing typically considered themselves superior to poor English speaking black people such as Clementine Walker. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 240 The institution of placage , or formal arrangement of mistress -keeping, although usually referring to white Creole men with Creole of color mistresses, might also provide a context for this union across social groups in which the children receive the fathers name.11 Though not of the same elite background as Rodolphe Desdunes, Morton was also a Creole of color, and adamantly so -he often made the point that he was not a \"Negro.\" While Mamie Desdunes was raised in a black English speaking household, she did live in the same neighbo rhood as Morton, and it is like that the two crossed paths professionally as well, since they both played Storyville brothels. To a Time Magazine reporter, Morton recalled Mamie Desdunes as \"good - natured, a fine dresser, and extremely popular with the spo rting crowd.\"12 In a 1949 interview with Alan Lomax, Bunk Johnson, recalled, \"I knew Mamie Desdoumes real well. Played many a concert with her singing those same blues. She was pretty good looking, quite fair and with a nice head of hair. She was a hustlin' woman. A b lues- singing poor gal. Used to play pretty passable piano around them dance halls on Perdido Street.\" Added Johnson, \"When Hattie Rogers or Lulu White would put it out that Mamie was going to be si nging at their place, the white men would turn out in bunches and them whores would clean up.\"13 Manuel Manetta recalled, \"Mamie Desdume was a madam who had a house of Villere Street; she played the piano.\"14 Mamie Desdunes apparently lived at 2328 Toledano Street with family members in 1900, about eight blocks from Mortons godmother, who was by then known as Laura Hunter (formerly Eulalie Hecaud) at 2 706 S. Robertson. Between 1901 and 1905, Jelly Roll Morton lived with his godmother, and this is likely the time when he listened to A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 241 Desdunes playing \"Mamies Blues.\" Mortons controversial claim to have \"invented jazz\" in 1902, while discredited by many scholars, may also indicate that th is time period was a turning point for Morton in the way he was conceptualizing and playing the difference between ragtime and jazz.15 If Mamie Desdunes and Mary Celina Degay [Dugay] are same person, she married George Degay [Dugay] in 1898. I have not been able to locate her house on Villere, nor have I been able to find her death date. Notes 1 In his transcription of Jelly Roll Mortons interviews, Alan Lomax spelled her name \"Desdoumes,\" but Lomaxs spelling is not one of the most reliable features of his valuable documentation of jazz history. 2 Thanks to Roy Tucker for genealogical research, and to Peter Hanley for his excellent essay \"Mamie Desdunes, Portraits from Jelly Roll's New Orleans <<http://www.doctorjazz.freeserve.co.uk/portnewor.html>> Both Tucker and Hanley believe that Mamie Desdun es is likely the same person as Mary Celina Desdunes. 3 Alan Lomax, Mister Jelly Roll .

Some spelling errors stem from the transcription of taped interviews conducted by Alan Lomax. Mamie Desduness name is spelled a number of different ways in the documentation, but Peter Hanley s best guess is that her name was spelled Desdunes, since it appears that her father was Rodolphe L.

July 7, 1910 (New Orleans) Yvonne Fasnacht was born on Laharpe Street, a \"downtown girl,\" of Swiss, German, and French lineage, in 1910 to a Catholic mother, Julia Almont, and a Lutheran father, Caroll P. Fasnacht. Ironically, she wouldnt be known as \"Miss Dixie\" until the 1930s, when she went on an Eastern tour with an \"all -girl\" band from Ohio. Intrigued by her accent, the members of the Smart Set re -named her \" Dixie,\" a name that would stick even after she returned to New Orleans for good. Her father played the drums, though his occupation ranged from bartender, to salesman, to hotel night manager. Her mothers health wasnt good, and times were difficult. Wh en Fasnacht was nine years old, her mother died of brain cancer, and her sister, Irma Fasnacht, became the head of household at age 18. To support her younger sister and their brother Lionel, \"Miss Irma\" took in lodgers, in particular, single women who ha d come to the city to work as secretaries. In school, Yvonne Fasnacht was only interested in drawing and music. She was fortunate to be able to attend the Francis C. Nicholls School, where these were two of the areas of focus. The other option, sewing, did not interest her in the least. Among her classmates were the talented Boswell Sisters , Connie (later Connee), Martha, and Vet, who played instruments and sang during the early years of their career in New A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 246 Orleans, and would soon go on to national accl aim as a singing trio. At the Nicholls School, \"all of the girls were uptown girls,\" said Fasnacht in her oral history. \"Because of the Depression, many of the women had been at Newcomb but had to go to trade school.\"1 The stock market crash, in other words, resulted in a scenario in which formerly affluent white college women sought money -making skills alongside young worki ng class white women such as Fasnacht. Fasnacht had only a sixth grade education, but excelled in he r studies in drawing and music at the Nicholls School , and soon found employment in both fields. In terms of her music studies, she began with the clarine t, and then switched to the E -flat alto sax. She improvised and played by ear. After the Nicholls School, she worked as a card illustrator for a company called the Idea Shop. She also \"found a little girl band and we played different places. We were th e Harmony Maids.\"2 The Harmony Maids were managed by a man named Al Durring or Durning.3 She still did not know whether she wanted to be an artist or a musician, but one event in particular helped to make up her mind. \"There was a girl band called the Smart Set that came from Ohio,\" she told an interviewer. \"They were farm girls. And they c ame down and they played the Orpheum. \"The six-piece band was stranded in New Orleans with no bookings beyond their Orpheum engagement, and so Fasnachts sister, \"Miss Irma,\" took them in. When the band took off on the road once again, they brought along Yvonne Fasnacht as their newest member. She was soon told, \"You dont look like an Yvonne. Were going to call you Dixie because youre from the South.\"4 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 247 The band broke up on the road, in F lorida, as Fasnacht recalled, \"right after repeal,\" when the Prohibition against alcohol sales was revoked in 1933. At that time, Gene Austin, the manager of a highly successful \"all -girl\" band called the Bricktops, ran across the musicians on a trip thro ugh Pensacola. He took Fasnacht, trumpet player Judy Ertle, and pianist Betty Giblin back to New Orleans where the Bricktops had an engagement at either the Suburban Gardens or South Port. The Bricktops, a big band, played the main part of the club, and the trio played the smaller room. The trio then played at the Little Ritz, a cocktail lounge near the St. Charles Hotel.5 Another musician arrived in New Orleans from Akron, Ohio, toting a h ome-made bass fiddle . With the addition of bassist Maxine Phinney, the trio hit the road as a quartet. Sometimes called the Sophisticates of Swing and sometimes called the Southland Rhythm Girls, they played the College Inn in Chicago. In New York, they played the Astor Hotel and Leon and Eddies on 52nd Street. Fasnacht recalled that their engagements at Leon and Eddies ran six months at a time.6 At Leon and Eddies, their act was caught by a movie scout who offered them the opportunity to do movie shorts.7 In 1935, they appeared in the short film, \"Speedy Justice\" (Universal Pictures). A 1938 write -up in Down Beat praised the skills and predicted success for \"Betty Giblin at the ivories, Judy Ertle blowing a hot trumpet, Maxine Phinney slapping the bass and Dixie Fasnacht hitting em high on the clarinet and supplying the vocal swing.\"8 At some point, pianist Dorothy Sloop from Steubenville, Ohio, took Betty Giblins place in the band in New York.9 While Miss Dixie was on the road with the band, her sister, Miss Irma, opened a A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 248 bar and made a successful business. Miss Dixie came off the road to co -run the bar in 1939. This bar would became a well -known spot for hearing Dixieland jazz, and would, for many of its cli entele, eventually become known as the first gay bar in New Orleans. In both its first and second locations, the bar would also become famous for its 35 -foot mural by Xavier Gonzales, depicting sixty -six musicians and entertainers of the period. After th e closing of the second location in 1964, the mural was moved to the Old Mint. The first location of Dixies Bar of Music was on 204 St. Charles, across the street from the St. Charles Hotel. The sisters ran the bar throughout World War II, becoming so p opular with servicemen that they were told that some U.S. military personnel had opened a Dixies Bar of Music overseas. The division of labor was strict and established early. Miss Irma was the business woman, and also \"the Sheriff,\" because \"it was she who, in addition to minding the books and the cash register at Dixies Bar of Music, also kept the kids in line.\"10 Miss Dixie was in charge of the entertainment, which included providing and playing in the band, which was made up of both women and men. The first band included Judy Ertle (trumpet), Armand Hug (piano), Bonnie Bell, Johnny Senac (bass), Bob Doyle (Armand Hugs brother -in-law), and Fasnacht on clarinet. O f her own playing, Miss Dixie has said, \"Im not a good musician, but I get a good tone.\"11 Joe Loyacano also recalled working in the St. Charles Avenue location of Dixies Bar of Music in a t hree-piece group that included Fasnacht on clarinet, \"a girl piano player,\" and himself on trombone.12 The New Orleans writer Lyle Saxon, who resid ed in the St. Charles Hotel, recalled a band comprised of both constants and variables: \"usually a pretty girl\" at the piano, a A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 249 guitarist, a bassist, and \"sometimes there is a trumpeter, sometimes not.\" Miss Dixie, he recalled, was one of the constants. And there is always Dixie and her clarinet. From her point of vantage on the platform, she is able to look over the heads of those at the bar and see the guests seated at the small tables beyond. She has that gift so necessary in conducting a club in tha t she can do three things at once; she sings, she plays with apparently carefree abandon, and she exchanges jokes with the guests. This is interspersed with sudden shouts: Vincent, catch Table 17, or Joe a guest is at the door, or Look whos here. Nothing escapes her notice.13 After the war, the landlords no longer wanted a bar on their property, so the sisters moved Dixies Bar of Music to 701 Bourbon Street (current lo cation of a bar called the Cats Meow). The sisters lived upstairs. The second Dixies Bar of Music opened around 1949. At this point, pianist Dorothy Sloop (1913 -1998) joined the band. She and Fasnacht would later record an album together circa 1957, entitled, Dixie and Sloopy: Sloopy Time (Golden Crest 3066), now a collectors item. In a strange twist of gender bias, the recording company prevented the regular bass player, Johnny Senac, from appearing on the record. Apparently, there was no sense in recording women jazz musicians unless they fulfilled the \"all -girl\" band requirement. So instead of a bass, the band was recorded with drummer, Maeceil Peterson, one of the excellent drummers from the musical family of Bernadette and George Peterson. Geo rge Peterson was a music teacher who taught at least three women drummers, all of whom became professionals: his daughters Bernadette Peterson Kerrigan and Maeceil Peterson Silliker, and his niece Lois Perry.14 Though Maeceil Peterson was a fine drummer, Fasnacht regretted that the band, which ordinarily had a bass and no drums, d id not sound like itself on its record.15 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 250 The bar had already begun to attract a small gay clientele at its first location, some of whom would follow Dixie s Bar of Music to its new location. On Bourbon Street the club acquired a large and very loyal customer base, both gay and straight, who became closely attached to the unique community of artists and eccentrics it harbored and encouraged. It was here whe re the reputation of Dixies Bar of Music as a gay bar was consolidated, whether or not Miss Dixie and Miss Irma saw it as such. These were dangerous times for gay people and gay bars, but the sisters were proud of their ability to maintain a well -run bus iness, and they went to great lengths to protect their customers. Recalled one regular, \"When they started to raid the bars, if Miss Dixie heard about it, she wouldnt close up. Shed just tell us to go home. All the vice squad found when they got there was Dixie and the bartender.\"16 The most famous incident occurred in 1962, when the Krewe of Yuga, a gay Carnival krewe, was raided at a private party in Jefferson Parish. As was typical with police raids of gatherings of gay people, arrests were made and the names published in the newspaper. The raid had not happened on the bars premises, but Miss Dixie still bailed the entire krewe out of jail. She later would insist that it was not a big deal and that too much had been mad e of the incident, but the gay and lesbian community in New Orleans hail it as one of the important markers of local struggles in the larger Gay Liberation Movement. For Fasnacht, the story is more one of mutual loyalty between proprietors and customers.17 She has been dismissive of the topic of sexual identity with interviewers, except to make the point that in her generation this was not something people discussed. To the inevitable questions about marriage that single women tend to field throughout their A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 251 lives, she has replied that she and Miss Irma had suitors \"coming and going,\" and \"friends -all kinds of friends,\" and that they simply didnt have time for marriage.18 In 1964, Miss Dixie and Miss Irma bought a cottage on Bourbon Street, sold Dixies Bar of Music and retired. Miss Irma died on May 14, 1993 at the age of 91. In 1997, Miss Dixie was presented a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 11th Annual Gay Appreciation Awards (GAA) Gala, for being \"a living testament to the history of gay New Orleans.\"19 As of this writing, she still lives on Bourbon Street.

Included in the accompanying file are newspaper articles featuring photographs of the bands in which she played. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 254 Mercedes Garman Fields [sometimes Gorman] (pianist, vocalist) b. March 1899 (New Orleans) / d. November 14, 1967 (New Orleans, Louisiana) When William Russell received the news that pianist Mercedes Garman Fields had died, he happened to have on his lap a copy of Al Rose's and Edmond Souchon's New Orleans Jazz: A Family Album . Flipping to her biography, he saw that there was one line only, indicating that she had been with Papa Celestin's band in the 1930s and 1940s, but with no details included. Sadde ned that so little had been documented, and that no oral history had been conducted with this well -respected pianist, Russell went to the wake to see if he could find out more about her. There he found a step -niece who told him that Mercedes Garman was a New Orleans native, born on Jackson Avenue probably in 1898 (but maybe 1897 or 1899),1 that she had worked with many renowned jazz musicians of the 1920s, including Celestin, Louis Armstrong, and Alphonse Picou. She had also sometimes played on a boat on Lake Ponchartrain. Besides New Orleans, she had worked on the Gulf Coast at Biloxi, Gulfport, and other locations. She was a graduate of Xavier, a member of the Holy Ghost Catholic Church, and a well -regarded piano teacher, as well as a working pianist.2 From Russell's notes, along with the information that was documented in her obituaries, we can piece together an outline of an entire life spent in New Orleans. The A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 255 U.S. Federal Census also helps to pin down some details. Accordi ng to the 1900 and 1910 Census reports, Mercedes Garman was born in March, 1899, the youngest of ten living children (three others died before 1900). Her parents were Adolph Garman, a laborer, whose father was born in England and mother was born in Louisi ana, and Alice Luciana Garman, a house keeper, whose father was born in Italy and mother was born in Louisiana. The 1890 and 1910 Census reports listed the entire Garman family as \"mulatto,\" a vague term that was used to classify children of mixed parenta ge (specifically black and white), all people with known mixed ancestry (again, specifically black and white), and Creoles - of-color who would not have identified as either black or white. Since there was no racial category for people who were mixed in Ji m Crow logic, all of these groups were lumped into the \"Colored\" side of the legal and mandatory black/white color line. Reflecting these contradictions, the 1900 Census lists the whole family as \"black.\" The Census also shows that the family was English -speaking, though it does not record if other languages were spoken as well.3 The 1880 Census shows the family to be living at 328 Jackson Avenue, and the 1900 Census indicates that they had moved to 2039 Jackson Avenue. By 1910, Mercedes Garman's mother was listed as widowed. The wage earners in the household are recorded as Mercedes's siblings, brothers: Ethan, a driver; Maltry, a labor er who did odd jobs; Ferdinand, a porter in a club, and her sister Orelia (or Aurellia), a seamstress. Mercedes Garman married Herbert B. Fields at some point before 1923, and lived at 2325 Josephine.4. While most references to her professional career refer to her A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 256 as \"Mercedes Fields,\" drummer Alex Bigard remembered playing in a band with \"Mercedes Garman,\" which suggests that her career began before she married. As Mercedes Fields, she was an active jazz band pianist and piano teacher from the 1920s through the 1950s. She taught private lessons, and also taught piano for about three years at the Beth Israel Cultural Nursery School on Terpsicore.5 Mercedes Garman Fields played piano for jazz bands at a time and place when it was not unusual for an otherwise all -male band to have a woman at the piano. As is evident throughout this report, many women pianists worked, and were respected as competent musicians, in the most popular jazz bands of New Orleans in the 1920s. A photograph at the Hogan Jazz Archive shows Mercedes Garman Fields at the piano in the ban d led by cornetist Manuel Perez at the opening of the Pythian Temple Roof Garden in the summer of 1923.6 Pianist Jeanette Salvant Kimball recalled that three years later, on September 19, 1926, when Kimball played her first job with Oscar \"Papa\" Celestin at the Pythian Temple Roof Garden, Perez's band was also playing, and Fields was still the pianist.7 In 1928, Fields was playing in the NOLA dance orchestra led by trumpet player Peter Lacaze on Carondelet Street.8 According to Karl Koenig, she played with John Robichaux's band in the late 1920s, along with Willie Pajaud, Harrison Barnes, Sam Dutrey Sr. and Charles McCurdy. He also mentions that she was in bassist Bob Lyon's band with Ricard Alexis, Frankie Dusen, Sidn ey Vigne and Tom Benton.\"9 Drummer, Alex Bigard, recalled that when he played with Bob Lyon's band, a pianist wasn't always used, but when there was a pianist i t was often \"Mercedes Gorman.\"10 Koenig also quotes Ernie Cognolotti, who remembered playing with her in A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 257 Bill Ma tthew's band. \"She was a good pianist and had a very good reputation and following in New Orleans. But she was not a traditional jazz pianist.\"11 What Cognolotti meant by that statement is probably what clarinetist Willie Humphrey meant when he described the playing of a long list of women pianists who played with early jazz bands, including Fields, as \"good piano players\" who \"made the correct chord changes. They could read and had good left hands.\"12 Some of these pianists took improvised solos, but many did so only minimally, and some did not solo - however, it is also important to note that band leaders often did not want their pianists to take improvised solos. The role of the pianist i n these 1920s bands was often seen as \"laying down the right chords\" for the other musicians.13 As Bruce Raeburn explained to film-maker Kay D. Ray, \"[u]sually what you want the piano player to do in collective improvisati on is comp and fill,\" maintaining the chords so that the other instrumentalists could hear them and to improvise on them, and to \"fill\" the in between spaces in support of the improvising brass and reeds, who are collectively featured. For pianists workin g in this context of early collective improvisation, the opportunity to solo was limited.14 Fields' most noted pe riod of playing is during the 1930s and 1940s, when she played with Oscar \"Papa\" Celestin.15 Jeanette Kimball recalled that when she took some time off from Celes tin's band (between 1935 and 1953), to raise her childre n, Celestin maintained two groups; a traveling band and a band at the Paddock Lounge. According to Kimball, Mercedes Fields was the pianist for the traveling band.16 It was also Fields who appeared on Deluxe recordings that were made in 1947, the first records Celestin had made since 1928. She appeared on three more recordings with A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 258 Celestin in 1951. None of these recordings are available as of this writing . According to Bruce Raeburn, she also played with Herbert Leary and with Ricardo Lexus.17 She was active as a professional musician through the 1950s, and then continued to work primarily as a piano teacher. In the mid -1960s, she bro ke her pelvis bone, an injury that forced her to retired. She spent the last couple of years of her life at the Lodwick -Manor Nursing Home, 5407 Dauphine. However, as Bill Russell was told at her wake, \"even here she entertained the other patients with h er music.\"18 Notes 1 The 1900 and 1910 U.S. Census for Louisiana list her birth date as March, 1899. 2 William Russell, unpublished notes, \"Field, Mercedes G.\" November 16 1967.

December 10, 1942 (New Orleans)2 Al Rose and Edmond Souchon described Edna Mitchell Francis as, \"A gifted soloist who entertained in the cabarets as a piano -playing balladeer.\"3 Louis Armstrong remembered working with her in Andersons Restaurant on Rampart Street in 1918. Her husband, drummer Albert Francis, thought it was 1919.4 This would have been around the same time that Albert Francis and Edna Mitchell were married.5 This was during a time period when Armstrong had separated from his first wife Daisy, and was temporarily living with his mother, and working at Tom Andersons, a well -known Storyville cabaret, frequented by high -tipping gamblers. Armstrong wrote , \"Lots of the Big shots from Lu Lu White s used to come there - And we made lots of Tips.\" The band was led by Paul Dominguez, Armstrong played cornet, Albert Francis played drums, and Edna Francis, Alberts wife, played piano. \"We played all sorts of arrangements from the Easiest to the Hardest -And from the Sweetest to the Hottest.\"6 In his oral history, Albert Francis credited his late wife with te aching him most of what he knew about music. He described her as a sight reader who \"could change keys\" and recalled that she \"worked with all the bands around New Orleans.7 Morris French recalls that when he played with Kid Rena's band, if the band was going to use a piano, they usually called Edna Francis.8 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 263 Little else of Edna Mitchell Francis is known.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 265 Bertha Gonsoulin (Bookman) (piano) b. ? / d. ? Bertha Gonsoulin was a pianist and music teacher about whom little is known, though she shows up in two crucial moments of New Orleans jazz history: both times in San Francisco. The first of these moments came in 1921, when she replaced Lil Hardin as pianist in Joseph \"King\" Olivers Creole Jazz Band for a one -year period. The second came over twenty years later when her credentials as an Oliver alumnus brought her to the attention of Rudi Blesh and other movers and shakers of the New Orleans Revival. These enthusiasts of early jazz sought Gonsoulins services as an appropriate accompanist for New Orleans trumpet legend, Bunk Johnson, in 1943. Cornetist and band leader Joe \"King\" Oliver moved from New Orl eans to Chicago around 1918 or 1919.1 His first Chicago jobs were in Bill Johnsons Royal Gardens band and Lawrence Duhes Dreamland Caf\u00e9 band, but by the fall of 1919, he was leading the band at the Dreamland. The band included Honore Dutrey, Johnny Dodds, Ed Garland, Minor Hall, and a recent migrant from Tennessee, pianist Lil Hardin. Business, however, was rocky at the Dr eamland . According to Gene Anderson, rumors that the club might be sold were circulating, and so Oliver decided to seize the opportunity for a California tour for which he had been recommended by trombonist Kid Ory.2 The band opened at Pergola, a dance hall in San Francisco in June, 1921. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 266 The pressure of declining work opportunities caused tension among the band membe rs and leader, and a series of personnel changes ensued. When the Pergola closed, the band was booked into the California Theater, where they encountered difficulties with the aggressive white audience, in the form of racial slurs, and challenges to their authenticity as \"Creoles.\" Hardin, at this time married to Jimmy Johnson, received an opportunity to return to the Drea mland and play for violinist and band leader Mae Brady . Hardin was but one of the musicians to evacuate the ill -fated tour.3 Bertha Gonsoulin, a pian ist with roots in New Orleans, but who lived in San Francisco, became Hardins replaceme nt. Promoter Bill Colburn, who lived in San Francisco and knew Gonsoulin well, told William Russell, \"When very young, she played in her fathers band in New Orleans. Her father was a violinist who worked on the Southern Pacific Railroad.\"4 If her father s name was Gonsoulin, it is possible the family lived in New Iberia, Louisiana where numerous Gonsoulins show up in US Federal Census records. According to Burton W. Peretti, \"For New Orleans jazz musicians before 1917, distant California was as important a market as Chicago.\"5 Indeed many New Orleans musicians, including Jelly Roll Morton and Kid Ory had moved their career bases to the West Coast as early as musicians in the more often -noted Chicago migration. We know little about Gonsoulins role in this movement. She is not mentioned in Tom Stoddards history of jazz in San Francisco, Jazz on the Barbary Co ast (Chigwell, Essex: Storyville, 1982). The details of her life are as scarcely considered by most Oliver scholars as the minutia about other members is actively debated. We do know that her A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 267 nickname was \"Bob\" or \"Miss Bob.\"6 We also know that Gonsoulin stuck it out through the year of personnel changes and fickle employment. At one point, a reconfigured band called, \"King Olivers and Orys Celebrated Creole Orchestra,\" made up of Oliver, Kid Ory, Baby Do dds, Ed Garland, Johnny Dodds, and Bertha Gonsoulin, played for Mardi Gras Ball in Oakland.7 When Oliver brought his band back to Chicago in June, 1922, Gonsoulin was still the pianist. It was she, in fact, not Hardin, who was the working pianist in the Creole Jazz Band when Oliver sent away for a young New Orleans musician by the name of Louis Armstrong to join as second cornet. As Gonsoulin told William Russell in 1940, \"the telegram asking Louis Armstrong to join the Oliver band was sent to him on a Sat. evening and he replied Sunday eve. Louis arrived on Tuesday eve., carrying his cornet wrapped in a black bag.\"8 Oliver took Armstrong to the Dreamland to meet Lil Hardin, and to try and convince Lil to come back to his band at the Royal Garden. When Armstrong joined the band in August 1922, he did so as a part of a larger reorganization of the Creole Jazz Band, which included more shifting of personnel, such as the return of clarinetist Honore Dutrey and pianist Lil Hardin. When Hardin agreed to re-join the band in December 1922, Bertha Gonsoulin was sent back to San Francisco. As an out -of-towner, Gonsoulin recalled that she had been paid in cash the whole time she was in Chicago, and had amassed so much of it that she \"carried it home in a pillow case.\"9 At some point in the early twenties, either before her departure to Chicago with Oliver, or after her return, she took some lessons from Jelly Roll Morton. Bill Colburn told William Russell that Bertha \"couldnt go to the places where [Morton] played, so he A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 268 went to her home to teach her. She said he taught her several of his compositions, including Kansas City Stomp, the Pearls, and Frog -i-more.\"10 What happened to Gonsoulin over the next twenty years is, again, ske tchy. The 1930 Census lists a Bertha Gonsoulin, age 49, \"wife,\" living in Louisiana. This could very well be her. The age could be right, but by 1940, we find her again in San Francisco. Perhaps she could have moved back and forth between the two citie s. We know from a photo and caption in the Chicago Defender , that, in 1940, she was a well - respected piano teacher at the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center in San Francisco.11 The paper ran a photograph of her looking very distinguished in a white dress, regal gaze, sitting at a piano, not as an entertainer, but as a \"Trainer of Musicians.\" The caption stated that \"Miss Bertha Gonsoulin ... has the enviable reputation of being one of the finest instructors, composers, and trainers of aspiring musicians in the west.\"12 Accounts of the 1943 Bunk Johnson concerts and recordings make no mention of her reputation as a \"fine instructor,\" or \"composer,\" but they do suggest that she had become \"immersed in church music when she was approached by Rudi Blesh to accompany Bunk on the piano.\"13 Martin Williams adds that she h ad, in fact, \"given up jazz for church music\" and \"had to be persuaded\" to play with Bunk Johnson.14 Whether or not Gonsoulin herself found church music incompatible with jazz-(had she \"given up\" jazz, or had she not had opportunities to work as a jazz pianist?) -over the next several months, she played a role in the celebration of New Orleans jazz (pre -1929) that became known as the New Orleans Revival. In San Francisco in the 1940s, the New Orleans Revival centered around Lu A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 269 Watters Yerba Buena Jazz Band, a contemporary group of white male musicians who were inspired by the music of \"King\" Oliver. Christopher Hillman wrote of the atmosphere of excitement, when, \"[I]n early 1 943, Rudi Blesh, who was on the fringe of the movement associated with the book Jazzmen , arranged to give a series of lectures on New Orleans jazz at the Museum of Art in San Francisco.\" Concerts by \"authentic\" New Orleans jazz musicians were conceived as part of this popular lecture series. Blesh and other collectors raised money to bring Bunk Johnson appear at one of the lectures, but they had to find musicians to play with him. Blesh located \"Bertha Gonsoulin, a lady who had once played with King Oliv er in Chicago, but was by then heavily involved in church music.\"15 She agreed to accompany Johnson on the piano. The lecture/concert (April 11, 1943) was an eno rmous success. In his opening remarks, Blesh shared a letter from Louis Armstrong that praised Bunks genius, and put in a good word for \"Miss \"Bob\" (Bertha Gonsoulin), expressing hopes that they \"could get together for a jam session in the near future.\"16 A list of the numbers played by Johnson and Gonsoulin , compiled by Mike Hazeldine and Barry Lord, Im Crippled.\".17 The concert was recorded, and several of the numbers are currently available on CD (AMCD -016 Bunk Johnson in San Francisco ).18 This event was so well received, that a subsequent one was planned for May 9, 1943 at the Geary Theater. On May 7, 1943, Johns on and Gonsoulin met at the latter musicians home on 1782 Sutter Street in San Francisco to prepare for the forthcoming concert. William A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 270 Russell, who had just arrived from New Orleans, was on -hand to document the session, which, he later recalled, had no t been planned as a recording session, but rather as a chance \"to get Bunks lip in shape.\"19 This rehearsal, however, was, in fact, issued on the American Music label, and is also represe nted on the aforementioned CD (AMCD - 016 Bunk Johnson in San Francisco ). The May 9th concert little resembled this intimate rehearsal. It did not include duets between Johnson and Gonsoulin. Trombonist Kid Ory and his band had been brought up from L os Angeles, and the concert primarily featured Johnson with Kid Orys band. Gonsoulin, who would have known Ory from 1920s concerts with King Oliver, was not much featured, but did play a couple of solos. The next day, she expressed disappointment when s he found that her own contributions in the concert were \"hardly mentioned in the press.\"20 Perhaps in response to her ennui, Russell recorded Gonsoulin re -creating the solo rendition of \"The Pearls\" she had performed the previo us night. This, too, appears on Bunk Johnson in San Francisco . After the Geary Theater concert, several traditional jazz concerts were presented at the CIO, co -sponsored by a coalition of jazz fans and labor union figures, including Harry Bridges. Bunk Johnson and Bertha Gonsoulin were the \"special guests\" at the first such concert on July 11, 1943.21 After Johnson left the San Francisco Bay Area for lack of work, Gonsoulin made at least one further appearance at the CIO, in the spring of 1944.22 At some point, Russell interviewed Gonsoulin, and his hand -written notes are housed at The Williams Research Center.23 I have drawn heavily from these notes, as one of the few sources of information on Gonsoulin, but must add that these notes are A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 271 sketchy, f ocus entirely on her year with King Oliver, and include her claim to have been the pianist on the Gennett session of \"The Chimes,\" which is incorrect. Future research should continue to seek information on Bertha Gonsoulin for years other than 1921 -22 and 1943 -44. Future research should also explore the possibility that Gonsoulin may have been thinking of a different recording session, other than her discredited claim to have been on the Gennett session, when she told Russell she recorded with Oliver.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 274 Antonia P. Gonzales [Gutierrez?] (cornet, vocalist, entrepreneur) b. ? / d. ? In the early 1900s, the glass door of her four -story mansion was engraved with the words, Gonzales, Female Cornetist.1 The fact that Antonia Gonzales, or Miss Tonia, was also one of the most famous madams in New Orleans did not need to be posted. Located on the corner of Customhouse (Iberville) and Villere, the well - appointed house was clearly one of the higher class brothels in Storyville, the most notorious red -light district in the U.S., and unique in that it was established not only through informal channels, but by a series of city ordinance s. While prostitution was no more legal in Storyville than it was anywhere else in the country, it was treated as such between 1897 and 1917 within the boundaries of Basin Street North, Robertson Street, St. Louis Street, and Customhouse/Iberville. That Miss Tonia's status as a cornetist was emphasized, not only on her door, but in advertisements in the notorious Blue Books (or guidebooks to Storyville brothels), is a testament both to the importance of having a memorable special feature to attract customers in such a highly concentrated marketplace, and of the value placed on music in the sex industry in turn of the century New Orleans. Other madams also advertised music (though not their own cornet skills). The presence of piano professors such as Jelly Roll Morton and Tony Jackson heightened the status of a house, and increased A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 275 the price, since these pianists received, and expected, large tips. Houses without pianists had coin -operated player pianos. Lulu White, perhaps the most famous of all Storyville madams, advertised that in her establishment, there were \"always ten entertainers who get paid to do nothing but sing and dance.\"2 The prostitutes at Minnie White's establishment at 221 Basin Street could sing bawdy ballads.3 Prostitutes danced to live music for customers. Clients and prostitutes danced together in th e ballrooms or in parlors. And at 1535 Customhouse (later Iberville), the madam sometimes played her cornet in duet with ragtime professor Tony Jackson. Gonzales, like so many Storyville figures, has acquired a status somewhere between legend and compl ete obscurity. Researching the occupants of brothels has its singular challenges. Though census takers did stroll house -to-house through the streets of Storyville, collecting data on heads of household and bo arders, the evidence of such reports is ev en more tenuous than the already sketchy census reports of residents of neighborhoods where people were less likely to wish to conceal their identities. Incentives to pass as younger than one's years were magnified. Married women may have passed as singl e to census takers. Spanish or French surnames could indicate heritage, or they could be marketing strategies of light -skinned black women passing for Creole -meaning, in this case, mixed European and African ancestry -in order to boost their social and eco nomic capital. Creoles of color in New Orleans had a higher economic and social status than English -speaking or American blacks.4 Antonia Gonzales advertised herself as an Octoroon, as did m any madams and prostitutes in Storyville, but this did not mean she was literally one -eighth black. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 276 Octoroon, as many scholars have pointed out, had become more of an erotic fantasy about New Orleans held by white men at the turn of the century, than an actual description of genealogy.5 The surname Gonzales may indicate Antonia Gonzales's identify as a Creole of color, and suggest that she, like so many Gonzales' s in turn of the century New Orleans, was descended from the Canary Islanders who migrated to Louisiana in the late 1700s. There were at least three Antonia Gonzales's in New Orleans who could have been the cornet -playing madam, all of whom were descended from the Islanos . I have not been able to trace any of these three women, however, to the properties run by the Antonia Gonzales whose cornet expertise was etched on the door to her brothel.6 It is also possible that Antonia Gonzales was a self -selected name fashioning Creole identity to benefit from culture capital not available to colored identity, (as Phil Pastras speculates was the case with another Gonzales, Jelly Roll Morton's friend, Anita Gonzales, whose birth name was Bessie Johnson). Gonzales's establishment moved at least twice during the Storyville years. Her first house was located at 217 Basin Street between 1895 and 1900, estimated Al Rose, though the Soards Directory continues to list her at that address through 1903.7 The Blue Book listing shows that when Gonzales was at 217 Basin Street, running a house specializing in Octoroons, she sh ared a two block stretch with other famous Octoroon madams, Lulu White and Willie Piazza.8 Like the related term Quadroon, Octoroon was one of many terms referencing a mixed -race, but light skinned black woman, in a historical context in which affluent and well -respected white men routinely A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 277 purchased sexual relations with light women who were legally defined as black (by having any known African ancestry). Monique Guillory, in w riting about the practice of Quadroon Balls, fancy events in which white men selected their light -skinned black mistresses during the time of slavery, notes the moral hypocrisy of a city which by day, sells these women as chattel, and by night, toasts the ir beauty, their charm and their whiteness.9 Not disconnected from this history, the customers at thes e Storyville brothels were white men, often affluent and well -respected, selecting light -skinned black women to fulfill their desires for so -called exotic sex, during the sa me period in which Jim Crow \u2014the legal and mandatory system of segregation \u2014was bei ng consolidated in the South. White women also worked as prostitutes, but only in houses where the madam was also white. Black women worked in houses run by black women. Black men were not allowed as customers, but they were frequently present as musici ans. We know little about Antonia Gonzales's place in this history, but we do know that her business was housed at 217 Basin Street during the years that Jelly Roll Morton recalled having his piano playing talent requested by all the \"highest class landla dies,\" naming \"Willie Piazza, Josie Arlington, Lulu White, Antonia Gonzales, Hilma Burt, and Gypsy Schaeffer.\" Said Morton, \"Their houses were all in the same block on Basin Street, stone mansions with from three to seven parlors and from fifteen to twent y-five women all clad in evening gowns and diamonds galore.\"10 At some point, Miss Tonia ran a house at 1308 Conti Street (Conti and Franklin), which was, according to Rose, one of the few places on Conti between Franklin Street and the cemetery, St. Louis N. 2, that offered music.11 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 278 But it was at 1535 Customhouse (Iberville), at Villere, where Gonzales achieved her greatest renown both as a madam and as a proprietress with high musical standards, \"playing the cornet in duets with pianist Tony Jackson.\"12 Al Rose described the house on Customhouse/Iberville and Villere as, one of the most spectacular architectural specimens to be found in the District. In that ancient wooden affai r with a multitude of galleries and columns13 one heard Antonia P. Gonzales, 'the only Singer of Opera and Female Cornetist in the Ten derloin,' as well the 'ragtime singing' --often by the great Tony Jackson, when he was in town. Miss Antonia herself is said to have been surprisingly proficient as an instrumentalist and often joined in duets with the professor.14 That Rose found her proficiency surprising tells us something about socially conditioned e xpectations of trumpet players, women, and prostitutes, reminding us that historians, even those who include women in history books, are not exempt from historical processes! The duets of the female cornetist and ragtime professor are noted by other historians and musicians as well. Composer and pianist Spencer Williams recalled, \"My old friend, Tony Jackson, who composed Pretty Baby' and Some Sweet Day,' used to play piano at a house run by Miss Antonia Gonzales, who sang and played the cornet.\"15 It is notable that her cornet playing was only one aspect of her musical importance to the Storyville scene. The fact that she procured the talents of pianist Tony Jackson are also much hailed in accounts of her house. In a 1948 article for the jazz magazine, Record Changer , Roy Carew described an inspiring evening in the winter of 1904/1905 that he spe nt standing outside of her house: A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 279 As I neared the front of the Gonzales establishment, I could hear the sound of piano playing with someone singing, which my ears told me was coming from the Villere side of the house. Always very fond of popular music, I immediately walked to the side of the house and got as close to the music as possible; with the banquette going right up to the side of the house, I found myself standing under one of the windows of what probably was Madame Gonzales' parlor listening to th e professor playing and singing. It was the most remarkable playing and singing I had ever heard.16 An article from one of the Storyville's newspapers, the Sunday Sun (the other being the Mascot ) confirmed the serious music al reputation of Miss Tonia's house, Among the swell houses in the district there is none more popular or attractive than the one which is operated by Miss Antonia Gonzales, on Customhouse Street corner of Villere. All summer this resort has done good bus iness notwithstanding the prevailing dull times. This place is filled with beautiful young women all the time, and a visit to the tenderloin is incomplete without enjoying a good time here. This place is what we might prope rly term a modern music casino.17 The Soards Directories list her at the Customhouse address in 1904 and 1906. The Third Edition (1906) Blue Book carried the following elaborate ad: Miss Antoni a P. Gonzales. Corner Villere and Iberville Streets. Cornetist Songstress Dancer. The above party has always been a head -liner among those who keep first -class Octoroons. She has also has the distinction of being the only Singer of Opera and Female Cor netist in the Tenderloin. She has had offers after offers to leave her present vocation and take to the stage, but her vast business has kept her among her friends. Any person out for fun among a lot of pretty Creole damsels, here is the place to have it . For ragtime singing and clever dancing and fun generally, Antonia stands in a class all alone. Remember the Number. PHONE 1974.18 This advertisement seems to epitomize the delicate ba lance between sexual services and uninhibited fun, and respectability and sophistication that Alecia P. Long has argued was the key to success for some octoroon madams, including Willie Piazza, Lulu White, and Antonia Gonzales.19 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 280 I have not been able to determine how long Gonzales remained at the Customhouse address. The U.S. Navy officially closed down Storyville as a legally zoned red -light district in 1917. There is a 1911 listing in the Soards' Directory for Anton ia Gonzales, occupation cook, at 636 Bourbon Street, but, again, I have not been able to confirm whether this is the same person.

See entries on her sisters: Ida Goodson , Sadie Goodson , and Billie Pierce , for additional information on the contributions of the Goodson sisters to jazz piano. Born in 1904 or 1905, Edna Goodson was the fourth of six piano -playing daughters of Hamilton Madison Goodson a nd Sarah Jenkins Goodson of Pensacola, Florida. Of the six sisters: Mabel, Della, Sadie, Edna, Wilhelmina (Billie), and Ida (a seventh sister, Maggie, died young), four defied their religious parents to play ragtime, blues and jazz (Edna, Sadie, Billie, a nd Ida). Hamilton and Sarah Goodson played in church, where Hamilton was a \"piano -playing Baptist deacon.\"2 Although their parents forbade them to attend dances, Edna would sometimes slip out of the house with her next youngest sister, Billie, to hear local and traveling jazz bands. Oftentimes, they would be surprised to find their sister Sadie playing with the band3 When Billie was fifteen and Edna was about eighteen, the two sisters went on the road with the Mighty Wiggle Carniva l.4 Their mother and older sister Mabel both died in 1918, and their father died in 1924, so the remaining daughter s scrambled to find ways to earn a living. The Mighty Wiggle Carnival was owned by a man named Jack Shaffer. Edna A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 284 danced and played in the band in the \"colored minstrel show,\" and Billie played organ, sang, and danced. Later Billie would move to New Orleans, first to substitute for her sister Sadie in Buddy Petit's band, then to lead her own bands. Edna continued to play, but remained primarily based in Pensacola, and other n earby towns. According to Billie, Edna mostly worked in \"show business,\" throughout Molino, Florida; and Century, Florida; but she sometimes worked in New Orleans between shows.5 Billie's husband De De Pierce recalled that Edna worked four or five months with his band at the Cat a the Fiddle, on Dau phine in the French Quarter.6 Notes 1 Social Security Death Index contains information on an Edna Goodson who was born February 4, 1904, died January 1986. 2 Bill Grady, \"Kid Sheik and Sadie: Partners in Jazz.\" The Times -Picayune Saturday, April 28 1990: A -10. 3 Billie and De De Pierce, Oral History, October 7, 1959, also present: Ernest Trepagnier, PRC and RBA., Reel I -Summary -Retyped, 3. 4 Billie and De De Pierce, Oral History, April 2, 1959, interviewed by William Russell and Ralph Collins.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 286 Ida Goodson (pianist, organist) b. November 23, 1909 (Pensacola, Florida) / d. January 5, 2000 (Pensacola, Florida) Ida Goodson grew up in a musical family in Pensacola, Florida. See entries on her sisters: Edna Goodson , Sadie Goodson , and Billie Pierce , for addit ional information on the contributions of the Goodson sisters to New Orleans jazz. Ida Goodson was the youngest piano player in a family of pianists. Her mother Sarah Jenkins Goodson and father Hamilton Madison Goodson played piano in church, where her f ather was a deacon.1 Of the six piano -playing daughters -Mabel, Della, Sadie, Edna, Wilhelmina (Billie), and Ida (a seventh sister, Maggie, died young) -four defied their religious parents to play ragtime, boogie woogie, blues and jazz (Edna, Sadie, Billie, and Ida). Ida Goodson often told a story of playing jazz while their parents were out of the house, then \"when her parents showed up unexpectedly, th ey easily made the transition to gospel without missing a beat.\"2 There is excellent footage of Ida telling this story in the documentary, Wild Women Don't Have the Blues (1989). The sisters did not wholly rebel from their parents' devotion to religious music, however. Though she played ragtime, Della primarily playe d church music. And in the 1950s, Ida also largely gave up jazz in order to play religious music.3 Born in 1909 , Ida was the youngest of the Goodson sisters. By the time she was nine, her older sister Sadie was already playing jazz piano professionally in New A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 287 Orleans. Local and traveling jazz bands frequently played in Pensacola. Included among the New Orleans b ands that came through town, Ida remembered hearing Papa Celestin.4 Her mother and her sister Mabel died when she was nine (1918), and then, six years l ater, her father died (1924). Ida was compelled to quit school and go to work. She did a variety of jobs, including working as a babysitter, cook, and maid, and began playing piano professionally with traveling bands for dances and medicine shows.5 In an interview with Richard Allen on May 6, 1961, Ida recalled that her first band job was with R.D. Jordan, a drummer who led a six or seven piece band. She then played with Wally Mercy [?] for about 16 years. Her sister Billie Pierce recalled that Ida played in Pensacola bands, including a band with the great Pensacola saxophonist Wallace Rankin.6 She also played in the bands of Carl Davies and Hal Andrew. A self -taught pianist with her own approach to chords, Ida began with ragtime, then boogie woogie, swing, and gospel. While she learned the traditional styles, Pensacola bass player Harold Andrews said, \"She wasn't an old -timer. She changed with the times.\"7 Her sister Sadie Goodson recalled that unlike herself and Billie Pierce, who played in a traditional New Orleans style, Ida played modern jazz.8 Also differentiating her career from that of her two New Orleans based sisters, Ida chose to remain in the Pensacola area. She visited New Orleans, but did not play there.9 In her later years, she often played piano at Seville Quarter in Pensacola, a tavern called Rosie O'Grady's. In 1950s, gave up jazz and primarily played church music. Her own church was the Mount Olive Baptist Church in Pensacola, but she also played in several others.

June 9, 2002 (Detroit) Sadie Goodson grew up in a musical family in Pensacola, Florida. See entries on her sisters: Edna Goodson , Ida Goodson , and Billie Pierce , for additional information on the cont ributions of the Goodson sisters to New Orleans jazz. Sadie Goodson and her six piano -playing sisters were well -known in Jackson County, Florida, their home, as well as in New Orleans, where two of the sisters, Sadie and Billie (Pierce) became important p layers in 1920s and 1930s. Though all of the sisters were admired for their playing, Sadie often told interviewers that she was the best, and that people would say, \"We want Sadie!\"2 Their parents, Hamilton Madison Goodson and Sarah Jenkins Goodson, played piano in church, but of their six (living) piano -playing sisters -Mabel, Della, Sadie, Edna, Wilhelmina (Billie ), and Ida (a seventh sister, Maggie, died young) -four defied their religious parents to play ragtime, boogie woogie, blues and jazz (Edna, Sadie, Billie, and Ida). Sadie was the only one of the Goodson sisters to take formal piano lessons.3 She was also the first of two sisters to strike out for New Orleans (the second was Billie). Sadie began playing piano in the familys Pensacola, Florida, home at an early age (some sources say three, others say six).4 She began working professionally at a very early age, though the dates vary widely in her own accounts. She first worked A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 291 locally, with Pensacola bands and traveling bands on their Florida stop -overs, then began going out on the road. She was often the pianist that her younger sisters Billie and Edna heard when they snuck out of the house to go hear jazz.5 She worked primarily with Macks Merrymakers, led by Thomas Mack, (not to be confused with Mack and Mack, the group led by Billy and Mary McBride).6 Thomas Mack, a trumpet player, was from New Orleans, though the rest of the band was made up of musicians from the Pensacola area. The band spent most of its time on the road. Sadie had many opportunities to play with acts tha t traveled through Pensacola. When she was 16, she accompanied Bessie Smith. The same year, she was heard by the highly acclaimed New Orleans trumpeter Buddy Petit, who told her, \"You play too much piano to be in Pensacola. You come on to New Orleans. So I did. I came there on a train by myself. Sure did! I was 16 years old.\"7 In the 1920s, Sadie Goodson was one of the two female piano players who worked with Papa Celestin prior to Jeanette Kimball s tenure in the band. The other was Emma Barrett . Celestins band included drummer Abbey \"Bebe Chinee\" Foster, whom she married.8 She and Foster both played with Buddy Petit on the Steamer Madison , then, when Petit left the band to take work elsewhere, Sadie took over, leading the band throughout the twenties. Her sist er Billie filled in for her throughout an illness in 1929. She resumed the leadership of the band in 1930, and later with Kid Rena. In the mid -1930s, Sadie moved to New York, where she worked as a musician, trained to be a registered nurse, and struggled to make it as a single mother.9 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 292 In the 1950s, she married Thomas Peterson, a supervisor at Ford Motor Company , and moved to Detroit. In the Motor City, Sadie continued playing with New Orleans musicians, including Manny and Percy Gabriel. Her marriage lasted for 26 years, ending with Petersons death in 1982. The same year, an old friend, George \"Kid Sheik\" Co lar lost his spouse. \"Sheik,\" a trumpet player, had known Sadie Goodson in the 1920s, when they had played together in New Orleans. They married in 1982, and Sadie returned to New Orleans, where she and Colar played at Preservation Hall.10 Sadie Goodson is one of many 1920s musicians who enjoyed a successful comeback in New Orleans due to the New Orle ans revival, which saw the emergence of venues dedicated to traditional music -notably Preservation Hall. Benjamin Jaffe, whose parents founded Preservation Hall, described Sadies playing to film -maker Kay D. Ray as having a \"driving force,\" adding that s he was \"a loud pianist. Loud and extremely musical.\"11 Bruce Raeburn commented that she was one of the few fema le pianists of that generation who improvised.12 She recorded several times in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Sad ie was interviewed on ABCs \"Good Morning America,\" as one of the \"musicians without whom there wouldnt be a jazz festival.13 In 1994, she and her sister Ida appeared together at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. In the mid -1990s, Sadie and \"Kid Sheik\" moved to Detroit. \"Sheik\" preceded her in death. She died in Detroit at 101 years of age, five days after making a trip to New Orleans to attend a presentat ion at Preservation Hall. She had planned to attend a tribute to the Goodson Sisters presented by the Jazz Society of Pensacola on May 26, 2002, but had been too ill to attend. She died knowing that the Goodson Sisters would A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 293 continue to be remembered and celebrated for their musical contributions. Notes 1 1910 Census indicates she was seven years old, which would put her birth year at 1902 or 1903. Her obituaries, however, gave 1900 as her birth year, which was the year that she gave interviewers. 2 Sadie Goodson, interviewed by film -maker Kay D.

October 14, 1895 (New Orleans, Louisiana) / d. August 16, 1925 (Chicago, Illinois) Born to Rena and Victor Landreaux in 1895, Edna Landreaux (later Hicks) was the paternal half - sister of singer Lizzie Miles , seven months her junior. Edna married vaudevillian William Benbow when she was 15, and took to the road as Benbow and Landry.i Like many performers in the U.S. with non -Anglophone names, she adopted a stage name American audiences were more likely to remember and be able to pronounce: \"Landry,\" instead of \"Landreaux.\" After a year on the road, Edna convinced Lizzie to join the couple on the road. Lizzie would later describe Edna as a \"coon shouter,\" and tell about Edna's superior ability to roll her eyes while singing. Though identified as Creole in New Orleans, Edna and Lizzie were defined black in the U.S. at large. Like other black performers in the early twentieth century, they inherited the performance traditions of minstrelsy.ii Lizzie's recollections of her half -sister are meant to be complimentary, though they also serve as reminders of the performa nce context in which they grew up. Most music historians and critics have described Edna Hick as more of a blues singer on the spectrum of blues and vaudeville blues, with Lizzie Miles on the vaudeville end -though both singers performed blues and traveled on vaudeville. Lizzie married J.C. Miles, a band leader and producer of minstrel shows in the A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 297 \"colored annex\" of circuses. Both sisters were on the road throughout the teens -Edna on TOBA -Theater Owners Booking Association -vaudeville, and Lizzie with the circus. They apparently kept in touch, as suggested by a note in a newspaper column on June 27, 1914, in which Lizzie wrote that she would like to hear from her sister, \"Edna Benbow, of the team Benbow and Landry.\"iii Edna traveled and appeared in shows in new York between 1916 and 1919, then moved her base to Chicago, though she continued to travel the TOBA circuit. In the early twenties, she married her second husband John Hicks. Edna Hicks began a brief but prodigious recording career. In New York, she recorded with Porter Grainger in December 1923, and in 1924, with Fletcher Henderson. By the spring of 1924, she had moved back to Chicago where her career showed no sign of slowing. She recorded once with Lovie Austin , then died in a fire in a household accident when she was only 29. All of her recordings except for the Austin dates are available on CD as of this writing .

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 299 Rosalind Johnson (piano, song writer, vocalist) b.. circa 1890 (New Orleans) / d. ? Rosalind Johnson grew up on Gasket Street (now Cleveland Street). After her parents died, she was raised by her mother's sister and her husband in a very musical family that included several piano playing cousins. Although her interview does not specify the names of her family, a Rosa Johnson (born January 1890) appears in the 1900 Census, living with her aunt and uncle, Patrick and Emma Winford, on 1218 S. Robertson Str eet in the 2nd Ward.i Rosalind played piano throughout her childhood, and studied piano at Straight University on Can al Street. As she explained to William Russell, she became interest ed in playing in Storyville when a girl she knew by the name of Ossie found such work and told her about it. Her friend found her a job at May Tuckerman's sporting house on Conti Street in Storyville. Her aunt and uncle were furious and threw her out of the house, expecting her to ab andon the idea and come home. Instead, \"Miss May,\" Tuckerman fixed her a room so she could keep working at her establishment. \"Finally, my aunt came and got me. I was loaded with money, all my tips and salary. So I went back home and they agreed to let me come into the world and play.\"ii While she was playing at May Tuckerman' s in about 1911 or 1912, she struck up a friendship with Jelly Roll Morton. She sometimes played in theaters, which closed at 11:00 pm, then played in the District from 11:30 until morning. She also played at A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 300 sporting houses of Gypsy Shafer, May Evans, H ilma Bart, and Eloise Blankenstein. Although Lulu White usually only hired white entertainers, she would sometimes have Johnson play at her establishment. \"Sometimes I could get a job where a Negro man couldn't, because they were very partial at one time .\"iii Johnson also played for touring shows on vaudeville, traveling extensively on the rugged TOBA (Theater Owners Booking Association) circuit. In her interview with William Russell, Johnson spoke very positively about the work she found as a pianist in the sporting houses. \"I didn't have to worry about no job. If they made me mad in the theater, the red light district would beckon to me.\"iv She recalled the rules as very strict in the big sporting houses. \"A girl could not curse in those parlors. You couldn't smoke a cigarette ... and you couldn't get drunk.\"v Music was n eeded for dancing, and it was needed in private parlors. Lulu White's Mahogany Hall, and other high class establishments, would have several private parlors, each with a piano and piano player. Johnson remembered some other women entertainers in Storyvil le, including May Wilson and Daisy Toledo, neither of whom played piano, but both of whom she admired. Johnson, herself, could sing and play, but did not dance. She was also a song writer, claiming to be the author of \"I'm So Glad I'm Brownskin.\" By the 1970s, she was working as a maid.

Williams Research Center. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 302 Jeanette Salvant Kimball (piano, organ) b. December 18, 1908 (Pass Christian, Mississippi) / d. March 29, 2001 (Charleston, South Carolina) Jeanette Salvant was raised by her mother, Susan \"Susie\" Salvant, a cook for a private family, and her father Jul ius \"June\" Salvant, a carpenter, along with her older sister, Octavia, and two younger brothers, Julius and Gaines. Listed in the U.S. census variously as \"B\" for black and \"Mu\" for mulatto, the Salvants were English speakers, with French Creole of color heritage. Both Susan and Julius Salvant had been born in Louisiana, but had relocated to Pass Christian, in Harrison County, Mississippi. Located less than 70 miles east of New Orleans, Pass Christian was a logical stop along the way for New Orleans band s on Gulf Coast tours, making the small town conducive to an introduction to jazz in the early 1900s. Jeanette's strict upbringing prevented her from attending public dances where these traveling groups played -even in her late teens -but she was able to he ar these bands, including Sam Morgan's, Kid Rena's, Tom Albert's, and, later, Papa Celestin's when they would ballyhoo their way through town. To ballyhoo is to advertise a band's wares by playing from the backs of trucks. It is doubtful that she heard t he role of the piano in these bands, or saw the pianists (who were frequently women) since pianos were not generally carted along on these mobile previews -of-coming attractions.1 But she did gain a familiarity with the music of New Orleans jazz bands from hearing their piano -less ensembles, quite A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 303 literally as they traveled through town. Jeanette's own musica l life began quite early, despite the fact that she was the only person in her family whose interest in music was more than casual.2 In addition to hearing jazz bands on the backs of trucks, she gained exposure to music from the Catholic church, social, and school events, from the records that her family had at home, and from piano lesso ns. Her sister Octavia, who was three years older, took piano lessons, but only Jeanette became a serious musician.3 Her mother decided to get her a music teacher when Jeanette proved her talents by playing the piano when they visited other people's houses.4 She began taking lessons at age seven, and was teaching music by the time she was fourteen.5 In one interview, she told of a music class she taught to children and adults at the age of eleven.6 Throughout her life, she would continue to study music, and to play at ho me alone. She enjoyed all kinds of styles besides jazz, including classical, semi -classical, and opera.7 Kimball regularly credited her piano teacher with giving her the training that would solidify her reputation as a player who could sight -read anything and transpose on the spot. \"I had a good teacher,\" she wrote to historian D. Antoinette Handy. \"Her name was Anna Stewart, a graduate of Boston Conservatory. And I just loved music always and had a natural talent from God, which my deceased mother recognized --God bless her soul.\"8 In another interview, she said that Stewart was a graduate of the New England Conservatory, rather than the Boston Conservatory.9 In either case, it seems that Stewart was a conservatory trained musician, who did not only teach her gifted student classical piano technique, but instructed her in music theory, transposition, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 304 bass, and harmony.10 In fact, Stewart's method, which Kimball would continue to uphold, began with a strong foundation in music theory.11 Kimball told William Russell that she \"lived at the piano\" when she began taking lessons from Anna Stewart, that she took three lessons a week, for which Stewart charged a weekly total of fifty cents. She recalled that while boys as well as girls took piano lessons in her home town, there were more girls. She also remembered another talented piano student, Ruby May Townsend, who became a public school music teacher later on.12 Jeanette gained ensemble experience as a child, when she played in a string band consisting of Harry Watson, mandolin and leader; Eddie Watson, guitar; Henry Watson, banjo; Murray bass, and herself on piano.13 This band played at a hotel, the Inn by the Sea.14 Though some accounts say 1925, and others 1926, it was probably the summer or fall of 1925 when Papa \" Oscar\" Celestin stopped long enough on one of his trips through Pass Christian to audition a new pianist for the band he was in the process of reorganizing.15 Celestin had parted ways with his longtime co -leader of the Original Tuxedo Orchestra, trombonist William \"Bebe\" Ridg ely, who had managed to retain the name of the band, plus many of the musicians, including the pianist, Emma Barrett .16 Celestin worked with s everal pianists after that, including Manuel Manetta, but was seeking a permanent person for the band. On the recommendation of a friend of the Salvants' in New Orleans, Celestin, along with his alto saxophonist Paul Barnes paid a visit to audition Jeanet te in her home. She had just graduated from high school. Although she was accustomed to sheet music scored specifically for piano, she was able to sight -read the orchestrations that Celestin put in front of her. The orchestra A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 305 leader made the same promis e he had previously made Emma Barrett's mother: if her daughter could join his orchestra, he would personally look out for her safety. There had been at least two women pianists in Celestin's band before Salvant, including Barrett and Sadie Goodson. Even though Jeanette was in her late teens and had never been far from home, her mother allowed her to join the band, in part because of Celestin's promise, and also because the family had many relatives and friends in New Orleans. In fact, Jeanette would liv e with a friend of her mother's until she married Narvin Kimball in 1929.17 Celestin's new eight -piece band was called the Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra, and competed with Ridgely's Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra for what were known as \"society\" j obs. Jeanette Kimball would recall her first job with Celestin as an engagement at the Pythian Temple Roof Garden where Manuel Perez's band was also playing. Mercedes Fields was Perez's pianist, and remembered this job as being September 19, 1926. Howev er, as Jempe de Donder points out, this may be a few months off, since her first recording with Celestin took place in April 1926.18 Besides Celestin, on trumpet and cornet, the band included Paul Barnes (alto sax), Sidney Carrere (tenor s ax), John Marrero (banjo), Simon Marrero (bass or tuba), August Rousseau (trombone), Abbey \"Chinee\" Foster (drums), and Jeanette Kimball piano. The band played mostly stock arrangements, though sometimes Paul Barnes and John Marrero wrote for the band. T his band played society jobs, Carnival balls for both black and white organizations, and on the Capitol river boat. More recordings would follow, also for Columbia, in 1927 and 1928.19 Among the tunes she recalled recording with A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 306 the band were \"Station Calls,\" written by John Marrero, and Paul Barnes's \"My Josephine.\" Two or three years after she joined, Celestin switched to a larger 14 -piece band format. The larger band did not perform stock arrangements as had the previous group, but played special arrangem ents by alto saxophonist Cecil Thornton. Jeanette remembered enjoying Thornton's arrangements because the piano parts were challenging. John Marrero and Paul Barnes had left by this time. Banjo player Narvin Kimball, whom Jeanette would marry in 1929, w as hired to fill the vacancy left by Marrero. The personnel changed frequently at this point. Jeanette, who sang as well as played piano when she lived in Pass Christian, also sang some with the big band.20 Celestin's larger band toured a great deal. Narvin Kimball recalled that in 1929 or 1930 the band began playing at hotels in Biloxi, Mississippi.21 Narvin recalled that Jeanette's skills were well suited for traveling. \"One thing that she could do at sight ... when you'd go in certain places the pianos weren't tuned correctly. She would make immediate transposing. She was a very good musician.\"22 Jeanette Kimball told William Russell that the band was kept constantly busy, and traveled throughout the South.23 The band toured Mexico in 1932.24 Jeanette played in the big band until 1935 . She quit to raise her two daughters , but continued to take college courses, in music and other subjects. This is not to say that she quit playing during this period altogether. On the contrary, she taught music and took what playing jobs that she could d o while raising her children. She became the organist and choir director of the Holy Ghost Catholic Church. In 1946, she played A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 307 with a six -piece group led by Buddy Charles at the Dew Drop Inn. Then from 1949 -53, she played with Herbert Leary's dance ba nd. She referred to these bands as \"stationary\" bands since they didn't require her to travel.25 She and Narvin co - composed \"My Memphis Baby. \" The marriage to Narvin did not last, but she retained the name Kimball. She also taught her own girls piano during this time period, but interestingly, did not want them to be professional musicians. After a nineteen year break from Celestin's orches tra, Jeanette rejoined his band in 1953.26 On May 8, 1953, Jeanette was at the piano when Papa Celestin's band played at the White House for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She recorded several times in the 1950s for the Southland label: including the sides issued on l.p. as Papa Celestin's Golden Wedding , which included the popular recording of \"Marie Leveaux,\" named for the famous vodoun priestess of New Orleans. Celestin died in December 1954. The band continued under the leadership of Eddie Pierson, then Albert \"Papa\" French, though it continued to be called the Celestin band. Jeanette played with this ban d until 1977, while also playing and recording with other groups. She traveled a great deal while playing in the Celestin \"ghost\" band, including tours of the British West Indies, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland.27 In the 1970s she was one of the pianists most in demand in New Orleans, for both gigs and re cordings. In 1979, she became a member of the newly formed Original Camillia Band, led by English trumpeter Clive Wilson. She became one of the regular players at Preservation Hall with two different bands: Clive Wilson's Original Camillia A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 308 Jazz Band, an d Kid Sheik . She traveled to Paris with the Preservation Hall Jazz band in 1979. According to Benjamin Jaffe, Kimball was \"highly regarded as a musical innovator in New Orleans traditional jazz.\" He recalled her as \"a very dignified person. Always very well-dressed. A stickler for doing things the right way.\"28 In February and March of 1980, Jeanette recorded an album under her own name, Sophisticated Lady (New Orleans NOR 7208). Primarily a trio and quartet setting with her colleagues from the Originally Camillia Jazz Band, this album leaves an excellent record of her piano style. One reviewer wrote, \"Jeanette Kimball's style is unique. Her very extensive background in all styles of music has allowed her to move a considerable distance from the usual New Orleans style of jazz piano. She plays in a clipped, staccato manner with a very unusual approach to the rhythm.\" The reviewer praised her ability to \"build tension and interest\" by varying her relationship to the beat, a little ahead, or a little behind.29 When Kimball beg an having health problems In the late 1990s, her daughters Barbara Massey and Evangeline Kimball Donnelley convinced her to retire. Kimball left New Orleans to divide her time between her daughters and their families in Ohio and South Carolina. She died at the age of 94 on March 29, 2001. \"She only retired three or four years ago when I removed her from New Orleans bodily,\" Massey said.30 She only missed two things about New Orleans: Preservation Hall and the Holy Ghost Catholic Church. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 309 Notes 1 Bruce Raeburn confirms that the photographic evidence would indicate that pianos were not placed on trucks for the purposes of advertising a band, even if the band's instrumentation included piano. Pianos were hard enough to keep in tune in the Louisiana (and Mississippi) humidity without driving them around in the backs of truck s on bumpy roads!

Marshall Maurice Kimble (Kimball, Anita Margaret Isabelle Marshall) (pianist, music teacher) b. July 14, 1885 ( ca 1886,1896)1, New Orleans / d. ? Little is known of pianist Margaret Kimble, except that she was well regarded as the pianist in violinist John Robichauxs Lyric Theater Orchestra in the 1920s. The Lyric Theater, located at 201 Burgundy Street, was a black vaudeville theater on the Theat er Owners Booking Association (TOBA) circuit. The acts traveled through town, but the pit orchestra stayed put, and was led by John Robichaux from the opening of the theater in 1918 to 1926. We do know that when Margaret joined the band circa 1923, she was Margaret Maurice. When she left the orchestra in 1925 or 1926, she was Margaret Kimble, married to Robichauxs cornetist, Andrew Kimble . While researching the Lyric Theater, historian Lynn Abbott made some pertinent discoveries regarding Margaret Kim ble. One of these was the spelling of her name. References to Andrew and Margaret Kimble had been routinely transcribed from oral histories as \"Kimball,\" do doubt due to other well -known Kimballs in New Orleans jazz, including Narvin Kimball, Jeanette Ki mball, and Henry Kimball. Narvin Kimballs oral history further confused this matter with the story of why he thought he might be related to Andrew Kimble. While consulting the \"digest\" of the oral history tape, the story seems like a point of fact, but on listening to the tape itself, Abbott found the story to be inconclusive. Andrews brother was named Henry, and Narvins father and grandfather A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 315 were both named Henry, but the connection remains mysterious.2 City directories, as well as a signed note in the John Robichaux Collection at Hogan Jazz Archive, clearly spell Andrew s last name as \"Kimble.\"3 Additionally, Abbott determined that Margaret Kimbles maiden name was probably Marshall, a fact that is confirmed by the Census.4 Her mother was Frances Sheldon (or Shelden) Marshall and her father was Joseph Marshall, to whom she was one of at least six daughters.5 Drumm er Alfred Williams recalled in his 1961 oral history that she was from a large family.6 In 1910, she was living with her parents as Margaret Maurice, along with her husband, R aoul Maurice, and two daughters, Ellen and Geraldine. Soon afterward, as Margaret M. Maurice and Margaret Marshall -Maurice, she ran elegant advertisements for her services as a concert pianist, accompanist, and piano teacher, from her studio at 1419 Burde tte Street, in the 1912 and 1914 issues of the Woods Directory: Being as Colored Business, Professional and Trade Directory of New Orleans, Louisiana .7 Both ads feature photographs of her wearing a long white dress, sitting at an upright piano in what appears to be a living room or parlor. Crisp sheet music catches the light from a nearby window. Raoul Maurice shows up in the city directories, as an inspector at the Customs House, and sharing the 1419 Burdette Street address in 1913. A search of marriage license records confirms that Margaret A. V. Marshal l married Raoul Maurice on December 24, 1906. Her age was given as 21, and his as 28.8 In the 1916 and 1918 city directories, Raoul appears to be living at 1419 Burdette alone. In 1920, the city directory lists Raoul on B urdette, while Mrs. Margaret Maurice is listed as a musician living at 2225 Valence. The 1920 Census, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 316 however, shows Margaret Maurice, music teacher, age 34, to be living with her parents, Joseph Marshall and Frances Sheldon (or Shelden) Marshall at 2530 Cadiz. Also living with them are Margarets two daughters, Helen Maurice, age 12; and Geraldine Maurice, age 10.9 In 1924, the city directory lists Margaret Maurice as a musician at the Lyric Theater, living at 2530 Cadiz; Andrew Kimble is listed in 1924 also as musician at the Lyric Theater, living at 7701 Oak. It seems likely that Margaret separated from Raoul Maurice around 1915, and married Andrew Kimble around 1925, during the time they both played in John Robichauxs highly acclaimed orchestra at the Lyric Theater. Reviews of Robichauxs orchestra identify Margaret Maurice by name when praising the group. A reporter for the Chicago Defender October 20, 1923, wrote . Prof. John P. Robichaux, violinist, has gotten together five of the best musicians beside himself, and jazz is their middle name. With Mrs. Margaret Maurice at the piano they simply walk their ways into hearts of a music mad city, the New York of the South.\"10 On April 4, 1925, the Chicago Defender called Robichauxs orchestra \"one of the best in the city,\" and \"Miss [sic] at marvel.\"11 Alex Bigard remembered the Robichauxs Lyric Theater Orchestra of those years as consisting of John Robichaux, leader and violin; Andrew Louis Nelson, clarinet. He also recalled that Robichaux was a rigorous leader, who rehearsed the band, yet expected the players to sight -read well enough to bring them different music to the performance than what they had rehearsed. The orchestra never appeared as an act on the stage, but played for all the acts, as well as performing the ir A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 317 own numbers from the pit.12 The post -Lyric years are sketchy. Margaret Kimble left the Lyric with Andrew Kimble around 1925 or 1926. The couple took a job in Hot Springs, Arkansas. According to trumpet player Charlie Love, this was a two or three month job, and when Lucius Wilson hi red the Kimbles, Robichaux replaced them with Love and pianist May Neely. The Kimbles later moved to the Shreveport.13 Some accounts say that Andrew died shortly thereafter, but th e public records show that he died in New Orleans, February 1942.14 Andrew Kimbl e (mus ician) and Margaret (whose occupation is not listed) appear in the 1940 Soards Directory as living at 3313 Baronne in New Orleans In 1942, the directory lists only Margaret Kimble, 3313 Baronne, working as a maid.15 Notes 1 Al Rose and Edmond Souchon list her birth year as ca. 1896, but Census and Marriage License records both indicate that she was more likely born in 1885 or 1886.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 320 Lizzie Miles ([nee Elizabeth Mary Landreaux] Miles Pajaud [aka Mandy Smith]) (vocalist, song writer) b. March 31, 1895 (New Orleans, Louisiana) / d. March 17, 1963 (New Orleans, Louisiana) Elizabeth Mary Landreaux is the given name for the singer better known as Lizzie Miles; also known as \"the Creole Songbird,\" and , internationally, as the \"Black Rose of Paris.\" Lizzie was born in 1895 to Victor Landreaux and Ramise Fazende in New Orleans, most likely at 1508 Bourbon Street.1 The year after she was born, the U.S. Supreme Court would decide against a case brought by another Creole of color from New Orleans, Homer Pless y; in the disastrous ruling that launched the legally mandated black/white segregation that would be known as Jim Crow. While Lizzies parents grew up with a strong sense of themselves as Creole, Lizzie entered a world that would see her as black, and as a member of a class of segregated second -class citizens, a factor that would greatly affect her life as a traveling entertainer in the first decades of the twentieth century. Lizzie grew up in the Seventh Ward, part of an impressive generation within an extended musical family. At least three of her siblings were active participants in early New Orleans jazz. Her paternal half -sister, only seven months older than Lizzie, was Edna Landreaux (later Edna Hicks), who would become a great blues singer and who se brief but brilliant career would help to launch Lizzies own. In her oral history, she A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 321 recalled that her mother sometimes sang Creole songs in public settings.2 When Lizzie was four, her mother married another man named Victor, who also lived in the Seventh Ward: Victor Morand, with whom she had several children. Lizzie would spend the remainder of her childhood growing up in a family that included her younger maternal half -brothers, Herb Morand, who would become a renowned New Orleans trumpeter an d leader of the Harlem Hamfats, and drummer, Morris (Maurice) Morand.3 Earlier in this report, the important role of the Catholic church in New Orleans musical life was noted. This is certainly apparent in the early musical life of Lizzie Miles, which began, in fact, as an off -shoot of her early religious training in the Cat holic faith. As one writer put it, \"she strengthened her powerful voice each day by chanting sacred hymns in catechism classes, plus shouting robust ditties during the evenings at house parties, lawn dances and traditional Saturday night fish -fries, sizzl ing with ragtime dance bands.\"4 Her catechism teacher, Mrs. Atkins, taught singing and also produced concerts at which the children made money. Lizzie sang, at first in lawn parties, but later in pre -ball concerts held at Franc Amis Hall, LEquite Hall, Artisan Hall, and other halls, in the process working with Joe (later \"King\") Oliver, Kid Ory, Alphonse Picou, Manuel Perez, and Bunk Johnson. She also sang in concerts in public parks and at theaters, such as the Pythian Theater. In an interview with Richard B. Allen, she recalled th at she made fifty cents at first, but that her wages increased.5 Another place where she was exposed to music was at the French opera, where her aunt, Corinne Levieller Fazande, was a maid for actresses, and where Lizzie sold A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 322 candy when she was 12 or 13.6 In 1910, Lizzies half -sister Edna Land reaux left New Orleans with a vaudeville troop and beckoned Lizzie to follow. According to the 1910 Census, fifteen -year-old Lizzie was living on Claiborne Street that year with her mother, her step -father, and their children.7 But soon thereafter, she would be on the road with her half -sister who was now married to a vaudevillian named William Benbow. Lizzie traveled with them on the Tri-State Circuit, the first black vaudeville route.8 By 1914, Lizzie had married J.C. Miles, a band leader and minstrel show producer, and was traveling with him in a troupe called the Alabam a Minstrels. Some sources mistakenly claim that J.C. Miles was her father, but Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff have corrected the record: J.C. Miles was Lizzies first husband. In April 1914, Lizzie and her husband joined up with Jones Bros and Wilsons Thr ee-Ring Circus, where J.C. Miles was in charge of the circus minstrel band and show. It was not uncommon in the teens and 1920s for white circuses in the U.S. to include a black minstrel show as a part of the side -show.9 Lizzie p erformed in the \"colored annex\" of circuses in minstrel shows from 1914 -1918.10 As a black performer in th e side -show of a white circus, Lizzie did not simply sing, but also acted in the black minstrel show, sometimes performing the role of the interlocutor. She also performed a variety of circus staples, including a slack wire act, danced, and working with a nimal acts, including the elephants. One of her specialties was singing while riding a horse bareback as pigeons landed on her shoulders. Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff described the behind -the-scenes working A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 323 conditions as \"a grueling succession of one nigh t stands, working six nights a week, traveling by rail living out of a Pullman coach.\"11 The work was seasonal, so the performers, including Lizzie and J.C. Miles, had to scramble for other work during the winter mo nths. In 1918, disaster struck. While on a train headed for Shreveport for the winter season, Lizzie and her husband and all of the trains passengers, for that matter, fell victim to the Spanish flu epidemic. Tragically, J.C. Miles died on October 19, 1918. Lizzie was placed in a sanatorium in a small town, where she promised God that if she survived the Spanish flu, she would \"never set foot on a stage again.\"12 She returned to New Orleans to recuperate. Lizzie would keep her promise to God, but apparently didnt consider singing with bands in cabarets or dance halls to be the same as the theatrical stage. In 1919, she was singing with Arnold Metoyers band at the Pythian Temple Roof Garden. She traveled to Chicago, where she worked at the Dreamland with Joe \"King\" Oliver, singing in his band that included Louis Armstrong and Lil Hardin.13 In Chicago, she also worked with Freddy Keppard at Entertainers, and at the Deluxe. She then traveled to New York, where she encountered the problem of New Orleans musicians always being expected to play Dixieland.14 In 1922, Lizzie Miles made her first record in New York City, \"Muscle Shoals Blues\" (Okeh), launching what became an impressive, if chronologically concentrated, recording career. She made dozens of recordings in New York in the 1920s. She said that her singing style was inspired by Sophie Tucker, whom she saw perform at the Palace Theater, and by Tillie Johnson, a New Orleans blues singer. Her repertoire would encompass the range of vaudeville offerings, includin g vaudeville blues A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 324 and ragtime material, but also French Creole songs. She once told Carey James Tate, \"I sing love songs -sad songs -torchy songs better. I guess its because I had such a hard, sad life from as far back as I can remember. Most of these songs bring memories.\"15 In her study of the classic blues singers of the 1920s, Daphne Duval Harrison categorizes Lizzie Miles as one of the \"caba ret blues singers such as Lucille Hegamin\" who \"deserve credit for popularizing and standardizing blues performance so it became a staple in American song repertoire.\"16 Her international popularity was secured when she made the first blues record released in England, with her 1923 recording, \"Youre Always Messin Around With My Man.\" In 1924, Lizzie Miles traveled to Paris. Billed as the Bla ck Rose, or \"La Rose Noire,\" Lizzie worked in a night club called Chez Mitchell, operated by an American, Louis Mitchell, where she sang in both English and in Creole French. As a songwriter, she co -wrote \"Haitian Blues\" with Spencer Williams. She return ed to New York in 1927, where she made several more records. She recorded with King Oliver in 1928. In 1929, she found very few opportunities to record, but among them were records that she had Jelly Roll Morton made together, \"Dont Tell Me Nothin Bout My Man\" and \"I Hate a Man Like You\" (Victor -38571).17 , Zutty Singleton said that Lizzie Miles was Jelly Roll Morton's favorite vocalist.18 With the Depression, Lizzie Miles fell on hard times, finding it difficult to get recording dates throughout the 1930's. Some sources state that she was employ ed as a domestic worker during part of this time. She finally began to record again in Chicago in the late 1930s, but returned to New Orleans in 1942 when her mother became ill. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 325 She worked as a barmaid while caring for her mother until she died on May 15, 1945. Lizzie Miles was an avid letter -writer throughout her life. In the 1940s, she focused her letter -writing on revitalizing her career. She wrote to Ebony Magazine in the late 1940s trying to get publicity. Fortunately, she was still writing letter s and still trying to get work as a singer, when the post -war New Orleans Revival hit, bringing a new audience hungry for music from the 1920s. In 1951, a New Orleans disk jockey helped her to make her comeback.19 With nothing else to wear in the spotlight, she costumed herself in dramatic 1920s dresses she had purchased for her mother in Paris. She began recording again, making some extremely popular albums for the Cook label. Jon Newlin described her 1950s recordings as \"saloon -sporting -house -boarding house - parlor repertoire de livered by a singer who seems complete at peace.\"20 A rapid -fire correspondence between Lizzie Miles and George Hoefer, collected at the Institute for Jazz Studies, well illustrates how seriously s he pursued her desire to take an active role in her career during her come -back. Now in her sixties, she became a darling of the media, with features in Hue, Time , and, finally, Ebony , which ran a two -part feature on her in 1955. Lizzie Miles performed at Tony Almericos Sunday afternoon jam sessions on Royal Street in 1957. New Orleans revivalist fans loved her performances, they loved her wardrobe, and they loved news about her eccentricities. They loved her when the 72-year old star checked into the Y WCA instead of a hotel while on a New York tour in 1957.21 In 1958, she turned down Joe Glaser when he wanted to pu t her in a Broadway Show.22 She told the powerful agent about her promise to God that she wouldnt A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 326 perform on stage if he would deliver her home from the deadly flu epidemic that brought her off the road in 1918. But the flu epidemic story was no mere eccentricity, and she seems to have embraced it at a new level at the end of the decade. When she was invited by the New Orleans Jazz Club to sing in 1959, she said she wouldnt do it unless she could sing from the audience. Again, her reasons was her promise to God in 1918 that if He let her live, she would never sing on the stage again.23 She appeared with Celestins band at Tulane University on April 5, 1959, giving a performance described by one reviewer a s \"what was probably the finest jazz session ever heard on Tulane Campus.\" The reviewer claimed that Lizzie Miles \"was in rare, rare form. She gave out that powerful shouting voice as we have not heart for many years! Probably the spirit which the band h ad established worked its way right into her soul, for she has never sung better or more generously.\"24 In 1960, she refused Bill Russells request to conduct an oral history with her.25 She was living alone at 1214 N. Tonti, and working with the nuns two blocks away at the Lafon Catholic Old Folks Home of the Holy Family, and did not wish to talk about jazz anymore. In 1961, she declined an invitation to the Grand Opening of the New Orleans Jazz Museum with the following explanation: \"I have chosen to live the life of a nun. Not a modern one, but an old -fashioned Godly one, and have given up the outside world...It's my way of thanking Him for all His wonderful blessings.\"26 On March 17, 1963, she wasnt feeling well. She went over to the Lafon home, where she read her prayer book, then went to sleep, and died at the age of 67. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 327 Her obituary in the Times -Picayune stated, \"Famed blues singer Lizzie Miles, who devoted her final years to prayers for these troubled times, died at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, at the Lafon Catholic Old Folks H ome of the Holy Family.\"27 Notes 1 Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff, \"Lizzie Miles: Her Forgotten Career in Circus Side - Show Minstrelsy, 1914 -1918,\" 78 Quarterly vol. 1, no. 7, 1992, 61. 2 Lizzie Miles, oral history, January 18, 1951.

March 30, 1888 (New Orleans, Louisiana) / d. April 27, 1982 (Washington, D.C.) While not a jazz musician, Camille Lucie Nickerson is an extremely important figure in New Orleans musi c history. She was born i n New Orleans to Aurelie Duconge and William Joseph Nickerson, in 1888. Her mother died when Camille was eight. In 1902, Professor Nickerson, a renowned music teacher and violinist , married Julia Ellen Lewis, also a music teacher and musician ( cello and voice) . Lewis joined the all-woman concert group founded by her new husband, the Nickerson Ladies Orchestra , in which her stepdaughter, Camille, had been pianist since she was a child, (Kennedy says nine - years -old, Handy says 1900, which she would have been twelve).1 Camille Nickerson became one of New Orleanss most influential music educators, an important musicologist of Creo le of color songs, and a founder of the B - Sharp Club, an organization dedicated to appreciation and support of \"Negro Music.\" While the club was not so interested in jazz in its early days, it promoted interest in African American music including classica l music, spirituals, and Creole of color songs. It also raised money to support causes of interest to African Americans, such as the scholarship fund of the National Association of Negro Musicians, the NAACP, and the Anti-Lynching Fund.2 Camille Nickerson s father, William Joseph Nickerson, was a violinist and A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 333 composer, as well as an extremely important music teacher in turn -of-the-century New Orleans. While not a jazz musician, many of his pupils became important figures in New Orleans jazz, including Jel ly Roll Morton, Emma Barrett, Henry Kimball, and Manuel Manetta. In an interview, Manetta recalled that around 1905, \"...I was taking lessons from Professor Nickerson on the piano.... his son played violin, and his daughter was a pianist, greatest pianis t they had around here.\" 3 In 1912, Camille Nickerson left the Nickerson Ladies Orchestra to attend Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio , where she received a BA in Music in 1916. She returned to New Orleans, where she taught with her father from 1916 until 1926 at the Nickerson School of Music and founded the B -Sharp Music Club in February 1917. In 1921, the club gave its first rec ital, and joined the National Association of Negro Musicians, becoming that organizations New Orleans Branch. The next year, they started giving monthly free concerts. In 1951, the club started granting scholarships for college music students. Mostly c lassical, but the program of the Friday, April 2, 1976 concert at the New Orleans Theatre of the Performing Arts includes spirituals, gospel, ragtime, jazz, blues, and soul.4 During the time period in which she taught with her father in New Orleans, she returned to Oberlin for a year in 1923. In that year, she was elected as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of N egro Musicians. In 1926, she was elected as Secretary, and in 1930, she was elected Vice president, and in 1944, she was elected President. In 1926, she accepted a position at Howard University, and moved to A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 334 Washington D.C. where she taught piano, organ, and teaching methods until 1962. In 1930, concerned that the Creole songs were dying, she pursued and received a fellowship to travel for a year and collect and transcribe Cre ole music. She published many C reole songs, and wrote a masters thesis: Africo -Creole Music in Louisiana (masters thesis, Oberlin, 1932). In 1932, she received a Master of Music degree from Oberlin. She began to perform Creole songs as \"The Louisiana Lady,\" in order to educate the public about Creole songs and to keep them alive. On April 22, 1982, she died of pneumonia at Howard University Hospital.

June 8, 1907 (Marianna, Florida) / d. September 29, 1974 (New Orleans, Louisiana) Wilhelmina \"Billie\" Goodson was born on June 8, 1907, in her mothers hometown of Marianna, Florida, and raised in Pensacola where she became a key member of a large music al family, famous for its piano -playing daughters. There were six children in the family, all girls, all pianists (a seventh daughter, Maggie, died young): Mabel (b. 1899), Della (1901) , Sadie (1903), Edna (1904), Billie (1907), and Ida (1909). Only one sister, Sadie, had lessons. The others learned piano from their very religious parents, Madison H. Goodson and Sarah Jenkins Goodson, who played hymns and sang in the choir in the Baptis t church where Madison Goodson was a Deacon.1 See entries on Edna Goodson , Ida Goodso n, and Sadie Goodson , for additional information on the contributions of the Goodson sisters to New Orleans jazz. As the second to the youngest Goodson sister, the piano legacy was well established by the time Billie came along. Even though Madison and S arah Goodson disapproved of ragtime, blues, and jazz, Billie recalled that she could pick out the blues on the piano before she could talk.2 According to Billie, the greatest piano player of the sisters was Mabel, then the next greatest was Sadie.3 Mabel, who died at age 19, didnt play with bands, but played piano at house parties. Della played mostly for church, but also played ragtime.4 Though her parents only played religious music, Billie A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 338 and her sisters were drawn to ragtime jazz, plentiful in Pensacola when th e girls were growing up. Their father wouldnt let them go hear the bands, but Billie and Edna would sometimes slip out of the house to listen to jazz. Sometimes, they would spot their sister Sadie playing in the band.5 As with many Gulf Coast towns of the teens and twenties, local bands and traveling bands played year roun d. Pensacola bands playing in the ragtime jazz style included those led by George Douglas Orchestra and Joe Jesse. Traveling groups from New Orleans included the bands of Papa Celestin, Buddy Petit, and Kid Rena.6 There were locally grown jazz bands in Florida in those days that used the same instrumentation as the New Orleans bands, but Pierce t old Bill Russell that the New Orleans bands had something special. There were, she recalled, about two bands a week from New Orleans coming through Florida, notably the one led by the celebrated cornetist Buddy Petit.7 As a teenager Billie worked with traveling shows on the Florida legs of their tours, and also filled in for piano players a t Pensacolas Belmont Theater, as did her sisters (though by 1916, Sadie had moved on to New Orleans). At the age of 15, Billie was traveling her older sister Edna on a Florida tour with The Mighty Wiggle Carnival, owned by Jack Shaffer. The Show travele d widely across the south, but Billie recalled working only in Florida. Billie played organ, sang, and danced, and Edna danced and played with the band in the \"colored minstrel show.\" In Pensacola, Billie remembered working with Macks Merrymakers (led b y trumpet player Thomas Mack - her sister Sadie worked primarily with this band) and Mack and Mack (Billy and Mary Mack), with whom she appeared at the Belmont Theater in Pensacola.8 She sat in with A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 339 \"Papa\" Celestin when he came through Florida.9 Billies opportunity to accompany Bessie Smith occurred while she was working in the chorus of Smiths show in Florida when she was 15. The pianist was Clarence Williams, but he suffered a heart at tack, and Billie sat in. She recalled that Bessie sang \"Whoah, Tillie, Wont You Take Your Time\" and \"Gulf Coast Blues.\" Billie liked very few singers. In one interview, she recalled liking both Ma Rainey (for her voice and power) and Bessie Smith (for her feeling), but no other singers. In another interview, she was ambivalent about Ma Rainey, but recalled liking Ida Cox and Bessie Smith.10 In 1929, Billie was working in a nine -piece band called the Nighth awks Orchestra in Birmingham, Alabama, when she received word that her older sister, Sadie, who was working on the steamer Madison with trumpet player Buddy Petit, had fallen ill and needed a replacement. Billie took off for New Orleans, where she played in the band on the Steamer Madison until Sadie rallied. Also in the band was Sadies husband, Abbey \"Chinee\" Foster (drums). After Sadies return, Billie worked briefly with trumpet player Lawrence Toca, then returned to Birmingham to rejoin the Nighthaw ks. She also toured Florida with Macks Merry Makers. Around 1930, Billie came back to New Orleans. Along with Lawrence Toca, she played with Alphonse Picous five -piece band (along Milton, drums; Picou, clarinet; Toca trumpet; Billie piano) at the Rialto Nightclub on Jefferson Davis Parkway.11 She would stay wi th Picou for a couple of years. Billie met De De Pierce when they were working in nearby clubs in the French Quarter. De De become the trumpet player for Sadies band on the boat when Buddy A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 340 Petit left to take another job. Sadies band was playing at a club called Corinne on Decatur and Ursulines. At the very same intersection, Billie was leading a band that included clarinetist George Lewis at a club called the King Fish. Billie became interested in De De, but checked with Sadie first to make sure De De wasnt her boyfriend. Then she told him she liked him.12 They married soon after th at. De De told Bill Russell that he and Billie were inseparable, even before he lost his eyesight.13 Billie and De De married on March 28, 1935. Clarinetist George Lewis was the best man at their wedding, at St. Peter Claver Church.14 The couple worked together after that, traveling with Ida Cox at one point. They played Decatur Street clubs with George Lewis (clarinet), Klebert Cagnolatti (drums), among others.15 Billie worked with A.J. Piron at the Absinthe House. During World War II, they played at the Club Playtime in Bunkie, Louisiana . As with so many New Orleans musicians, De De had another trade to earn his living: he was a brick layer. Billie led the band at the popular Marais Street dance spot, Luthjens, off and on for 24 years. Describing Billie and De Des playing at Luth jens, Edw ard Pleasants wrote, The husband and wife team, generally with a drummer but quite often alone, settled down into a very fine musical combination. The specialty was the blues; De Des cornet tone was excellent and Billie s shouting blues voice and rolling boogie beat were, at their best, in the top rank of blues performances.\"16 Tom Stagg heard their style as \"strengthened by De Des background with the marching bands and Billies vocals which were influenced by her days with the blues singers.\"17 A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 341 In 1951, Billie made her first record on a New Orleans on label owned by Willi am Russell (American Music 641). T he band included De De and Lawrence Toca on trumpet.18 Studs Terkel, reviewing the recording for the Chicago Sun -Times was struck by the vocals contributed by \"lady piano player, Billie Pierce,\" which he found \"vigorous, though tender.\"19 Hard times fell on the couple in the 1950s. Billie had a stroke, which paralyzed her for several months. Around the same time, De De contracted glaucoma, which cost him his vision, as well as his ability to work as a brick layer.20 As Billie regained her faculties and De De coped with his vision loss, the couple tried to earn a living by playing in bars as a cornet/trumpet/piano duo. When they became involved with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band in 1961, they enjoyed what William Russell called, \"one of the most remarkable comebacks in New Orleans history.\"21 As band leaders at Preservation Hall, they worked throughout the 1960s and earl y 1970s, touring widely, and riding the revival of interest in traditional New Orleans music, what one reviewer hailed as \"unmodified music of another era. It was like a renaissance in reverse\".22 When De De died in November of 1973, he received one of the largest jazz funerals of that era. Four bands played: Preservation Hall Band, and the Olympia, Eureka, and Young Tuxedo brass bands.23 Billie continued playing at Preservation Hall, even making one last tour, but never seemed to recover from losing De De. She eventually spent much of her time in Flor ida. After a brief illness, Billie Pierce died on September 29, 1974, at the age of 67, less than a year after De Des death. During Billie Pierces jazz funeral procession, on October 3, 1974, the Olympia A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 342 Brass Band played \"Just A Closer Walk With Thee, \" and paused in front of the house at 1619 Galvez where Billie and De De had lived for thirty years.24 At Corpus Christi Church, Narvin Kimball played banjo and sang, \"Where He Leads Me I Will Follow,\" and Sweet Emma Barrett sang \"Just a Closer Walk With Thee.\" After Billie was buried next to De De, the procession left St. Louis No. 2 Cemetery while the band played \"Hello, Dolly.\"25 Notes 1 Billie and De De Pierce, Oral History, April 2, 1959, interviewed by William Russell and Ralph Collins.

May 17, 1880, New Orleans/d. June 18, 1980, New York City1 Though born in New Orleans, Olivia L'Ange Porter Shipp spent most of her professional life in New York, where she w orked as a bassist, cellist, and pianist from 1900 through the 1950s. She is best known for organizing the Negro Women's Orchestral and Civic Assoc iation in New York (circa late 1920s -1930s.) Born Olivia Sophie L'Ange in New Orleans in 1880, her early musical experiences included playing her family's pump organ, and accompanying the church choir. Her only formal musical training as a child came fro m Abbey Lyons, who gave her voice lessons. Lyons was a former member of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who married a New Orleans minister. Olivia and her sister May wished to work in the entertainment industry, but their father objected. May joined Black Pat ti Troubadours in New York, later forming Bob and Kemp vaudeville team as May Kemp. When May invited Olivia to New York around 1900, Olivia changed her last name to Porter in order to save her father the embarrassment of dragging the family name into show business2 and accepted her sister' s offer to use her vaudeville connections to get her work as a pianist. While working as a pianist, Olivia took cello lessons. She also studied violin and bass beginning in around 1916. At some point she married a man named Shipp. A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 350 In 1917, as a bassist , Olivia joined Marie Lucas Lafayette Theater Ladies Orchestra. Soon after, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians (one of the few integrated locals of the AFM) helped her to start the Negro Women's Orchestral and Civic Association. This impre ssive group became an important orchestra during Harlem Renaissance.3 The NWOCA included Gladys Bell Seals, a saxophonist and founder of the Gladys Seals Symphonette in Harlem; Leora Meo ux Henderson, trombonist Della Sutton, and her daughter Corrine Schyver, a drummer.4 She also led the \" Olivia Jazz-Mines Famous Female Orchest ra\" in the late 1920s.5 In the early 1930s, when Lil Hardin Armstrong was slated to appear at the Apollo Theater with an all -woman band, Shipp's Negro Women's Orchestral and Civic Association supplied the musicians.6 Armstrong's musicians for that appearance included Alma Long Scott (saxophone), Leora Meoux Henderson and Dolly Jones Hutchinson (trumpets). Sc ott, incidentally, was the mother of jazz pianist Hazel Scott, Henderson, the wife of Fletcher Henderson, and Hutchinson, the daughter of jazz trumpet player Dyer Jones. Olivia Shipp freelanced in multiple genres, from dance bands, to chamber ensembles, t o orchestras throughout World War II. She died in NYC 1980.

A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 353 Camilla Todd (Haynes) [Camille] (pianist, piano teacher, organist, choir director) b. December 1892 [ca. 1888], New Orleans / d. 1969 New Orleans.1 Camilla Todd is but one of several women pianis ts in early New Orleans jazz bands whose career managed to cross borders between secular and sacred music, classical and jazz, performer and teacher. For Todd, it was even possible to maintain a reputation of respectability as an educator and church musi cian alongside a jazz career that included playing in the red light district -a place where, according to Mahalia Jackson, \"no decent Negro -no church -going Negro, at least -would be caught dead.\"2 Todd was a church -going African American, yet, according to trumpet player Punch Miller, both Camilla and her brother Clarence played piano in the Storyville bordellos,3 a fact that did not seem to harm her status as \"one of the city's foremost music teachers.\"4 The extent to which such divisions were crossed by musicians, and specifically by \"piano women,\" is a project deserving further study. Todd's career does not answer these questions, but the bits and pieces of what we know about her life do suggest that, for some women, playing in a jazz band did not exact the price of respectability as a church woman, church musician or music teacher in the community. Many factors could be responsible for Todd's acceptability in all of these realms at once. One is that her place in the community as a prominent music teacher was already well established at the time of her jazz career -indeed the band -leader with A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 354 whom she had the most lasting association, cornetist Hyppolyte Charles -was one of her students. Oral histories indicate that her fellow musicians in early jazz bands certainly knew of her reputation as a classically trained pianist, prominent music teacher, and church musician. It could also be that while classical music may h ave more readily signaled feminine respectability and upward mobility for many black women in early twentieth century New Orleans, Todd's community would realize the enormity of obstacles facing a classically trained, working class African American woman w ho wished to be a concert pianist. There could have been more leeway for poor and working class black women to have their jazz careers seen as suitable alternatives to menial labor. Family connections have also eased the way for many women jazz musicians . New Orleans jazz musicians would have known her brother Clarence, who was a pianist and singer, as well as a porter, and who had served in the Army with trumpet player Ernest \"Punch\" Miller during World War I. Camilla Todd was born in December of 1892 in New Orleans, to Charles Todd and Cora Martin.5 Her younger brother, Clarence, was born in February 1895, and three younger sisters, Geneva, Helen, and Dorothy, were born around 1901, 1904, and 1907, respectively. The 1900 and 1910 Census have Camilla, her parents, and siblings living at 1931 7th Street, near Dryades, in the Central City neighborhood. The family moved across the street sometime between 1910 and 1912, to 1916 Seventh Street. According to the 1910 Census, her father worked as a railroad car cleaner, her mother was a servant (and had, indeed been employed as a domestic or laundress from childhood), and 18 -year-old Camilla was a musician and music teacher, accepting A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 355 students at th e rented house in which the family resided. Her ad in the 1912 Woods Directory , read: \"Miss Camilla Todd, Music Teacher, 1916, Seventh Street.\"6 Colleagues remembered \"Miss Todd\" as a classically trained concert pianist. I have not been able to discern where she obtained her training or whether or not she was able to have a concert career at any point. My guess would be that she was studying somewhere in New Orleans during the same t ime period that she was giving music lessons, as her teaching career began when she was in her late teens. According to Karl Koenig, cornetist Hyppolyte Charles studied piano with her as early as 1909,7 when she would have been 17 years old. Pianist Octave Crosby also remembered studying with Todd, whom he remembered as a long -time church musician who played for the First Street Methodist Church just a few blo cks from her family's home. Crosby recalled that \"Miss Todd\" also played with dance bands, notably the versatile band led by Hyppolyte Charles at the New Orleans Country Club. Crosby already played by ear, and engaged the services of \"Miss Todd\" for a ye ar or more, specifically to learn \"standard methods,\" i ncluding learning to read music . According to Crosby, men had been discouraged from playing the piano, and less frequently received training in how to read music, so when piano jobs opened up that req uired reading musicians, women were often hired.8 The piano in early jazz bands was prim arily used to play block chords, and didn't take solos. Horn players needed to be able to improvise. Pianists needed knowledge of chords, and the ability to read. In other words, women who had been encouraged to take piano lessons (without the punishmen t of being called \"sissy\"!) and who played for church choirs, were A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 356 well equipped with the skills needed in early jazz bands that used pianos. They were not only often called to fill such jobs, but were important teachers to early jazz and dance band piani sts, both female and male. Camilla herself is not listed among her family in the 1920 Census.9 At some point between 1919 and 1922, she married Leroy Haynes, so it is possible that she was living elsewhere with him, though they were now here to be found in the 1920 Census. They reappear in the 1930 Census, both living with Camilla's parents again, only this time on Magnolia Street.10 It is also possible that Camilla's busy dance band career kept her a jump ahead of the Census takers in 1920. The late teens and early twenties was the time period in which Todd was in the midst of a remarkable early jazz career, that included stints with the Original Maple Leaf Orchestra (\"one of the city's greatest early jazz bands,\" according to Koenig11), the Hyppolite Charles Orchestra, bands led by Kid Rena, A.J. Piron, Buddy Petit, and the NOLA band -all important early New Orleans bands. According to trumpet Punch Miller, she also sang and played piano for a time in the Tuxedo Orchestra.12 Trombonist Maurice (Morris) French recalled that when he played with Kid Rena's band, when the band used a piano, they usually used Edna Francis (wife of drummer Albert Francis), but sometimes used either Manuel Manetta or Camilla Todd.13 Punch Miller recalled that when John Robichaux's society orchestra played the Lyr ic Theater, he sometimes used Camilla Todd (and also Jeanette Kimball).14 At some point in the 1920s, she also played in the Nola Band with trumpet player Peter Lacaze.15 The chronology of Todd's jazz career from 1919 to the mid -twenties is packed, A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 357 and goes something like this: In 1919, Tom Gaspard, a bassist, and his brothe r Vic (trombone and baritone) were playing with John Robichaux's Orchestra at the Lyric Theatre, when the leader became ill. The brothers organized the Maple Leaf Orchestra for a location job at the Eurey Hotel in Shreveport, Louisiana. The personnel inc luded Emile Bigard (violin), Lorenzo Tio Jr. (clarinet), Camilla Todd (piano) Hyppolite Charles (cornet) and Louis Cottrell, Sr., (drums). The band worked in Shreveport from July to September, 1919, then returned to New Orleans.16 Drummer Alex Bigard remembered playing with Todd in the Original Maple Leaf Orchestra, as well, with slightly different personnel. Instead of Lorenzo Tio and Louis Cott rell, the band included; Sidney Vigne (clarinet), Alex Bigard (drums), and Willie Bontemps (banjo).17 Several months after returning to New Orleans, Hyppolite Charles formed a band of his own, taking with him two of the Maple Leaf musicians, Emile Bigard and Camilla Todd. Charles's new orchestra played at the Moulin Roug e on Bourbon Street and Bienville. At that time, A.J. Piron was the leader of the house orchestra at Tranchina's Restaurant at Spanish Fort. But when Piron had a chance to go to New York, Charles's orchestra took over that regular booking. Eddie Dawson, who played tenor banjo with the Hyppolite Charles' band, recalled that all of the Charles band members read music. Musicians included: Sunny Henry, trombone; Camilla Todd, piano; Emile Bigard, violin; Charles, trumpet; Joe Welch, drums; Clarence Hall, saxophone. He recalled that after the Tranchina's job, the band played at the New Orleans Country Club, the historic San Jacinto Hall on Dumaine Street, and the \"colored Lions Club (Liberty Street near Francs Amis Hall).\"18 According A Feminist Perspective on New Orleans Jazz Women A NOJNHP Research Study by Sherrie Tucker, University of Kansas 358 to Dawson, the Hyppolite Charles Orchestra played a variety of styles, and that Charles himself wrote most of the arrangements. Their regular job at the New Orleans Country Club included playing Wednesday and Saturday nights, plus a Sunday mat inee.19 In 1925, Hyppolyte Charles collapsed with a ruptured spleen after playing a tea dance, and was forced to retire.20 Octave Crosby recalled that Todd's \"regular band\" was with Hyppolyte Charles but that she worked with \"almost everyone, including Kid Ory.\" He recalled that she played with A.J. Piron until she was replaced by Steve Lewis. Also says that she later gave up playing for anything except the church.21 By the 1930s, her name ceased to appear in band rosters, but she continued to be listed as a musician/music teacher in New Orleans. Her brother, Clarence, on the other hand, had left New Orleans for New Yor k in the mid -1920s -1930s, where he pursued a career as an entertainer and song -writer. He co -wrote \"Papa -De-Da-Da\" (1925) with Clarence Williams and made fourteen recordings between 1924 and 1934.22 Camilla Todd died in 1969. Notes: 1 December 1892 birth date comes from the 1900 US Census. The \"ca 1888\" birth date comes from Rose and Souc hon. I take the 1892 date to be more reliable, though there is some confusion later on in the Census reports when the entire Todd family seems to have lost track of their ages, or have given younger ages. 2 Mahalia Jackson , with Evan McLeod Wylie, Movin' On Up , (New York: Hawthorn Books, Inc, 1966) , 30. 3 Punch Miller interview, September 1, 1959, quoted in Charles Chamberlain, 4. 4 Mary Gehman and Nancy Ries, Women and New Orleans: A History (New Orleans: Margaret Media Inc., 5th printing, 2000), 76.

But the Census of 1930 finds Camilla listed as born three years later than in earlier reports. It seems more likely to me that at some point, she found it advisable to subtract a few year s (perhaps to be younger than her husband, who is listed in the 1930 Census as age 36). As a 34 year -old in 1930, who had been married since she was 26, she would have been married in 1922. 11 Koenig, The Jazz Lectures , 24. 12 Punch Miller, Oral History, April 4. 1960.
