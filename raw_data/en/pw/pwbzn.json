This isn't just metaphorical; [gut health is science](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=gut+health), people! Whether you're a tree-dwelling yogi or shiny hospital doctor, the truth remains the same: what we put into our bodies has a direct affect on how we look, feel, think, move \u2014 and when our diet gets a little dirty, it's on us to clean it up. Functional and integrative medicine master, [Dr. Frank Lipman](https://www.bewell.com/blog/), is showing us how... The [ microbiome](http://thechalkboardmag.com/microbiome-pressed-juicery-medical-board-juicing) has the power to impact almost every area of your health, from [ your immunity](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=immunity) and your [stress response](http://thechalkboardmag.com/how-to-reduce-stress-every-day) to [sleep](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=sleep), mood, behavior, [metabolism](http://thechalkboardmag.com/skinny-genes-that-control-weight-and-metabolism), weight and much more. When your microbiome is out of balance, your immune system struggles and you're likely to suffer from frequent colds, allergies, joint pains, brain fog, [acne/skin issues](http://thechalkboardmag.com/adult-acne-products-survival-kit), [yeast overgrowth](http://thechalkboardmag.com/how-to-clear-candida-yeast-overgrowth) and, potentially, more serious disorders. The most obvious signs of an imbalance are frequent gas, bloating, loose stools and/or constipation. If you suffer from any of these, you might need to work on balancing your microbiome. Protecting your microbiome - and restoring its balance if disrupted - is one of the most important things you can do to sustain health. What's the Right Way to Deal with Gut Imbalances? After years of practice I've come to know there is no one \"right\" way to deal with imbalances. Everyone is different and therefore their treatment most likely will be different as well. However, we typically need to start with creating balance by removing something that is harming you and restoring something that's lacking. It is ideal to start by pulling out all foods that feed yeast or bad bacteria in the gut \u2014 like sugar, [gluten](http://thechalkboardmag.com/healthy-gluten-free-tips-unhealthy-habits-dr-mark-hyman) and all factory-farmed meats/processed foods, and focus on consuming clean, real and nutrient-dense foods. Additionally you to need enhance your good bacteria [with a daily probiotic](http://thechalkboardmag.com/how-to-pick-probiotics-for-gut-health) and serving of probiotic-rich foods like [fermented organic veggies](http://thechalkboardmag.com/would-you-or-wouldnt-you-make-fermented-beet-juice), while taking a anti-microbial supplement that helps fend off harmful bacteria.
