Hitchcock Summer Camp is a space where hopeful, creative problem solvers come together to play, shout, build, discover, and create. We work within a framework of student-led inquiry to explore the world around us from insects to raptors and more. We use what we learn to solve problems, build models, and build relationships to each other and to the earth. And don't worry-we'll still have plenty of time to run wild, jump in the mud, and howl at the moon. 2023 Summer Camp Dates: Session 1: June 26 - June 30 Making and Tinkering (1 wk ) Session 2: July 3 - July 14 Our Valley Our Home (2 wk) Session 3: July 17 - July 21 Woodland Magic and Mysteries (1 wk) Session 4: July 24 - August 4 Making and Tinkering (2 wk) Session 5: August 7 - August 11 Woodland Magic and Mysteries (1 wk) Session 1 - 5: Chickadee Camp (K-1) Session 2: Leadership Training Camp for 7-9 graders (2 wk) Session 3: Climate Collaborative Camp for 7-9 graders (1 wk) **NEW!** The Hitchcock Center highly encourages all campers (and requires all staff and campers 16 and over) to have the COVID-19 vaccine in order to ensure that our camp can be as safe as possible for all participants. We require all vaccinations required by the Town of Amherst. The Amherst Board of Health now requires COVID-19 vaccination for students 16 years of age and older (except for medical or religious exemptions) to attend Amherst public schools. Should FDA approval occur for children ages 5-12, we anticipate the town will also require vaccination for that age group. We will follow Board of Health guidelines.

We'll learn about our rich farm soil, our fascinating history of our region and the wilderness around us. Through hands-on experiences within these spaces, mixed with stories, field trips, songs, games and crafts, we will build our sense of place within the Connecticut River Valley and explore the ways we can take care of it in the future.

Leadership Training Camp Entering grades 7-9, only Session 2: Monya Relles and Peter Lamdin Mondays-Fridays, 8:45am-3pm Session 2: July 3 - July 14 (two weeks) Fees: Tier A $1,050; Tier B $875; Tier C $744; Tier D $569 LTC is where new leaders can develop their skills as naturalists, activity leaders, problem solvers, and community members, and returning leaders can strengthen the skills they've been developing. This is done through our \"spiral\" system, with spirals representing your experience in LTC (spiral 1 for first year campers, spiral 2 for second year campers, etc.) and each spiral holding different expectations and skills. We plan to incorporate some of our favorite activities from previous years, such as rock climbing, ropes course challenges and our camping overnight, along with new activities, challenges and field trips. We'll take time to develop as a group, to work with the younger campers to put what we learn into practice, and to be campers ourselves: playing in the woods and learning about and exploring nature. Leadership Training Camp is jam-packed with outdoor adventures, group challenges, nature hikes and discussions on what makes good leaders. We offer up a combination of games and songs with leadership skills you can use as a Hitchcock Junior Counselor, at school, and just in life! LTC is an active camp, but time is also spent listening and learning from each other by sharing knowledge and talking about our experiences and how they help us become better leaders. It is designed for all Hitchcock campers entering grades 7-9 looking to learn what it takes to lead others in the outdoors. It is designed for those who may want to be a Counselor-in-Training or Junior Counselor at Hitchcock or other camps, who want a chance to develop leadership skills that can apply to other parts of their life, or who just want to learn new skills and have some fun. Please note that drop-off and pick-up times for LTC may change on some days depending on our schedule for that day. Climate Collaborative Camp **NEW!** Entering grades 7-9, only Session 3: Monya Relles and Emily Schuttenberg Mondays-Fridays, 8:45am-3pm Session 3: July 17 - July 21 (one week) Fees for 1 week session: Tier A $509; Tier B $424; Tier C $360; Tier D $276 Over the course of this week of justice oriented activities, campers will play games and engage in experiments that explore the science of climate change. We'll ask questions about the history and future of the land and our connection to it as a community and be inspired by the Hitchcock Center Living Building. The week will culminate in a camper-led climate action. This week will be fun, hands-on and outdoors!

What to bring to Camp Here is our list of what to bring to summer camp. To have fun and be safe in the outdoors, it is important that each camper brings the following items to camp. Each camper will be responsible for caring for his/her own possessions during the day as we move from building to van to the activity site. ***Please label all items with your child's name!*** Checklist: - Hearty snack and lunch that do not require heating or refrigeration - Proper footwear. We recommend bringing one pair that can get wet/muddy and one sturdy closed-toe pair for hiking and running. No flip flops, please. - Change of clothes: shirt, bottoms, underwear and socks. This can stay at camp throughout the session. - Rain gear - Two masks - Hand sanitizer (optional - counselors will provide if needed) - Water bottle (screw top or canteen style, no straws please) - Back pack that fits and is comfortable to wear - Hat with brim for sun protection - Sunscreen and insect repellent ( we can only apply what you provide) - Swim suit and towel for sprinkler play A Typical Nature Summer Camp Day 8:45-9:00 Arrival, Mystery Corner/Landing activity/ Outside Game 9:00 Morning Circle: Name Game, Songs, Group Challenge, Theme of the Day 10:00 Snack 10:15 Outdoor Adventure and Exploration or Field Trip 12:00pm Lunch, Story and Siesta 1:15 Outdoor Nature Free Play 1:45 Craft and/or Science 2:40 Clean up 2:45 Closing Circle 2:55-3:05 Pick Up Each day consists of outdoor play, guided hikes and field investigations, songs, crafts and team building games.

Please call the Hitchcock Center - 413-256-6006 if your child can not make it to camp, or if you know ahead of time, inform your counselor. We will have different areas in our parking lot for drop off for the different groups. We will have signs for each group. Due to our limited parking we are encouraging live drop off with out parking for children who are easily able to separate from their parents is preferred after the first day. The Eco-Investigators will be the first location, Nature Explorers, the second, and Young Naturalists the third, and Chickadee Camp last. Please pull your car up to the correct area to drop off your child. If you would like to walk your child to the drop off location, please park your car in a parking spot. It is wonderful to have your children come to camp with sunblock and bug spray, already applied. If you want to apply sunblock/bug spray at drop off, we will ask you to first find a parking spot. If you do this, please walk your child to their counselor, as the parking lot will be very busy. If you think that there is anyone that you would like to add to your list of people who can pick your child up from camp, please send them to him. We will ask you to check this list at drop off on the first day. Pick Up Pick Up for Chickadee Camp is at 1:00 each day** Pick up for all other groups is from 2:55 to 3:05 each day** We will ask you to come out of the car, and meet one of your children's counselors to sign your child out. Please ensure that you have provided a list of all potential people who will be picking up your child. We can't release a child to someone who is not on the list. Our counselors are busy preparing for the day before 8:45, and need time in the afternoon for cleaning up and additional prep the next day, so we ask you to please not drop off your children early or pick them up late. We ask that you please park in the parking lot when pick up your child/ren. There will be a lot of activity at these times, so please drive slowly and carefully, and be aware while leaving the car.

Life Threatening Allergy Guidelines The Hitchcock Center for the Environment (HCE) provides a safe and healthy environment for our campers and staff to the extent reasonably possible. Campers identified with life-threatening allergies will be provided for as medically necessary. The HCE guidelines will help reduce exposure to allergens to the best of our ability, knowing that we can be allergen-aware, not allergen free, and to follow established procedures to treat allergic reactions. The HCE is a public building and we can not control if allergens are brought into the building. A camper identified as having a life-threatening allergy must have a written statement clearly documenting the allergy from his/her health care provider/allergy specialist along with a written medication order, parent/guardian consent for required interventions and medication. HCE will provide training to educate Counselors in the management of life threatening allergies. If there is a camper with a severe peanut or tree nut allergy, or other life-threatening allergy in a session, families and campers for that group and session are respectfully asked to refrain from bringing nuts or foods processed with nuts in lunches and snacks (or the relevant allergen). At the end of each snack and lunch and at the end of the day, tables are cleaned and students will be asked to wash their hands before and after eating. Camp's Responsibility - The Health Care Supervisor will be available for campers who have a life-threatening allergy. A back-up plan will be in place when the Health Care Supervisor is not available on-site. - Counselors will have cell phones to maintain contact with the Health Care Supervisor and/or other camp staff in case of a medical emergency. - The camp's emergency response plan will include a written plan that outlines the management of life threatening emergencies. - In the event of an allergen exposure, policies and procedures will be reviewed. - Camp personnel will receive appropriate training in allergic response recognition and response as needed. - After reviewing the health records provided by the parent/guardian, the camp Health Care Supervisor in conjunction with the Health Care Consultant will develop an individual health care plan. - If the camper is carrying their epinephrine auto-injector, the counselor will check in with the camper to ensure that they have the epinephrine auto-injector at the beginning of the camp session. Recommendations for Campers Based on the camper's age and developmental level, campers are encouraged to be proactive in the care and management of their allergies and reactions. All guidelines below are considered recommendations but it will not be assumed that any child can take full responsibility for their own allergy management. - Wash hands with soap and water before and after eating (hand sanitizer is not effective). - Learn to recognize symptoms of an allergic reaction. - Promptly inform an adult as soon as possible exposure occurs or symptoms appear. - Do not trade or share food. - Do not eat anything with unknown ingredients or known to contain any allergen. - Develop a relationship with the camp Health Care Supervisor and other adults in the camp to help identify issues related to managing the allergy in camp. - Notify an adult immediately if feeling threatened or bullied as it relates to their life threatening allergy. - Camper may carry epinephrine auto-injector on self if camp Health Care Supervisor, parent or guardian and licensed prescriber are in agreement.

Parental Responsibilities A parent, guardian or designated representative for the child shall not send the child to the program if they are ill or have a temperature. All contagious illnesses must be reported to the Camp Director. If it is determined during the day that the child is ill, is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or has a temperature, the parent/guardian will be notified. It is their responsibility to have the child picked up from camp as soon as possible. Due to COVID-19 we require that families follow the current guidelines from the state of MA, regarding traveling and exposure to large groups. Please do not bring your child to camp if you have traveled to an area designated as high risk, or any gatherings that are not in compliance with the guidance provided by the State. The parent or guardian shall notify the Camp Director if a child will be absent on a regularly enrolled day. Parents or guardians shall notify the campers Counselor or the Camp Director when someone other than those named on the child's Emergency Information will be picking up the child. Parents or guardians will assist staff in handling any behavior problems or other concerns by being open to discussions and conferences in order to best service their child. Parents and guardians can request copies of our background check, health care and discipline policies by contacting the Camp Director. Parents must provide documentation from the camper's health care providers regarding the camper's allergy prior to the beginning of camp or as soon as possible after diagnosis. The health care provider should be the allergist or similar specialist to the extent that the camper has such a provider. In the case of a food allergy, provide a list of foods/ingredients the camper child must avoid. In addition: if your child has a severe allergy, parents are responsible to: - Provide the camp with up-to-date medication (epinephrine auto-injector), medication orders from a licensed health care provider and parent/guardian consent forms for medication administration. - Provide the camp with a way to reach you at all times or an available local emergency contact. - Provide the Health Care Supervisor with any changes in your camper's allergy status as soon as they occur. - Educate your child about her/his allergy: importance of avoiding allergens, symptoms of a reaction and how to communicate to an adult if they think a reaction is starting. Parents' and guardians' questions, suggestions, and concerns are important to the success of Hitchcock Centers Summer Nature Camp. If a staff member is not free to speak with you immediately, please leave your name and phone number, and someone will call you as soon as possible. You can also email the Camp Director. We encourage you to inform the staff if your child is having difficulty at camp. Let them know if changes are occurring at home that are affecting your child's mood or behavior. Also, if your camper enjoyed a particular event or activity and you appreciate something special at Camp, please tell the staff. Camper Requirements We strive to make summer camp as accessible, safe, and inclusive as possible. Due to the outdoor and exploratory nature of our camp program, campers must be able to move about on uneven terrain. Campers are expected to meaningfully participate in age-appropriate activities, including nature study. We welcome campers who are emerging multilinguals, queer and questioning, as well as campers with social, emotional, physical, cognitive, or behavioral challenges, along with their 1:1 assistant or a personal care assistants. If your camper has social, emotional, physical, cognitive, or behavioral challenges, or if you have questions or concerns about how we can best support your camper, please contact our Camp Director to determine whether your camper can be accommodated at camp. In addition, your child must be able to wear a mask when appropriate, and be capable of being able to thoroughly wash their hands, and maintain social distancing requirements. Non-disclosure may result in dismissal without refund. Safety and Behavior Policy One of our primary goals at the Hitchcock Center is to provide a safe and positive environment for all of the children who participate in our programs, all of the time. At day camp, it is not possible for us to work one-on-one with children with behavioral difficulties. We have designed a general policy to be used with all camp children. There can be no exceptions to this policy. We will handle disruptive and aggressive behavior (hitting, bad language, disrespect to other children or to staff, etc.) as follows: - If there is one incident, the parent will be informed. - If there are two incidents, we will have a parent, child, and camp director meeting. - If the behavior continues and cannot be controlled, the child will be disenrolled. The Executive Director, acting with the advice of the Camp Director or Counselor, will make this decision. Parents should judge beforehand whether their child is capable of handling a camp setting, as the Hitchcock Center will not refund camp fees for these reasons. This policy represents our best effort to protect children with behavioral problems, their families, other children, and our staff. While the Hitchcock Center is a public building, staff and counselors will keep campers separate from any persons who are not a part of camp. Any adults that are unrecognized persons (ie. Non-campers, staff, volunteers, contractors, parents or guardians) will be asked not to interact with campers. Safety and Behavior Agreements - We promote a culture of using our words to solve problems and to alert staff if a camper is hurt by another camper or otherwise needs help. Staff are trained to facilitate conflict resolution among campers. - We foster a culture of respect and care for ourselves, each other, Counselors, and the environment. When disrespect is shown, staff facilitate conflict resolution. - Children eat their own food brought from home or snacks given by Counselors only. - Children will never be left unsupervised or left alone with a Counselor in Training (CIT). - Shoes must be worn at all times while outside. - The Hitchcock Center encourages the use of sun protection for all, including wearing wide brim hats, long sleeves and pants, and sunscreen with an SPF greater than 25. We request that sunscreen and insect repellent be applied before camp. If necessary, and if permission is given, Counselors can reapply both sunscreen and insect repellent during the camp day. - All children wash their hands before meals, snack and after going to the rest room. If snack or lunch is happening in a location where hand washing is not available, then hand sanitizer will be used. - No child shall be denied food, water or shelter as a form of punishment; subjected to cruel or severe punishment, humiliation, verbal abuse, or corporal punishment, including spanking; or be punished for soiling, wetting or not using the toilet. Staff Recruitment The following is our standard procedure to ensure that our employees and volunteers have a background free of conduct that has an adverse effect on his/ her ability to provide for the safety and well being of the campers. The following are minimum requirements for each new prospective employee who may have unsupervised contact with a camper: - - Prior Work History (address, phone number) - Three positive reference checks from individuals not related to the staff person including, but not limited to previous employers or school administration. - Inquiry by agency into the individual's prior criminal history (CORI check and SORI). All staff who live outside of MA are to provide documentation from their local chief of police indicating their prior criminal history. - Based on the required information we will then determine if the potential employees history should disqualify them from any type of contact or presence at the camp.
