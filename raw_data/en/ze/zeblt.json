A holistic approach to [health and wellness](https://integrativehealthcarespringfieldmo.com/about-kare-health-and-wellness-springfield-mo/) requires taking a look at your body as a whole which includes everything you put into it. That includes what you eat and drink as well as the products that you rub into your skin. As part of our approach to holistic medicine in Springfield Missouri, we are happy to announce that we are now carrying EleSpa products in our office. The addition of this organic line to our offerings is yet another step we are taking to proactively protect our patients from harmful toxins hidden in things we use every day. While it's understandable to assume that anything you can buy in a supermarket would be proven to be safe for your body, the United States actually has very lax skin care product regulations. According to the [US Food and Drug Administration,](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/fda-authority-over-cosmetics-how-cosmetics-are-not-fda-approved-are-fda-regulated#Who_is_responsible) \"Neither the law nor FDA regulations require specific tests to demonstrate the safety of individual products or ingredients. The law also does not require cosmetic companies to share their safety information with FDA.\" Because the law doesn't require it, many skin care companies choose not to share their additives. According to [A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients](https://www.amazon.com/Consumers-Dictionary-Cosmetic-Ingredients-Cosmeceuticals/dp/0307451119), only an estimated 35 to 40 percent of the companies report their ingredients to the FDA. That's why it's important to do your research to ensure the skin care products you use are not full of toxins. Toxins in Skin Care Many of the most common chemicals in skin care products are parabens. Parabens - otherwise known as methylparabens, propylparabens, butylparabens, and ethylparabens - preserve shelf-life for Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients](https://www.amazon.com/Consumers-Dictionary-Cosmetic-Ingredients-Cosmeceuticals/dp/0307451119) found that 75-90% of skin care products contain parabens. Parabens can act like estrogen in the body. This disrupts the natural hormonal balance. They've been linked to [breast cancer](https://www.breastcancer.org/risk/factors/cosmetics) and can also cause [reproductive and fertility issues](https://www.ewg.org/californiacosmetics/parabens). Another surprisingly common and potentially unsafe additive is fragrance. The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/cosmetics-labeling-guide#clgl4) doesn't require skin care products to be specific about which ingredients were included to mask odor. Often, the chemicals used to disguise an unpleasant odor and hidden in the ingredients list as \"fragrances\" can cause allergies, hormone disruption and lead to bigger health problems including [reproductive issues and infertility](https://prhe.ucsf.edu/sites/g/files/tkssra341/f/CA%20Safe%20Cosmetics%20Program%20Report.pdf). The [American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/diseases/eczema/contact-dermatitis-causes) found that fragrances are also one of the top causes of contact dermatitis.
