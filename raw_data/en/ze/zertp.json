In the interests of clarityand rationality, the said Directives should therefore be codifiedby assembling them in a single text. (2)The essential aim of any rules governing the production, distri-bution and use of medicinal products must be to safeguardpublic health. (3)However, this objective must be attained by means which willnot hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry ortrade in medicinal products within the Community. (4)Trade in medicinal products within the Community is hinderedby disparities between certain national provisions, in particularbetween provisions relating to medicinal products (excluding substances or combinations of substances which are foods, animal feeding-stuffs or toilet preparations), and such disparitiesdirectly affect the functioning of the internal market. (5)Such hindrances must accordingly be removed; whereas thisentails approximation of the relevant provisions. (6)In order to reduce the disparities which remain, rules should be laid down on the control of medicinal products and the duties incumbent upon the Member States' competent authorities shouldbe specified with a view to ensuring compliance with legalrequirements. (7)The concepts of harmfulness and therapeutic efficacy can onlybe examined in relation to each other and have only a relativesignificance depending on the progress of scientific knowledgeand the use for which the medicinal product is intended. The particulars and documents which must accompany an application for marketing authorization for a medicinal product demonstratethat potential risks are outweighed by the therapeutic efficacy ofthe product. (8)Standards and protocols for the performance of tests and trialson medicinal products are an effective means of control of theseproducts and hence of protecting public health and can facilitatethe movement of these products by laying down uniform rules applicable to tests and trials, the compilation of dossiers and the examination of applications. (9)Experience has shown that it is advisable to stipulate more precisely the cases in which the results of toxicological and pharmacological tests or clinical trials do not have to beprovided with a view to obtaining authorization for a medicinalproduct which is essentially similar to an authorized product,while ensuring that innovative firms are not placed at a disad- vantage. (10)However, there are reasons of public policy for not conducting repetitive tests on humans or animals without over-riding cause. (11)The adoption of the same standards and protocols by all theMember States will enable the competent authorities to arrive attheir decisions on the basis of uniform tests and by reference to uniform criteria and will therefore helpto avoid differences in evaluation. (12)With the exception of those medicinal products which aresubject to the centralized Community authorization procedureestablished by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authoriza-tion and supervision of medicinal products for human andveterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 3 (1) OJ L 297, 13.10.1992, p. 8.B Evaluation of Medicinal Products (1) a marketing authorization for a medicinal product granted by a competent authority in oneMember State ought to be recognized by the competent authori- ties of the other Member States unless there are serious grounds for supposing that the authorization of the medicinal productconcerned may present a risk to public health. In the event of adisagreement between Member States about the quality, thesafety or the efficacy of a medicinal product, a scientific evalua- tion of the matter should be undertaken according to a Community standard, leading to a single decision on the area ofdisagreement binding on the Member States concerned. Whereasthis decision should be adopted by a rapid procedure ensuringclose cooperation between the Commission and the MemberStates. (13)For this purpose, a Committee for Proprietary MedicinalProducts should be set upattached to the Europ ean Agency forthe Evaluation of Medicinal Products established in the above-mentioned Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. (14)This Directive represents an important step towards achievementof the objective of the free movement of medicinal products.Further measures may abolish any remaining barriers to the freemovement of proprietary medicinal products will be necessary in the light of experience gained, particularly in the abovemen- tioned Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. (15)In order better to protect public health and avoid any unneces-sary duplication of effort during the examination of application for a marketing authorization for medicinal products, Member States should systematically prepare assessment reports inrespect of each medicinal product which is authorized by them,and exchange the reports upon request. Furthermore, a MemberState should be able to suspend the examination of an applica-tion for authorization to place a medicinal product on the market which is currently under active consideration in another Member State with a view to recognizing the decision reachedby the latter Member State. (16)Following the establishment of the internal market, specific controls to guarantee the quality of medicinal products imported from third countries can be waived only if appropriate arrange-ments have been made by the Community to ensure that thenecessary controls are carried out in the exporting country. (17)It is necessary to adopt specific provisions for immunologicalmedicinal products, homeopathic medicinal products, radiophar-maceuticals, and medicinal products based on human blood orhuman plasma. (18)Any rules governing radiopharmaceuticals must take into account the provisions of Council Directive 84/466/Euratom of 3 September 1984 laying down basic measures for the radiationprotection of persons undergoing medical examination or treat-ment ( 2). Account should also be taken of Council Directive 80/ 836/Euratom of 15 July 1980 amending the Directives laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionizing radia-tion ( 3), the objective of which is to prevent the exposure of workers or patients to excessive or unnecessarily high levels ofionizing radiation, and in particular of Article 5c thereof, whichrequires prior authorization for the addition of radioactive2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 4 (1) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1.

(19)The Community entirely supports the efforts of the Council ofEurope to promote voluntary unpaid blood and plasma donationto attain self-sufficiency throughout the Community in thesupply of blood products, and to ensure respect for ethical prin- ciples in trade in therapeutic substances of human origin. (20)The rules designed to guarantee the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma must be applied in the same manner to both public and private establishments, and to blood and plasma imported fromthird countries. (21)Having regard to the particular characteristics of these homeo-pathic medicinal products, such as the very low level of activeprinciples they contain and the difficulty of applying to themthe conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials, itis desirable to provide a special, simplified registration proce-dure for those homeopathic medicinal products which are placed on the market without therapeutic indications in a phar- maceutical form and dosage which do not present a risk for thepatient. (22)The anthroposophic medicinal products described in an officialpharmacopoeia and prepared by a homeopathic method are tobe treated, as regards registration and marketing authorization,in the same way as homeopathic medicinal products. (23)It is desirable in the first instance to provide users of thesehomeopathic medicinal products with a very clear indication oftheir homeopathic character and with sufficient guarantees oftheir quality and safety. (24)The rules relating to the manufacture, control and inspection ofhomeopathic medicinal products must be harmonized to permitthe circulation throughout the Community of medicinal productswhich are safe and of good quality. (25)The usual rules governing the authorization to market medicinalproducts should be applied to homeopathic medicinal productsplaced on the market with therapeutic indications or in a form which may present risks which must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect. In particular, those Member Stateswhich have a homeopathic tradition should be able to applyparticular rules for the evaluation of the results of tests and trialsintended to establish the safety and efficacy of these medicinal products provided that they notify them to the Commission. (26)In order to facilitate the movement of medicinal products and to prevent the controls carried out in one Member State from beingrepeated in another, minimum requirements should be laid down for manufacture and imports coming from third countries and for the grant of the authorization relating thereto. (27)It should be ensured that, in the Member States, the supervision and control of the manufacture of medicinal products is carried out by a person who fulfils minimum conditions of qualification. (28)Before an authorization to market an immunological medicinal product or derived from human blood or human plasma can be granted, the manufacturer must demonstrate his ability to attainbatch-to-batch consistency. Before an authorization to market amedicinal product derived from human blood or human plasmacan be granted, the manufacturer must also demonstrate the absence of specific viral contamination, to the extent that the state of technology permits. (29)The conditions governing the supply of medicinal products to thepublic should be harmonized. (30)In this connection persons moving around within the Communityhave the right to carry a reasonable quantity of medicinalproducts lawfully obtained for their personal use. It must also2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 5B be possible for a person established in one Member State to receive from another Member State a reasonable quantity ofmedicinal products intended for his personal use. (31)In addition, by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 2309/93, certainmedicinal products are the subject of a Community marketingauthorization. In this context, the classification for the supply ofmedicinal products covered by a Community marketing authori-zation needs to be established. It is therefore important to set thecriteria on the basis of which Community decisions will be taken. (32)It is therefore appropriate, as an initial step, to harmonize the basic principles applicable to the classification for the supply ofmedicinal products in the Community or in the Member Stateconcerned, while taking as a starting point the principles alreadyestablished on this subject by the Council of Europe as well as the work of harmonization completed within the framework of the United Nations, concerning narcotic and psychotropicsubstances. (33)The provisions dealing with the classification of medicinalproducts for the purpose of supply do not infringe the nationalsocial security arrangements for reimbursement or payment for medicinal products on prescription. (34)Many operations involving the wholesale distribution of medic- inal products for human use may cover several Member Statessimultaneously. (35)It is necessary to exercise control over the entire chain of distri-bution of medicinal products, from their manufacture or importinto the Community through to supply to the public, so as to guarantee that such products are stored, transported and handled in suitable conditions. The requirements which must be adoptedfor this purpose will considerably facilitate the withdrawal ofdefective products from the market and allow more effectiveefforts against counterfeit products. (36)Any person involved in the wholesale distribution of medicinal products should be in possession of a special authorization. Phar- macists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products tothe public, and who confine themselves to this activity, shouldbe exempt from obtaining this authorization. It is however neces-sary, in order to control the complete chain of distribution of medicinal products, that pharmacists and persons authorized to supply medicinal products to the public keep records showingtransactions in products received. (37)Authorization must be subject to certain essential conditions andit is the responsibility of the Member State concerned to ensurethat such conditions are met; whereas each Member State must recognize authorizations granted by other Member States. (38)Certain Member States impose on wholesalers who supply medicinal products to pharmacists and on persons authorized tosupply medicinal products to the public certain public serviceobligations. Those Member States must be able to continue toimpose those obligations on wholesalers established within their territory. They must also be able to impose them on wholesalers in other Member States on condition that they do not impose anyobligation more stringent than those which they impose on theirown wholesalers and provided that such obligations may beregarded as warranted on grounds of public health protectionand are proportionate in relation to the objective of such protec- tion. (39)Rules should be laid down as to how the labelling and package leaflets are to be presented. (40)The provisions governing the information supplied to usersshould provide a high degree of consumer protection, in orderthat medicinal products may be used correctly on the basis offull and comprehensible information.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 6B (41)The marketing of medicinal products whose labelling and package leaflets comply with this Directive should not be prohibited or impeded on grounds connected with the labellingor package leaflet. (42)This Directive is without prejudice to the application of measures adopted pursuant to Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws,regulations and administrative provisions of the Member Statesconcerning misleading advertising ( 1). (43)All Member States have adopted further specific measuresconcerning the advertising of medicinal products. There aredisparities between these measures. These disparities are likelyto have an impact on the functioning of the internal market,since advertising disseminated in one Member State is likely to have effects in other Member States. (44)Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordi- nation of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation oradministrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities ( 2) prohibits the television advertising of medicinal products which are available only onmedical prescription in the Member State within whose jurisdic-tion the television broadcaster is located. This principle shouldbe made of general application by extending it to other media. (45)Advertising to the general public, even of non-prescriptionmedicinal products, could affect public health, were it to beexcessive and ill-considered. Advertising of medicinal productsto the general public, where it is permitted, ought therefore tosatisfy certain essential criteria which ought to be defined. (46)Furthermore, distribution of samples free of charge to thegeneral public for promotional ends must be prohibited. (47)The advertising of medicinal products to persons qualified toprescribe or supply them contributes to the information availableto such persons. Nevertheless, this advertising should be subjectto strict conditions and effective monitoring, referring in parti-cular to the work carried out within the framework of the Council of Europe. (48)Advertising of medicinal products should be subject to effective, adequate monitoring. Reference in this regard should be made tothe monitoring mechanisms set upby Directive 84/450/EEC. (49)Medical sales representatives have an important role in thepromotion of medicinal products. Therefore, certain obligationsshould be imposed upon them, in particular the obligation tosupply the person visited with a summary of product characteris- tics. (50)Persons qualified to prescribe medicinal products must be able to carry out these functions objectively without being influenced by direct or indirect financial inducements. (51)It should be possible within certain restrictive conditions to provide samples of medicinal products free of charge to personsqualified to prescribe or supply them so that they can familiarize themselves with new products and acquire experience in dealing with them. (52)Persons qualified to prescribe or supply medicinal products musthave access to a neutral, objective source of information about products available on the market. Whereas it is nevertheless for the Member States to take all measures necessary to this end, inthe light of their own particular situation.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 7 (1) OJ L 250, 19.9.1984, p. 17.

Directive as amended by Directive 97/36/EC (OJ L 202, 30.7.1997, p. 60).B (53)Each undertaking which manufactures or imports medicinal products should set up a mechanism to ensure that all informa- tion supplied about a medicinal product conforms with theapproved conditions of use. (54)In order to ensure the continued safety of medicinal products inuse, it is necessary to ensure that pharmacovigilance systems in the Community are continually adapted to take account of scien- tific and technical progress. (55)It is necessary to take account of changes arising as a result ofinternational harmonisation of definitions, terminology and tech-nological developments in the field of pharmacovigilance. (56)The increasing use of electronic networks for communication ofinformation on adverse reactions to medicinal products marketedin the Community is intended to allow competent authorities toshare the information at the same time. (57)It is the interest of the Community to ensure that the pharmacov- igilance systems for centrally authorised medicinal products and those authorised by other procedures are consistent. (58)Holders of marketing authorisations should be proactivelyresponsible for on-going pharmacovigilance of the medicinalproducts they place on the market. (59)The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directiveshould be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for theexercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commis-sion( 1). (60)The Commission should be empowered to adopt any necessarychanges to Annex I in order to take into account scientific andtechnical progress. (61)This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time-limits for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.

TITLE VI CLASSIFICATIONOFMEDICINALPRODUCTS Article 70 1. When a marketing authorization is granted, the competent autho- rities shall specify the classification of the medicinal product into: \u2014 a medicinal product subject to medical prescription, \u2014 a medicinal product not subject to medical prescription. To this end, the criteria laid down in Article 71(1) shall apply.2. The competent authorities may fix sub-categories for medicinal products which are available on medical prescription only. In that case, they shall refer to the following classification: (a) medicinal products on renewable or non-renewable medical prescription; (b) medicinal products subject to special medical prescription; (c) medicinal products on restricted medical prescription, reserved for use in certain specialized areas. Article 71 1. Medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription where they: \u2014 are likely to present a danger either directly or indirectly, even when used correctly, if utilized without medical supervision, or \u2014 are frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly, and as a result are likely to present a direct or indirect danger to humanhealth, or \u2014 contain substances or preparations thereof, the activity and/or adverse reactions of which require further investigation, or \u2014 are normally prescribed by a doctor to be administered parenterally. 2. Where Member States provide for the sub-category of medicinal products subject to special medical prescription, they shall take accountof the following factors: \u2014 the medicinal product contains, in a non-exempt quantity, a substance classified as a narcotic or a psychotropic substance withinthe meaning of the international conventions in force, such as theUnited Nations Conventions of 1961 and 1971, or \u2014 the medicinal product is likely, if incorrectly used, to present a substantial risk of medicinal abuse, to lead to addiction or bemisused for illegal purposes, or2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 33B \u2014 the medicinal product contains a substance which, by reason of its novelty or properties, could be considered as belonging to the groupenvisaged in the second indent as a precautionary measure. 3. Where Member States provide for the sub-category of medicinal products subject to restricted prescription, they shall take account of the following factors: \u2014 the medicinal product, because of its pharmaceutical characteristics or novelty or in the interests of public health, is reserved for treat-ments which can only be followed in a hospital environment, \u2014 the medicinal product is used in the treatment of conditions which must be diagnosed in a hospital environment or in institutions with adequate diagnostic facilities, although administration and follow- upmay be carried out elsewhere, or \u2014 the medicinal product is intended for outpatients but its use may produce very serious adverse reactions requiring a prescription drawn up as required by a specialist and special supervision throughout the treatment. 4. A competent authority may waive application of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 having regard to: (a) the maximum single dose, the maximum daily dose, the strength, the pharmaceutical form, certain types of packaging; and/or (b) other circumstances of use which it has specified. 5. If a competent authority does not designate medicinal products into sub-categories referred to in Article 70(2), it shall nevertheless take into account the criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article in determining whether any medicinal product shall be classi-fied as a prescription-only medicine. Article 72 Medicinal products not subject to prescription shall be those which do not meet the criteria listed in Article 71. Article 73 The competent authorities shall draw up a list of the medicinal products subject, on their territory, to medical prescription, specifying, if necessary, the category of classification. They shall update this list annually. Article 74 On the occasion of the five-yearly renewal of the marketing authoriza- tion or when new facts are brought to their notice, the competentauthorities shall examine and, as appropriate, amend the classification of a medicinal product, by applying the criteria listed in Article 71. Article 75 Each year, Member States shall communicate to the Commission and to the other Member States, the changes that have been made to thelist referred to in Article 73.

(2) Two main sets of information shall be provided, dealing with the active substance(s) and with the finished medicinal product, respectively. (3) This Module shall in addition supply detailed information on the starting and raw materials used during the manufacturing opera- tions of the active substance(s) and on the excipients incorporated in the formulation of the finished medicinal product. (4) All the procedures and methods used for manufacturing and controlling the active substance and the finished medicinal product shall be described in sufficient details to enable them to berepeated in control tests, carried out at the request of the compe- tent authority. All test procedures shall correspond to the state of scientific progress at the time and shall be validated. Results of the validation studies shall be provided. In the case of test proce- dures included in the European Pharmacopoeia, this description2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 59M2 shall be replaced by the appropriate detailed reference to the monograph(s) and general chapter(s). (5) The monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia shall be applic- able to all substances, preparations and pharmaceutical forms appearing in it. In respect of other substances, each Member State may require observance of its own national pharmacopoeia. However, where a material in the European Pharmacopoeia or in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State has been prepared by a method liable to leave impurities not controlled in the pharmaco- poeia monograph, these impurities and their maximum tolerance limits must be declared and a suitable test procedure must be described. In cases where a specification contained in a mono- graph of the European Pharmacopoeia or in the national pharmacopoeia of a Member State might be insufficient to ensure the quality of the substance, the competent authorities may request more appropriate specifications from the marketing authorisation holder. The competent authorities shall inform the authorities responsible for the pharmacopoeia in question. The marketing authorisation holder shall provide the authorities of that pharmaco- poeia with the details of the alleged insufficiency and the additional specifications applied. In the case of analytical procedures included in the European Pharmacopoeia, this description shall be replaced in each relevant section by the appropriate detailed reference to the monograph(s) and general chapter(s). (6) In case where starting and raw materials, active substance(s) or excipient(s) are described neither in the European Pharmacopoeia nor in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State, compliance with the monograph of a third country pharmacopoeia can be accepted. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a copy of the monograph accompanied by the validation of the analytical procedures contained in the monograph and by a translation where appro- priate. (7) Where the active substance and/or a raw and starting material or excipient(s) are the subject of a monograph of the European Phar- macopoeia, the applicant can apply for a certificate of suitability that, where granted by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, shall be presented in the relevant section of this Module. Those certificates of suitability of the monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia are deemed to replace the relevant data of the corresponding sections described in this Module. The manu- facturer shall give the assurance in writing to the applicant that the manufacturing process has not been modified since the granting of the certificate of suitability by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. (8) For a well-defined active substance, the active substance manufac- turer or the applicant may arrange for the (i) detailed description of the manufacturing process, (ii) quality control during manufacture, and(iii) process validation to be supplied in a separate document directly to the competent authorities by the manufacturer of the active substance as an Active Substance Master File. In this case, the manufacturer shall, however, provide the appli- cant with all of the data, which may be necessary for the latter to take responsibility for the medicinal product. The manufacturer shall confirm in writing to the applicant that he shall ensure batch to batch consistency and not modify the manufacturing process or specifications without informing the applicant. Documents and particulars supporting the application for such a change shall be supplied to the competent authorities; these documents and parti- culars will be also supplied to the applicant when they concern the open part of the active substance master file. (9) Specific measures concerning the prevention of the transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies (materials from ruminant origin): at each step of the manufacturing process, the applicant must demonstrate the compliance of the materials used with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products and its updates, published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union. Demonstration of compli-2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 60M2 ance with the said Note for Guidance can be done by submitting either, preferably a certificate of suitability to the relevant mono- graph of the European Pharmacopoeia that has been granted by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines or by the supply of scientific data to substantiate this compliance. (10) For adventitious agents, information assessing the risk with respect to potential contamination with adventitious agents, whether they are non-viral or viral, as laid down in relevant guidelines as well as in relevant general monograph and general chapter of the European Pharmacopoeia, shall be provided. (11) Any special apparatus and equipment, which may be used at any stage of the manufacturing process and control operations of the medicinal product, shall be described in adequate details. (12) Where applicable and if needed, a CE marking which is required by Community legislation on medical devices shall be provided.

A biological medicinal product is a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs for its characterisation and the determination of its quality a combination of physico-chemical-biological testing, together with the production process and its control. The following shall be considered as biological medicinal products: immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood and human plasma as defined, respectively in paragraphs (4) and (10) of Article 1; medicinal products falling within the scope of Part A of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93; advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Part IV of this Annex. Any other substances used for manufacturing or extracting the active substance(s) but from which this active substance is not directly derived, such as reagents, culture media, foetal calf serum, additives, and buffers involved in chromatography, etc. are known as raw materials. 3.2.1.2. Manufacturing process of the active substance(s) a) The description of the active substance manufacturing process repre- sents the applicant's commitment for the manufacture of the active substance.

When cell banks are used, the cell characteristics shall be shown to have remained unchanged at the passage level used for the produc- tion and beyond. Seed materials, cell banks, pools of serum or plasma and other mate- rials of biological origin and, whenever possible, the materials from which they are derived shall be tested for adventitious agents. If the presence of potentially pathogenic adventitious agents is inevi- table, the corresponding material shall be used only when further processing ensures their elimination and/or inactivation, and this shall be validated. Whenever possible, vaccine production shall be based on a seed lot system and on established cell banks. For bacterial and viral vaccines, the characteristics of the infectious agent shall be demon- strated on the seed. In addition, for live vaccines, the stability of the attenuation characteristics shall be demonstrated on the seed; if thisproof is not sufficient, the attenuation characteristics shall also be demonstrated at the production stage.

Finished medicinal product 3.2.2.1. Description and composition of the finished medicinal product A description of the finished medicinal product and its composition shall be provided. The information shall include the description of the pharmaceutical form and composition with all the constituents of the finished medicinal product, their amount on a per-unit basis, the func- tion of the constituents of: \u2014 the active substance(s), \u2014 the constituent(s) of the excipients, whatever their nature or the quantity including colouring matter, preservatives, adjuvants, stabilisers, thickeners, emulsifiers, flavouring and aromatic substances, etc., \u2014 the constituents, intended to be ingested or otherwise administered to the patient, of the outer covering of the medicinal products(hard capsules, soft capsules, rectal capsules, coated tablets, films- coated tablets, etc.), \u2014 these particulars shall be supplemented by any relevant data concerning the type of container and, where appropriate, its manner of closure, together with details of devices with which the medicinal product will be used or administered and which will be delivered with the medicinal product. The 'usual terminology', to be used in describing the constituents of medicinal products, shall mean, notwithstanding the application of the other provisions in Article 8 (3) (c): \u2014 in respect of substances which appear in the European Pharmaco- poeia or, failing this, in the national pharmacopoeia of one of the Member States, the main title at the head of the monograph in ques- tion, with reference to the pharmacopoeia concerned, \u2014 in respect of other substances, the international non-proprietary name (INN) recommended by the World Health Organisation, or, failing this, the exact scientific designation; substances not having an international non-proprietary name or an exact scientific designa- tion shall be described by a statement of how and from what they were prepared, supplemented, where appropriate, by any other rele- vant details, \u2014 in respect of colouring matter, designation by the 'E' code assigned to them in Council Directive 78/25/EEC of 12 December 1977 on the approximation of the rules of the Member States concerning the colouring matters authorised for use in medicinal products ( 1) and/or European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs(2). In order to give the 'quantitative composition' of the active substance(s) of the finished medicinal products, it is necessary, depending on the pharmaceutical form concerned, to specify the mass, or the number of units of biological activity, either per dosage-unit or per unit of mass or volume, of each active substance. Active substances present in the form of compounds or derivatives shall be designated quantitatively by their total mass, and if necessary or relevant, by the mass of active entity or entities of the molecule. For medicinal products containing an active substance, which is the subject of an application for marketing authorisation in any Member2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 63 (1) OJ L 11, 14.1.1978, p. 18. (2) OJ L 237, 10.9.1994, p. 13.M2 State for the first time, the quantitative statement of an active substance, which is a salt or hydrate shall be systematically expressed in terms of the mass of the active entity or entities in the molecule. All subsequently authorised medicinal products in the Member States shall have their quantitative composition stated in the same way for the same active substance. Units of biological activity shall be used for substances, which cannot be defined molecularly. Where an International Unit of biological activity has been defined by the World Health Organisation, this shall be used. Where no International Unit has been defined, the units of biological activity shall be expressed in such a way as to provide unam- biguous information on the activity of the substances by using where applicable the European Pharmacopoeia Units. 3.2.2.2. Pharmaceutical development This chapter shall be devoted to information on the development studies conducted to establish that the dosage form, the formulation, manufac- turing process, container closure system, microbiological attributes and usage instructions are appropriate for the intended use specified in the marketing authorisation application dossier. The studies described in this chapter are distinct from routine control tests conducted according to specifications. Critical parameters of the formulation and process attributes that can influence batch reproduci- bility, medicinal product performance and medicinal product quality shall be identified and described. Additional supportive data, where appropriate, shall be referenced to the relevant chapters of Module 4 (Non Clinical Study Reports) and Module 5 (Clinical Study Reports) of the marketing authorisation application dossier. a) The compatibility of the active substance with excipients as well as key physicochemical characteristics of the active substance that can influence the performance of the finished product or the compat- ibility of different active substances with each other in the case of combination products, shall be documented. b) The choice of excipients, in particular relative to their respective functions and concentration shall be documented. c) A description of the development of the finished product shall be provided, taking into consideration the proposed route of administra- tion and usage. d) Any overages in the formulation(s) shall be warranted. e) As far as the physiochemical and biological properties are concerned, any parameter relevant to the performance of finished product shall be addressed and documented. f) The selection and optimisation of the manufacturing process as well as differences between the manufacturing process(es) used to produce pivotal clinical batches and the process used for manufac- turing the proposed finished medicinal product shall be provided. g) The suitability of the container and closure system used for the storage, shipping and use of the finished product shall be docu- mented. A possible interaction between medicinal product and container may need to be considered. h) The microbiological attributes of the dosage form in relation with non-sterile and sterile products shall be in accordance with and documented as prescribed in the European Pharmacopoeia. i) In order to provide appropriate and supportive information for the labelling the compatibility of the finished product with reconstitution diluent(s) or dosage devices shall be documented. 3.2.2.3. Manufacturing process of the finished medicinal pr oduct a) The description of the manufacturing method accompanying the application for Marketing Authorisation pursuant to Article 8 (3) (d), shall be drafted in such a way as to give an adequate synopsis of the nature of the operations employed. For this purpose it shall include at least: \u2014 mention of the various stages of manufacture including process controls and corresponding acceptance criteria, so that an assess- ment can be made of whether the processes employed in producing the pharmaceutical form might have produced an adverse change in the constituents,2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 64M2 \u2014 in the case of continuous manufacture, full details concerning precautions taken to ensure the homogeneity of the finished product, \u2014 experimental studies validating the manufacturing process, where a non-standard method of manufacture is used or where it is critical for the product, \u2014 for sterile medicinal products, details of the sterilisation processes and/or aseptic procedures used, \u2014 a detailed batch formula.

In addition, colouring matter shall meet purity criteria as laid down in Directive 95/45/EC, as amended. b) For each excipient, the specifications and their justifications shall be detailed. The analytical procedures shall be described and duly vali- dated. c) Specific attention shall be paid to excipients of human or animal origin. Regarding the specific measures for the prevention of the Transmis- sion of animal Spongiform Encephalopathies, the applicant must demonstrate also for excipients that the medicinal product is manu- factured in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products and its updates, published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union. Demonstration of compliance with the aforementioned Note for Guidance can be done by submitting either preferably a certificate of suitability to the relevant monograph on Transmissible Spongi- form Encephalopathies of the European Pharmacopoeia, or by the supply of scientific data to substantiate this compliance. d) Novel excipients: For excipient(s) used for the first time in a medicinal product or by a new route of administration, full details of manufacture, character- isation, and controls, with cross references to supporting safety data, both non-clinical and clinical, shall be provided according to the active substance format previously described. A document containing the detailed chemical, pharmaceutical and biological information shall be presented. This information shall be formatted in the same order as the chapter devoted to Active Substance(s) of Module 3. Information on novel excipient(s) may be presented as a stand-alone document following the format described in the former paragraphs. Where the applicant differs from the novel excipient manufacturer2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 65M2 the said stand-alone document shall be made available to the appli- cant for submission to the competent authority. Additional information on toxicity studies with the novel excipient shall be provided in Module 4 of the dossier. Clinical studies shall be provided in Module 5. 3.2.2.5. Control of the finished medicinal pr oduct For the control of the finished medicinal product, a batch of a medicinal product is an entity which comprises all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial quantity of material and have undergone the same series of manufacturing and/or sterilisation operations or, in the case of a continuous production process, all the units manufactured in a given period of time. Unless there is appropriate justification, the maximum acceptable devia- tion in the active substance content of the finished product shall not exceed \u00b1 5 % at the time of manufacture. Detailed information on the specifications, (release and shelf life) justi- fication for their choice, methods of analysis and their validation shall be provided. 3.2.2.6. Reference standards or materials Reference preparations and standards used for testing of the finished medicinal product shall be identified and described in detail, if not previously provided in the section related to the active substance. 3.2.2.7. Container and closure of the finished medicinal product A description of the container and the closure system(s) including the identity of each immediate packaging material and their specifications shall be provided. The specifications shall include description and iden- tification. Non-pharmacopoeial methods (with validation) shall be included where appropriate. For non-functional outer packaging materials only a brief description shall be provided. For functional outer packaging materials additional information shall be provided. 3.2.2.8. Stability of the finished medicinal pr oduct a) The types of studies conducted, protocols used, and the results of the studies shall be summarised; b) Detailed results of the stability studies, including information on the analytical procedures used to generate the data and validation of these procedures shall be presented in an appropriate format; in case of vaccines, information on cumulative stability shall be provided where appropriate; c) The post authorisation stability protocol and stability commitment shall be provided. 4. MODULE 4: NON-CLINICAL REPORTS 4.1.FormatandPresentation The general outline of Module 4 is as follows: \u2014 Table of contents \u2014 Study reports \u2014Pharmacology \u2014 Primary Pharmaco-dynamics \u2014 Secondary Pharmaco-dynamics \u2014 Safety Pharmacology \u2014 Pharmaco-dynamic Interactions \u2014Pharmaco-kinetics \u2014 Analytical Methods and Validation Reports \u2014 Absorption \u2014 Distribution \u2014 Metabolism\u2014 Excretion \u2014 Pharmaco-kinetic Interactions (non-clinical) \u2014 Other \u2014 \u2014 Single-Dose Toxicity \u2014 Repeat-Dose Toxicity \u2014 Genotoxicity \u2014 In vitro \u2014 In vivo (including supportive toxico-kinetics evaluations) \u2014 Carcinogenicity \u2014 Long-term studies \u2014 Short- or medium-term studies \u2014 Other studies \u2014 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity \u2014 Fertility and early embryonic development \u2014 Embryo-fetal development \u2014 Prenatal and postnatal development \u2014 Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated \u2014 Local Tolerance \u2014Other Toxicity Studies \u2014 Antigenicity \u2014 Immuno-toxicity \u2014 Mechanistic studies \u2014 Dependence \u2014 Metabolites \u2014 Impurities \u2014 Other \u2014 Literature references 4.2.Content:basicprinciplesandrequirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. (1) The pharmacological and toxicological tests must show: a) the potential toxicity of the product and any dangerous or unde- sirable toxic effects that may occur under the proposed conditions of use in human beings; these should be evaluated in relation to the pathological condition concerned; b) the pharmacological properties of the product, in both qualita- tive and quantitative relationship to the proposed use in human beings. All results must be reliable and of general applicability. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in eval- uating the results. Additionally, it is necessary for clinicians to be given informa- tion about the therapeutic and toxicological potential of the product. (2) For biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma, the requirements of this Module may have to be adapted for individual products; therefore the testing program carried out shall be justified by the applicant. In establishing the testing program, the following shall be taken into consideration: all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and interfer- ence by, antibodies; examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and peri- natal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered. Where constituents other than the active substance(s) are incriminated, validation of their removal may replace the study. (3) The toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated. (4) Where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product, the toxicology of degradation products must be considered.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 67M2 4.2.1. Pharmacology Pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach. \u2014 Firstly, the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described. Where possible, recognised and validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, shall be used. Novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc. Wherever possible, comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar therapeutic action. \u2014 Secondly, the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological func- tions. These investigations shall be performed at exposures in the anticipated therapeutic range and above. The experimental techni- ques, unless they are standard procedures, must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator must establish their validity. Any suspected modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall be investigated. For the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction, tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharma- cological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect. In the first case, the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combination of value in therapeutic use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the combination is sought through therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals, and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated. 4.2.2. Pharmaco-kinetics Pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance, and its metabolites, within the organism, and covers the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism (bio-transformation) and excretion of these substances. The study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical, chemical or possibly by biological methods, and by observa- tion of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself. Information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco-dynamic effects (e.g. numerous diagnostic agents, etc.). In vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material (i.e. protein binding, metabolism, drug-drug interaction). Pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances, which have been investigated in accordance with the provi- sions of this Directive, pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be required, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission. The pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human. 4.2.3. Toxicology a) Single-dose toxicity A single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions, which may result from a single admin- istration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico-chemical state in which they are present in the actual product. The single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. b) Repeat-dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or anatomo-pathological changes induced by repeated adminis- tration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine how these changes are related to dosage.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 68M2 Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use. Its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attention should be paid in clinical studies. The duration is defined in the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. c) Geno-toxicity The purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells. Mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk of inducing germ-line mutation, with the possibility of inherited disor- ders, and the risk of somatic mutations including those leading to cancer. These studies are obligatory for any new substance. d) Carcino-genicity Tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required: 1. These studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient's life, either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittent manner. 2. These studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential, e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure, or from evidence in repeated dose toxicity studies. 3. Studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed, as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. If such a medicinal product is intended to be administered chronically to humans a chronic study may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects. e) Reproductive and developmental toxicity Investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performed by appropriate tests. These tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female repro- ductive function, studies of the toxic and teratogenic effects at all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity as well as latent effects, when the medicinal product under investigation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. Omission of these tests must be adequately justified.Depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product, additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted. Embryo/foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species, one of which shall be other than a rodent. Peri- and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species. If the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man, it is desirable to include this species. It is also desirable that one of the species is the same as in the repeated dose toxicity studies. The state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the study design. f) Local tolerance The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medic- inal products (both active substances and excipients) are tolerated at sites in the body, which may come into contact with the medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product can be distin- guished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones. Local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use, using the vehicle and/or excipients in treating the control group(s). Positive controls/reference substances shall be included where necessary. The design of local tolerance tests (choice of species, duration, frequency and route of administration, doses) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions of adminis- tration in clinical use. Reversibility of local lesions shall be performed where relevant.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 69M2 Studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality and useful- ness for the purpose of safety evaluation. For chemicals applied to the skin (e.g. dermal, rectal, vaginal) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available (the guinea pig assay or the local lymph node assay). 5.

Consequently, an essential requirement is that the results of all clinical trials should be communicated, both favourable and unfa- vourable. b) Clinical trials must always be preceded by adequate pharmacological and toxicological tests, carried out on animals in accordance with the requirements of Module 4 of this Annex. The investigator must acquaint himself with the conclusions drawn from the pharmacolo- gical and toxicological studies and hence the applicant must provide him at least with the investigator's brochure, consisting of all the relevant information known prior to the onset of a clinical2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 70M2 trial including chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data, toxico- logical, pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic data in animals and the results of earlier clinical trials, with adequate data to justify the nature, scale and duration of the proposed trial; the complete pharmacological and toxicological reports shall be provided on request. For materials of human or animal origin, all available means shall be employed to ensure safety from transmission of infectious agents prior to the commencement of the trial. c) Marketing authorisation holders must arrange for essential clinical trial documents (including case report forms) other than subject's medical files, to be kept by the owners of the data: \u2014 for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the trial, \u2014 or for at least two years after the granting of the last marketing authorisation in the European Community and when there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the European Community, \u2014 or for at least two years after formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. Subject's medical files should be retained in accordance with applic- able legislation and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice. The documents can be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the hospital, institution or practice as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. The sponsor or other owner of the data shall retain all other docu- mentation pertaining to the trial as long as the product is authorised. This documentation shall include: the protocol including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, and details of the investigational product, the reference medicinal product and/or the placebo used; standard operating procedures; all written opinions on the protocol and procedures; the investigator's brochure; case report forms on each trial subject; final report; audit certificate(s), if available. The final report shall be retained by the sponsor or subsequent owner, for five years after the medicinal product is no longer authorised. In addition for trials conducted within the European Community, the marketing authorisation holder shall make any additional arrange- ments for archiving of documentation in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2001/20/EC and implementing detailed guidelines. Any change of ownershipof the data shall be documented. All data and documents shall be made available if requested by rele- vant authorities. d) The particulars of each clinical trial must contain sufficient detail to allow an objective judgement to be made: \u2014 the protocol, including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, and details of the investiga- tional medicinal product used \u2014 audit certificate(s), if available\u2014 the list of investigator(s), and each investigator shall give his name, address, appointments, qualifications and clinical duties, state where the trial was carried out and assemble the informa- tion in respect of each patient individually, including case report forms on each trial subject \u2014 final report signed by the investigator and for multi-centre trials, by all the investigators or the co-ordinating (principal) investi- gator. e) The particulars of clinical trials referred to above shall be forwarded to the competent authorities. However, in agreement with the competent authorities, the applicant may omit part of this informa- tion. Complete documentation shall be provided forthwith upon request. The investigator shall, in his conclusions on the experimental evidence, express an opinion on the safety of the product under normal conditions of use, its tolerance, its efficacy and any useful information relating to indications and contra-indications, dosage2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 71M2 and average duration of treatment as well as any special precautions to be taken during treatment and the clinical symptoms of over dosage. In reporting the results of a multi-centre study, the principal investigator shall, in his conclusions, express an opinion on the safety and efficacy of the investigational medicinal product on behalf of all centres. f) The clinical observations shall be summarised for each trial indi- cating: 1) the number and sex of subjects treated; 2) the selection and age-distribution of the groups of patients being investigated and the comparative tests; 3) the number of patients withdrawn prematurely from the trials and the reasons for such withdrawal; 4) where controlled trials were carried out under the above condi- tions, whether the control group: \u2014 received no treatment \u2014 received a placebo\u2014 received another medicinal product of known effect\u2014 received treatment other than therapy using medicinal products 5) the frequency of observed adverse reactions;6) details concerning patients who may be at increased risk, e.g. elderly people, children, women during pregnancy or menstrua- tion, or whose physiological or pathological condition requires special consideration; 7) parameters or evaluation criteria of efficacy and the results in terms of these parameters; 8) a statistical evaluation of the results when this is called for by the design of the trials and the variable factors involved. g) In addition, the investigator shall always indicate his observations on: 1) any signs of habituation, addiction or difficulty in weaning patients from the medicinal product; 2) any interactions that have been observed with other medicinal products administered concomitantly; 3) the criteria determining exclusion of certain patients from the trials; 4) any deaths which occurred during the trial or within the follow- upp eriod. h) Particulars concerning a new combination of medicinal substances must be identical to those required for new medicinal products and must substantiate the safety and efficacy of the combination. i) Total or partial omission of data must be explained. Should unex- pected results occur during the course of the trials, further pre clinical toxicological and pharmacological tests must be undertaken and reviewed. j) If the medicinal product is intended for long-term administration, particulars shall be given of any modification of the pharmacolo- gical action following repeated administration, as well as the establishment of long-term dosage. 5.2.1. Reports of bio-pharmaceutics studies Bio-availability study reports, comparative bio-availability, bio-equiva- lence study reports, reports on in vitro and in vivo correlation study, and bio-analytical and analytical methods shall be provided. In addition, an assessment of bio-availability shall be undertaken where necessary to demonstrate bio-equivalence for the medicinal products referred to in Article 10 (1) (a). 5.2.2. Reports of studies pertinent to pharmaco-kinetics using human bio- materials For the purposes of this Annex, human bio-materials shall mean any proteins, cells, tissues and related materials derived from human sources that are used in vitro or ex vivo to assess pharmaco-kinetics properties of drug substances.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 72M2 In this respect, reports of plasma protein binding study, hepatic metabo- lism and active substance interaction studies and studies using other human bio-materials shall be provided. 5.2.3. Reports of human pharmaco-kinetic studies a) The following pharmaco-kinetic characteristics shall be described: \u2014 absorption (rate and extent), \u2014 distribution,\u2014 metabolism, \u2014 excretion. Clinically significant features including the implication of the kinetic data for the dosage regimen especially for patients at risk, and differences between man and animal species used in the pre clinical studies, shall be described. In addition to standard multiple-sample pharmaco-kinetics studies, population pharmaco-kinetics analyses based on sparse sampling during clinical studies can also address questions about the contribu- tions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the variability in the dose- pharmaco-kinetics response relationship. Reports of pharmaco- kinetic and initial tolerability studies in healthy subjects and inpatients, reports of pharmaco-kinetic studies to assess effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and reports of population pharmaco- kinetic studies shall be provided. b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomi- tantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modifi- cation of the pharmacological action. Pharmaco-kinetic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 5.2.4. Reports of human pharmaco-dynamic studies a) The pharmaco-dynamic action correlated to the efficacy shall be demonstrated including: \u2014 the dose-response relationship and its time course, \u2014 justification for the dosage and conditions of administration, \u2014 the mode of action, if possible. The pharmaco-dynamic action not related to efficacy shall be described. The demonstration of pharmaco-dynamic effects in human beings shall not in itself be sufficient to justify conclusions regarding any particular potential therapeutic effect. b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomi- tantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modifi- cation of the pharmacological action. Pharmaco-dynamic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 5.2.5. Reports of efficacy and safety studies 5.2.5.1. Study Reports of Controlled Clinical Studies Pertinent to the Claimed Indication In general, clinical trials shall be done as 'controlled clinical trials' if possible, randomised and as appropriate versus placebo and versus an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value; any other design shall be justified. The treatment of the control groups will vary from case to case and also will depend on ethical considerations and therapeutic area; thus it may, in some instances, be more pertinent to compare the efficacy of a new medicinal product with that of an estab- lished medicinal product of proven therapeutic value rather than with the effect of a placebo. (1) As far as possible, and particularly in trials where the effect of the product cannot be objectively measured, steps shall be taken to avoid bias, including methods of randomisation and blinding. (2) The protocol of the trial must include a thorough description of the statistical methods to be employed, the number and reasons for inclusion of patients (including calculations of the power of the trial), the level of significance to be used and a description of the statistical unit. Measures taken to avoid bias, particularly methods of randomisation, shall be documented. Inclusion of a large number2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 73M2 of subjects in a trial must not be regarded as an adequate substitute for a properly controlled trial. The safety data shall be reviewed taking into account guidelines published by the Commission, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increased risk shall be identified and parti- cular attention paid to potentially vulnerable patients who may be present in small numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked abnormalities of metabolism or excretion etc. The implication of the safety evaluation for the possible uses of the medic- inal product shall be described. 5.2.5.2. Study reports of uncontrolled clinical studies reports of analyses of data from more than one study and other clin- ical study reports These reports shall be provided. 5.2.6. Reports of post-marketing experience If the medicinal product is already authorised in third countries, infor- mation shall be given in respect of adverse reactions of the medicinal product concerned and medicinal products containing the same active substance(s), in relation to the usage rates if possible. 5.2.7. Case reports forms and individual patient listings When submitted in accordance with the relevant Guideline published by the Agency, case report forms and individual patient data listings shall be provided and presented in the same order as the clinical study reports and indexed by study. PART II SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION DOSSIERS AND REQUIREMENTS Some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in Part I of this Annex need to be adapted. To take account of these particular situations, an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants. 1. WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICINAL USE For medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have a 'well-established medicinal use' as referred to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. The applicant shall submit Modules 1, 2 and 3 as described in part I of this Annex. For Modules 4 and 5, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics. The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use: a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are: \u2014 the time over which a substance has been used, \u2014 quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, \u2014 the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) and \u2014 the coherence of scientific assessments. Therefore different periods of time may be necessary for estab- lishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well estab- lished medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and docu- mented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community. b) The documentation submitted by the applicant should cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 74M2 concerning experience in the form of epidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documenta- tion, both favourable and unfavourable, must be communicated. With respect to the provisions on 'well-established medicinal use' it is in particular necessary to clarify that 'bibliographic reference' to other sources of evidence (post marketing studies, epidemiolo- gical studies, etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product if an appli- cation explains and justifies the use of these sources of information satisfactorily. c) Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking. d) The non-clinical and/or clinical overviews must explain the rele- vance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketing authorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue. 2. ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS a) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (i) (essentially similar products) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex provided the applicant has been granted the consent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of his Modules 4 and 5. b) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex together with data showing bio-avail- ability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal product provided the latter is not a biological medicinal product (see Part II, 4 Similar biological medicinal products). For these products the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements: \u2014 the grounds for claiming essential similarity; \u2014 a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage) as proposed for use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities; \u2014 an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on 'Inves- tigation of Bio-availability and Bio-equivalence'; \u2014 an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application. It may be acceptable for articles in 'peer review' journals to be annotated for this purpose; \u2014 every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/ or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical/clin- ical overviews/summaries and substantiated by published literature and/or additional studies. \u2014 if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should be provided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity. 3. ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS Where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt/ester complex/derivative evidence that there is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety, pharmaco- dynamics and/or in toxicity which could change the safety/efficacy profile shall be demonstrated. Should this not be the case, this associa- tion shall be considered as a new active substance. Where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered by different routes or in different doses or with a different posology, the2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 75M2 results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of clinical trials shall be provided. 4. SIMILAR BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The provisions of Article 10(1)(a) (iii) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products. If the information required in the case of essentially similar products (generics) does not permit the demonstra- tion of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products, additional data, in particular, the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided. When a biological medicinal product as defined in Part I, paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, which refers to an original medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation in the Community, is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period, the following approach shall be applied. \u2014 Information to be supplied shall not be limited to Modules 1, 2 and 3 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data. The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical and appro- priate clinical data) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. \u2014 Due to the diversity of biological medicinal products, the need for identified studies foreseen in Modules 4 and 5, shall be required by the competent authority, taking into account the specific charac- teristic of each individual medicinal product. The general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the Agency. In case the originally authorised medicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product claimed to be similar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. 5. FIXED COMBINATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS Applications based upon Article 10 (1) (b) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previously authorised as a fixed combination medicinal product. For those applications a full dossier (Modules 1 to 5) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product. Where applicable, infor- mation regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitious agents, safety evaluation shall be provided. 6. DOCUMENTATION FOR APPLICATIONS IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES When, as provided for in Article 22, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because: \u2014 the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or \u2014 in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive informa- tion cannot be provided, or \u2014 it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information, marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obli- gations. These obligations may include the following: \u2014 the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile, \u2014 the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorised person, \u2014 the package leaflet and any medical information shall draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 76M2 7. MIXED MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS Mixed marketing-authorisation applications shall mean marketing- authorisation application dossiers where Module 4 and/or 5 consists of a combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinical studies carried out by the applicant and of bibliographical references. All other Module(s) are in accordance with the structure described in Part I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed format presented by the applicant on a case by case basis. PART III PARTICULARMEDICINALPRODUCTS This Part lays down specific requirements related to the nature of identified medicinal products. 1. BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 1.1.Plasma-derivedmedicinalproduct For medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma and by derogation from the provisions of Module 3, the dossier requirements mentioned in 'Information related to the starting and raw materials', for starting materials made of human blood/plasma may be replaced by a Plasma Master File certified in accordance with this Part. a) Principles For the purposes of this Annex: \u2014 Plasma Master File shall mean a stand-alone documentation, which is separate from the dossier for marketing authorisation which provides all relevant detailed information on the characteristics of the entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw material for the manufacture of sub/intermediate fractions, constitu- ents of the excipient and active substance(s), which are part of medicinal products or medical devices referred to in Directive 2000/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2000 amending Council Directive 93/42/EC as regards medical devices incorporating stable derivatives of humanblood or human plasma ( 1). \u2014 Every centre or establishment for fractionation/processing of human plasma shall prepare and keep updated the set of detailed relevant information referred to in the Plasma Master File. \u2014 The Plasma Master File shall be submitted to the Agency or to the competent authority by the applicant for a marketing authorisation or the holder of the marketing authorisation. Where the applicant for a marketing authorisation or the marketing authorisation holder differs from the holder of the Plasma Master File, the Plasma Master File shall be made available to the applicant or marketing authorisation holder for submission to the competent authority. In any case, the applicant or marketing authorisation holder shall take responsibility for the medicinal product. \u2014 The competent authority that is evaluating the marketing authorisa- tion shall await for the Agency to issue the certificate before deciding on the application. \u2014 Any marketing authorisation dossier containing a human plasma- derived constituent shall refer to the Plasma Master File corre- sponding to the plasma used as a starting/raw material. b) Content In accordance with the provisions of Article 109, as amended by Direc- tive 2002/98/EC, which refers to the requirements for donors and the testing of donations, the Plasma Master File shall include information on the plasma used as starting/raw material, in particular: (1) Plasma origin (i) information on centres or establishments in which blood/ plasma collection is carried out, including inspection and approval, and epidemiological data on blood transmissible infections.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 77 (1) OJ L 313, 13.12.2000, p. 22.M2 (ii) information on centres or establishments in which testing of donations and plasma pools is carried out, including inspection and approval status. (iii) selection/exclusion criteria for blood/plasma donors.(iv) system in place which enables the path taken by each donation to be traced from the blood/plasma collection establishment through to finished products and vice versa. (2) Plasma quality and safety (i) compliance with European Pharmacopoeia Monographs. (ii) testing of blood/plasma donations and pools for infectious agents, including information on test methods and, in the case of plasma pools, validation data on the tests used. (iii) technical characteristics of bags for blood and plasma collec- tion, including information on anticoagulants solutions used. (iv) conditions of storage and transport of plasma.(v) procedures for any inventory hold and/or quarantine period.(vi) characterisation of the plasma pool. (3) System in place between the plasma-derived medicinal product manufacturer and/or plasma fractionator/processor on the one hand, and blood/plasma collection and testing centres or establish- ments on the other hand, which defines the conditions of their interaction and their agreed specifications. In addition, the Plasma Master File shall provide a list of the medicinal products for which the Plasma Master File is valid, whether the medicinal products have been granted a marketing authorisation or are in the process of being granted such an author- isation, including medicinal products referred to in Article 2 of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. c) Evaluation and Certification\u2014 For medicinal products not yet authorised, the marketing authorisa- tion applicant shall submit a full dossier to a competent authority, which shall be accompanied by a separate Plasma Master File where one does not already exist. \u2014 The Plasma Master File is subject to a scientific and technical evaluation carried out by the Agency.

For Genetically Modified Organisms deliberate release in the environment, attention shall be paid to the persistence of the Genetically Modified Organisms in the recipient and to the possible replication and/or modification of the Genetically Modified Organisms when released in the environment. The information concerning the environmental risk should appear in the Annex to Module 1. 1. GENE THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENO- GENEIC) For the purposes of this Annex, gene therapy medicinal product shall mean a product obtained through a set of manufacturing processes aimed at the transfer, to be performed either in vivo or ex vivo, of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic gene (i.e. a piece of nucleic acid), to human/animal cells and its subsequent expression in vivo. The gene transfer involves an expression system contained in a delivery system known as a vector, which can be of viral, as well as non-viral origin. The vector can also be included in a human or animal cell. 1.1.Diversityofgenetherapymedicinalproducts a) Gene therapy medicinal products based on allogeneic or xenogeneic cells The vector is ready-prepared and stored before its transfer into the host cells. The cells have been obtained previously and may be processed as a cell bank (bank collection or bank established from procurement of primary cells) with a limited viability. The cells genetically modified by the vector represent an active substance. Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished product. By essence, such a medicinal product is intended to be administered to a certain number of patients. b) Gene therapy medicinal products using autologous human cells The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector stored before its transfer into the autologous cells. Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. Those products are prepared from cells obtained from an individual patient. The cells are then genetically modified using a ready- prepared vector containing the appropriate gene that has been prepared in advance and that constitutes the active substance. The preparation is re-injected into the patient and is by definition2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 84M2 intended to a single patient. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one intervention. c) Administration of ready-prepared vectors with inserted (prophy- lactic, diagnostic or therapeutic) genetic material The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector.Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. This type of medicinal product is intended to be administered to several patients. Transfer of genetic material may be carried out by direct injection of the ready-prepared vector to the recipients. 1.2.SpecificrequirementsregardingModule3 Gene therapy medicinal products include: \u2014 naked nucleic acid \u2014 complex nucleic acid or non viral vectors \u2014 viral vectors \u2014 genetically modified cells As for other medicinal products, one can identify the three main elements of the manufacturing process, i.e.: \u2014 starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured such as, gene of interest, expression plasmids, cell banks and virus stocks or non viral vector; \u2014 active substance: recombinant vector, virus, naked or complex plas- mids, virus producing cells, in vitro genetically modified cells; \u2014 finished medicinal product: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. Depending on the type of gene therapy medicinal product, the route of administration and conditions of use may necessitate an ex vivo treatment of the cells of the patient (see 1.1.b). A special attention shall be paid to the following items: a) Information shall be provided on the relevant characteristics of the gene therapy medicinal product including its expression in the target cell population. Information concerning the source, construction, characterisation and verification of the encoding gene sequence including its integrity and stability shall be provided. Apart from therapeutic gene, the complete sequence of other genes, regulatory elements and the vector backbone shall be provided. b) Information concerning the characterisation of the vector used to transfer and deliver the gene shall be provided. This must include its physico-chemical characterisation and/or biological/immunolo- gical characterisation. For medicinal products that utilise a micro-organism such as bacteria or viruses to facilitate gene transfer (biological gene transfer), data on the pathogenesis of the parental strain and on its tropism for specific tissues and cell types as well as the cell cycle-dependence of the interaction shall be provided. For medicinal products that utilise non-biological means to facilitate gene transfer, the physico-chemical properties of the constituents individually and in combination shall be provided. c) The principles for cell banking or seed lot establishment and charac- terisation shall apply to gene transfer medicinal products as appropriate. d) The source of the cells hosting the recombinant vector shall be provided. The characteristics of the human source such as age, sex, results of microbiological and viral testing, exclusion criteria and country of origin shall be documented. For cells of animal origin, detailed information related to the following items shall be provided: \u2014 Sourcing of the animals \u2014 Animal husbandry and care \u2014 Transgenic animals (methods of creation, characterisation of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted gene)2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 85M2 \u2014 Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals \u2014 Testing for infectious agents \u2014 Facilities \u2014 Control of starting and raw materials. Description of cell collection methodology including location, type of tissue, operating process, transportation, storage and traceability as well as controls carried out during the collection process shall be documented. e) The evaluation of the viral safety as well as the traceability of the products from the donor to the finished medicinal product, are an essential part of the documentation to be supplied. E.g., the presence of replication competent virus in stocks of non-replication competent viral vectors must be excluded. 2. SOMATIC CELL THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) For the purposes of this Annex, somatic cell therapy medicinal products shall mean the use in humans of autologous (emanating from the patient himself), allogeneic (coming from another human being) or xenogeneic (coming from animals) somatic living cells, the biological characteris- tics of which have been substantially altered as a result of their manipulation to obtain a therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive effect through metabolic, pharmacological and immunological means. This manipulation includes the expansion or activation of autologous cell populations ex vivo (e.g., adoptive immuno-therapy), the use of allo- geneic and xenogeneic cells associated with medical devices used ex vivo or in vivo (e.g., micro-capsules, intrinsic matrix scaffolds, bio- degradable or not). Specific requirements for cell therapy medicinal products regarding Module 3 Somatic cell therapy medicinal products include: \u2014 Cells manipulated to modify their immunological, metabolic or other functional properties in qualitative or quantitative aspects; \u2014 Cells sorted, selected and manipulated and subsequently undergoing a manufacturing process in order to obtain the finished medicinal product; \u2014 Cells manipulated and combined with non-cellular components (e.g. biological or inert matrixes or medical devices) and exerting the principle intended action in the finished product; \u2014 Autologous cell derivatives expressed in vitro under specific culture conditions; \u2014 Cells genetically modified or otherwise manipulated to express previously unexpressed homologous or non-homologous functional properties. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient (autologous situation) up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one single intervention. As for other medicinal products, the three elements of the manufac- turing process are identified: \u2014 starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured, i.e., organs, tissues, body fluids or cells; \u2014 active substance: manipulated cells, cell lysates, proliferating cells and cells used in conjunction with inert matrixes and medical devices; \u2014 finished medicinal products: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. a) General information on active substance(s) The active substances of cell therapy medicinal products consist of cells which as a consequence of in vitro processing display prophy- lactic, diagnostic or therapeutic properties different from the original physiological and biological one. This section shall describe the type of cells and culture concerned. Tissues, organs or biological fluids from which cells are derived as well as the autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic nature of the dona- tion and its geographical origin shall be documented. Collection of the cells, sampling and storage prior further processing shall be detailed. For allogeneic cells, special attention shall be paid to the very first stepof the p rocess, which covers selection of donors. The2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 86M2 type of manipulation carried out and the physiological function of the cells that are used as active substance shall be provided. b) Information related to the starting materials of active substance(s) 1. Human somatic cells Human somatic cell therapy medicinal products are made of a defined number (pool) of viable cells, which are derived from a manufacturing process starting either at the level of organs or tissues retrieved from a human being, or, at the level of a well defined cell bank system where the pool of cells relies on continuous cell lines. For the purposes of this chapter, active substance shall mean the seed pool of human cells and finished medicinal product shall mean seed pool of human cells formulated for the intended medical use. Starting materials and each stepof the manufacturing p rocess shall be fully documented including viral safety aspects. (1) Organs, tissues, body fluids and cells of human origin The characteristics of the human source such as age, sex, microbio- logical status, exclusion criteria and country of origin shall be documented. Description of sampling including site, type, operating process, pooling, transportation, storage and traceability as well as controls carried out on sampling shall be documented. (2) Cell banking systems Relevant requirements depicted in part I shall apply for the prepara- tion and quality control of cell banking systems. This may essentially be the case for allogeneic or xenogeneic cells. (3) Ancillary materials or ancillary medical devices Information shall be provided on the use of any raw materials (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, culture media) or of possible ancillary products and medical devices e.g., cell sorting devices, biocompa- tible polymers, matrix, fibres, beads in terms of bio-compatibility, functionality as well as the risk of infectious agents. 2. Animal somatic cells (xenogeneic) Detailed information related to the following items shall be provided: \u2014 Sourcing of the animals \u2014 Animal husbandry and care\u2014 Genetically modified animals (methods of creation, characterisa- tion of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted or excised (knock out) gene) \u2014 Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals \u2014 Testing for infectious agents including vertically transmitted micro-organisms (also endogenous retro viruses) \u2014 Facilities\u2014 Cell banking systems\u2014 Control of starting and raw materials. a) Information on the manufacturing process of the active substance(s) and the finished product The different steps of the manufacturing process such as organ/tissue dissociation, selection of the cell population of interest, in vitro cell culture, cell transformation either by physico-chemical agents or gene transfer shall be documented. b) Characterisation of active substance(s) All of the relevant information on the characterisation of the cell population of interest in terms of identity (species of origin, banding cytogenetics, morphological analysis), purity (adventitious microbial agents and cellular potency (defined biological2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 87M2 activity), and suitability (karyology and tumorigenicity tests) for the intended medicinal use shall be provided. c) Pharmaceutical development of finished medicinal product Apart from the specific method of administration used (intravenous infusion, site-injection, transplantation surgery), information shall also be provided on the use of possible ancillary medical devices (bio-compatible polymers, matrix, fibres, beads) in terms of bio- compatibility and durability. d) Traceability A detailed flow chart shall be provided insuring the traceability of the products from the donor to the finished medicinal product. 3. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR GENE THERAPY AND SOMATIC CELL THERAPY (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) MEDICINAL PRODUCTS REGARDING MODULES 4 AND 5 3.1.Module4 For gene and somatic cell therapy medicinal products, it is recognised that conventional requirements as laid down in Module 4 for non-clin- ical testing of medicinal products may not always be appropriate due to unique and diverse structural and biological properties of the products in question, including high degree of species specificity, subject speci- ficity, immunological barriers and differences in pleiotropic responses. The rationale underpinning the non-clinical development and the criteria used to choose relevant species and models shall be properly captioned in Module 2. It may be necessary to identify or developnew animal models in order to assist in the extrapolation of specific findings on functional endpoints and toxicity to in vivo activity of the products in human beings. The scientific justification for the use of these animal models of disease to support safety and proof of concept for efficacy shall be provided. 3.2.Module5 The efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products must be demon- strated as described in Module 5. For some products and for some therapeutic indications, however, it may not be possible to perform conventional clinical trials. Any deviation from the existing guidelines shall be justified in Module 2. The clinical development of advanced therapy medicinal products will have some special features owing to the complex and labile nature of the active substances. It requires additional considerations because of issues related to viability, proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells (somatic cell therapy), because of the special clinical circum- stances where the products are used or because of the special mode of action through gene expression (somatic gene therapy). Special risks associated with such products arising from potential contamination with infectious agents must be addressed in the applica- tion for marketing authorisation for advanced therapy medicinal products. Special emphasis should be put on both the early stages of development in one hand, including the choice of donors in the case of cell therapy medicinal products, and on the therapeutic intervention as a whole, including the proper handling and administration of the product on the other hand. Furthermore, Module 5 of the application should contain, as relevant, data on the measures to surveying and control of the functions and development of living cells in the recipient, to prevent transmission of infectious agents to the recipient and to minimise any potential risks to public health. 3.2.1. Human pharmacology and efficacy studies Human pharmacology studies should provide information on the expected mode of action, expected efficacy based on justified end- points, bio-distribution, adequate dose, schedule, and methods of administration or modality of use desirable for efficacy studies. Conventional pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be relevant for some advanced therapy products. Sometimes studies in healthy volunteers are not feasible and the establishment of dose and kinetics will be diffi-2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 88M2 cult to determine in clinical trials. It is necessary, however, to study the distribution and in vivo behaviour of the product including cell prolif- eration and long-term function as well as the extent, distribution of the gene product and duration of the desired gene expression. Appropriate tests shall be used and, if necessary, developed for the tracing of the cell product or cell expressing the desired gene in the human body and for the monitoring of the function of the cells that were administered or transfected. The assessment of the efficacy and safety of an advanced therapy medicinal product must include the careful description and evaluation of the therapeutic procedure as a whole, including special ways of administration, (such as transfection of cells ex vivo, in vitro manipula- tion, or use of interventional techniques), and testing of the possible associated regimens (including immuno-suppressive, antiviral, cytotoxic treatment). The whole procedure must be tested in clinical trials and described in the product information. 3.2.2. Safety Safety issues arising from immune response to the medicinal products or to the expressed proteins, immune rejection, immuno-suppression, and breakdown of immuno-isolation devices shall be considered. Certain advanced gene therapy and somatic cell therapy medicinal products (e.g. xenogeneic cell therapy and certain gene transfer products) may contain replication-competent particles and/or infectious agents. The patient may have to be monitored for the development of possible infections and/or their pathological sequelae during pre- and/ or post-authorisation phases; this surveillance may have to be extended to close contacts of the patient including health-care workers. The risk of contamination with potentially transmissible agents cannot be totally eliminated in the use of certain somatic cell therapy medic- inal products and certain gene transfer medicinal products. The risk can be minimised, however, by appropriate measures as described in Module 3. The measures included in the production process must be comple- mented with accompanied testing methods, quality control processes and by appropriate surveillance methods that must be described in Module 5. The use of certain advanced somatic cell therapy medicinal products may have to be limited, temporarily or permanently, to establishments that have documented expertise and facilities for assuring a specific follow up of the safety of the patients. A similar approach may be rele- vant for certain gene therapy medicinal products that are associated with a potential risk of replication-competent infectious agents. The long term monitoring aspects for the development of late complica- tions shall also be considered and addressed in the submission, where relevant. Where appropriate, the applicant has to submit a detailed risk manage- ment plan covering clinical and laboratory data of the patient, emerging epidemiological data, and, if relevant, data from archives of tissue samples from the donor and the recipient. Such a system is needed to ensure the traceability of the medicinal product and the rapid response to suspicious patterns of adverse events. 4. SPECIFIC STATEMENT ON XENO-TRANSPLANTATION MEDIC- INAL PRODUCTS For the purposes of this Annex, xeno-transplantation shall mean any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either live tissues or organs retrieved from animals, or, human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have under- gone ex vivo contact with live non-human animal cells, tissues or organs. Specific emphasis shall be paid to the starting materials. In this respect, detailed information related to the following items shall be provided according to specific guidelines: \u2014 Sourcing of the animals \u2014 Animal husbandry and care2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 89M2 \u2014 Genetically modified animals (methods of creation, characterisation of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted or excised (knock out) gene) \u2014 Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals \u2014 Testing for infectious agents\u2014 Facilities\u2014 Control of starting and raw materials\u2014 Traceability.2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 90B ANNEX II PART A Repealed Directives, with their successive amendments (referred to by Article 128) Council Directive 65/65/EEC (OJ 22, 9. 2. 1965, p. 369/65) Council Directive 66/454/EEC (OJ 144, 5. 8. 1966, p. 2658/66) Council Directive 75/319/EEC (OJ L 147, 9. 6. 1975, p. 13) Council Directive 83/570/EEC (OJ L 332, 28. 11. 1983, p. 1) Council Directive 87/21/EEC (OJ L 15, 17. 1. 1987, p. 36)Council Directive 89/341/EEC (OJ L 142, 25. 5. 1989, p. 11) Council Directive 92/27/EEC (OJ L 113, 30. 4. 1992, p. 8) Council Directive 93/39/EEC (OJ L 214, 24. 8. 1993, p. 22) Council Directive 75/318/EEC (OJ L 147, 9. 6. 1975, p. 1) Council Directive 83/570/EEC Council Directive 87/19/EEC (OJ L 15, 17. 1. 1987, p. 31) Council Directive 89/341/EEC Commission Directive 91/507/EEC (OJ L 270, 26. 9. 1991, p. 32)Council Directive 93/39/EECCommission Directive 1999/82/EC (OJ L 243, 15. 9. 1999, p. 7) Commission Directive 1999/83/EC (OJ L 243, 15. 9. 1999, p. 9) Council Directive 75/319/EEC Council Directive 78/420/EEC (OJ L 123, 11. 5. 1978, p. 26) Council Directive 83/570/EECCouncil Directive 89/341/EEC Council Directive 92/27/EEC Council Directive 93/39/EECCommission Directive 2000/38/EC (OJ L 139, 10. 6. 2000, p. 28) Council Directive 89/342/EEC (OJ L 142, 25. 5. 1989, p. 14) Council Directive 89/343/EEC (OJ L 142, 25. 5. 1989, p. 16)Council Directive 89/381/EEC (OJ L 181, 28. 6. 1989, p. 44) Council Directive 92/25/EEC (OJ L 113, 30. 4. 1992, p. 1) Council Directive 92/26/EEC (OJ L 113, 30. 4. 1992, p. 5) Council Directive 92/27/EEC Council Directive 92/28/EEC (OJ L 113, 30. 4. 1992, p. 13) Council Directive 92/73/EEC (OJ L 297, 13. 10. 1992, p. 8)2001L0083 \u2014 EN \u2014 01.07.2003 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 91B PART B Time-limitsfortranspositionintonationallaw(referred tobyArticle 128) Directive Deadline for transposition Directive 65/65/EEC 31 December 1966 Directive 66/454/EEC \u2014 Directive 75/318/EEC 21 November 1976 Directive 75/319/EEC 21 November 1976 Directive 78/420/EEC \u2014Directive 83/570/EEC 31 October 1985 Directive 87/19/EEC 1 July 1987 Directive 87/21/EEC 1 July 1987 1 January 1992 ( 1) Directive 89/341/EEC 1 January 1992 Directive 89/342/EEC 1 January 1992 Directive 89/343/EEC 1 January 1992 Directive 89/381/EEC 1 January 1992 Directive 91/507/EEC 1 January 1992 (2) 1 January 1995 (3) Directive 92/25/EEC 1 January 1993 Directive 92/26/EEC 1 January 1993 Directive 92/27/EEC 1 January 1993 Directive 92/28/EEC 1 January 1993 Directive 92/73/EEC 31 December 1993 Directive 93/39/EEC 1 January 1995 (4) 1 January 1998 (5) Directive 1999/82/EC 1 January 2000 Directive 1999/83/EC 1 March 2000 Directive 2000/38/EC 5 December 2001 (1) Deadline for transposition applicable to Greece, Spain and Portugal.
