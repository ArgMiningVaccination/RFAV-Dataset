World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-Aprill996 Editorial Culture and health Or Hiroshi Naka;ima , Director-General of WHO. Written in 1946, WHO's Constitution provides us with a strikingly modem definition of health. It is \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the ab\u00ad sence of disease or infirmity\". This notion of well-being is often under\u00ad stood today in terms of people's perceptions of their quality of life as individuals and members of society. We must realize, however, that such perceptions are largely shaped by the values and symbolic representa\u00ad tions which prevail in any group or culture. As cultural representations of the human body , time, life, death and disease vary, so do people's approaches to action, prevention and treatment. Procreation, childbirth, weaning, sexuality, death, disease and suffering are not just private experiences but all have an intrinsic social dimension. The health condi\u00ad tions in which they take place are often determined as much by cultural practices as by biological and envi\u00ad ronmental factors. For example, traditional practices such as female genital mutilation, or food taboos during pregnancy and childhood, can have serious consequences for peo\u00ad ple's health. Similarly , until recently, though highly addictive and harmful to health, smoking was generally accepted as part of social life. The Mr Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO. current increase in noncommunica\u00ad ble diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases can only be understood in connection with the worldwide spread of new lifestyles and diet. To reduce sickness and death among mothers and children, to promote family planning, to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, to foster the rational use of health services or the social integration of the disabled, to improve nutrition or to control violence, we must be able to influence behaviours, cultural attitudes and lifestyles. From that point of view, WHO's community and family health approaches are particularly important for achieving social and cultural relevance in health work. UNESCO also has a major role to play in devising appro\u00ad priate means of communicating about health so that each community can develop healthy lifestyles that are in harmony with its social, cul\u00ad tural and economic environment. As health workers and educators we have a twofold responsibility: firstly, to provide equitable access to safe and effective health care and services; and secondly, to provide the necessary knowledge, information and infrastructure that will enable people to take care of themselves and promote their own health and that of their families. To be effective and 3 sustainable, our health policies and interventions, including our educa\u00ad tion programmes, must be based not only on hard scientific and epidemio\u00ad logical evidence but also on people's personal experience of life and health and their own priorities and constraints. To ensure community participa\u00ad tion, we must build health develop\u00ad ment on what people know and what they want and are therefore prepared to support in the long run. We must also be able to rally the cooperation of respected community members such as traditional healers and birth attendants. While maintaining our concern to make safe and effective care of good quality available to all, we must show our willingness both to learn from others and to share our knowledge and experience with them. Much empirical knowledge , for example on medicinal plants, has been accumulated by various cul\u00ad tures and traditions which we must recognize and preserve as part of the common cultural and scientific heritage of mankind. As lead agency for the United Nations World Decade for Cultural Development, UNESCO has chosen this year to focus more particularly on \"Culture and health\". In May 1996, a joint UNESCO/WHO International Conference will be held in Chiang Rai, hosted by the Government of Thailand, to assess the work carried out to date and propose further avenues for coopera\u00ad tion so that health and culture can be developed in a mutually supportive manner which will benefit all peo\u00ad ples in all countries. Hiroshi Naka;;ma Federico Mayor 4 World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-April1996 Traditional medicine and WHO Xiaorui Zhang Traditional medicine plays a very important role in primary health care in many developing countries, and its use has increased in recent years. To enhance its safety and eff~ctiveness, WHO supports research and training activities in Member States. matter of ensuring that traditional medicine is examined critically and with an open mind. A progress report on traditiona l medicine and modem health care presented to the World Health Assembly in 1991 emphasized five major areas of concern: national programme development; health systems and operational research; clinical and scientific investigations; education and training; and exchange of information. The Programme's future directions were to focus on three main activities: national poli\u00ad cies, medicinal plants, and acupunc\u00ad A traditional practitioner in Congo treating his patient. ture. Then in 1994 at the World Health Assembly governments called on the Director -General \"to consider the contribution WHO might make to promot\u00ad ing respect for, and maintenance of, indigenous knowledge , traditions and remedies , in particular, their pharmacopoeia \". In 1977, the year WHO's Tradi\u00ad tional Medicine Programme was established, the World Health Assembly urged governments \"to give adequate importance to the utilization of their traditional systems of medicine, with appropriate regula\u00ad tions, as suited to their national health systems\". WHO is well aware that many elements of traditional medicine are beneficial, but others are not. In this respect, the Organization encourages and supports countries in their efforts to find safe and effective remedies and practices for use in health ser\u00ad vices. However, this does not amount to a blind endorsement of all forms of traditional medicine; it is a National policy As there is a shortage of medical doctors and pharmaceutical products, most of the population in developing countries still rely mainly on tradi\u00ad tional practitioners and local medici\u00ad nal plants for primary health care. Practitioners include traditional birth attendants, herbalists, and bone\u00ad setters. In Ghana, for example, the ratio of medical doctors to the total population is 1:20 000, whereas for traditional practitioners it is 1 :200. In Swaziland these figures are 1:10 000 and 1:100 respectively. Traditional birth attendants conduct 95% of the births in rural areas and 70% of the births in urban areas in some countries. During the last decade there has been a growing interest in traditional and alternative systems of medicine in industrialized countries. In the United States, a survey made in 1992 showed that about a third of the population made at least some use of alternative treatment such as herbal medicines, acupuncture, chiropractic and homoeopathy. Surveys in European countries showed similar interest; 60% of the Dutch and Belgian public have expressed their willingness to pay extra health insur\u00ad ance for alternative medicine, and 74% of the British public favour complementary medicine being available on the national health service. Herbal medicine Medicinal plants and herbs are of great importance to the health of individuals and communities; be- . tween 35 000 and 70 000 species have at one time or another been used for medical purposes, and international use of herbal medicines and natural products is steadily increasing. In 1993, the total sales of herbal medicines in China amounted to more than 14 billion yuan (US$ 2.4 billion), not including US$ 400 million worth of exports. The Malaysian Government estimates that sales of traditional medicine currently amount to US$ 60 million. In the United States and Canada, sales of herbal medicines showed a growth rate of 15% in 1990, while the national growth rates in western European countries ranged from 5% to 22%. In Japan, there was a 15- fold increase in herbal sales between 1979 and 1989, while sales of phar\u00ad maceutical products multiplied by only 2.6. Despite the existence of herbal medicines over many centuries, only a relatively small number of plant World Health 49th Yeor, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 species -about 5000 -have been studied for their possible medical applications. Safety and efficacy data exist only in respect of a much smaller number of plants, their ex\u00ad tracts and their active ingredients, as well as of preparations containing them. The establishment and use of regulation procedures and quality control have become major concerns in both developing and industrialized countries. Acupuncture Acupuncture is today being used worldwide because of the simplicity of its application, its minimal side\u00ad effects and its low cost. It has been in constant use in China for thou\u00ad sands of years, and spread to other oriental countries long ago. A big increase in the use of acupuncture and in training and research on it has also occurred worldwide in the last two decades. By 1990, the total number of acupuncturists in Europe had reached 88 000, of whom 62 000 were medical doctors, while acupuncture users totalled 20 mil\u00ad lion. Consumer surveys consistently showed positive public attitudes to complementary medicine; 90% of the pain clinics in the United Kingdom and 77% in Germany use acupuncture. Important advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms of acupuncture. In particular, great progress has been made in clinical research on acupuncture analgesia, which has been used during surgery and for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. As the use of acupuncture has grown, so has the need for training. Since the 1970s, WHO has sup\u00ad ported training in acupuncture by establishing collaborating centres and awarding fellowships. According to a report by three WHO collaborat\u00ad ing centres for traditional medicine in China, more than 6000 foreign stu\u00ad dents from over 100 countries were trained there during the last decade. In Europe, there are 242 permanent training schools of acupuncture with more than 7800 students. Training and research In order to ensure the safe and effec\u00ad tive use of traditional medicine, WHO supports research and training activities. There are now 24 WHO Collaborating Centres for Traditional Medicine; eight of them are involved in training and research on acupunc\u00ad ture while the others are conducting research on herbal medicines. The main role of the Collaborating Centres is to support WHO in imple\u00ad menting its policies and decisions regarding traditional medicine. In addition to their achievements in research and the integration of tradi\u00ad tional medicine into national health care systems, these centres have made a major contribution to the international standardization of herbal medicines and acupuncture, and the exchange of information. Governments in countries where traditional medicine is widely prac\u00ad tised are also showing an interest in research in this field. In China, for instance, each province has a college and a research institute for Chinese traditional medicine . In India, the government provides financial sup\u00ad port for the research and develop\u00ad ment of the Ayurvedic and Unani systems and their increasing involve\u00ad ment in the delivery of health ser\u00ad vices. Such systems are seen as allies in the delivery of primary health care. National research insti\u00ad tutes have been established in such countries as Burundi, Cameroon, Mali, Peru, the Philippines , Sudan and VietNam. Research institutes and founda\u00ad tions have also been established in industrialized countries. In the United States, for example, the Office of Alternative Medicine was initiated through a congressional mandate and was located in the National Institutes of Health in 1992. The goal of this office is to evaluate alternative or unconventional med\u00ad ical treatments, and research on acupuncture is a main aspect. In the United Kingdom , several research councils for acupuncture and com\u00ad plementary medicine have long been in existence, committed to encourag-Selling medicinal plants culled from tropical forests in Brazil. s ing collaborative research to find proof of the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and other forms of traditional medicine. European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical research (COST), which aims to improve pan\u00ad European collaboration in science and technology, was set up by the European Commission , which also funds the project. In June 1993, a COST group was established with a mandate to investigate the therapeu\u00ad tic significance of unconventional medicine , its cost-benefit ratio and its sociocultural importance as a basis for the evaluation of its possible use or risks in public health. WHO strongly supports the further promotion and development of the rational use of traditional medicine throughout the world. There is no doubt that this branch of medicine is making and will continue to make a very significant contribu\u00ad tion to our efforts to achieve health for all.

Switzerland. 6 World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 Building on local health culture Haile Mariam Kahssay The term \"community health worker\" (CHW) is used generi\u00ad cally by WHO to refer to men and women who are trained and supported by the health sector to work in their own communities. Some countries prefer to call them voluntary health workers, and they may also be known as village health guides (India), health cadres (Indonesia), or community health agents (Ethiopia). CHWs play a unique role because they belong both to the community and to the health sector. They make a practical and proven contribution to the core of the primary health care approach , which is the involvement of peo\u00ad ple. This is absolutely essential if the health sector is to promote good health rather than just control diseases. Mutual under\u00ad standing and cooperation are often difficult because the health sector is guided mainly by the sciences of medicine and public health, whereas the community is guided mainly by its own health culture, with its rich variety of attitudes, beliefs and practices. The CHW can greatly help to ease this relationship and thus im\u00ad prove the health services by providing a combination of scientific or management expertise and knowledge of the community and its culture. Health personnel tend to assume that people do not know anything. They often see communities as empty vessels into which scientific knowledge has to be The community health worker makes a practical and proven contribution to the core of the primary health care approach, which is the involvement of people.

But in reality, of A Family health worker in Nigeria visits a mother and her child. course, there are no empty vessels; they are filled with popular health culture. Perhaps those who know their communities and their health culture best are the traditional heal\u00ad ers. These are available in significant numbers in many parts of the world and are unlikely to disappear, despite the spread of modem health services. They have been found to be willing, effective and sustainable CHWs once they are given the necessary training and support. Traditional healers include people who may be known as herbalists, diviners, spiritual or faith healers, traditional birth attendants, curanderos,shamans,bone\u00ad setters and by many other names. Using available potential There is often strong oppo\u00ad sition to traditional healers on the grounds that they are not \"scientific\". On the other hand there are those who argue that whether they are \"scientific\" or not, they are effective. Furthermore, many people trust them, they are accessi\u00ad ble and affordable, and they are the only health services available to millions of people. In practice, argu\u00ad ments for and against traditional healers are not productive. It is more useful to start from the fact that they exist, they are accepted and used by their communities, and that in many cases they have the potential to be excellent CHWs. World Health 49th Yeor, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 In Bangladesh, a community health worker gives nutrition and family planning advice to village women. When a survey was made of projects that trained and used tradi\u00ad tional healers as community health workers, the findings were summa\u00ad rized as follows. Traditional healers are available and willing to work in community health. Traditional healers can be trained to perform a wide range of pri\u00ad mary health care tasks. Training has affected the atti\u00ad tudes, knowledge and practice of traditional healers in positive ways. Training the healers has proved to be cost-effective. The drop-out rate for traditional healers is much lower than that of otherCHWs. On the other hand, there are also a number of difficulties to be over\u00ad come in using traditional healers as CHWs. The most important of these were found to be the following. There is a lack of supportive government policies to promote cooperation with and use of traditional healers in primary health care. This lack of clear policy has helped to foster a negative atti-tu de on the part of health staff towards traditional healers. Many healers are illiterate or lack formal education , thus making it difficult for health staff to discuss ideas and approaches with them. WHO followed up this survey with an in-depth field evaluation of the effectiveness of programmes in which traditional healers were trained to carry out primary health care services in rural communities. Projects in Bangladesh, Ghana and Mexico were evaluated . As a result of this and other available informa\u00ad tion and experience, WHO has been able to produce guidelines whose aim is to assist individuals and orga\u00ad nizations to develop the right kind of training programmes. These will enable traditional healers to play a significant role in improving the health of their communities because they know the local traditions and culture, and can therefore build on them with the help of the modem health sector.

Micozzi For 80% of the world's people, approaches that Western medicine might label \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" constitute primary care. Far from being experimental, they have been \"field-tested\" by millions of people for thousands of years. My experience as a physician and anthropologist has taught me that, in a world marked by complexity and diversity, no one system of health beliefs alone provides a formula that will allow us to offer effective medical care for the whole human family. Policy-makers and experts in the field of health would do well to adopt an attitude of open-minded respect towards the world's diversity of health beliefs and practices. What we need is an eclectic health model in which peo\u00ad ple can choose from a variety of health traditions. Here's why: Even gastronomy can promote health. Western medicine has stepped up its efforts to educate people on healthy eating so as to reduce the risks of cardiovascular diseases. Western medicine has produced the finest system of emergency medical care the world has yet seen, but allopathic medicine (i.e. medi\u00ad cine which counteracts the effects of the disease being treated) is neither perfect nor always affordable. During the last hundred years or so, Western physicians have embraced the science of medicine , and our initial success in dealing with a host of infectious diseases has encouraged us to believe that the future will always hold \"miracle cures\". Since the 1970s, scientists in the Western world have been searching for a cure for cancer. Many now suspect that neither this ongoing effort nor the international project to map the entire human genome will produce affordable magic bullets for heart disease, cancer or even arthritis. Our contemporary focus on science and technology has led us to construct a medical system founded on expensive machines, powerful drugs and invasive procedures . It has also created therapeutic expectations which encourage people to believe that they can escape the conse\u00ad quences of risky health behaviour. Patients, physicians and governments need a wellness-based medical sys\u00ad tem in which the goal is to keep the patient out of the hospital in the first place. Spiritual component Our reliance on scientific biomedi\u00ad cine as the ultimate \"gold standard\" causes concern to many because this system does not accord a central place for the potential of the body to heal itself. It often detaches the health of people from their place in the natural world, and does not easily incorporate a spiritual component in healing. However, these important aspects of healing have long been recognized by the traditional health belief systems of Asia and Africa and of indigenous American peoples. In these approache s, the healer attempts to restore a sense of balance by focusing on the individual 's relation to the community and to nature. Few traditional healers would attempt to restore a person to health without involving the body's natural abilities. Western health experts acknowledge that such abilities exist but often are not able to incorporate them in healing; much effort has gone into exporting biomedicine to the developing world, but many have concluded that developing nations simply cannot afford it. Indeed, there are now doubts about how much longer the West itself can afford the cost of Western medicine, given our current \"health care crisis\". World Health 49th Yeor, No. 2, Morch-April1996 A traditional healer at work in Congo. Relating the patient to his natural world will boost the potential of the body to heal itself. In my view, traditional health care systems have yet to achieve the respect they deserve in the West because of misinformation. Many people are put off by the phrase \"alternative medicine.\" It might be helpful to point out that, for 80% of the world's people, approaches that we might label \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" constitute primary care. Some physicians refer to these traditions as if they were experimen\u00ad tal, or a new, untested discovery without a sound intellectual basis and history, whereas in reality they have been \"field-tested\" by millions of people for thousands of years. While it is hard to make valid generaliza\u00ad tions about human behaviour , it is probably fair to say that human cultures are unlikely to continue to invest their time and energy in ap\u00ad proaches which don't work. The fact that these health belief systems have been passed down from one genera\u00ad tion to another for so long is worthy of serious attention. Inner resources ing. Anyone who has cut a finger or bruised a knee has seen this principle at work. A medical treatment simply mobilizes the body's own resources to respond. A key component of these tradi\u00ad tions is respect for nutrition and natural products in maintaining good health. As a component of the nat\u00ad ural world, humans were \"designed \" to eat certain foods. This also ex\u00ad plains why we obtain the best nutri\u00ad ents not from vitamin pills but from nature itself. It is no coincidence that plants do not only provide the oxy\u00ad gen we breathe, but serve as the source of many foods and pharma\u00ad ceuticals that people have come to depend on. In the United States, for example, two-thirds of the drugs currently available on the market are originally based on medicinal plants. Since cost has become an essential factor in shaping the kind of health care people have access to, it is worth noting that one reason for herbal medicines being relatively inexpensive is that they cannot be patented. The international commu\u00ad nity has begun to recognize the importance of protecting the world's flora, but equally important is the indigenous knowledge of how these plants can be used for medicinal purposes. 9 During the last decade, efforts to export Western medicine to the developing world have been com\u00ad plemented by a kind of \"reverse technology transfer\". Medical approaches and techniques originat\u00ad ing in China, India and elsewhere have achieved strong footholds in Europe and the United States. Doctors are healers first; they will use any acceptable treatment that has been shown to work. While main\u00ad taining safety we need to work towards a truly integrated medical model in which different systems can coexist. Or Marc S. Micozzi is Executive Director of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, 19 South 22nd Street, Philadelphia, PA 191 03\u00b73097. USA These traditions are important be\u00ad cause they recognize that health is not a gift that some outside person or process can bestow on a patient. Wellness results from a balance of inner resources with the physical and social environment. Many of these belief systems also understand that self-healing is the basis of all heal-A Chinese woman feeds her child in the street. Wellness results from a balance between inner resources and the physical and social environment . 10 World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 Food beliefs and taboos Mohammed Abdussalam & Fritz Kiiferstein The primary function of food is to provide nourishment. Nevertheless, in every society there are dietary customs which play sociocultural and symbolic roles that go far beyond the mere nourishment of the body. So it is extremely important for health workers to understand these roles and their implications when seeking solutions for a community's nutritional and food safety problems . The natural environments and trade channels of all human groups provide a variety of nutrients or the potential to produce them. But the nutrients do not automatically be\u00ad come food until they are so defined and are culturally accepted as fit for human consumption. Because of aesthetic preferences, religious taboos, health beliefs and the like, some nutritionally valuable foods are often excluded from the diet. Although people in Western commu- nities have plenty of scientific knowledge about nutrition and di\u00ad etetics, they generally avoid eating horse or dog flesh, the eyes and lungs of cattle and sheep, snakes and igua\u00ad nas, mare's and ewe's milk, dolphins, locusts, grubs, scorpions and sea\u00ad weed. Yet all these items are freely consumed in other cultures and are biologically valuable foods. A recent survey of a South Asian population showed a general correla\u00ad tion between income and nutritional status, the rich being better nourished than the poor. Yet the poorest mem\u00ad bers of the community were as well nourished as the middle-income groups, simply because they were uninhibited in their choice of nutri\u00ad ents and supplemented their diet with Certain nutritionally valuable food items may be excluded from the diet for aesthetic, religious or other reasons. Food can also be mishandled, unwisely prepared or inadequately cooked. Health education must be carefully designed to correct such practices in socially and culturally appropriate ways. Cultural taboos The avoidance of specific types of food is a widespread phenomenon and applies more commonly to food of animal origin. Religious and other beliefs often call for this avoid-ance, but other cultural factors are involved as well; some foods are regarded as being of low prestige, for example. Most people avoid the meat of animals that have died of natural causes, especially if they were dis\u00ad eased. This natural trait is strength\u00ad ened by injunctions of the major religions. However, beliefs can differ sharply. One of the writers once saw migrant workers in the western Himalayas carrying away meat from a calf that had died of anthrax, a deadly disease, and was told that such meat had a special \"sweetish\" taste which they highly appreciated . The meat was later confiscated and incinerated by the authorities. In most societies, cannibalism would be imaginab le only in desper\u00ad ate circumstances. Yet in a number of cultural environments it has been snake and rat meat. A fish market. Food preferences are closely linked with cultural factors.

Culinary practices have usually evolved in such a way as to ensure safe food even in an unhygienic environment. practised as a ritual. In some tribes, eating the brain of dead ancestors was thought to be a way of obtaining their wisdom, but scientists have seen it as a possible mode of trans\u00ad mission of kuru, an infection en\u00ad demic in some parts of the highlands of eastern Papua New Guinea. The tribes themselves consider kuru to be the result of sorcery. Important examples of food avoidance are pork among Jews, Muslims and Ethiopian Christians; beef among Hindus, some Buddhists and Jains; chicken and eggs in some African communities; dog meat in the West; fish in Mongolia and other parts of central Asia; milk and milk products in Polynesia and parts of China. Some communities avoid all food derived from animals. Folk wisdom Through trial and error over genera\u00ad tions, traditional societies have developed culinary practices which enable them to prepare and eat safe food even in unhygienic environ\u00ad ments. Some examples are: thor\u00ad ough boiling of milk, cooking meat in small pieces to facilitate heat penetration, using proper fermenta\u00ad tion processes, and eating freshly cooked food. But folk wisdom is not an infalli-safe culinary practices. For example, it is a widely held belief that raw food of animal origin is more invigo\u00ad rating and strengthening than cooked food. Raw fish and meat dishes such as sashimi in the East, steak tartar in Europe and ceviche in Latin America are well known and are now avail\u00ad able in special restaurants world\u00ad wide. There are many other raw dishes consumed locally in different parts of the world which encourage transmission of food-borne diseases and parasites. Many folk beliefs require preg\u00ad nant and lactating women to avoid eating meat and eggs, or in some ble guide to healthy food habits and A family eating supper in Bangladesh. societies even to cut out fruit and vegetables. Scientifically, these are precisely the foods they need. Food processing 11 In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in developing rela\u00ad tively inexpensive technologies to make food safe for human consump\u00ad tion without reducing its nutritive value. Unfortunate ly, prejudice and cultural resistance to some of the most useful of these technologies, such as irradiation and microwave cooking, prevents their full exploita\u00ad tion. Heat treatment (such as pasteur\u00ad ization, frying, grilling or roasting) destroys most of the disease-produc\u00ad ing organisms in food, if properly carried out. But people may not cook their food adequately either because they prefer a raw taste or because they cannot pay for fuel. In either case they expose themselves to serious risks of food borne disease. Lack of adequate cooking facili\u00ad ties was highlighted some years ago by an outbreak of the pig tapeworm (Taenia solium) infection and a serious disease with its larval form (cysticercosis) among inhabitants of the lrian Jaya Highlands (Indonesia) . These people live in close contact with their pigs, but \"cooking\" merely 12 World Health 49th Yeor, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 means placing slices of pork, alter\u00ad nated with vegetables, among hot stones.

Very soon a large percentage of pigs as well as people were infected, and cysticercosis produced epileptic fits, coma and death. The outbreak is now reported to be under control. also their sociocultural basis, includ\u00ad ing tradition and beliefs. Recent development of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach has provided a simple and relatively inexpensive method of identifying safety hazards in food habits and in culinary practices . secondly, it should be able to bear any economic and social costs it may involve. It is clearly desirable to change food-related behaviour which leads to malnutrition or to the transmission of agents of disease. Before deciding on intervention strategies, it is neces\u00ad sary to obtain full information about the practices to be changed -not only their health implications but Once the hazards as well as the critical points for their control have been identified , health education can be designed to induce the community and individuals to correct hazardou s practices . Two important principles have to be observed to assure the desired changes: firstly, the commu\u00ad nity should perceive the advantage of Professor Mohammed Abdussalam is a former staff member of WHO; his address is 48 chemin des Coudriers, 1209 Geneva, Switzerland.

The implication is that all that matters to the stomach is that it remain full. Of course, the eye and the palate are considerably more discriminating about what in fact goes into the stomach. Nevertheless, choice in the matter is determined to a large extent by culture and geography . From the universal need for every one of the earth's estimated 4237 mammalian species to obtain nourishment, the focus for the individual is on the specific foods that are actually available and eaten. Apart from one exception, then, it is probably not an exaggeration to say that there is no single universal food. And what is this exception? Why, breast milk of course! Breast milk is the contemporary universal nutritional link par excellence for the entire human species -north, east, south and west, all 5700 million of us. Historically, it is also a vital nutritional link in the human family's unending chain; it helps to define our place in the parade of generations, as much in terms of those who came before us as of those who will come after. No substitute, not even the most sophisticated and nutritionally balanced infant formula, can Mother's milk, the common heritage of humanity. possibly compete with the multiple wonders of breast milk. But then, how could it? After 60 million or so years of mammalian evolution -or what many attribute to the perfect hand of the Creator - a synthetic product that is usually based on the milk of another species could hardly be expected to measure up. Nor can artificial feeding do more than approximate the act of breast-feeding, in physiologica l and emotional significance, for babies and mothers alike. And so, no matter how important it is to provide a nutritionally balanced substitute when babies are not breast-fed, giving them something else in place of breast milk will always be a deviation from the biological norm for our speci~s. Indeed, breast milk transcends culture and geography, uniting us all through our common nutritional heritage.

World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-Aprill996 13 Ritual and culture Helmut L. Sell Social and cultural factors underly the abuse of different substances. There is even a \"caste system\" among illicit drug users in certain parts of the world. Mind-altering substances have been used in many cultures for millennia. Their use was socially sanctione d and often formed part of social or religious rituals. Cannabis is still consumed at reli\u00ad gious festivals in some parts of Asia. Where alcohol is widely used, it is an accepted part of adult social behaviour; in some families adoles\u00ad cents are introduced to alcohol con\u00ad sumption in a rite of passage and many kinds of celebration involve symbolic or social drinking. The ritualistic and social nature of alcohol consumption is also obvious from the large number of customs surrounding it. For instance, differ\u00ad ent types of glasses must be used for different alcoholic drinks; it is seen as improper to offer champagne in a coffee mug or plastic cup, whereas water, coffee or soft drinks may be taken from any container. Certain drinks are to be consumed at specific times of the day; friendships are confirmed over a glass of wine, and so forth. Culturally and socially accepted forms of drug use, including intoxi\u00ad cation on specified festive occasions, have been strongly defended when governments have tried to impose bans. In Thailand , for example, a civil war followed a ban on opium in 1811, leading finally to the opium franchise of 1851 permitting trading Even though if tastes terrible of first, young people often go on smoking for fear of losing status among their peers. it is essential therefore that health education messages are aimed primarily of the very young. under official control. The attempt to ban alcohol in the USA in the 1930s was notoriously unsuccessful. There are even cultural differ\u00ad ences in the ways drugs affect peo\u00ad ple. The Chittagong Hills on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border are a sort of watershed for the effect of opiates: to the east the drugs are incapacitating, to the west they are invigorating. Landowners in India still sometimes give opium to their labourers to make them work harder; and the Rajput warriors of north-west India took opium before going into battle in order to fight more fiercely. One important issue often over\u00ad looked is that all substances of abuse have an unpleasant effect for the uninitiated , usually giddiness and nausea. Why do people work so hard to become smokers, for example? Most commonly, it is probably be\u00ad cause youngsters feel that some special status is to be achieved by becoming a smoker. If drug initiation is accompanied by fear of the unknown , the danger\u00ad ous and illegal, the anxiety-alleviat\u00ad ing effect of drugs may come as a pleasant surprise, with a feeling of relief. But the puzzling question remains: why do people continue taking drugs if they have initially unpleasant effects? A variety of factors influence people to switch from oral drug use to injecting. In many instances socio\u00ad cultural factors are particularly strong. This can be seen when the inconvenience and discomfort of using a syringe are apparently out\u00ad weighed by the attraction of joining the drug injectors' sub-culture. There is even a kind of \"caste system\" among drug users in some societies. Those who inject do not normally mix with those who inhale drugs. Heroin inhalers sometimes look down upon cannabis smokers, and all of them despise alcohol abusers.

Throughout human history, breast-feeding and parents sleeping alongside their infants constituted a marvellously adaptive system in which both the mothers' and infants' sleep physiology and health were connected in beneficial ways. By sleeping next to its mother, temperature. The mother's proxim\u00ad ity also stimulates the infant to feed more frequently, thus receiving more antibodies to fight disease. The increased nipple contact also causes changes in the mother's hormone levels that help to prevent a new pregnancy before the infant is ready to be weaned. In this way the infant regulates its mother's biology, too; increased breast-feeding blocks ovulation , which helps to ensure that pregnancies will not ordinarily occur until the mother's body is able to restore the fat and iron reserves needed for optimal maternal health. It is a curious fact that in Western societies the practice of mothers, fathers and infants sleeping together has come to be thought of as strange, unhealthy and dangerous. Western parents are taught that \"eo-sleeping \" will make the infant too dependent on them, or risk accidenta l suffoca\u00ad tion. Such views are not supported by human experience worldwide, however, where for perhaps millions of years infants as a matter of course slept next to at least one caregiver, usually the mother, in order to sur\u00ad vtve. At some point in recent history infant separateness with low parental contact during the night came to be advocated by child care specialists, while infant-parent interdependence with high parental contact came to be discouraged. In fact, the few psycho\u00ad logical studies which are available suggest that children who have \"eo\u00ad slept\" in a loving and safe environ\u00ad ment become better adjusted adults than those who were encouraged to sleep without parental contact or reassurance. Complex history The fear of suffocating infants has a long and complex cultural history. Since before the middle ages \"over\u00ad lying\" or suffocating infants deliber\u00ad ately was common, particularly among the poor in crowded cities. This form of infanticide led local church authorities to make laws forbidding parents to let infants sleep next to them. The practice of giving infants alcohol or opiates to get them to sleep also became common; under such conditions , babies often did not wake up and it was presumed that the mothers must have overlaid them. Also, in smoke-filled, under-venti\u00ad lated rooms, infants can easily suc\u00ad cumb to asphyxia. Unfortunately, health officials in some Western countries promote the message that sleep contact between the mother and infant increases the World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 parents within a year, whereas humans take 14 to 17 years to be\u00ad come fully devel\u00ad oped physically, and usually longer than that to be fully indepen\u00ad dent. Sleeping beside her child enables the mother to give it constant attention. Apart from being a natural characteristic of our species, constant proxim\u00ad ity to the mother during infancy is also made neces\u00ad sary by the need to feed frequently. Human milk is composed of relatively low amounts of pro\u00ad tein and fat, and chances of the infant dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). But the research on which this message is based only indicates that bed-sharing can be dangerous when it occurs in the context of extreme poverty or when the mother is a smoker. Some researchers have attempted to export this message to other cultures. However , in Japan, for example, where eo-sleeping is the norm, SIDS rates are among the lowest in the world, which suggests that this arrangement may actually help to prevent SIDS. Human infants need constant attention and contact with other human beings because they are unable to look after themselves. Unlike other mammals, they cannot keep themselves warm, move about or feed themselves until relatively late in life. It is their extreme neuro\u00ad logical immaturity at birth and slow maturation that make the mother\u00ad infant relationship so important. The human infant's brain is only about 25% of its adult weight at birth, whereas most other mammals are born with 60-90% of their adult brain size. The young of most other mam\u00ad mals become independent of their high amounts of quickly absorbed and metabolized sugars. Therefore the infant's hunger cycle is short, as is the time spent in deep sleep. All of these factors seem to indicate that the custom of separat\u00ad ing infants from their parents during sleep time is more the result of cul\u00ad tural history than of fundamental physiological or psychological needs. Sleep laboratory studies Sleep laboratory studies have shown that bed-sharing instead of sleeping in separate rooms almost doubled the number of breast-feeding episodes and tripled the total nightly duration of breast-feeding. Infants cried much less frequently when sleeping next to their mothers, and spent less time awake. We think that the more frequently infants are breast-fed, the less likely they are to die from cot\u00ad death. Our scientific studies of mothers and infants sleeping together have shown how tightly bound together the physiological and social aspects of the mother-infant relationship really are. Other studies have shown IS that separation of the mother and infant has adverse consequences. Anthropological considerations also suggest that separation between the mother and infant should be minimal. Western societies must consider carefully how far and under what circumstances they want to push infants away from the loving and protective eo-sleeping environment. Infants' nutritional, emotional and social needs -as well as maternal responses to them-have evolved in this environment for millennia. Or james).

The way Asian Families tend their infants may have a bearing on the low rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Babies have been dying suddenly and unexpectedly for centuries. In the First Book of Kings in the Old Testament, written about 500 BC, we read: \"And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it\". For many centuries overlying by the mother (causing suffocatio n) was accepted as the cause of sudden unexpected infant deaths. It was not until the late 18th century that doctors began to explore other possible causes for such deaths, beginning with the hypothesis that these infants suffered from an en\u00ad larged thymus, leading to \"internal suffocation\". This was widely ac\u00ad cepted throughout the 19th century and indeed into the 1930s, when it became discredited. In 1969, a definition of the term Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was agreed upon at an inter\u00ad national conference in the USA: Commonly known as \"cot deaths\", the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is remarkable for its widely different rates between various ethnic groups. The baby's sleeping position and whether or not the mother smokes appear to have a direct bearing on those rates. \"The sudden death of any infant or young child, which is unexpected by history and in which a thorough postmortem examination fails to demonstrate an adequate cause for death\". The second half of the 20th cen\u00ad tury has seen many hypotheses proposed about the cause of these deaths. Millions of research dollars have been spent on efforts to identify the mechanism of death, and these efforts are continuing. The SIDS rate is now less than 1 per 1000 live births in most Western cultures. At the same time, medical science has been taking increasing interest in the differences that exist in the SIDS rates between various ethnic groups. For example, studies have shown a low rate among Asian families, even if they are immigrants living in a Western society. Most researchers now feel that there are useful lessons to be learnt from different cultural practices in relation to child care. Let us look at three widely accepted recommendations on reducing the risks of SIDS. World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-Aprill996 1. Place your baby on its back to sleep. Many studies have indicated a strong association between prone (front) sleeping and the occurrence of SIDS. The practice of placing babies face downwards to sleep became popular in many Western countries in the 1970s and 1980s-a period marked by high SIDS figures. Prone sleep\u00ad ing is not favoured in Asian families, even those resident in Western soci\u00ad eties. Evidence from Hong Kong, where there are virtually no cases of SIDS, confirms this avoidance of prone sleeping. In countries where, over the past few years, a strong message has been conveyed to par\u00ad ents to avoid the prone sleeping position, there has been a marked reduction -in some cases of 60% - in the number of SIDS cases. This would strongly suggest that the Western practice of placing infants prone for sleep was actually harmful. Smoking is harmful for the foetus. When the habit continues after the birth, the infant will be put at increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 2. Avoid smoking during pregnancy and around the baby during the first year of life. Smoking, particularly among moth\u00ad ers, has emerged as a major risk factor for SIDS. Studies have shown that maternal cigarette smoking increases the risk of SIDS for a baby as much as sevenfold , with an even greater risk if the father smokes too. In New Zealand, where a forceful campaign to reduce the risks of SIDS has been promoted since 1990, there has been a striking drop in the inci\u00ad dence of SIDS among non-Maori infants, but a far less marked reduc\u00ad tion among Maoris, whose infants are now four times as likely to be SIDS victims as non-Maori infants. Researchers in that country are convinced that one of the reasons for this difference is that Maori women are twice as likely to smoke as non\u00ad Maori women. Smoking was intro\u00ad duced relatively recently in Maori society but has become a cultural norm. Conversely, smoking is un\u00ad common among Asian women, whose infants seem to be at very low risk of SIDS. 3. Avoid overwrapping your baby. Studies have indicated that babies may be at increased risk of SIDS if they are too warm. A study of Welsh and Bangladeshi families in Cardiff, Wales, published in 1993, demon\u00ad strated that the Asian mothers were much more concerned about the danger of their infant overheating, and this was one of the explanations given for the practice of shaving babies' heads. Welsh mothers, on the other hand, were anxious to keep their infants warm. Is stimulation desirable? Over the past three years, consider\u00ad able interest has also focused on the possibility that stimulation may play a role in reducing the risk of SIDS. Asian families, with their low SIDS incidence, often live in an extended \u00ad family situation, with aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents forming part of the household. The baby is kept in the heart of the family during the day, subject to the noise and bustle and accustomed to a busy social and tactile environment. Western babies are much more likely to be placed \"somewhere quiet\" for sleep periods; the suggestion has been made that this lack of both supervision and stimulation may not be advantageous. Be careful not to leave your baby alone for too long. 17 At night the Asian infant sleeps either in bed with the mother or in a cot next to her. The fact that this practice is associated with a low incidence of SIDS has led some researchers to think that bed-sharing may be desirable for all infants. However, research from New Zealand has indicated a significantly increased risk of SIDS for infants sharing a bed with a mother who smokes. Maori mothers are twice as likely as non-Maoris to both smoke and bed-share. Bed-sharing is a traditional infant care practice for the Maori, while smoking is an introduced practice. Educators in New Zealand are there\u00ad fore trying to discourage smoking, while encouraging the treasured tradition of bed-sharing. The low incidence of SIDS among bed-shar\u00ad ing Asian infants may reflect the fact that few Asian mothers smoke. Cultural differences may well suggest valid ways of reducing the risks of SIDS, but it is important to see these differences as interdepen\u00ad dent parts of rich and varied cultures, rather than in isolation. In addition, we may have to face, in all our cul\u00ad tures, a rise in SIDS rates caused by the use of illegal substances. Mrs Hazel Brooke is Chairman of SIDS International.

Characteristically, most of the traditional healing methods in Africa have not been recorded and written down. This orally trans\u00ad mitted healing knowledge is usually only known to initiated healers themselves. People are understood to obtain this knowledge either from initiated healers or from ancestral spirits. Most of the literature on traditional and faith healing in Africa concerns mental disorders. Although in a traditional context mental and physical disorders cannot be sepa\u00ad rated, most healing methods focus on psychosocial problems and disorders. Most psychosocial problems and disorders can be classified in the following way: social disorders (economic and occupational problems, family problems , sorcery, witchcraft, theft, security and legal problems); psychoneurotic disorders (hyste\u00ad ria, depressive other sub\u00ad stances; psychosocial problems in patients with infertility, epilepsy, sterility, organic psychosis, mental handi\u00ad cap and development disabilities; terminal or chronic diseases requiring psychosocial rehabilita\u00ad tion. Outpatient setting for traditional healing The typical outpatient setting is at the healer's own house, but sometimes the healer con\u00ad ducts home visits. More rarely, witchcraft is deemed to be affecting a whole community, such as a village or a school. In such cases, the group concerned may be \"cleansed\" from witches and wizards by a witchfinder, in World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 Faith healers may succeed in offering positive support for their urban clients, but they are not usually well versed in the nature of modem psychosocial disorders. As a result, more and more patients, especially in urban Africa, feel the need for psychotherapy. called a \"public health approach\". Cleansing ceremonies of this kind seem to be on the decrease, while there is an increasing trend to join \"born-again\" Christian movements which seek to have a long-term effect by changing ways of living and personality traits that are judged harmful to health. Treatment in possessio n cults usually takes place in an outpatient setting. A potentially good spirit is thought to express itself through the patient while he or she is in a \"pos\u00ad session trance\" during which the patient may be initiated into the cult. disorders related to the use of what might be Traditional healers can treat a whole range of psychosocial disorders. World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-Aprill996 The members and the leaders of such cults meet from time to time, particu\u00ad larly when new patients are to be initiated. Often the members per\u00ad form dances accompanied by drum\u00ad ming, clapping hands, and songs leading to kinetic trance. A wide range of continuous outpatient services also take place in the context of Christian churches, independent or healing churches, or born-again Christian and Islamic communities. Members are initiated at ceremonies comparable to those of the traditional possession cults and usually have to follow various rules of behaviour. These healing churches seem particularly effective in combating alcohol dependence and in helping patients come to terms with chronic and terminal diseases. Some healing churches have even developed a specific treatment pro\u00ad gramme for alcoholics in which a drug-free community- including former alcoholics- plays a major role. The inpatient setting Inpatient treatment can take place at the healer's home or in a house built specially for this purpose in the village. The home setting is used for patients with mental disorders, and the family members of the healer often participate . Inpatient treatment at village healing centres is offered to both mentally and physically ill patients. The treatment methods may include herbal and symbolic therapy, \"milieu therapy\", dream interpretation , counselling during daily \"ward rounds\" or in group sessions, prayers and songs, a special diet, kinetic trance, dancing and sacrifice. Those involved include the chief healer, assistants , patients and relatives. The goal of treatment is to allow the patient to readapt gradually to culturally appropriate forms of com\u00ad munity life in which the spirits of the ancestors and group solidarity play an important part. Since normally a relative cares for the patient in the healing centre, the family context of the psychosocial disorder can be 19 In Botswana, a family health worker calls on all patients in the village known to be suffering from psychiatric disorders. further assessed and treated; usually the relative helps in the rehabilitation of the patient. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy may appear to be a luxury in African countries. However , to be effective, treatment of diseases of poverty such as pro\u00ad tein-energy malnutrition, most often include psychosocial counselling and diseases of affluence, such as psy\u00ad chosomatic headache due to stress, may require psychotherapy. General medical and psychiatric services are prescribing psychotropic medication for an increasin g number of psycho\u00ad logically ill patients in African coun\u00ad tries. pathologie s such as psychosomatic disorders, substance abuse and other chronic modern diseases. Faith healers may succeed in offering positive support for their urban clients, but they are not usually well versed in the nature of modern psy\u00ad chosocial disorders.

Professor Korl Peltzer is Associate Professor at the University of Malawi, Private Bog I, Lilongwe, Malawi.

Ellen M. Einterz A doctor confronted every day with the clash of different beliefs and socioeconomic pressures tries to take a balanced view to promote better understanding between professional health workers and their patients. C ommunities in rural Africa are commonly served by medical personnel who were born, raised and trained in distant parts of their multicultural country. These doctors and nurses, even if they are from the same country, may speak none of the local language s and may be familiar with few of the cultural characteristics which defme the population for whose health care they have become responsible. Judgements too hastily made-the people are ignorant, indifferent , closed to new ideas, unwilling to cooperate -may leave the medical worker deeply discouraged. In the village where I work in northern Cameroon, popular belief holds that a breast-feeding infant who imbibes the milk of a mother newly pregnant with her next child will fall gravely ill. The milk, they say, is contaminated by the fetus and infects the suckling child, causing diarrhoea , anorexia and weight loss. At the first suspicion of a new preg\u00ad nancy, therefore, a lactating mother stops breast-feeding , regardless of the age of the weanling , who, as a consequence eats less nutritiously , loses weight, suffers recurrent episodes of diarrhoea, develops kwashiorkor and subsequently dies. Knowing her child had sucked at her breast before she realized she was pregnant again, the mother under-Medica/science alone does not provide all the answers; doctors need to understand the culture and beliefs of the people they treat. stands that his early demise was to be expected. Does she understand wrong? We medical doctors have our own explanation . We believe that some combination of the child's basic nutritional requirements was not provided, and that this deficiency set off a cascade of other problems which resulted in death. But to the mother her explanation is equally plausible. The villagers say that a tetanus baby, with his puckered face, clenched fists and flexed limbs, resembles a monkey, and that he became that way because, unknow\u00ad ingly, his father killed a monkey or his mother ate monkey meat during pregnanc y. Are they wrong? Demonstration of the tetanus bacillus in a cut umbilical cord does not explain how or why the germ got there in the first place, or why it should \"cause\" this sickness. In this context it can be difficult to convince pregnant women of the need for immunization against tetanus. Fears and dangers As in many societies relatively unex\u00ad posed to modem Western thought, epileptics are believed to be inhab\u00ad ited by the devil. According to this view, they are not evil people, but the devil, having wormed its way inside them, causes them to flail about from time to time. A grand mal seizure can be a frightening thing for anyone anywhere to witness, and neurolo\u00ad gists will admit that altered elec-World Health 49th Yeor, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 troencephalogram patterns are a result, not a cause, of the problem. Infertility is still disastrous for women in many parts of the world, including most African societies. A woman who fails to conceive is less likely than others to be able to settle into a successful marriage. Women who deliver children who all subse\u00ad quently die do not suffer a similar fate. Infertility, not childlessness, provokes the stigma. Conveniently, people accept that some women can conceive and remain pregnant with\u00ad out delivering for many years. Such women continue to menstruate regu\u00ad larly and do not alter their abdominal girth as they and their husbands wait patiently for the baby to grow and get ready to come out. The women explain that they can feel the child moving inside them and sense sin\u00ad cerely that aU is well, only slow. One night a young man who did not know I only practised \"Western\" medicine appeared at my door in a state of pain and agitation. He had just been bitten by a snake, which he had killed and wrapped in an old black plastic bag tied with grass. He unwrapped it for me and I recognized the deadly Echis carinatus. I told him that hospitalization and injec\u00ad tions of antivenin would be required. He told me that he was to be married one week from that night; the snakebite therefore could not have been an accident. Someone or some spirit had cursed him and only some\u00ad one who knew how to lift the curse could save him; aU the antivenin in the world would be of no avail. He left in search of a marabout (holy man), and did not come back. He died on what was to have been his wedding day, the curse evidently unlifted. Occasionally a snakebite victim dies in spite of what would ordinarily be considered adequate treatment. Other patients with other illnesses also occasionally die inex\u00ad plicably, in defiance of medical logic. Is it then surprising that peo\u00ad ple believe there are spirits to ap\u00ad pease, curses to counter, sacrifices to offer? In some societies it is thought that there is a sort of beetle, a fat brown bug with a slow clunky walk, that bites some breast-feeding women and causes mastitis, they say. Generally the women don't know they've been bitten until the pain starts in the breast. The same bug in the same way causes orchitis (in\u00ad flammation of the testicles) in men. And in children, it causes the swollen feet of kwashiorkor . I don't hold to the bug theory, but I have no better explanation for why some breast\u00ad feeding women get mastitis while others don't, or why only some men get orchitis or why only some mal\u00ad nourished children become so swollen. Must differing explanations impede health care? Parents who do not want their baby to suffer the disastrous consequences of drinking the milk of a pregnant mother are more likely to delay conceiving until the child in arms is weaned. A health worker would advise no differently. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine disgruntled spirits send\u00ad ing snakes to do their bidding, it is not so difficult to understand well\u00ad ness as a state of being in harmony with one's self, one's community and one's environment. Monkeys may not transmit tetanus by being eaten, but they are involved in the transmis\u00ad sion of yellow fever and other lethal 21 viruses, so that avoidance of unnec\u00ad essary interaction with them is prob\u00ad ably not a bad idea. To outsiders, the tangle of truths, half-truths, superstitions and un\u00ad knowns that make up any culture can be like a jungle. Effective health workers learn to tread gently, open\u00ad ing new paths through the jungle without trampling flowers or top\u00ad pling trees. Few of those, after all, are real obstacles, and experienced trekkers understand that as new saplings take root and new flowers bloom, there will be time enough to prune old branches . The essential task is to proceed with open eyes, unblinded by bias, and to be prepared to take the long way around, should some cultural barrier demand a detour. Or Ellen M.

Tabbane Culture affects not only the occurrence of depressive illness but also the manifestation of symptoms and the evolution of the disease. Yet the description of mental illnesses that figures in reference books is based mainly on observations of Western mental cases. E ach year, at least 100 million people around the world develop a depressive illness. This num\u00ad ber will in all probability increase as a result of lengthening life expectancy in most countries, and of the socioeconomic and cultural changes which expose more and more people to acute or prolonged psychosocial stress. It may also be, however, that the frequency of de\u00ad pression is increasing in the younger generations . Uprooting , the disinte\u00ad gration of the family, social isolation and other such phenomena can cause depressive reactions. The spread of certain somatic pathologies also increases the risk of depression, with greater consumption of alcohol and the abuse of a whole range of drugs which hasten the onset of depression or accentuate its intensity (see Depressive disorders in different cultures, by N.

The scale of the problem is cer\u00ad tainly of great public health impor\u00ad tance, especially since effective treatments exist. But patients who suffer from depression usually re\u00ad ceive no treatment, especially in the developing countries, and as a result are exposed to quite unnecessary suffering which in turn also affects the family and the community. Access to appropriate care for depressed patients is particularly limited by misconceptions about this disorder, which result in many diag\u00ad nostic and therapeutic errors. The cure. After she had had a long series of medical consultations with neurol\u00ad ogists, ophthalmologists, and ear, nose and throat specialists, a dentist blamed tooth decay. She had all her teeth extracted and replaced by a false set, but this did nothing to improve her headaches -on the contrary, they got worse. Wearily, the dentist sent her to a psychiatrist who diagnosed an underlying depres\u00ad sion. The diagnosis was confirmed by her total cure from all the symp\u00ad toms, including headaches , once antidepressive treatment was started. Do symptoms of depression differ across cultures? Back in 1904, the German psychia\u00ad trist Emil Kraepelin, who laid the foundations of modem psychiatry by defining the basic morbid symptoms in terms which remain essentially valid today, wrote after travelling to several countries: \"The descriptions of mental illness that figure in our classical reference books and manu\u00ad als are based on the observation of Western mental cases, but the symp\u00ad toms seen in other countries are often different\". It has been widely demonstrated since then that culture affects not only the incidence of depressive illness but also the manifestation of symptoms and the evolution of the disease. For example, in Western countries depression is verbalized in terms of mental suffering, sadness, despair or pessimism, whereas in African or Eastern societies moods often appear to be described in the language of physical symptoms, translating the suffering of the spirit into bodily terms. A wide range of ailments, such as headaches, stomach World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-Aprill996 upsets or back pain, as well as the fear of illness and death, will express the feeling of being unwell and wanting to die that is inherent in depression. Changing clinical profile Recent studies have shown evidence of a definite change in the clinical profile of depressive states. This is directly related to the profound social, economic and cultural changes that the developing coun\u00ad tries are undergoing. An epidemio\u00ad logical inquiry made among the general public in Tunisia in 1995 found, in a sample of 5000 persons, prevalen.ce rates of depression that were entirely comparable with those of the industrialized countries. It does seem as if \"Western-style\" depression is becoming common in parallel with socioeconomic devel\u00ad opment, urbanization and the conse\u00ad quent dislocation of traditional community structures. Yet although the environment colours the symptoms of depression, it never radically alters the basic structure or dynamics of this condi\u00ad tion. So alongside the manifesta\u00ad tions that are proper to a given culture, one finds certain common non-specific characteristics which seem to be universal: a fundamental change of mood, a diminution of interest and initiative, a lack of enjoyment of life, sleeping troubles, and loss of appetite or libido. Thus in a WHO study (1983), 76-100% of the patients in all four countries involved (Canada, Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Switzerland) showed a core of depressive symptoms comprising \"sadness, lack of joy, anxiety, tension, lack of energy, lack of interest, loss of concentration, and feelings of inadequacy, incapacity or loss of esteem\". Although prevalence rates may vary, it is incontestable that depres\u00ad sion appears everywhere in the world and that depressive patients constitute an important percentage\u00ad perhaps even a majority -of individ\u00ad uals requiring or requesting mental health treatment. A child in a Rio favela. The depression caused by poverty may lead the sufferer into drug abuse and criminality . 23 All the same, because psychic suffering is a subjective experience expressed in the individual's own language and personal history, cul\u00ad ture can affect the evolution and communication of depressive symp\u00ad toms. The risk of underestimating their importance or of making diag\u00ad nostic errors can be reduced by a better knowledge of cultural influ\u00ad ences. That knowledge is all the m0re important at a time of great cultural intermingling in all coun-tries, since it will help to highlight, over and above the differences , the shared characteristics that must be recognized if therapeutic knowledge is to make progress.

A recent WHO survey in general health care settings in 14 countrieso confirmed that depressive disorders were the most common mental disorder among primary care attenders. On average 1 0% of the primary care attenders had a \"current\" depression although rates varied depending on the health care setting. it was shown that all core symptoms of depression , as defined in the International Classification of Diseases, 1Oth revisionb, were observable in different cultures. There was little difference between the so-called \"bodily\" (physical) and \"emotional\" (psychological) expressions of depression across different cultures. The study showed that only half of these patients were recognized as cases and only a quarter of them were given treatment. This provides an intriguing insight into the dimensions of this major public health problem. Depression is highly prevalent. it is, however, often neither recognized nor treated, although effective treatment exists. a Mental illness in general health care. An international study, by T B.

Geneva, World Health Organization, 1992. 24 World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-April1996 Culture and preventive care at school: Geneva Philippe Granget The international nature of the city of Geneva means that almost 60% of a school's pupils may be non-Swiss. Health messages directed towards preventing risky lifestyles have to take into account wide variations in the children's cultural backgrounds. As a highly cosmopolitan re\u00ad gion, Geneva requires an intercultural approach in its health education programmes. Everyone, whatever their origin, cultural background or religion, should be able to understand and accept the health messages prepared for those living in the city and its surrounding areas. Besides general campaigns, more specific programmes are aimed at individual target groups, such as the school population. Primary prevention in Geneva schools Since the beginning of this century, the schools of Geneva have bene\u00ad fited from health education pro\u00ad grammes carried out by qualified staff. Their task is first and foremost to collaborate with teachers and other people specializing in youth matters to protect and promote the health of each individual as well as the general health of all pupils at\u00ad tending the city's schools. During their school years all Geneva schoolchildren receive, at different levels: classes on sex education, sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, diet, dental and physical hygiene, stress, sleep and so on; individual counselling during health visits and, if necessary , referral to medical practitioners or other specialized services; various health promotion activi\u00ad ties, in the context of \"the school in the community\". Health pro\u00ad motion here means improving the school environment and helping to create an atmosphere at the school that will help everyone to develop their potential. These three preventive approaches to health problems are interdependent and fall within the more general mandate of training and education that each school is expected to carry out. It can be argued that in Switzerland the major health prob\u00ad lems stem principally from unwise lifestyles. Preventive actions must therefore be aimed at reducing the risks, and the initial targets are the motivating factors that induce chil\u00ad dren to start taking risks or to put their health in danger. To determine those factors, we have to consider the degree to which children are integrated within the school and in their sociocultural background. In order to promote, protect and improve the health of a multicultural school population, the school itself must inculcate social behaviours that will permit each youngster to become a valued part of the school community , and to have enough confidence to take part in a training programme. These social behaviours will include first and foremost tolerance, but also appreci\u00ad ation of other people's lifestyles, acceptance of foreigners and respect for outlooks differing from one's own. Blowing up a condom. Haw la protect oneself from AIDS forms part of the health education routinely received by schoolchil dren in Geneva. World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 A friendly and welcoming atmosphere helps everyone to develop their potential and facilitates integration . Multicultural schools In some Geneva schools close to 60% of the pupils are non-Swiss, so encouraging good cultural cohabita\u00ad tion is a high priority. In such a context, health education must use a multicultural approach to convey the information that is needed to avoid risky behaviour or situations. Such an approach rests on the following three principles: It is essential to know the origin of the youngsters who are being addressed and to underline right away the differences between cultural concepts of health. From their own cultural back\u00ad ground, schoolchildren have acquired some degree of basic knowledge about the subjects to be dealt with. So the messages of prevention have to be based on those different levels of knowl\u00ad edge, and proceed by developing and modifying them as necessary. When talking to young people, you have to consider that one or more of them may actually be facing the problems being ex\u00ad plained, so sensitivity and tact are needed. First of all, the principal obstacles to health education stem from the The teacher or the health educator must take a multicultural approach that will respond adequately to the needs of all the pupils 25 inadequate integration of the young people being addressed. They must have sufficient knowledge of French. The city and its inhabitants should be perceived as a favourable environ\u00ad ment. The family has to have found its place in the local economic and social setting, and individuals must be able to express their original cultural identity. All this depends on the attitudes which native Swiss and immigrants adopt towards each other -since the local residents may also have difficulties with integration. Secondly, the cultural background itself can be an obstacle to the assim\u00ad ilation of preventive messages . In fact, the \"healthy\" behaviour that is recommended sometimes clashes with the teaching already received, and this can risk pushing young people into a conflict of loyalty with their families, thus destabilizing their quest for an identity. Health mes\u00ad sages can then prove to be counter\u00ad productive. One way of avoiding this type of pitfall is to encourage open discussion about the limits that culture or religion imposes on certain individual subjects, while at the same time explaining local sensitivities in this field. This briefly describes the frame\u00ad work within which preventive health education has evolved in Geneva's schools. The concept of prevention among the city's young people needs to be refined still further and much thought should be given to it. It should be remembered that the re\u00ad sults of the preventive programmes can only be verified in the long term. So prevention has to be worked out in stages, as a continuing process which can be adapted to changing cultural and other patterns among the different groups which are being addressed .

Among children and young adults, injuries are the number one cause of death, and a major cause of dis\u00ad ability and suffering. During this century struc\u00ad tural changes like urbaniza\u00ad tion, industrialization and increasing motor traffic have made injuries a major public health problem. participation by local organizations. It was able to show a 27-28% reduc\u00ad tion of injuries in the trans\u00ad port, home and industrial safety areas by 1981. In the areas without surveillance there was no decline. The ideas behind the programme , based on information, education, supervision and environ\u00ad mental control, were taken up by communities in several other countries, such as Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. At the same time, similar pro\u00ad grammes were being devel\u00ad oped in countries like Indonesia and Thailand. Injury control has pri\u00ad marily been tackled sector by sector: transport safety authorities have established their solutions , industrial safety theirs and so on. However, we still do not have control over safety. This was evident to WHO's How to protect children from burns. The municipality of Falkoping in Sweden started an iniury control programme that has since been adopted in many countries. The one in Thailand started with an initiative taken by the National Injury Prevention Programme at the beginning of the 1980s and has been fully stated in WHO's General Programme of Work for 1990-1995 and 1996-2001, as well as in the Manifesto for Safe Communities of 1989. The Manifesto was the result of work by 500 delegates from 50 countries during the First World Conference of Accident and Injury Prevention, held in Stockholm 1989 and sponsored by WHO. Much of the success of local safety work resulted from programmes pioneered in Norway, Sweden and Thailand, which were able to reduce the number of injuries by between 30% and 50%. As far as we know, the first programme of this kind was developed in the municipal\u00ad ity ofFalkoping, Sweden. Injury surveillance started there in 197 8 and the programme was based on inter\u00ad sectoral cooperation and voluntary Disillusionment and feelings of being a loser may lead to destructive behaviour, criminality, gang-building, violence and abuse.

Promoting healthy, non-violent communities in cities may be one of the most important contributions to the health of future generations. Board of Public Health which stimulated the Primary Health Care organization of each village to encourage popular participation in health and safety matters. Local village committees in some areas judged injuries to be the number one problem and ran safety promotion campaigns. In the village of Wang Khoi, the schools developed safety education , farmers tried to make two\u00ad wheeler tractors safer, and everyone took action to prevent poisoning by pesticides. 11Safe Community\" models Could such different cultural condi\u00ad tions as are found in the rural parts of Thailand and the wealthy areas of Scandinavia really be compared?

Farmers in Thailand are taking action to reduce the risk of insecticide poisoning. nar and found that the components were essentially the same. However, the structure and organization of different societies need to be taken into account when choosing strate\u00ad gies for introducing Safe Community models. Some societies favour a local model of decision-making and are easier to approach than others where formal action is limited by official approval. In the latter case it may be necessary to have national approval before action can be taken at the local level. \"Various models are proposed for the Safe Community rather than one model\", but all \"contain an element of community involvement and participation\" , Ms Irene Graham from the Safe Castelmilk programme in Glasgow, Scotland, told the Third International Safe Community Conference in Harstad, Norway. Professor Dinesh Mohan from the Indian Institute of Technology stresses that it is not possible simply to transfer Safe Community guide\u00ad lines from northern Europe to less industrialized countries, because of the different stages in technical development and democratization. A seminar hosted by the Navajo Nation in the USA in 1993 empha\u00ad sized that, just as the community is the owner of its problems, so the community should also be the owner of its development activities, like safety promotion. Experts can coor\u00ad dinate and support the programmes but the actual work and initiatives must come from the members- as is done in the Navajo Safe Community programme , whose success has underlined that safety promotion must take the specific cultural fea\u00ad tures into account. The Indian tribes, like indigenous groups in many other situations, were driven away from their country during the nineteenth century, and were thus threatened with the loss of their cultural structure, their lan\u00ad guage and their philosophy of life. During the seminar, questions such as the following were asked: \"What does lack of cultural respect and understanding mean to people? What happens to people when they become refugees in their own coun\u00ad try? What happens to parents when they find themselves unable to give their children good advice for the future? What happens to children when they realize that what they learn from their parents is of no help to them in school or daily life?\" A rude awakening? Losing one's cultural identity can be like opening the gate to destructive behaviour. We now see huge prob\u00ad lems of alcoholism, criminality, domestic violence and alcohol\u00ad related transport injuries among the population. Disillusionment and feelings of being losers may domi\u00ad nate, which may also lead to destruc\u00ad tive behaviour, criminality , gang-building, violence and abuse. If we do not understand and tackle this problem today, we will receive a rude awakening tomorrow. The challenge s faced by less industrialized countries in safety promotion differ from those of indus\u00ad trialized countries, but everywhere, health and safety beliefs are an inte\u00ad gral part of life, culture, history and religion. As a result, elements from all settings should be used for the further development of the Safe Community movement and of WHO's Safe Community programme. The programme in\u00ad volves more than 30 countries and has 14 official demonstration com\u00ad munities. It is coordinated by the WHO Collaborating Centre on Community Safety Promotion at the Karolinsk a Institute in Sweden. WHO-spon sored International Safe Community Conferences are orga\u00ad nized each year.

For all too many poor children, the only school is the street. The information and communica\u00ad tions revolution has catapulted health information into the headlines of newspapers, radio and television programmes around the world. Lemuel Shattuck, with the Boston census of 1845, was one of the first people to promote data gathering for the development of modern public health programmes , but it was not until the turn of the century that modern market research began, with an American breakfast food manufacturer who did postcard surveys on the readers of popular magazines. Since then, commercial interests have been at the forefront in exploiting the behavioural and com\u00ad munication sciences for promotion purposes -with numerous conse\u00ad quences, both beneficial and harm\u00ad ful, for public health. Positive and negative influences Traditionally, societies have ex\u00ad pressed and reinforced their health beliefs through their own modes of cultural and social expression, but now traditional beliefs and modern commercial messages increasingly coexist in the developing world. Public health authorities often be\u00ad moan the negative impact of both these influences on health. It is only in the past few decades that leaders in health have begun to understand and tap both sources of public infor\u00ad mation for health development. In the industrialized world, health care, nutrition and healthy lifestyles have been popularized in magazines and newspapers, although many of these countries still condone false images, for instance in advertisements associ\u00ad ating youth, fresh air and glamour with tobacco products. The influence of culture and the media on health beliefs is often just a by-product of changing fashions, quickly outmoded or invalidated by subsequent discoveries. Beliefs can also be affected more deliberately, however, for instance through the dissemination of the results of re\u00ad search, including stories by health Popular culture and the modern media can easily mislead people but they can also be used to lead them to better health for themselves and their children. and science writers in the popular media, or through the explicit efforts of local or national authorities to develop media campaigns and pro\u00ad grammes as an adjunct to a larger health promotion effort. Brazil, with its diversity of cul\u00ad tural and social backgrounds, and the coexistence of traditional and modern belief systems, faces a special challenge in conveying health concepts to the public. One of the most successful areas of positive influence has been the promotion of childhood immuniza\u00ad tion, which is now widely accepted by all segments of the population. Radio, newspapers and television have been particularly effective in making people aware of the need for preventing childhood diseases through immunization. On the other hand, breast-feeding serves as an example of both posi\u00ad tive and negative influences . Only 6% of Brazilian children are exclu\u00ad sively breast-fed after the first two months of life. Radio, TV, newspa\u00ad pers and popular magazines, with the support of local and national authorities , present essential infor\u00ad mation on breast-feeding and its advantages. But these media have also been known to present advertis\u00ad ing and images which associate World Health 49th Year, No. 2, Morch-Aprill996 beautiful and well-nourished infants with milk formula and baby foods. These images of \"ideal\" beautiful babies have a strong effect on mater\u00ad nal emotions. In a programme for \"newborn mothers\" in a large hospi\u00ad tal serving the poor in Rio de Janeiro, a young woman said, \"I don't believe this dirty water coming out of my breast is important for my son. This is not the real milk we could buy, so my baby will not get fat and beautiful like the ones they show on TV.\" She was referring to colostrum, so rich in substances that protect the newborn against many diseases early in life. Beliefs come from feelings as well as knowledge Feelings are difficult to modify, particularly when they are deeply rooted in cultural myths and beliefs. In many areas of Brazil women will not wash their hair in the first days after the birth of their child because they believe that if they do so they will go crazy. This is the popular explanation of postpartum psychosis or depression. In Zimbabwe there is a common belief that obstructed or prolonged labour is a sign of marital infidelity. Dr Jane Mutambwira trains traditional birth attendants to distinguish between the \"medical\" and \"cultural\" causes of obstructed labour-showing how the latter are very, very rare and the former should be promptly referred to hospital for care. Emotional needs, originating in a particular cultural context, may also create obstacles to the absorption and use of correct information. Many adolescent girls in some cultures become pregnant despite access to contraception. The wish -some\u00ad times unconscious- to get pregnant as a means of attaining the status of a woman, or to prove to themselves that they are fertile, is a powerful factor undermining the influence of correct and sensible information. Programmes that integrate scien\u00ad tific concepts and popular culture must take into account the subtle ways in which thinking and feeling are intimately combined, thus im\u00ad proving the likelihood of messages being absorbed and acted upon by the community. The work of Dr Galba Araujo in the poverty-stricken regions of north-east Brazil, illus\u00ad trates this principle. He noted that mothers brought their dehydrated children to the hospital only when they were almost dead, and only after first taking them to traditional heal\u00ad ers -women who knew special prayers for dealing with this condi\u00ad tion. By working with these women and convincing them to include oral rehydration therapy with their A school in Brasilio. Schoolchildren serve os promising pathways to convey health concepts to the general population. 29 The \"polio drop\". Thanks to public information drives, immunizaion is now accepted widely by the population. prayers, he enabled them to become more effective as community health agents, with far greater influence than the doctors in modifying the beliefs of the community. Dr Araujo had a similar impact on maternal and perinatal health when he encouraged the traditional birth attendants to attend deliveries in health centres and posts where more skilled support was available in case they ran into difficulties. Recognizing the physio\u00ad logical advantages, he also supported the birth attendants in their prefer\u00ad ence for the traditional manner of giving birth in a sitting or squatting position. These are just a few of the many examples that exist of how both traditional beliefs and the modem media can be used to promote good health. Or Moria Terezo Moldonodo is a psychologist and on author.

Farnsworth Collecting medicinal plants in a rain forest in Cameroon . Plants have always been a \"treasure house\" of potential new drugs; but emphasis has now turned to tropical rain\u00ad forest plants as opposed to the temperate zone plants which previously provided many of the major plant-derived drugs. More than 250 000 species of flowering plants exist on this planet. Of these, about 60% are found in tropical forests and most of the tropical forests of the world are found in developing countries. In recent years, scientists from acade\u00ad mic institutions and industrial firms have turned to certain plants from tropical rain forests as a source either of potential new drugs or of compounds from which less toxic or more efficacious drugs can be developed. Plants are selected for study on the basis either of their general scien-tific interest or of their long-standing use in traditional medicine. Among the most important drugs that have been derived from plants over the past half century are the following: ajmalicine, used for circulatory disorders, and reserpine, used for high blood pressure and as a tranquil\u00ad lizer, both derived from the Indian Snake Root atropine and and are commer\u00ad cially isolated from the Australian cork tree (though originally they were discovered in Atropa belladonna and Hyoseyanus niger ); emetine from Cephaelis ipecacuanha, which is useful as an amoebicide; pilocarpine from the South American rain forest plant Pilocarpus jaborandi, which is widely used for glaucoma; and the skeletal muscle relaxant tubocurarine from the tropical Chondodendron tomentosum. In more recent years, artemisinin from the weed Artemisia annua, was discovered in China to be an effec\u00ad tive agent to treat drug-resistant malaria, and is now used-along with several synthetic analogues to treat World Health 49th Year, No. 2, March-Aprill996 severe types of malaria. Also discov\u00ad ered in China is the alkaloid huperzine A, currently being studied in China and other countries for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Tripterygium wilfordii, the Chinese Thunder God Vine, is widely used in China as a standard\u00ad ized extract for the treatment of severe cases of arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. It is a power\u00ad ful suppressant of the immune sys\u00ad tem. Several novel active principles have been isolated from this plant, especially triptolide and tripdiolide. The extract as well as the pure com\u00ad pounds also reduce sperm counts in men. Plaunol, isolated from Croton sublyratus (Plau-noi) from Thailand, is being used as an anti-ulcer drug in Japan_ Prospects for new treatments Calanolide A, from the Malaysian tropical rain-forest tree Calophyllum lanigerum var. austrocoriaceum , is currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of AIDS in the United States. A well-known com\u00ad pound, betulinic acid, has recently been isolated from the Zimbabwean tree Ziziphus mauritiana , and has been found to have a selective action against melanoma cells in vitro, and to inhibit melanoma dramatically in laboratory animals. This substance is now being considered for preclinical studies that could lead to a new drug for the treatment of melanoma. Of importance also is a resur\u00ad gence in developing and developed countries in the production of stan\u00ad dardized crude extracts as drugs. These usually have known active principles that cannot be patented, so the enormous costs of gaining ap-World Health 49th angustifolia is reported to improve the immune system and lessen the symptoms of influenza. proval for the active principles as drugs cannot be recouped by the developer.

The leaves of Ginkgo biloba (maid\u00ad enhair tree) are widely employed throughout the world as a treatment for memory loss and ringing in the ears, and as a preventive agent for stroke. Numerous clinical studies have shown that extracts of Echinacea angustifolia can improve the immune system and can either prevent or make less severe the symptoms of influenza. Two other plants, Serenoa repens (sabal, sabadilla) fruits and Urtica dioica (nettle) roots, have been clinically investigated and are being used successfully to alleviate benign prostatic hyperplasia . There is increasing evidence from developed countries that tradi\u00ad tional medicines (complementary or alternative therapies), which have been used for centuries in developed and developing countries, have In the next issue The May:June issue of World Health is largely devoted to the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem. The key to elimina tion is multidrug therapy (MDT) This issue also foresees the final eradication of guinea-worm disease. Achieving these goals will mark two signal successes for WHO during its first half-century of existence. something positive to offer in the way of healing. In the United States, this area of medicine has been show n to be widely used by the public, and most physicians believe that many of these therapies are effective. The government has now set up an Office of Alternative Medicine within the National Institutes of Health to study this widening area of medical interest. Plants have always been a \"trea\u00ad sure house\" of potential new drugs; but emphasis has now turned to tropical rain-forest plants as opposed to the temperate zone plants which previously provided many of the major plant-derived drugs. Develop\u00ad ing country institutions and scientists are becoming more active in plant\u00ad derived drug development , and formal cooperative efforts between them and developed country scien\u00ad tists and institutions continue to grow.
