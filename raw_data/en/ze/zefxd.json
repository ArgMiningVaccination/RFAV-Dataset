'\u00b7\u00b7 UC IRVINE - 1999-2000INTRODUCTION THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA Richard C. Atkinson, President The University of California (UC) was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influenced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward eminence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. A tenth campus, UC Merced, is projected to open in 2005. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, a school of veterinary medi\u00ad cine, and professional schools of business administration, educa\u00ad tion, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The coll~ctions of the more than 100 UC libraries are surpassed in size on the American continent only by the Library ot Congress collection. The University is one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher education. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements and includes 20 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Sciences membership numbers 285, greater than any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricul\u00ad tural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 loca\u00ad tions throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban popu\u00ad lations, and a broad program of continuing education. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, the University operates the Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National Laboratories. Other major research facilities include the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory, Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of University Professors. This title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recognized internationally as scholars and teach\u00ad ers. A University Professor may visit several UC campuses during the academic year, holding conferences and presenting lectures. Governance. Under the State constitution, governance of the Uni\u00ad versity is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's advice, the officers of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by the Regents to the Academic Senate, which consists of faculty and certain administra\u00ad tive officers. The Academic Senate determines academic policy for the University as a whole, sets conditions for admission and the granting of degrees, authorizes and supervises courses and curric\u00ad ula, and advises the University administration on faculty appoint\u00ad ments, promotions, and budgets. Additionally, each campus has a divisional Academic Senate. The President is executive head of the total institution. Each cam\u00ad pus has a Chancellor as its chief administrative officer. Students participate in policy-making at both the campus and University\u00ad wide levels. The names of University Professors, Regents, Officers, and Chan\u00ad cellors are presented in the Appendix. THE IRVINE CAMPUS Ralph J. Cicerone, Chancellor The University of California, Irvine (UCI) opened in 1965 with 116 faculty and 1,589 students. Since then, UCI programs, faculty and graduates have achieved distinction in virtually every discipline. Two Nobel Prizes in 1995 for founding faculty F. Sherwood Row\u00ad land in Chemistry and the late Frederick Reines in Physics, helped to secure UCI's position among the leading American research uni\u00ad versities. More recently, UCI has been ranked prominently along with much older universities for excellence in the arts and humani\u00ad ties, earth system science, management, social sciences, technol\u00ad ogy, and information systems. For quality of educational experience and caliber of faculty, UCI consistently ranks among the nation's 10 best public universities, and among the top 50 universities overall. Election to the Ameri\u00ad can Association of Universities (AAU), a group of 60 of the most distinguished research institutions, is another indication of UCI's stature in the academic community. As a research university, UCI challenges students at every level, both academically and personally. While research is critical to graduate education, the research environment also opens up new educational experiences for undergraduates. Students have access to a faculty at the forefront of their fields, and they also have opportunities to participate directly in faculty research projects. In addition, to empower students for the future in an information\u00ad focused society, UCI has integrated computer technology through\u00ad out the curriculum and campus life. UCI is committed to the discovery and transmission of knowledge. It makes available to its 18,210 students (14,570 undergraduate, 2,540 graduate, and 1,100 health science students and medical resi\u00ad dents) the education, skills, and credentials which provide the basis for lifelong personal and professional opportunities. UCI's education and research missions are fulfilled in its academic units, which are described briefly below, and in its formal research units, which are described in the Research and Graduate Studies section. The School of the Arts teaches the creative as well as the acade\u00ad mic and critical dimensions of the arts. It is concerned with the vitality of the arts in society. Faculty energies are directed toward the refinement, enhancement, and encouragement of students' artis\u00ad tic and creative talents and toward the development of the stu\u00ad dents' understanding of related theory and history. The School offers programs which emphasize extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical background studies, and exercises in criticism. There are 950 students in the School, including 840 undergraduate and 110 graduate. The School of Biological Sciences is one of the campus' larger academic units, with 2,760 students (2,610 undergraduate and 150 graduate). Faculty research areas include neural plasticity and behavior (which in part encompasses the development of the ner\u00ad vous system, memory, response to injury, and degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's); the nature of cell-cell interactions; pattern formation; the elucidation of ecological conditions and evo\u00ad lutionary histories that have been the driving forces in organism design and functional diversity; the organization and expression of genes; biomolecular structure; molecular pathogenesis; and cell biology. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000FROM THE CHANCELLOR On behalf of the entire UCI community, I am delighted to welcome you to the Irvine campus. As you become more familiar with UCI, I think you'll begin to understand the pride we have in this university, which is now regarded as one of the top 10 public universities in the coun\u00ad try. In fact, many of our programs and faculty have achieved standing with the best private universities. To you as students, that means UCI can match the enthusiasm and expectations you bring to your education by introducing you to a new world of intellectual experience. We provide you with chances to question, discuss, disagree, and discover-unique opportunities that are bound to shape your future. Those opportunities, along with the people you will encounter at UCI, contribute to an atmosphere that is both challenging and supportive. You'lllearn alongside some of the brightest students on any university campus. UCI students compete successfully for the most coveted scholarships and postgraduate fellowships. Their competitive edge comes from being at a research university where, even as undergraduates, students may participate in the intense creativity of the research process. The UCI faculty who will be your teachers and mentors are some of the nation's foremost scholars, respected for their ability to engage students in the excitement of learning, as well as for their research. Among the faculty who helped to build this campus are two Nobel Laureates, F. Sherwood Rowland in Chemistry and the late Frederick Reines in Physics. Many UCI faculty are also members of the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and other distinguished professional organizations. As UCI's reputation for excellence in the sciences and medicine has grown over the years, so has our strength in virtually every other discipline, from the arts, humanities, and social sciences, to technology and management. But increasingly, society and the workplace demand knowledge that crosses traditional boundaries. So we have developed innovative\u00ad often one-of-a-kind-programs that combine studies such as art and technology, medicine and business, ecology and the social sciences. In addition, our campus is noted for using information technology to its best advantage, preparing students for the roles they must fill in the new century. UCI has flourished within the Orange County community, which is one of the fastest growing in the country, both economically and in its wide spectrum of cultural and intellectual offer\u00ad ings. The University's partnerships with the community create outstanding opportunities for students. They include work experience in a dynamic international marketplace, learning as you serve the community through the campus' outreach and public service groups, or simply benefiting from the advice of UCI alumni and leaders from every facet of society. Where activities outside the classroom are concerned, one of my goals is to work with students to steadily improve upon the already good quality of life at UCI. A new fully equipped student recreation facility will open in 1999. And we are constantly augmenting the many cultural and athletic events available to students. Whether you are a graduate or undergraduate student, UCI is the ideal place to pursue the course you have in mind for your future, or to change that course should you decide to explore other avenues for achieving your individual goals. We welcome the unique talents and experience that each of you will bring to our campus, and I look forward to sharing the next few years in your lifetime pursuit of learning. Sincerely, Ralph J. Cicerone Chancellor 5 UC IRVINE - 1999-20006 UCI 1999-2000 Introduction The Department of Education, with 160 postbaccalaureate stu\u00ad dents, offers an Ed.D. in Educational Administration, credential programs for current and prospective teachers and administrators in California's public elementary and secondary schools, and a minor in Educational Studies.

The School of Physical Sciences has a student body of 1,120 (850 undergraduate and 270 graduate). Researchers in the School are conducting investigations in atmospheric chemistry (including the discovery of the adverse impact of human-made chlorofluorocar\u00ad bon compounds on the earth's ozone layer), biogeochemistry and climate, synthetic chemistry, laser spectroscopy, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, plasma physics, and pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. The School of Social Ecology, a multidisciplinary unit established in 1970, is unique to UCI. The School's central objectives are the application of scientific methods to the analysis and resolution of societal problems and the development of theory and knowledge pertinent to environmental and social phenomena. Among issues of long-standing interest are crime and justice in society, social influ\u00ad ences on human development over the life cycle, and the effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. There are 1,650 students in the School, including 1,490 undergraduate and 160 graduate. The School of Social Sciences, with 3,860 students (3,640 under\u00ad graduate and 220 graduate), is one of the larger academic units at UCI. The faculty, several of whom are nationally recognized, has expertise in a wide range of specific social science topics, for example, the mathematical modeling of perception and cognitive processes; the economic analysis of transportation; the examination of the impact of society's political system on its economy; the study of social structure and values in different cultures through a formal-scientific methodology; and the exploration of authority structures and inequality in society. The UCI College of Medicine has 1,100 students (380 medical, 620 resident-physicians and fellows, and 100 graduate). It offers one of the country's largest residency training opportunities in pri\u00ad mary care and internal medicine and houses some of the most advanced equipment in medical imaging and laser medicine avail\u00ad able in the world. The College's faculty conduct innovative research in the following areas of emphasis: bioethics, biomolecu\u00ad lar structure, oncology, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, geriatric medicine, immunology, molecular and human genetics, the neurosciences, and perinatology. Academic Goals UCI offers programs designed to provide students with a founda\u00ad tion on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. Programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should pro\u00ad vide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and lifelong learning. An important aspect of UCI's educational approach is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Indepen\u00ad dent research in laboratories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in arts productions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments, special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. UCI provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholar\u00ad ship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of humanity, and to the development of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, UCI has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic understanding of the problems of society. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Academic Structure UCI's instruction and research programs focus on fundamental areas of knowledge, and at the same time provide for interdiscipli\u00ad nary and professional study through the School of the Arts, School of Biological Sciences, Department of Education, School of Engi\u00ad neering, School of Humanities, Department of Information and Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Programs, Graduate School of Management, School of Physical Sciences, School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy, School of Social Sciences, and the College of Medicine. The Office of Academic Affairs has responsibility for all programs of instruction and research. It, as well as the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and the Division of Undergraduate Educa\u00ad tion, report directly to the Executive Vice Chancellor. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Acade\u00ad mic Senate. The mission of the Division of Student Services may be expressed in terms of its three major goals: (1) to support campus efforts to recruit, enroll, educate, and retain to graduation an outstanding stu\u00ad dent body; (2) to support the academic success and personal development of students with emphasis on ethical development, understanding and appreciation of diversity, leadership skill devel\u00ad opment, and community service; and (3) to provide programs and services which are expected of a major university. In addition to \u00b7 essential needs such as housing, health services, financial aid, admissions, registration, career planning, and child care, Student Services offers programs that place special emphasis on encourag\u00ad ing students to participate fully in their University experience. The Division of Undergraduate Education provides leadership in developing policies and programs for the improvement of under\u00ad graduate education in such areas as general education, retention, advising, curricular development, undergraduate scholarship and research activities, international education, assessment, improve\u00ad ment of instruction, and improvement of instructional space. Undergraduate Education also administers programs and services affecting undergraduate education which require campus-level attention and coordination and which do not come under the direct authority of the heads of academic units or the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has general administrative responsibility for graduate education and research. In the area of research, the Vice Chancellor is responsible for research policy development, implementation, and oversight. In graduate education, the Dean of Graduate Studies serves as the aca\u00ad demic dean for all graduate students and is responsible for admis\u00ad sions, graduate student services, graduate student support, and the Graduate Diversity Program.

OFFICE OF THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN The University Ombudsman is available to assist students, faculty, staff, and visitors with problems they may encounter while on the UCI campus. The University Ombudsman responds to individual grievances or group petitions by hearing complaints; clarifying issues; making appropriate on-and off-campus referrals; and pro\u00ad viding a confidential, impartial, and informal setting for conflict negotiation. The Office also sponsors the Campus Mediation Pro\u00ad gram in which trained volunteer mediators provide free, confiden\u00ad tial mediation services for the campus community. The Office is located in 255 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-7256. The Campus Setting UCI's\u00b7location combines the cultural and economic resources of an urban area with access to Southern California's spectrum of recreational, scenic, and entertainment venues. Fifty miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,489 acres of coastal foothills, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and the dynamic international business environment of Orange County and the sur\u00ad rounding region. The famed sailing and surfing beaches of Newport, Laguna, and Huntington are a 10-minute bike ride from campus, while hiking trails, desert camping, or mountain resorts for snow boarding and skiing are within two-hour's travel distance from Irvine. The cam\u00ad pus itself is a natural arboretum of native species, as well as trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adjacent to the campus, the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh serves as a natural classroom or peaceful refuge, with trails for viewing the rich diversity of wildlife. A full roster of intramural sports and recreation events helps to fill the daily fitness needs of students, along with UCI's new Student Recreation Center which is under construction. This 92,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility, slated to open in 1999, will include a pool, gymnasiums, racquetball courts, weight room, and jogging track. UCI is also an NCAA Division I campus that competes in men's and women's intercollegiate athletics. Across Campus Drive, and linked by a pedestrian bridge, an area of shops and restaurants also features a comedy nightclub, post office, and theatre. Complementing UCI cultural events throughout the academic year is the vigorous Orange County arts and enter\u00ad tainment environment. It offers everything from small venues for bands and performers to galleries, museums, the Irvine Barclay Theater, Orange County Performing Arts Center, and Pacific Sym\u00ad phony. And within a one-to two-hour drive are the metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego. With plenty of land for growth, UCI is building to accommodate greater numbers of students, as well as to provide the most updated classroom and laboratory space. Projects planned or under way include a new music building, multimedia center and arts complex renovation, a natural science building, and earth system science research facility. On the west campus, the 180-acre University Research Park is attracting private companies like America Online and Canon Information Systems, that agree to collaborate with UCI faculty and students on internships, research, and other programs. Due to the high caliber of UCI faculty and scholarship, the campus is home to national organizations including the National Fuel Cell Research Center and the Western Center of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a major site for the nationwide cancer genetics research network. For its range of services and research, UCI's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center is the county's only cancer facility designated \"comprehensive\" by the National Cancer Institute. UCI is noted in fact for its strengths in cancer and neuroscience research, much of which takes place at UCI Medical Center. Located in the City of Orange, 13 miles to the north, the Medical Center is the primary teaching and research hospital for the UCI College of Medicine. Bus transportation makes travel convenient between the campus, UCI Medical Center and major housing areas, shopping centers, and recreation locales. In addition, the campus and surrounding communities are designed for bicycle traffic with trails connecting UCI with student housing and the coast. CELEBRATE UCI On Saturday, April 15, 2000, UCI will host its annual open house -Celebrate UCI. Among the day's events are the Wayzgoose Medieval Fair, housing and campus tours, and lectures and presen\u00ad tations, including information about admissions, academic pro\u00ad grams, and financial aid.

Munoff, University Librarian Established in 1963, the UCI Libraries serve the information needs of students, faculty, staff, and community members at three major library facilities, the Main and Science Libraries on the Irvine cam\u00ad pus and the Medical Center Library in Orange. The print collec\u00ad tion, carefully selected and developed in conjunction with the cam\u00ad pus academic plan, is augmented by access to a growing number of electronic resources, including resources that are part of the rapidly expanding California Digital Library, the collections of the Univer\u00ad sity of California library system, and several systemwide coopera\u00ad tive acquisitions programs. The UCI Libraries have more than two million volumes and approximately 19,000 active serial subscriptions that are available for study, teaching, and research. With the exception of certain materials, all books and periodicals are on open shelves and easily accessible to users. In addition, campus users may request library materials, including periodical articles, from libraries around the world. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Technology has dramatically changed the way a research library acquires, processes, and makes available information. Modem methods for increasing the speed and efficiency of library services are in evidence throughout the UCI Libraries. The Libraries sub\u00ad scribe to a computer-based cataloging service that facilitates the rapid availability of materials. UCI has its own local computerized system, ANTPAC (the Anteaters Public Access Catalog), that pro\u00ad vides information about books, periodicals, and other materials at UCI, including whether an item is checked out, on-order, or in\u00ad process. The Libraries also provide access to a growing number of licensed CD-ROM and Web-based bibliographic, abstracting, and full-text resources, including dictionaries, encyclopedias, electronic journals and books, and other useful subject resources. In addition, the MELVYL Catalog, available via the California Digital Library and the UCI Libraries Web site, connects users at UCI with the vast resources of the nine-campus University of California library system. Information about the Libraries may also be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.lib.uci.edu. The UCI Libraries conduct an active instruction program to help\u00ad users become familiar with rapidly expanding information resources and technologies. The program includes a formal course in library research techniques (Humanities 75, Library Research Methods), course-related and course and program-integrated instruction, instruction in the use of various computerized systems, and e-mail and Internet access training, as well as general orienta\u00ad tions to the libraries.

IRVINE ECOLOGICAL PRESERVE The 102-acre Irvine Ecological Preserve consists of several small hills and surrounding flatlands bearing remnants of coastal sage scrub flora and associated fauna. The Preserve is located on the campus and is set aside for use by the campus community. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; telephone (949) 824-6006. NATURAL RESERVES SYSTEM The University of California manages and maintains a system of 27 land and water reserves that are representative of the State's habitat and geographic diversity. These serve as outdoor laborato\u00ad ries for students, faculty, and staff, and are intended primarily for purposes of education and research. The reserves are administered by local campus management committees who control their uses. UCI is responsible for two reserves: the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve and the Bums Pinon Ridge Reserve. Additional information is available from the manager; telephone (949) 824-6031. San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve The San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, one of the last remaining freshwater marshes of Southern California, is a 202-acre reserve adjacent to the UCI campus. The Marsh consists of a series of freshwater ponds and their attendant aquatic flora and fauna, and is especially known for its rich bird life, both resident and migratory. Researchers and observers have recorded more than 200 species of birds in the Reserve, a major stopping point on the Pacific Flyway. Periodic tours are conducted. Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve The Bums Pinon Ridge Reserve is located near the town of Yucca Valley in San Bernardino County. It is a 265-acre parcel of high\u00ad desert habitat representing an ecotone between montane and desert biota, with mixtures of Joshua tree, pinon pine, and juniper wood\u00ad land. The Reserve has primitive camping facilities and is used pri\u00ad marily for overnight field trips and research by faculty and stu\u00ad dents from the School of Biological Sciences. UCI ARBORETUM The UCI Arboretum is a botanical garden developed and managed by the School of Biological Sciences. It contains areas planted with floras adapted to climates similar to those of Southern California. The Arboretum maintains a gene bank devoted to the conservation of African monocot floras and contains several important collec\u00ad tions of rare plants. Certain research and instructional materials are grown. The Arboretum collections are also used as an educational resource for the community at large. Volunteers and other inter\u00ad ested parties are encouraged to participate in Arboretum activities. Additional information is available from the Arboretum Office; telephone (949) 824-5833. LASER MICROBEAM AND MEDICAL PROGRAM The Laser Microbeam and Medical Program (LAMMP) was estab\u00ad lished at UCI in 1979 as a national user facility providing a unique set of laser microbeam biotechnologies to individual researchers. LAMMP functions as a research, training, and service facility, and provides interaction between the laser industry and the academic biomedical optics community. LAMMP provides laser microbeam technologies for optical manipulation and functional imaging of living cells, and for developing noninvasive systems for monitoring and imaging physiology in living tissue. The program is conducted in the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic and is funded through the Biotechnology Resources Program of the National Institutes of Health. Additional information is available from the LAMMP coordinator at (949) 824-3664 and on the World Wide Web at http://www.bli.uci.edu/lammpllammp.html. THESAURUS LINGUAE GRAECAE Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) began in 1972. Its goals are to create the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, a comprehensive digital library of Greek litera\u00ad ture; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply technological innovation in these endeavors. TLG research activi\u00ad ties combine the traditional concerns and methodologies of philo\u00ad logical and literary study with the most advanced features of com\u00ad puter technology. Included among current research foci are the identification of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials from various literary-historical periods; the conversion of these materials into machine-readable form; the enhancement of auto\u00ad mated text-verification routines; and the examination of criteria for the lexical analysis and categorization of the texts in the data bank. TLG staff have also established procedures to facilitate nationwide UC IRVINE - 1999-2000access to data-bank resources at UCI. The data bank currently con\u00ad tains some 75 million words of Greek text and essentially all ancient Greek literary texts from Homer to A.D. 1453. Data entry contin\u00ad ues with the aim of including later periods of Greek literature. Close ties with the Department of Classics are evidenced by faculty participation in TLG research and TLG support of graduate stu\u00ad dents. The jointly sponsored TLG/Classics Research Laboratory offers faculty, graduate students, and advanced undergraduate stu\u00ad dents access to a wide variety of the latest hardware and software resources. In addition, TLG's library holdings enhance those of the University Library, and TLG-related conferences and scholarly vis\u00ad its afford faculty and students contact with eminent classicists. The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae has made UCI a major source of Clas\u00ad sics research activity. UCI MEDICAL CENTER UCI Medical Center, the only university hospital in Orange County, offers a full scope of acute-and general-care services including a comprehensive neuropsychiatric center, a regional bum center, and one of only 14 National Institute on Child Health and Human Development-designated mental retardation research cen\u00ad ters in the nation.

UC IRVINE - 1999-200012 UCI 1999-2000 Distinguished Faculty UCI ACADEMIC SENATE DISTINGUISHED FACULTY WARREN L. BOSTICK Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. Distinguished University Service Award, 1998 Professor Emeritus of Pathology My award in the broad area of distinguished service covers quite a span of activities over my many years at the University of California that include research, leadership, professional service, and citations for outstanding teaching. However, at this particular time the award had to be focused primarily on my love affair and interest and activities ih the democratic parliamentary process, organizations, and group leadership. I believe that component of my involvement may be of considerable interest to the type of student who might be UCI-bound. Our campus and faculty have an abiding interest in nurturing an atmosphere of responsible shared and self-governance, political representation, due process, and rules of order. The academic community at UCI is especially cordial for students who believe that united group activities through democratic means is a part of the learning process and will prepare them for more effective future responsibilities in our society. UCI is attractive to the young mind because of the governance activities of the campus' stu\u00ad dent organization, the Associated Students of UCI (ASUCI). It functions independently but in parallel with the faculty Academic Senate. The Senate invites the student body's nominations of student representatives as members of Senate committees, and the ASUCI president attends Senate meetings. The agenda of the Senate has a standing place for the ASUCI president to address that faculty body and to pre\u00ad sent student petitions. By those processes, students and professors come to understand each other's opinions and needs which mold them together as a part of the total family of this world-class university. Students choosing to come to UCI will find it very special indeed. Those who think they might wish to embrace the exhilaration of a role in the political representative processes should come prepared with backgrounds of such high school courses as drama, public speaking, logic, debate, and constitutional history. As a rapidly growing, youthful, and beautiful campus with boundless opportunities for stu\u00ad dents to develop ability in the democratic process, together with its enormous scholarly resources, UCI provides an outstanding university experience. Give it a try. PANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Research, 1998-99 Assistant Professor of Mathematics I cannot remember, ever, desiring to be anything but a mathematician. My first exposure to real mathematics happened when I was introduced to the two famous ancient Greek theo\u00ad rems: Euclid's theorem for the existence of an infinite number of prime numbers and Pythagoras' theorem on the \"irrationality\" of the square root of 2. Both exemplify the sim\u00ad ple complexity and abstract beauty of pure mathematics. Each is as fresh and relevant today as it was when first discovered, more than 2,000 years ago. The public doesn't need to be convinced that there is something important in mathematics. One knows that Newton developed calculus to explain the movement and interaction of heavenly bodies and that the computer revolution owes its birth to mathematics. From bridge building to chaos, from navigation to astronomy, from the theory of relativity to Wall Street, mathematics is the basis for formulating and understanding their principles. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I find mathematics continuously fascinating and challenging without end, because it com\u00ad bines logic and intuition, generality and individuality, analysis and construction. The discov\u00ad ery of new proofs is for me invigorating and most intriguing. My own field of research is classical mathematical analysis which is considered to be pure mathematics. I am concerned with the study of the structure and new features of various models of nonlinear partial differ\u00ad ential equations, in connection with more complex problems of differential geometry and their physical applications. My work is rather abstract. Yet, I get a great thrill in proving a new theorem and quite a satisfaction to see its application to areas such as population dynam\u00ad ics, diffusion through biological membranes, and possibly the spread of malignant cells. Teaching is a wonderful means for expressing my passion for mathematics. I strive to expose my students to the beauty of mathematical reasoning, and it is truly satisfying and fulfilling to see them smile when they finally understand a difficult abstract concept. I want my students to learn and use the mathematics I teach them. But my most important goal is to teach them to think independently and develop their own original ideas in their profes\u00ad sion and everyday life. I find UCI students very bright, knowledgeable, and eager to learn. It is very gratifying to see our freshmen grow and become well-educated people, equipped to handle the challenges they will meet as professionals and members of our society. Being in an excellent mathematics department and having the chance to interact with accomplished scientists in other fields, makes my research and teaching an even more stimulating and rewarding endeavor. As a mathematician and professor I strive to add new knowledge to my profession and I hope that my research has a value which differs only in degree, but not in kind, from the creations of the great scientists and artists who have contributed to the welfare of our society. KRISTEN M. DAY Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Teaching, 1998-99 Assistant Professor of Social Ecology My research and teaching in environment-design research examine how people shape and are shaped by the places we inhabit. I was first attracted to this field because of its potential to enhance people's well-being by improving the design and management of homes, work places, schools, parks, and even cities. Students intuitively appreciate how the physical environment may help reduce fear of crime, enhance job performance, and so on. Thus, my ambition as a teacher is to expand students' interest while providing the conceptual frameworks and research skills to investi\u00ad gate these complex interrelationships. I try to teach students to understand issues from a \"social ecological\" perspective, by considering problems at multiple levels-individual, organizational, community, societal-and through multiple disciplinary lenses. For example, during a class on aging and environments, I share with students my own research on design\u00ad ing environments for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In discussing how nursing home design impacts people with dementia, I am able to illustrate how the experience of the environment is also shaped by the family unit, by regulatory codes, and by cultural norms. This approach helps students to see that design is important, but it does not act in isolation. \u00b7 Environment-design research is a profession that few students will practice full time, yet its findings are relevant to most fields. I try to convince students to consider the role of the physical environment in a wide range of issues, by connecting class discussions and read\u00ad ings to the \"real world.\" For example, a class on crime prevention and design may feature a guest lecture by a former police officer, now a national expert in \"defensible space.\" Or I may include an article from the Wall Street Journal on skylights and consumer shopping, for a discussion on the relationship between light and mood. I look for opportunities for students to examine firsthand the issues raised in class. Thus, classes have included trips to downtown Los Angeles, Leisure World, and Habitat for Humanity homes. I also try to plan assignments in which students apply what they are learning to problems in local communities. Distinguished Faculty 13 UC IRVINE - 1999-200014 UCI 1999-2000 Distinguished Faculty My students may find themselves researching and designing parks, or developing design guidelines for downtown historic districts. Such projects bring out the best in students, who are motivated by the opportunity to exercise what they are learning. The students' enthusiasm, commitment, and creativity have won new friends for the School of Social Ecology and for UCI. Class exercises also generate opportunities for new research. It is these experiences that make teaching such a joy. WALTER M. FITCH Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award for Research, 1998-99 Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology I was fortunate that my parents encouraged greatly my sense of awe and curiosity about the world around me. I was even more fortunate to have gone to college and into academic life for they have permitted me to continue being inspired by Nature and to work (or is it play?) at uncovering more of Nature's secrets. I am particularly enthralled about discovering how everything came to be the way it is, and how powerful is the recognition that the laws of Nature do not change. It is this recognition which allows us to demand reproducibility of one's experiments. My present work is discovering the history of the human influenza virus. This has entailed several discoveries. The first was that the virus was evolving a million times faster than mammals evolve and the second was that the virus' genealogy is strange, having only a single main branch with all the other lineages dying out in a few years. Why should that be? It appears that the virus is trying to beat the human immune system. When the virus infects us, we make antibodies to fight the virus. But that depends upon the antibody's recognizing the virus and killing it. But if the virus gets a face-lift, a mutation that changes the way it looks, the old antibody doesn't recognize the newly transformed virus. We have lately discovered a dozen and a half positions in the structure of the influenza virus that are being pushed to change much more than the others. We believe that these are positions that provide the face-lifts that enable the virus to escape (temporarily) the immune system's antibodies. Moreover, by examining new mutant strains for changes in these posi\u00ad tions, we have been able to predict which strains were the more likely sources for future epidemics. This is exciting in the first instance because evolutionists study largely the past. No one has ever been able to pick the winners in an evolutionary race before. It is exciting in the second place because it may lead to more effective influenza vaccines. Places like the University of California, Irvine, which encourage such intellectual pursuits, are excellent places for such scientific accomplishments. There is reciprocal exchange of the joy of such discoveries among professors and students alike, to the great enrichment of us all. ALBERTO MANETTA Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award for Teaching, 1998-99 Senior Associate Dean of the College of Medicine and Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology As Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, I teach medical students, residents, and fellows. My research is focused on gynecologic cancer, currently on early diagnosis and prevention of cervical cancer. Research stimulates awareness of the range of possibilities for treatment and prevention of malignancies. My talks with medical students always include an angle on prevention. I emphasize in my teaching that I expect our students to modify the environ\u00ad ment for the betterment of society, rather than passively adapt to it. I have had the pleasure of working with both undergraduate and medical students in my research. I find it a joy and a privilege to shepherd students from hard-core basic research to clinical research and finally to the art and practice of medicine. As Senior Associate Dean for Educational Affairs, I have devoted my energy to develop\u00ad ment of the educational program for medical students. Medical education must take place UC IRVINE - 1999-2000within the dynamic context of the health care delivery system and new technology. We built a new Student Training Center and have implemented several new curricular initia\u00ad tives to keep pace with these changes. In the Training Center we teach and assess clinical skills in an environment that simulates an actual ambulatory clinical setting. The use of standardized patients (trained actors) allows students to gain hands-on experience in a controlled setting with taking histories, conducting physical examinations, and developing treatment plans. Standardized patients are also used in structured examinations to assess clinical competence. The Patient-Doctor courses emphasize the interpersonal skills needed to develop an effective patient/doctor relationship. Medical economics courses and a new combined M.D./M.B.A. program prepare our students to be cost-effective practitioners and leaders of their destiny within the economic realities of medical practice today. Our med\u00ad ical informatics curriculum provides students with the skills they will need to become life\u00ad long learners and to practice evidence-based medicine. I believe the process in education is as important as the content. We are reducing lecture hours in favor of problem-based learning, small group discussions, independent study, and computer simulations. Seeing our educational program move up through the ranks and receive recognition as one of the leading medical education programs in the country gives me a great deal of satis\u00ad faction. This progress has been well-documented through external measures such as our students' performance on the United States Medical Licensure Examinations and accep\u00ad tance into top residency programs throughout the country. The development of new meth\u00ad ods for the training and assessment of medical students has been an integral part of this process. I believe that the UCI College of Medicine provides the most up-to-date and sen\u00ad sible education matching the needs of patients and physicians for the twenty-first century. We also meet an important obligation to provide physicians for the State of California. Seventy-eight percent of our students remain in California-one-third in Orange County. I have always considered it a privilege to have the opportunity to work in an intellectually stimulating environment such as UCI that allows me to pursue my teaching, research, and patient care in an atmosphere of mutual benefit to myself, the institution, and the community. WILLIAM M. MAURER Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Research, 1998-99 Assistant Professor of Anthropology Ruth Benedict, one of the founding figures in American anthropology, remarked in 1934 that the West's blindness to the cultural embeddedness of its own sciences would hinder its understanding of social and cultural diversity, and lead scholars to make unfounded grand claims about the big questions of human existence. \"When a student has assembled the vast data for a study of international credits, or of the process of learning, or of narcis\u00ad sism as\u00b7 a factor in psycho-neuroses,\" she wrote, \"it is through and in this body of data that the economist or psychologist or the psychiatrist operates. He does not reckon with the fact of other social arrangements where all the factors, it may be, are differently arranged .... He identifies the local attitudes of the 1930s with Human Nature, the descrip\u00ad tion of them with Economics or Psychology.\" My research uses anthropology to question deeply held beliefs about the nature of law and economic processes, and I have found UCI to be an environment where a diversity of methodological and theoretical perspectives helps point up the limits of any one discipli\u00ad nary approach. My field research in the British Virgin Islands sought to explain why the place attracts so many Caribbean migrants. One reason is the fact that the territory is an offshore financial services center, or tax haven, and has been experiencing an economic boom since the late 1980s. While citizens benefit from good jobs in banks, immigrants come to take on work in the construction and service sector. I became interested in the cultural ramifications of offshore finance, and this has led me to my current research pro\u00ad ject. In this work, I have been bringing anthropological analyses of cultural forms to bear on the world of finance-an area often assumed to be bereft of cultural content. I am interested in the impact of financial globalization on places like the British Virgin Islands Distinguished Faculty 15 UC IRVINE - 1999-200016 UCI 1999-2000 Distinguished Faculty which are so intimately caught up in it. I have been looking at the way Caribbean tax havens market themselves to international investors-\"wizarding up\" images more reminis\u00ad cent of the British Empire than they are of Club Med-and asking questions about how those images redound into people's self-perceptions. Currently, I am looking at alternatives to financial globalization put forth in various quar\u00ad ters. These alternatives seek to rewrite the cultural scripts of finance from the ground up. These include alternative currency movements in the U.S., digital cash ore-cash efforts of banking and computer companies, and Islamic banking in Southeast Asia. I am interested in what happens when people seek to redefine (or undermine) some of the taken-for-granted cultural terms of finance-terms like \"money,\" \"property,\" \"capital,\" \"interest,\" and so forth-that are our \"native\" categories and that we rarely subject to cultural analysis. Like Benedict, I use my teaching and research to encourage anthropologists and others to give more serious consideration than they have to the cultural forms of the West as these forms spread around the world and are taken up, resisted, or possibly transcended. The ulti\u00ad mate goal of my research is to demonstrate that law and economics are above all cultural domains that encode whole cosmologies, and that shape and structure the worlds we inhabit and transform. KEITH A. WOERPEL Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Teaching, 1998-99 Assistant Professor of Chemistry It is ironic that I became a professor of organic chemistry. As a student intending to go to medical school, I entered the dreaded \"orgo\" lecture hall with the same trepidation as other premeds. My worst fears of organic chemistry soon came true. No matter how hard I studied, I could not keep \"substitution\" and \"elimination\" reac\u00ad tions separate in my mind. I had no idea how the bromination of alkenes worked. All those reactions and all that memorization was too much for me! The professor kept saying the course was not about memorization, but rather it was about understanding underlying prin\u00ad ciples and recognizing patterns of reactivity. All I could see were unrelated facts. I braced myself for the worst, and it came: I bungled the first exam that fall. It was going to be a long year. I decided that I had to focus on the logic of chemistry, not the facts, if I were to survive. It would be impossible to keep memorizing more and more and more reactions. That deci~ sion proved to be a turning point not only in that class, but also in my life. As I concen\u00ad trated harder on the concepts and used the problems in the back of the chapters to reinforce those concepts, I found that I did not need to memorize reactions if I could see the patterns and logic of chemical reactivity. The fundamental concepts in each chapter repeated them\u00ad selves over and over in various incarnations, yet they remained the same concepts. The material did not become easy, but the challenge became enjoyable, and every day I under\u00ad stood the material a little better. My grades slowly but steadily improved as I made con~ nections between the underlying principles and integrated new principles with older, more familiar ones. I believe that my struggle with organic chemistry is the primary reason I became a teacher. Organic chemistry did not come naturally to me; I worked at it. I learned to love this chal\u00ad lenge the way I had loved other challenges in my life, such as bicycling just a bit faster or learning to play a particularly complex piece of music. As a teacher, I see how intimidating the weighty organic chemistry textbook can be. My challenge now is to help students at UCI navigate their way through this material. I also hope to show them that they can learn to love the challenge. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000PREADMISSION MATTERS OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS The mission of the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, a division of Student Services, is to: (1) optimize UCI's undergraduate enrollments by implementing Academic Senate, uni\u00ad versitywide, and campus policies for the selection and admission of new freshman and transfer students; and (2) stimulate and advance cooperative educational relationships between UCI and California schools and colleges.

Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate or professional courses. Lower divi\u00ad sion usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, upper division to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing is not a prerequisite and when any other prerequisites have been met. A course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) nor\u00ad mally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a number usually designates a laboratory course. The letter H preceding a number designates an honors course. The (4) or (4-4-4) designation following the course title indicates the quarter unit credits toward graduation. Some courses give other than four units of credit; for example, two, five, or a range from one to 12. The notations F, W, S, or Summer after the course number and title indicate when the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring quarter, or summer session. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses at the end of the description. However, courses which have been approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement are not designated in this Catalogue. Rather, they are designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes with a W following the number. Students should refer to the Schedule of Classes for a complete listing of approved upper-division writing courses. UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS, MINORS, AND ASSOCIATED AREAS OF STUDY Students are urged to become informed of and understand all requirements concerning their intended majors, minors, and associ\u00ad ated areas of study. Special restrictions apply to some majors and minors; for example, some minors require formal application or declaration by students, others may be completed without such for\u00ad malities. Information about the programs listed below may be found in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue. Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree programs are referred to as majors in the following list. In association with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors, concentrations, specializa\u00ad tions, and emphases. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject matter, and/or discipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. An interdisciplinary minor consists of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. All minors, including interdisciplinary minors, are available to all students regardless of their major, with the exception that students may not minor in their major. Minors are listed on a student's tran\u00ad script but are not listed on the baccalaureate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary study consisting of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. Concentra\u00ad tions are similar to minors in that they require fewer units of work than majors do, and the area of concentration appears on the stu\u00ad dent's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Concentra\u00ad tions are taken in combination with a major in one of the schools or programs offering the concentration. Areas of Undergraduate Study 19 A specialization is a program of study which enables students to focus on courses in a particular field within a major. The area of specialization pursued appears on the student's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. An emphasis is a program of study within a major which empha\u00ad sizes a specific area of the discipline. Emphases usually have a defined course of study and are not listed on the transcript nor on the baccalaureate diploma.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000MAJORS AND CAREERS Choosing a Major Many students select their University major, the field of study which represents their principal academic interest, at the time they fill out their University of California Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarship. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its academic pro\u00ad grams. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. At UCI a number of traditionally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by broad interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, labo\u00ad ratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and arts productions. Such experiences can help students identify addi\u00ad tional areas of interest. The UCI General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available and requirements. Students are encouraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors and to go to any department to learn more about its programs of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limita\u00ad tions. (Some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. See the Undergraduate Admissions section for information.) While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Courses and workshops designed to assist students in choosing a major are offered by the UCI Career Center, the Division of Undergraduate Education, and some of the academic units. All students are required to choose a major by the time they reach junior status. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students should keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and could cause the student to need more than four years to obtain the baccalaureate degree. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Certain restrictions may apply; students should check with their academic advisor. Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, as indicated above. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and poli\u00ad cies and procedures. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is avail\u00ad able from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Majors and Careers 23 Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major or even to identify their interests with a particular school. Such students participate in the Unde\u00ad cided/Undeclared Advising Program which is administered by the Division of Undergraduate Education. The goal of this program is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are required to choose their major by the time they reach junior status. To make a good decision about what major to declare, students should know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of their own abilities and inter\u00ad ests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of their vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate preparation. Students in the Undecided/Unde\u00ad clared Advising Program receive quarterly individualized faculty and staff counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own interests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for graduate education and/or possible careers. To assist students in choosing a major, the program has created a two-quarter required course designed to expose undecided/unde\u00ad clared students to a variety of opportunities and resources available to them on the campus such as electronic technology including the World Wide Web and electronic mail, and to introduce students to each of the schools and majors offered. In addition, students learn about research and career opportunities within different disciplines. Call (949) 824-6987 for more information.

Prerequisite: employment as a tutor for the Learning and Academic Resource Center. Preparation for Graduate or Professional Study Undergraduate students should keep the possibility of future gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic pro\u00ad grams, and they should discuss their career goals with their advi\u00ad sors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those require\u00ad ments in mind when selecting courses. Furthermore, students should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language or other special requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. Students should consult the graduate advisor or academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to their area of interest and visit the UCI Career Center which offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. UC IRVINE - 1999-200024 UCI 1999-2000 Preadmission Matters 14.. Every UCI student is provided with an e-mail account and access to the Internet and class information resources via several computer laboratories on campus. Preprofessional Preparation LAW Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spectrum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immigration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evi\u00ad dence of academic excellence. A good record in physics or clas\u00ad sics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in his\u00ad tory or political science. Most law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writing, mathematics, research methods, and statistics, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and suc\u00ad ceeding in law school and the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers a Humanities and Law minor, emphasizing courses that require critical reading and analysis, and courses that focus on theoretical and applied ana\u00ad lytical perspectives on ethical, political, and social issues relevant to the law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, international relations, and economics of law and rec\u00ad ommends that students take some political science courses as well. The School of Social Ecology offers many law-related courses in both substantive law (such as environmental and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice, and offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to actual problems through its field study program. Students should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, LSAT results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should, be aware that not everyone who applies is admitted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative careers should one's goals change. MEDICINE AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SCIENCES Although health science educators strongly recommend that stu\u00ad dents obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many UCI students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences because much of the basic course work for that major is also required for medical school admission; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The minimum amount of undergraduate preparation required includes one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with labora\u00ad tory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statistics, as well as one semester (or two quarters) of biochemistry. Courses in cell or molecular biology, genetics, developmental physiology or comparative anatomy, vertebrate embryology, and computer sci\u00ad ence are recommended. In addition, some health sciences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or recommendations, for example, English and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish language is very helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are eval\u00ad uated separately, and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), the Dental Admission Test, and other apti\u00ad tude examination scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal interview; in-depth letters of recommendation; practical clinical expe\u00ad rience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, which is regarded favorably as an indication of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extracurricular activities which demonstrate the applicant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience, especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants and competition for entrance is keen, it is important to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to health science school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related programs now available. BUSINESS/MANAGEMENT The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to perceive and par\u00ad ticipate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, the ability to successfully deploy and manage information technologies, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of global economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes in organizations. Although UCI does not offer an undergraduate degree in business, the Graduate School of Management offers a minor in Manage\u00ad ment as a supplement to any undergraduate major. This minor can provide students with a broad understanding of management theory and practice and may be helpful to students in determining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or under\u00ad take graduate-level study in management. Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus, statistics, economics, psychology, sociology, computer science, and political science, and are encouraged to take intensive course work in the culture, history, geography, economy, politics, and language of specific foreign countries. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000For admission purposes, the majority of graduate schools of business look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admis\u00ad sion Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and commu\u00ad nity activities and work experience. Substantive work experience is becoming an increasingly important prerequisite for many programs. Students from a variety of undergraduate disciplines including lib\u00ad eral arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering are encouraged to apply to UCI's Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management. Career Opportunities UCI's academic units which offer undergraduate education leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. The lists which follow show the varied career areas pursued by UCI gradu\u00ad ates. Any major can lead to a number of careers.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS University Program for High School Scholars The University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) is a special opportunity offered to highly prepared and gifted students by UCI. High school seniors and, occasionally, juniors have the opportunity to expand their education by enrolling concurrently at UCI in order to pursue academic interests beyond those available at their high schools. UPHSS enables participants to sample UCI's nationally acknowledged academic resources, to participate in University life, and to interact with outstanding UCI faculty and students without disrupting high school academic and social involvements. UPHSS is particularly valuable for talented young people who are intellectually ready for university-level work, who have eagerly and successfully completed the \"college-prep\" courses offered by their high school, and who are looking for new academic chal\u00ad lenges. UCI makes every effort to encourage and facilitate the par\u00ad ticipation of qualified students from all ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Additional information is available in the Undergrad\u00ad uate Admissions section of this Catalogue and from the UPHSS coordinator in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, telephone (949) 824-6703. After matriculation, informa\u00ad tion is available from the Division of Undergraduate Education, telephone (949) 824-6987. Educational Opportunity Program UCI recognizes and values the contributions of a student commu\u00ad nity that reflects the cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity of the people of California. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) provides pre-University programs and services aimed at increasing the eligibility rates for socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Qualification for EOP is based primarily on family income level, and all students served by the program must be Cali\u00ad fornia residents, with the exception of American Indian students. EOP programs and services are located in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, (949) 824-6703, and in the Center for Educational Partnerships, (949) 824-7 482. Admission. Outreach counselors in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools visit high schools and community colleges UC IRVINE - 1999-2000throughout California and meet with prospective students, parents, teachers, counselors, and school officials to discuss the admission and financial aid processes, housing, and the academic opportuni\u00ad ties available at UCI. Prospective students indicate their interest in being considered for EOP services on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission and must provide the information requested. Application fee waivers are available for low-income applicants who meet the eli\u00ad gibility criteria. Housing. UCI guarantees on-campus housing to all new EOP stu\u00ad dents who meet the housing application deadline. Prior to enrolling at UCI, a limited number of admitted EOP stu\u00ad dents are invited to participate in a Summer Bridge Program spon\u00ad sored by Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS). SAAS and the California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CAMP) offer a variety of services to EOP students once they enroll at UCI including advising, tutor\u00ad ing, and learning skills services. Center for Educational Partnerships The Center for Educational Partnerships supports cooperative edu\u00ad cational partnerships among UCI and California schools and col\u00ad leges, and provides pre-enrollment services to prospective students. Partnership Programs. The Partnership Network, an academic col\u00ad laboration including UCI, K-12 schools, and postsecondary institu\u00ad tions, was established to encourage and develop creative leadership through various forums and to bring to light the best understanding of effective educational practices, paradigms, and structures. Project STEP (Student/Teacher Educational Partnership) is a regional model of institutional collaboration from K-16 to improve the college attendance rates of educationally disadvantaged stu\u00ad dents. Participating campuses include UCI, California State Uni\u00ad versity at Fullerton, Santa Ana College, Chapman University, and the Santa Ana Unified School District. Santa Ana Networks includes activities that focus on increasing the educational achievement of at-risk youth. The program is founded on the premise that the educational system must reach and serve students in new far-ranging ways and engage partners who are equally committed to student success. This is accomplished on the strength of two existing programs, Project STEP, which is men\u00ad tioned above, and Santa Ana 2000, a business/community/citywide partnership. Summer Scholars Transfer Institute, a collaborative Santa Ana Col\u00ad lege/UCI residential summer institute, facilitates the transfer of at\u00ad risk students to a four-year university and is a successful model of two institutions working together to provide academic readiness. Pre-College Initiatives and Services. The Center for Educational Partnerships promotes statewide pre-college initiatives that help disadvantaged students develop the academic skills and back\u00ad ground needed to enter college. These initiatives include Mathe\u00ad matics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA); Young Black Scholars; Upward Bound; High School Puente Program; and Cali\u00ad fornia Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal SOAP). Early Academic Outreach and Academic Development Partnerships provide pre-enrollment services. Early Academic Outreach devel\u00ad opment programs assist intermediate and high school students to become aware of academic opportunities and how to prepare for admission to the University of California. Workshops, special events, and conferences are offered to program participants and their parents. The School-Centered Partnerships division is dedicated to improved student academic preparation for college success through establishment of K-12/college/university academic partnerships. Special Programs 27 The Humanities Instructional Building houses a lecture hall, digital arts laboratory, computer laboratory, and classrooms. Staff generate extramural support for discipline-specific and inter\u00ad disciplinary initiatives for curriculum reform, professional devel\u00ad opment, and student academic services. For additional information about the Center for Educational Part\u00ad nership's programs and services, telephone (949) 824-7482. In addition, the Educational Opportunity Program and Center for Educational Partnerships are aligned with the California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering, and Mathemat\u00ad ics (CAMP), a program for students interested in these disciplines. CAMP provides research opportunities for undergraduates, faculty mentoring, and peer group support. Call (800) 776-5394 or (949) 824-3479 for information. Student Academic Advancement Services Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS), a unit of the Division of Undergraduate Education, provides support services to students who are first-generation college students or low-income students, as well as disabled students (those with physical and/or learning disabilities). The goal of SAAS is to help students earn their University degree. See the Division of Undergraduate Educa\u00ad tion section of the Catalogue for additional information. Graduate Diversity Program The University of California recently reaffirmed that a diverse stu\u00ad dent and faculty population is integral to academic excellence and is critical to promoting the lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and perspectives that are essential to advanced scholarly research. The University remains committed to expand outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts. Through the Graduate Diversity Program, steps are taken to increase the participation of diverse groups who may be disadvantaged in graduate education in the United States. See the Research and Graduate Studies section of the Catalogue for additional information. Medical Student Support Programs The College of Medicine's Office of Admissions and Outreach is designed to meet the challenges of California's changing demo\u00ad graphics and to contribute to the College's goal of achieving a broad spectrum of diversity in the student population, and ultimately, in the medical profession. The office plays a major role in the recruit\u00ad ment and retention of targeted socioeconomically disadvantaged students who have the potential of service to the medically under\u00ad served communities in California. See the College of Medicine section for additional information.

CALIFORNIA RESIDENCE AND THE NONRESIDENT TUITION FEE All students who have not lived in California with the intent to make California their permanent home for more than one calendar year prior to the residence determination date for each quarter or semester they propose to attend the University must pay the Non\u00ad resident Tuition Fee. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California cam\u00ad puses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester sys\u00ad tem, the day instruction begins for the semester. Laws Governing Residence The rules regarding residence classification for tuition purposes at the Uni\u00ad versity of California are governed by the California Educational Code and implemented by Standing Orders of the Regents of the University of Califor\u00ad nia. Under these rules adult citizens and certain classes of aliens can establish residence for tuition purposes. There are particular rules that apply to the res\u00ad idence classification of minors. Who Is a Resident? Adult students (at least 18 years of age) may establish residence for tuition purposes in California if they are a: (1) U.S. citizen; (2) permanent resident or other immigrant; or (3) a nonimmigrant who is not precluded from estab\u00ad lishing a domicile in the U.S. This includes nonimmigrants who hold valid visas of the following types: A, E, H-1, H-4, I, K, L, 0-1,0-3, orR. To establish residence a student must, immediately prior to the residence determination date: 1. Be physically present in California for more than one calendar year, and 2. Must have come to California with the intent to make California the per\u00ad manent home. For example, physical presence within the state of Califor\u00ad nia solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residence, regardless of the length of stay. 3. Students under 24 years of age whose parents are not residents of Califor\u00ad nia will be required to meet the Financial Independence requirement in order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes. Residence cannot be derived from a spouse or parents. Requirements for Financial Independence Students are considered \"financially independent\" if they fall into at least one of the following categories: I. At least 24 years of age by December 31 of the calendar year of the term for which resident classification is requested. 2. Veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. 3. A ward of the court or both parents are deceased. 4. Has legal dependents other than a spouse. 5. A married graduate or professional student who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by parents or any other individual for the tax year immediately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested. 6. An unmarried undergraduate student, not claimed as an income tax deduction by parents or any other individual for the two tax years imme\u00ad diately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested, who can demonstrate self-sufficiency for those years. NOTE: Financial independence is not a factor in residence status for graduate student instructors, graduate student teaching assistants, research assistants, junior specialists, postgraduate researchers, graduate student researchers, and teaching associates who are employed 49 percent or more of full time in the term for which resident classification is requested. Establishing Intent to become a California Resident Relevant indicia that contribute to the demonstration of a student's intent to make California the permanent home include, but are not limited to, the fol\u00ad lowing: registering to vote and voting in California elections, designating a California permanent address on all records (i.e., school, employment, mili\u00ad tary), a California Driver's License, a California Identification Card, Califor\u00ad nia vehicle registration, paying California income taxes as a resident (includ\u00ad ing taxes on income earned outside California from the date California residence was established), maintaining a California residence in which personal belongings are kept, licensing for professional practice in California, and the absence of these indicia in places other than California during any period for which residence in California is asserted. General Rules Applying to Minors The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under the age of 18) lives is the residence of the unmarried minor. When the unmarried minor does not live with either parent, the residence of the unmarried minor is that of the parent with whom the unmarried minor last lived. An unmarried minor may establish his or her own residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed unless the unmarried minor is a minor alien who is precluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from estab\u00ad lishing domicile in the U.S. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by the unmarried minor's own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by the relinquishment of a parent's right of control. Specific Rules Applying to Minors 1. Parent of Minor Moves from California. If the California resident par\u00ad ent(s) of an eligible minor moves from California, the minor will be enti\u00ad tled to resident classification as long as the minor enrolls for full-time attendance in a California public postsecondary institution within one cal\u00ad endar year of the parent's departure, and remains physically present in California. This classification will continue until the minor has attained the age of majority and has resided in California for the minimum time required to become a resident. The Financial Independence requirement does not apply to this situation. UC IRVINE - 1999-20002. Self-Supporting Minor. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible aliens may be eligible for resident classification if documentation of physical presence, intent to be a California resident, and self-support through the student's own employment or credit is provided for the entire calendar year prior to the residence determination. 3. Two-Year Care and Control. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible aliens may be eligible for resident classification if they have lived with and been under the continuous care and control. of an adult or series of adults other than a parent for not less than two calendar years. The adult or series of adults must have been responsible for care and control for the entire two-year period and must be California residents for 366 days prior to the residence determination date of the term for which resi\u00ad dent classification is requested. Exemptions from the Nonresident Tuition Fee Students for whom any of the following conditions apply may be eligible for an exemption from the Nonresident Tuition Fee. l. Member of the Military. A student, on active duty as a member of the United States military stationed in California, unless assigned for educa\u00ad tional purposes to a state-supported institution of higher education. 2. Child or Spouse of a Member of the Military. A student who is the nat\u00ad ural or adopted dependent child or spouse of a member of the United States military on active duty, stationed in California, unless the member of the military is assigned for educational purposes to a state-supported institution of higher education. 3. Child or Spouse of a Faculty Member. To the extent that university funds are available, a student who is the unmarried, dependent child under the age of 21 or the spouse of a University of California faculty member who is a member of the Academic Senate. 4. Child or Spouse of a University Employee. A student who is the unmarried, dependent child under the age of 21 or the spouse of a full\u00ad time employee of the University of California who is permanently assigned to work outside the state of California (i.e., Los Alamos National Laboratory). 5. Child of a Deceased Public Law Enforcement or Fire Suppression Employee. A student who is the child of a deceased public law enforce\u00ad ment or fire suppression employee, who was a California resident and was killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppression duties. 6. Dependent Child of a California Resident. A student who has not been an adult resident for more than one year and is the natural or adopted, dependent child of a California resident who has been a resident for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. The student must also maintain full-time attendance in a California public post\u00ad secondary institution. 7. Graduate of a California school operated by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (B.I.A.). A student who is a graduate of a California school operated by the B.I.A. (i.e., Sherman Indian High School) and who enrolls at the University of California. Temporary Absences If a nonresident student is in the process of establishing a domicile in Cali\u00ad fornia and returns to his or her former home during noninstructional periods, the student's presence in California will be presumed to be solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes and only convincing evidence to the contrary will refute this presumption. Students who are in the state of California solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes will not be classified as residents for tuition purposes regard\u00ad less of their length of stay in California. If a student who has been classified as a resident for tuition purposes leaves California temporarily, the absence could result in the loss of California resi\u00ad dence. The burden of proof is on the student to demonstrate through docu-. mentation that he or she (or the parents if the student is a minor) did nothing inconsistent with a claim of continuing California residence during a tempo\u00ad rary absence. Steps that should be taken to retain California residence include, but are not limited to: L Continue to use a California address on all records (educational, employ\u00ad ment, military, among others). 2. Continue to satisfy California tax obligations. A student claiming Califor\u00ad nia residence is liable for payment of income taxes on his or her total income from the date he or she begins to establish residence in California including income earned in another state or country. Expenses and Fees 31 3. Retain a California voter's registration and vote by absentee ballot. 4. Maintain a California Driver's License, California Identification Card, and vehicle registration in California. If it is necessary to change the dri\u00ad ver's license or vehicle registration, it must be changed back to California in the time prescribed by law. Change in Resident Classification Continuing students who are classified as nonresidents for tuition purposes, and who believe that they will be eligible for resident status for the upcoming quarter, must submit a Petition for Resident Classification to the Office of the Registrar in order to have their residence status changed before they submit their registration fee payment for the applicable quarter. Students must initi\u00ad ate all changes of status before the registration deadline of the quarter for which they want to be reclassified. (Specific deadline dates are listed in the quarterly Schedule of Classes booklet.) Students are strongly encouraged to submit their petition in person in order to expedite the review process. As long as submission deadlines are met, students may be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the quarter to provide any additional documen\u00ad tation required for residence determination. Incorrect Classification Any student found to be incorrectly classified as a resident is subject to non\u00ad resident classification and to payment of all previously unpaid Nonresident Fees. If a student has concealed information or furnished false information and was classified incorrectly as a result, the student is also subject to Uni\u00ad versity discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents of California must immediately notify the UCI Residence Deputy. Inquiries and Appeals Inquiries regarding residence requirements, determination, and/or recognized exceptions should be directed to the University of California, Irvine, Resi\u00ad dence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, telephone (949) 824-6129, or to the Legal Analyst, Residence Matters, 111 Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607-5200. No other University personnel are authorized to supply information relative to resi\u00ad dence requirements for tuition fee purposes. This summary is not a complete explanation of the law regarding residence classification. A copy of the regulations adopted by The Regents of the Uni\u00ad versity of California is available for inspection in the Office of the Registrar. Changes may be made in the residence requirements between the publication of this statement and the relevant residence determination date. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may appeal in writing to the Legal Analyst within 45 days of notifi\u00ad cation of the Residence Deputy's final decision. Fee Refunds Student Fee Refunds Students who pay fees for a regular academic quarter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancella\u00ad tion/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean and, for undergraduate students, the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable; and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal is used in determining the per\u00ad centage of fees to be refunded. This date is normally the date that the student submits the form to the appropriate Dean/Ombudsman for approval and is designated by that Dean/Ombudsman. It is pre\u00ad sumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Registration fees are refunded as follows. New Undergraduate Students. Through the first day of instruc\u00ad tion, fees are refunded in full except for the $100 Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee. The International Student Health Insurance Fee (if applicable) is withheld once the quarter begins. The refund of the Registration Fee, Educational Fee, Associated Students Fee, UCI Student Center Fee, Bren Events Center Fee, Recreation Center Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable) is prorated as shown.

Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are mailed to the student generally two to four weeks after the official notice of withdrawal is initiated. Students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UCI during a quarter will have all or part of the fee refund credited to the appropriate financial aid fund. Any cash disbursements, other than work-study, that a student received may also require repay\u00ad ment. The refund amount for new students who receive Title IV Federal financial assistance and withdraw during their first term at UCI is calculated as shown below. Students withdrawing who received loans must schedule an exit interview with the Financial Services Office at (949) 824-7081.

FINANCIAL AID Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; more than 60 percent of UCI's enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend may be eligible for scholarships, grants, loans, and/or work-study awards through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, some schol\u00ad arships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence. Information regarding the application process, deadlines, and finan- , cial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the 1999-2000 Financial Aid Handbook. The handbook is mailed to entering students in January and is available to continuing students in the Financial Aid Office, 102 Administra\u00ad tion Building; telephone (949) 824-8262. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA/Renewal Application). To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the FAFSA/Renewal Application and the necessary sup\u00ad porting documents each year. The FAFSA is available at high schools, local colleges and universities, and at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Renewal applications are mailed to current financial aid recipients starting in mid-November and continuing through the end of December. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible after January 1. The priority deadline to file the FAFSA/ Renewal Application for loans, work-study, and most grants is March 2. All other supporting documentation should be submitted to the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office by May 1 for priority consideration. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to the extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the FAFSA and supporting docu\u00ad ments determine the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's education. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a stu\u00ad dent and/or, if applicable, a spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate other than family residence; stocks, bonds, and other securi\u00ad ties; business equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are required to apply for a Pell Grant, and eligible California residents are required to apply for a Cal Grant. The application deadline for Cal Grants is March 2 for the following academic year. Special Expenditures. Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies associated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid counselor to explore the possibil\u00ad ity of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Exam\u00ad ples of such special expenditures include special equipment for stu\u00ad dents with disabilities. Eligibility Requirements Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the crite\u00ad ria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: (1) be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen of the U.S.; (2) be accepted for admission to the University; (3) be enrolled in good standing at the University; units taken through the Univer\u00ad sity Extension program are not counted toward half-or full-time enrollment; (4) demonstrate financial need (except for William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS loans); financial need is the differ\u00ad ence between the-reasonable and approved expenses of attending UCI and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the student, and any outside aid; (5) maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; (6) be registered with the Selective Service if the student is a male at least 18 years old, born after December 31, 1960, and not on active duty with the armed forces; (7) not owe a refund on a fed\u00ad eral grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Once a student meets the above criteria, disbursement of financial aid funds is made only if the student does not have outstanding debts owed to UCI. UCI POLICY ON SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1986 state that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursuing, according to the stan\u00ad dards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulations of May 1982 state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for assuring that every student receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be main\u00ad taining satisfactory progress in the course of study he or she is pursuing according to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Financial Aid The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCI Financial Aid Office. These requirements are separate and dis\u00ad tinct from UCI's policy regarding satisfactory academic progress. 1. Grade Point Average (GPA). All financial aid recipients must be in com\u00ad pliance with the following minimum cumulative GPA requirements at the conclusion of the spring quarter of each academic year: Undergraduates: first year, 1.85; second year, 1.90; third year, fourth year, 1.975; fifth year, 2.00; graduate students: 3.0; medical students: academic performance requirements to pass course.* * Prior to June 1996, third-and fourth-year students must meet the minimum 2.0 GPA requirement.

NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate students who enroll in more than the mini\u00ad mum number of units required per quarter in the first and second years will have the additional units carried forward for the cumulative total. 3. Quarter Limits for Eligibility. All financial aid applicants exceeding the following quarter limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Stu\u00ad dents will not be granted additional quarters of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pursuing more than one major. Undergraduate students: I. Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of 15 quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to determine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligibility at UCI. 3. Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have up to six quarters of additional financial aid eligibility for a maximum of 21 quarters of under\u00ad graduate attendance. Graduate students: 1. California educational credential students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Master's degree designed for completion in: a. three quarters: five quarters of academic year attendance. b. six quarters: eight quarters of academic year attendance. c. nine quarters: eleven quarters of academic year attendance. 3.

College of Medicine students who have been approved for Extended Cur\u00ad riculum will be eligible for financial assistance for a total of five years. Unit Evaluation 1. Remedial courses. Required remedial courses will count toward the undergraduate, graduate, and medical student minimum unit/clock-hour requirement of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid. 2. Grade evaluation. As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students: F (Failure), I (Incomplete), NP (Not Pass), U (Unsatisfactory), W (Withdraw), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of a D grade or higher; repeat of an advanced standing or high school course). Medical students: F (Failure), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of a D grade or higher). 3. Incomplete courses-medical students. Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quarter/quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade of F, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the stu\u00ad dent's satisfactory academic progress record. 4. Courses in progress-medical students. Clock-hours for courses In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during the first quarter/quintile of a course requiring more than two quarters/quin\u00ad tiles for completion. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been completed the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. Deficiencies in Satisfactory Academic Progress and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satisfactory acade\u00ad mic progress stated above are monitored each quarter and at the end of each academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. I. Quarterly totals-unit and GPA a. Cumulative GPA below the minimum required total: Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the GPA deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter of that academic year or the end of summer session. Eligibil\u00ad ity for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the GPA deficiency. Note: GPA deficiencies must be cleared at a University of California campus. b. Unit deficiencies: i. Enrolled in Jess than the minimum units required but at least six per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid UC IRVINE - 1999-200034 UCI 1999-2000 Preadmission Matters Reines Hall was named in honor of the founding Dean of the School of Physical Sciences and 1995 Nobel Laureate in Physics, the late Frederick Reines. funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter of that academic year or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. ii. Enrolled in less than six units per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive campus-based financial aid funds for that acad\u00ad emic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. 2. Academic year totals-units and GPA. The Financial Aid Office will ver\u00ad ify the cumulative totals for units and GPA after the conclusion of spring quarter. Students who have unit and/or GPA deficiencies will be required to make up the deficiency prior to receiving any future financial aid funds, including funds that would be used for payment of fees. 3. Quarter limits of eligibility. At the end of each quarter students will be notified by the Financial Aid Office if they are nearing the quarter limit of eligibility for financial aid. The notice will indicate how many quarters of eligibility remain. Students also will be notified when they have completed the maximum number of quarters of eligibility for financial aid. Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a student will be considered for financial aid only when one of the following conditions has been met: (a) sufficient u~its/clock-hours have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative GPA requirement has been satisfied, or (b) it is estab\u00ad lished through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating circumstances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered academic performance (i.e., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeal Request Form (available from the Financial Aid Office); a letter to the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office stating their reasons for failing to meet the unit, clock-hour, or GPA progress requirements, and whether or not they have solved their dif\u00ad ficulties; and any other requested documents. Undergraduate and graduate students may seek the assistance of the University Ombudsman in the prepa\u00ad ration of appeals. Medical students may seek the assistance of the Associate Dean of Student and Resident Affairs in the preparation of appeals. They may also be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or letter from their dean. Undergraduate Students-All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid pro\u00ad fessional staff). Once material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether eligibility for aid will be reinstated. In the event the Board decides not to accept an appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal inter\u00ad view with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final rec\u00ad ommendation based upon the interview and written material will be made by the Board and forwarded to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. Graduate Students-Appeals are reviewed by (I) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced degree program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies, who will make the final recommendations to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. Medical Students-AU relevant materials will be presented to the Committee on Promotions and Honors. If the Committee, after consideration of the appeal, determines that the appeal should be approved, its decision will be forwarded to the Director of Financial Aid and aid will be reinstated. In the event the appeal is denied by the Committee, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Committee. The Committee will for\u00ad ward the final decision to the Director of Financial Aid for implementation. \u00b7 Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achieve\u00ad ment, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excel\u00ad lence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate finan\u00ad cial need. UCI offers students with proven high academic achieve\u00ad ment and leadership potential seven top honors awards: Regents', University, Chancellor's Club, Alumni Association, Scholar's Cir\u00ad cle, UC Irvine Scholar, and UCI Foundation Scholarships. The scholarships have stipends which range from $250 to full in-State fees; or, in the case of Regents' Scholarships, may provide full demonstrated need. Entering Freshman and Transfer Students Students who are entering UCI in the fall must complete the schol\u00ad arship section of the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and submit the application by November 30. The Financial Aid Office automatically collects information about applicants' scholarship qualifications. Applications that meet the requirements are reviewed by the Faculty Advisory Panel on Undergraduate Scholarships, Honors, and Financial Aid. Informa\u00ad tion about the Alumni Scholarship is available in the UC Applica\u00ad tion for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships. Restrictive Endowment Scholarships Eligibility requirements for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships vary greatly and are restricted in terms of such student characteris\u00ad tics as geographic location, family background, academic major, and career goals. For the most part, these scholarship awards are based on the student's established financial need. All UCI students will be considered for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships based upon information from the UC Application for Undergraduaie Admission and Scholarships and their current academic records. Regents' Scholarships Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or transfer from community college. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The scholarship is awarded both as an honorarium and a stipend. It may be renewed for an additional one or three years depending on the year of appointment, provided the student completes an average of 12 units per quarter and maintains a grade point average of at least 3.25. The honorarium is awarded without reference to financial need. The amount of the stipend will vary depending on the student's established financial need. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000University Scholarships University scholarships are offered to students entering their fresh\u00ad man year who show evidence of high scholastic attainment. Stu\u00ad dents who demonstrate financial need may receive stipends funded by The Regents of the University of California.

The amount awarded depends upon financial need and funding levels. Financial Aid 35 Loans Loans are often part of a financial aid award. They provide recipi\u00ad ents with an opportunity to defer the cost of their education by borrowing when needed and paying later. However, loan recipients must pay interest on the amount borrowed. The deferment and can\u00ad cellation provisions for the loans listed below are contained on the promissory note each recipient must sign and also may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. A student's loan responsibility, prior to acceptance of the loan, is to understand the terms of the loan. After accepting the loan, the recipient must repay the loan in accordance with the repayment schedule, advise the Financial Aid Office upon leaving UCI; par\u00ad ticipate in an exit interview; and provide the Financial Services Office with a current address after leaving UCI. In case of death or total disability, outstanding loan obligations may be canceled upon presentation of official confirming documents.

Students may easily access all job listings using their student I.D. number via the Career Center's Web site at http://www.career.uci.edu/-career/. This site may be accessed through terminals located in the Center, from the many other on-campus terminals available to students, or via home Internet access. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools is responsible for the admission of new undergraduate freshman and transfer stu\u00ad dents. Inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, 204 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; telephone (949) 824-6703; e-mail: oars@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.reg.uci.edu/ UCUADMISSIONS/. The Office is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The information on admission to UCI presented below is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission as a Freshman Applicant Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars Admission as a Transfer Applicant Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Advanced Placement Credit Application Procedures Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the Gen\u00ad eral Educational Development (GED) Certificate, but has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately following graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. The University considers a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in a regular session of a college or university. Students who meet this definition cannot disregard their college record and apply as freshmen. To be considered as a California community college transfer applicant to UCI, a student must have earned at least 28 semester units from a California community college in the last two regular terms of enrollment. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent resi\u00ad dence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. Refer to the Non\u00ad resident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly regis\u00ad tered and enrolled at UCI and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enrollment. See Readmission: Under\u00ad graduate and Graduate Students. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bache\u00ad lor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) appli\u00ad cant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school or perhaps an area of interest not offered by the high school in which the student meets the necessary prerequisites. Participants are offi\u00ad cially registered UCI students who enroll in the same courses and are evaluated on the same basis as full-time undergraduates. Undergraduate Admissions 37 Members of the UCI Band perform during Welcome Week, a time for incoming students to get acquainted and to acclimate to the campus. UPHSS students enroll in one or two UCI courses on a reduced-fee basis concurrently with their high school courses. Admission as a Freshman Applicant The undergraduate admissions policy of the University of Califor\u00ad nia is guided by the University's commitment to serve the people of California and the needs of the State, within the framework of the California Master Plan for Higher Education. The University's eligibility requirements follow the guidelines set forth in the Master Plan, which specify that the top one-eighth of the State's high school graduates be eligible for admission to the University of California. These requirements, described in detail in the Basic Eligibility Requirements section, are designed to ensure that all eligible students are adequately prepared for University work. Meeting eligibility requirements entitles an applicant to be consid\u00ad ered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. In recent years, the number of freshman applicants to UCI has exceeded the number of spaces available. Since the campus cannot admit all eligible applicants, it must use standards that are more demanding than the minimum UC requirements to select students. These standards, which the University calls selection criteria, are used to identify applicants who have demonstrated the highest acad\u00ad emic achievement and who have a variety of other qualities that can contribute to the strength and diversity of the campus community. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit a change of major petition. SELECTION CRITERIA UCI seeks to enroll students who have a demonstrated record of academic excellence. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enroll\u00ad ment spaces. All applicants are assessed for evidence of academic achievement and potential. Although the number and type of courses completed, and grades and test scores earned remain important elements in the selection process, UCI recognizes that merit is demonstrated in many forms and can be measured in dif\u00ad ferent ways. UC IRVINE - 1999-200038 UCI 1999-2000 Preadmission Matters The following criteria are used to select between 50 to 75 percent of the freshmen class: Academic grade point average (GPA) calculated on all academic courses completed in the subject areas specified by the Univer\u00ad sity's eligibility requirements; the maximum value allowed for GPAis 4.0. Scores on the SAT I (or ACT) and three required SAT II Subject Tests. The number the college preparatory courses completed and the level of achievement in those courses including: courses com\u00ad pleted beyond the minimum subject requirements; University\u00ad approved honors courses, e.g., Advanced Placement, Interna\u00ad tional Baccalaureate Higher Level courses, and college courses; and, the quality of the senior-year program. Evidence of intellectual or creative achievement or substantial public service. This criterion recognizes extraordinary, sustained achievement in any field of intellectual endeavor, for example, a student who has received significant recognition for literary or scientific accomplishments, a student who has demonstrated a strong commitment to the visual and/or performing arts, or a stu\u00ad dent who has demonstrated substantial public service in any aca\u00ad demic field of study. The remaining 25 to 50 percent of freshmen will be selected on the basis of academic achievement and potential, as described above, and elements related to the applicants' personal experiences includ\u00ad ing exceptionally challenging curriculum and outstanding academic and co-curricular accomplishments. Achievements will be considered in the context of the opportunities the student has had, any hard\u00ad ships or unusual circumstances the applicant has faced, and the ways in which the student has responded to these challenges. Students interested in the Engineering majors and the Information and Computer Science major should be aware of the following provisions. School of Engineering: Applicants must complete four years of high school mathematics, including at least one year beyond inter\u00ad mediate algebra. Information and Computer Science: The number of applicants that can be admitted to this major is limited. BASIC ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, or the General Educational Development (GED) examination, and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for admission at the time of high school graduation may be considered after they meet the requirements for admission in advanced standing (see Admis\u00ad sion as a Transfer Applicant). Transfer credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college which conducted the course. REQUIREMENTS To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admission by exami\u00ad nation alone, as explained in the Admission by Examination Alone section. Meeting basic eligibility requirements entitles an applicant to be considered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. 1. UC Subject Requirement The UC subject requirement consists of several courses from six core subjects. These required courses are called the \"a through f' subjects. Students are required to complete 15 \"a through f' sub\u00ad jects as described below. (A one-year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one-half unit.)

College-Preparatory Electives: 2 years required. Two units (four semesters), in addition to those required in the \"a-e\" requirements chosen from the following areas: visual and per\u00ad forming arts, history, social science, English, advanced mathe\u00ad matics, laboratory science, and languages other than English\u00ad a third year in the language used for the \"e\" requirement or two years of another language. The general objective of the elective program is to improve the student's analytical ability, promote their artistic development, and strengthen their oral and writing skills. Electives should involve considerable reading and writing in an amount appro\u00ad priate to the course and the subject matter. The e111phasis in elective courses should be to prepare for future college-level work. Courses Satisfying the \"f\" Requirement: History: All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world history, political his\u00ad tory, or economic history) and should provide an understanding of the human past, including its relation to the present. Courses should develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate his\u00ad torical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. English: All English courses should require substantial reading with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized.

Laboratory Science: A laboratory science course should be a course in the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. On average the laboratory activ\u00ad ities should involve an amount of time equivalent to at least one full class period per week. An introductory science course normally offered in the ninth grade is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for laboratory science courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamen\u00ad tal principles of physical and biological science. Laboratory activi\u00ad ties as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet graduation requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Language Other Than English: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the language other than English \"e\" subject requirement. Elective courses in this lan\u00ad guage must have at least two years of the language as prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Undergraduate Admissions 39 Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisciplinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields.

Courses which are designed to meet State-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational charac\u00ad ter are not acceptable social science electives. Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and the visual arts. Courses should give specific attention to as many of the fundamen\u00ad tal arts components as possible, including the perceptual, the cre\u00ad ative, the historical, or the critical as are applicable. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artis\u00ad tic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with dis\u00ad crimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to developing creative artistic ability and those devoted to artistic performance should have prerequisites (either course work or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume profi\u00ad ciency beyond the introductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five-period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for exam\u00ad ple, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily athletic, or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. 2. Scholarship Requirement Applicants who attain a minimum grade point average of 3.30 (where the letter grade A= 4, B = 3, and C = 2) in \"a through f' subjects taken after the ninth grade will be considered eligible for admission to the University regardless of their scores on the stan\u00ad dardized tests used for the examination requirement. Applicants whose grade point average is below 3.30 but above 2.81 are eligi\u00ad ble to be considered for admission if they achieve the composite or total test score specified on the Eligibility Index. The grade point average will be based on semester grades, unless a high school gives only year grades. (Grades earned in ninth grade or earlier are not used to calculate the grade point average for admission; how\u00ad ever, these courses will be used to meet the subject requirement if they are completed with grades of C or better.) Freshman appli\u00ad cants may be required to present academic qualifications beyond those described here. Applicants should have earned grades of C or better in meeting the subject requirement. Any \"a through f' course in which a student received a D or F grade must be repeated with a higher grade or, in sequential areas of mathematics, chemistry, and language other than English, only validated by completion of advanced course work. (Applicants should consult with their counselors as to how UC IRVINE - 1999-200040 UCI 1999-2000 Preadmission Matters The Biological Sciences II building houses research laboratories and departmental and faculty offices. these grades can be remedied and how the University will use them in the evaluation of the high school record.) Honors-Level Courses. Advanced Placement courses, higher-level courses offered through the International Baccalaureate Program, courses certified by the University as honors courses, and college courses in the \"a through f' college preparatory subjects that are transferable are examples of honors-level courses. The University assigns extra grade points for up to four units of honors-level courses taken in the last three years of high school. NOTE: No more than two units of honors-level courses taken in grade 10 may be assigned extra points. Grades in honors courses will be counted as follows: A = 5 points, B = 4 points, and C = 3 points. Grades of D are not assigned extra points. To be counted, these grades must have been earned in University-approved honors-level courses in history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, Ian- guage other than English, computer science, social science, and the visual and performing arts. 3. Examination Requirements All freshman applicants must submit examination scores as described below. Students applying for admission for fall quarter should complete their examination requirements during May or June of their junior year or during their senior year, but no later than the December test date. (Typically, this means that students will take either the Scholastic Assessment Test I or the American College Test in October or November, and will take the Scholastic Assessment Test II in November or December.) Scores from earlier dates will be accepted. Applicants must ensure that reports for all scores have been submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools. The following examinations are required: 1. One Aptitude Test, either: a. The Scholastic Assessment Test I: Reasoning Test (SAT I): the verbal and mathematical reasoning scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting; or b. The American College Test (ACT) composite score and 2. Three Scholastic Assessment Test II: Subject Tests (SAT II) examinations, which must include (a) writing, (b) math, level 1, 1C, or 2C, and (c) one from among English literature, lan\u00ad guage other than English, sciences, or social studies. The SAT II examination in Literature may not be substituted for the Writ\u00ad ing Test. Admission by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT I is 1,400. (If the ACT is pre\u00ad sented, the minimum score is 31.) Also, the student's total score on the three SAT II examinations must be 1,760 or higher, or at least 1,850 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 530 on any individual SAT II examination. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The SAT II examinations cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. Freshman applicants who qualify for admission by examination alone may be required to present acade\u00ad mic qualifications in addition to the test scores listed above. NOTE: UCI typically does not select students for admission by the examination-alone criteria.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent, usually, with the senior year of high school is available to certain acceler\u00ad ated students. Admission to UPHSS is based upon a combination of criteria including grades, specific preparation in the field of interest, standardized test scores, recommendations, and statement of purpose. Through UPHSS, qualified high school students may enroll in UCI courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. To continue at UCI after high school graduation, a UPHSS student need only complete a change-of-major petition and enroll as a full\u00ad time student. The change of major petition must be filed with the Registrar by the third week of the quarter prior to full-time enroll\u00ad ment. Graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major) for UPHSS students will be determined by the year of the first enroll\u00ad ment in a course as a UPHSS student. However, regulations limit\u00ad ing the ways in which matriculated students may fulfill the writing requirements (Subject A, lower-and upper-division) do not apply to UPHSS students until they enroll as regular UCI students after high school graduation. If the UPHSS participant wishes to attend another University of California campus, the student must follow the regular admissions process and must complete a UC Undergraduate Application. More information about UPHSS is available from the Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools and high school counselors. Admission as a Transfer Applicant The University defines a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level extension classes other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. UCI considers a California community college transfer applicant as a student who has earned at least 28 semester units from a California community college in the last two regular terms of enrollment. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. (Transfer applicants who are not residents of California should also refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements.) SELECTION CRITERIA UCI attempts to accommodate as many qualified transfer appli\u00ad cants as possible. Priority consideration for admission of advanced\u00ad standing applicants is given to junior-level applicants (with a mini\u00ad mum of 60 semester/90 quarter units of transferable credit) from California community colleges and is based upon: (1) GPA in transferable courses; (2) depth of preparation toward general edu\u00ad cation and major requirements; and (3) participation in academi\u00ad cally selective honors courses or programs. Applicants with the strongest academic performance will be the most competitive for admission. Junior transfers from four-year colleges, including other UC campuses, and lower-division transfers will be considered as space permits. Applicants for fall quarter admission must complete required English composition and mathematics courses by the end of the spring term. Applicants for winter or spring quarter must complete required English composition and mathematics courses by summer or fall terms, respectively. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit a change of major petition. This is of particular importance to those who apply in majors which are subject to additional Undergraduate Admissions 41 course prerequisites and/or have a limit placed on the number of applicants admitted into the major. (See below.) Some transfer applicants are selected based upon consideration of the academic criteria in conjunction with the following personal achievement criteria: an exceptionally challenging curriculum; out\u00ad standing accomplishments relevant to academic aims; hardships or unusual circumstances the applicant has faced, and the ways in which the student has responded to these challenges; a strong, thoughtful match between UCI's programs and the student's acade\u00ad mic and career objectives, preparation, talents, and skills; and potential contributions to the campus. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. Transfer applicants to majors in Applied Ecology, Biological Sci\u00ad ences, Chemistry, Economics, Engineering, Information and Com\u00ad puter Science, Mathematics, and Physics must complete prerequi\u00ad site courses for the major as specified below. Applied Ecology: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Applied Ecology major. All applicants must complete one year of general chemistry with labo\u00ad ratory and an approved sequence of biological sciences courses. Biological Sciences: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Biological Sciences major.

Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission. All applicants must complete the follow\u00ad ing required courses: one year of approved calculus, one year of calculus-based physics with laboratory for engineering and physics majors, one semester or one year of general chemistry (whichever is required for the major) and one course in computational meth\u00ad ods, as specified by the major. See the School of Engineering sec\u00ad tion of this Catalogue for information on courses required for junior academic standing. Information and Computer Science: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science major. All applicants must complete the following required courses: one year of discrete mathematics or calculus and one year of computer science including a program\u00ad ming course in a modern high-level language such as ADA, C++, Java, Modula-3 (Pascal and C may be used but are not recom\u00ad mended). There is a limit on the number of applicants admitted to the major. UC IRVINE - 1999-200042 UCI 1999-2000 Preadmission Matters Mathematics: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades over\u00ad all and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Mathematics major. All applicants must complete one year of approved calculus. Physics: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Physics major. All applicants must complete the following required courses: one year of calculus\u00ad based physics with laboratory for engineering and physics majors and one year of approved calculus. TRANSFER STUDENT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The University of California requirements for admission as a trans\u00ad fer applicant vary according to the high school record. Transfer applicants who have completed a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency or the equivalent must also meet regular University entrance requirements. Transfer applicants should also refer to the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average of 2.00 or better in all transferable course work. A transfer applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. Students who were eligible for admission to the University when they graduated from high school-meaning they satisfied the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination Requirements-are eligible to transfer if they have a C (2.0) average in their trans\u00ad ferable college course work. 2. Students who met the Scholarship Requirement but did not sat\u00ad isfy the Subject Requirement must take transferable college courses in the subjects they are missing, earn a grade of C or better in each of these required courses, and earn an overall C (2.0) average in all transferable college course work to be eligi\u00ad ble to transfer. 3. Students who met the Scholarship Requirement but did not meet the Examination Requirement must complete a minimum of 12 semester (18 quarter) units of transferable work and earn an overall C (2.0) average in all transferable college course work completed. 4. Students who were not eligible for admission to the University when they graduated from high school because they did not meet the Scholarship Requirement must: a. Complete 60 semester units or 90 quarter units of transfer\u00ad able college credit with a grade point average of at least 2.4 (no more than 14 semester units or 21 quarter units may be taken Pass/Not Pass), and b. Complete the following course pattern requirement, earning a grade of C or better in each course: i. Two transferable college courses (3 semester or 4-5 quar\u00ad ter units each) in English composition; and ii. One transferable college course (3 semester or 4-5 quar\u00ad ter units) in mathematical concepts and quantitative reason\u00ad ing; and iii. Four transferable college courses (3 semester or 4-5 quarter units each) chosen from at least two of the following subject areas: the arts and humanities, the social and behavo\u00ad rial sciences, the physical and biological sciences. NOTE: For UCI, in fulfilling items i and ii, the courses in English and mathematics should be completed no later than the following term: Applicants for: Fall Winter Spring Courses must be completed by: Spring term Summer term Fall term ADMISSION FOR A SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE A student whose educational objective has changed substantially after receiving the bachelor's degree may be considered for admis\u00ad sion to a program for a second degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Application for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, available from the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission requirements for applicants who are not California resi\u00ad dents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. However, all nonresident freshman and transfer applicants are sub\u00ad ject to the same selection criteria as California residents, as explained in a previous section. Refer to the Expenses and Fees section for information regarding residence classification for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. NONRESIDENT FRESHMAN APPLICANT A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a region\u00ad ally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination; (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through f' pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test either the SAT I (verbal and mathematical scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) com\u00ad posite score, and three SAT II examinations which must include (a) writing, (b) math, level 1, lC, or 2C, and (c) one from among English literature, language other than English, sciences, or social studies. (The SAT II examination in Literature may not be substi\u00ad tuted for the Writing test.) Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to Califor\u00ad nia residents only. To be considered for admission by examination alone, a nonresident applicant must score either 1,400 on the SAT I or 31 on the ACT. The total score on the three SAT II examinations must be 1,850 or higher with a score of at least 530 on each test. NONRESIDENT TRANSFER APPLICANT The minimum admission requirements for nonresident transfer applicants are the same as those for residents, except that nonresi\u00ad dents must have a grade point average of 2.8 or higher in all trans\u00ad ferable college course work. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant-a stu\u00ad dent who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. The application should be submitted to the University of California Undergraduate Application Processing Service early in the appropriate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the neces\u00ad sary passport visa. Official certificates and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools only when requested. International applicants whose native language is other than Eng\u00ad lish will be required to demonstrate their English proficiency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a minimum score of 550 (paper-based) or 213 (computer-based) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, USA; telephone (609) 771-7100; World Wide Web: http://www.toefl.org/. Students must ask the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for international applicants. Students who wish to improve their English proficiency to meet the TOEFL requirement may enroll in the intensive Program in English as a Second Language sponsored by UCI Extension. Infor\u00ad mation is available from English and Certificate Programs for Internationals, UCI Extension, P.O. Box 6050, Irvine, CA 92616- 6050. See Supplementary Educational Programs for additional information. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score, all international students whose native language is other than English must take an English as a Second Language Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during their first year, with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Univer\u00ad sity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. Interna\u00ad tional students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commitments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are consid\u00ad ered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay nonresi\u00ad dent tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Students must also pay the International Student Health Insurance Fee, or have private insurance; see the Student Health Service sec\u00ad tion for information. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY OF PERMANENT RESIDENT, REFUGEE, AND INTERNATIONAL (F-1 VISA) STUDENTS: ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE Any student (a) whose first or native language is not English, (b) who has not satisfied the Universitywide Subject A requirement, and (c) whose score on the verbal portion of the SAT I is 430 or less, or any such student without a verbal SAT I score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score or TSWE (Test of Standard Written English) Undergraduate Admissions 43 UCI has more than 275 clubs and organizations encompassing interests from multicultural to religious, and from environmental to social. score, take an English as a Second Language Placement Test (ESLPT) prior to the first quarter of enrollment. Also, any student who is identified as an ESL student through the Universitywide Subject A Examination must take the ESLPT. The ESLPT is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Welcome Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction, and on dates to be announced. Information is available from the Testing Office (tele\u00ad phone 949-824-6207) and the Office of English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage (telephone 949-824-5991). Based upon the results of the ESLPT, students may be required to enroll in ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writ\u00ad ing courses. Students required to enroll in ESL courses must begin satisfying their ESL requirements within their first or second quar\u00ad ter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecutive quarters. The ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the ESL require\u00ad ment by the end of their sixth quarter will be ineligible to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. Subject A must be satisfied during the quarter following the completion of ESL requirements. If the ESL requirements are completed during the first quarter of enrollment, the Subject A requirement must be satisfied before the beginning of the fourth quarter of enrollment. ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities and listed in the School's section of this Catalogue, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. CREDIT FOR ENGLISH-AS-A-SECOND-LANGUAGE COURSE WORK Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for English-as-a-second-language course work. Students may receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this 12-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. CREDIT FOR NATIVE LANGUAGE Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Some restrictions apply; see the School of Humanities section for information.

Advanced Placement Credit Students who earn scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations will receive credit toward grad\u00ad uation at UCI. The unit and subject credit allowed toward degree requirements assigned to each test are shown in the accompanying chart. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of Advanced Place\u00ad ment credit. Students who elect to enroll in courses for which they have already received Advanced Placement credit will have those courses specially coded on their transcript without unit or grade credit. However, if a student receives less than full series credit (i.e., 8 units of credit for a 12-unit series such as Art History 40A, 40B, 40C or 4 units of credit for an 8-unit series such as Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B), the student may elect to take the final course in the series for credit. International Baccalaureate The University grants eight quarter units (five and one-third semes\u00ad ter units) of credit for each International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level examination on which a student scores 5 or higher. The Uni\u00ad versity does not grant credit for subsidiary level examinations. The units granted for IB examinations are not counted toward the maxi\u00ad mum number of credits required for formal declaration of an under\u00ad graduate major or the maximum number of units a student may accumulate prior to graduation from the University. Students who enter the University with IB credit do not have to declare a major earlier than other students nor are they required to graduate earlier. Application Procedures Application packets for undergraduate admission to the University are available from the counseling office of any California high school or community college, from any University of California Admissions Office, or on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucop. edu/pathways/. Students applying for admission to UCI should complete the appli\u00ad cation and submit it according to the instructions provided in the Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarships. A non\u00ad refundable application fee of $40 must accompany the application. This basic fee entitles the applicant to be considered at one campus; for each additional campus selected, an additional $40 fee is required. Applicants concerned with admission or application pro\u00ad cedure questions specific to UCI should communicate directly with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; telephone (949) 824-6703; e-mail: oars@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.reg.uci.edu/ UCI/ADMISSIONS/. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. WHEN TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION To ensure that applications will be considered for admission by both UCI (or other University campuses) and the student's choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be filed during the priority filing period. Each campus accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. Additionally, students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admission should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early. Completing the examination requirement (SAT I or ACT and three SAT II exami\u00ad nations) no later than the December testing date of the senior year of high school is strongly recommended for students applying for the fall quarter. Quarter to be Admitted at UCI Winter quarter, 2000 Spring quarter, 2000 Fall quarter, 2000 Winter quarter, 200 I Spring quarter, 200 I Priority Application Filing Dates File July 1-30, 1999 File October l-30, 1999 File November 1-30, 1999 File July 1-30, 2000 File October l-30, 2000 After the priority filing period has ended, campuses will accept applications only if they still have openings for new students. Students are advised to check with the Admissions Office to find out if applications are being accepted for winter or spring terms. ADDING A CAMPUS If the campus or campuses being considered are still accepting applications, students may, after submitting their application, add additional campus choice(s) to that or those initially listed on their application. A $40 fee for each additional campus will be required. Students should contact the Admissions Office on the campus to be added for information on which programs are still open and the procedures for adding campuses. UC IRVINE - 1999-200046 UCI 1999-2000 Preadmission Matters Students should be aware that processing an additional campus choice will take several weeks before the new campus actually receives the application and data. Students should also be aware that special program commitments, such as the Educational Oppor\u00ad tunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Program may vary from campus to campus. Students can communicate with the Housing or Financial Aid Office directly for information about deadlines, priorities, and availability of these services. TRANSCRIPTS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Freshman Applicants. Applicants will be notified if a preliminary high school transcript is required. Applicants are also responsible for asking testing agencies to report examination scores for either the SAT I or ACT tests and three SAT II examinations to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. An official final high school transcript showing a statement of graduation also must be forwarded to the campus at which the student has decided to register and enroll. Official final transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools by July 15 for those students admitted for fall quarter. Those students entering in the winter or spring quarters must have their transcripts in the Office within one month of the completion of the term 'of the school from which they entered: A California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency, the results from a proficiency test from any state, or a Gen\u00ad eral Education Development (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma. Transfer Applicants. Transfer students should not send transcripts unless requested to do so. It is essential that applicants accurately complete the self-reported college credit information in the appli\u00ad cation because it will be used for initial admission screening. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at UC/, an official tran- . script from each college attended and the high school from which they graduated must be sent to the Office of Admissions and Rela\u00ad tions with Schools. Unless a student is attending a summer session, final official transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools by July 15 for those students admitted for the fall quarter. Summer-session transcripts must be submitted by September 15. Students entering UCI in the winter or spring quarters must have their final official transcripts sent to the Office no later than one month after completion of the term of the school they are currently attending. Delays in receiving official transcripts will disadvantage students in the academic advising process and can affect enrollment in appropriate courses. EXAMINATION ARRANGEMENTS Students should make arrangements to take the SAT I and SAT II examinations with the Educational Testing Service, College Board/ATP, CN 6200, Princeton, NJ 08541-6200; World Wide Web: http://cbwebl.collegeboard.org. For the ACT, students should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, lA 52243. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not to the University.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is important to use pre\u00ad cisely the same form of the student's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. In 1999-2000 SAT I and SAT II are offered concurrently on the fol\u00ad lowing Saturday mornings: October 9, 1999; November 6, 1999; December 4, 1999; January 22, 2000; May 6, 2000; and June 3, 2000. The 1999-2000 ACT Tests are offered on the following dates: Sep\u00ad tember 25, 1999; October February 12, 2000; April1, 2000; and June 10, 2000. Details on testing are available from the College Board, the Ameri\u00ad can College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. NOTIFICATION OF ADMISSION Most fall quarter freshmen applicants are notified of their status between March 1 and 31. Transfer applicants are usually notified by May 1. In some cases for transfer applicants, complete tran\u00ad scripts of course work are required before a final decision can be made; such records will be requested by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Note that these target dates apply only to those applicants who submitted their applications during the fall priority filing period (November 1-30). Those students who apply after the priority period will be notified as soon as possible after March 31. Statement of Intent to Register Students who are accepted for admission will receive, with their notification of admission, a Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) form. The SIR serves to notify each campus of the student's deci\u00ad sion to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before complet\u00ad ing and returning the form, students who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their responses to each campus. However, it is essen\u00ad tial that students allow enough time to meet the deadline for returning their SIR. Once they have decided on which campus to attend, students should submit their positive SIR and nonrefund\u00ad able $100 deposit (if applicable) to the campus Admissions Office. Students should not submit a positive SIR to more than one cam\u00ad pus. Additionally, once the positive SIR and fee have been received, the student cannot transfer to another UC campus . Freshman students entering in the fall quarter must return their positive SIR by May 1 or by the date indicated on the SIR. Trans\u00ad fer students entering in a fall quarter must return their positive SIR by June 1, or by the date indicated on the SIR. Students entering in a winter or spring quarter must return the SIR by the date indicated on the SIR. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Student Records Access and Disclosure At UCI, an \"applicant\" becomes a \"student\" at the time of submis\u00ad sion of the SIR. Information regarding access to student records and disclosure of student record information (both public and con\u00ad fidential) may be found in the Appendix. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000INFORMATION FOR ADMITTED STUDENTS ORIENTATION Each May information about UCI's orientation programs sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Students is sent to applicants for admission who plan to enroll in the fall. Student-Parent Orientation Programs (SPOP) are held three dif\u00ad ferent times during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new stu\u00ad dents with their registration materials and offers informative ses\u00ad sions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in resi\u00ad dence halls, and the program fee covers room, board, and program costs. Two mini-SPOPs (intensive one-day events) are held in July for students and parents who are unable to attend the multi-day programs. For more information, telephone (949) 824-7759 or send e-mail to jhalvaks@uci.edu. Transfer Orientation is a unique one-day program geared to the needs of transfer students. Held at the end of July, the program provides advising, access to campus resources, a graduate school preparation workshop, and more. Uni-Prep is a four-day program for entering students held in August. Participants live in the residence halls and attend work\u00ad shops and other activities designed to provide them with informa\u00ad tion about shaping their academic and personal lives at UCI. A fee is charged that covers room, board, and program costs. Welcome Week features a variety of academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the beginning of fall quarter classes. DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION The core mission of the Division of Undergraduate Education is to provide campus leadership, programs, and services which enhance the quality of undergraduate education at UCI. An advocate and steward for educational excellence, the Division works with all acad\u00ad emic units, programs, and members of the UCI community to foster a climate of learning and discovery for every undergraduate student. Through its diverse and innovative programs and services, the Divi\u00ad sion provides support for student academic achievement, for a rich and coherent curriculum, and for outstanding teaching through the integration of teaching and research activities and the facilitation of effective pedagogy. The Division of Undergraduate Education is responsible for the fol\u00ad lowing programs and services: the Campuswide Honors Program, which also administers the Scholarship Opportunities Program; the Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program and the International Opportunities Program; the Peer Academic Advising Program and academic advising for Undecided/Undeclared students; the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; the Learning and Academic Resource Cen\u00ad ter; Student Academic Advancement Services; the Testing Office; the Instructional Resources Center and the Instructional Technol\u00ad ogy Center; the Resource Center for Undergraduate Education Grants; administration of the UCI Washington D.C. Center Pro\u00ad gram; and the organization of the campus' student orientation pro\u00ad grams in cooperation with the Division of Student Services. The Division's programs and services are described in detail below. The Division is responsible for the administration of the revised Academic Honesty Policy (adopted by the UCI Academic Senate on December 12, 1996; see the Appendix) as it relates to undergradu\u00ad ates; for maintaining a classroom environment conducive to teach\u00ad ing and learning; and for implementing the Student Recommended Faculty Program, initiated at UCI in 1969. This is the only such program in the U.S. that affords undergraduates the opportunity to identify, select, and propose recruitment of nonrenewable faculty appointments in curricular areas of particular interest not repre\u00ad sented at UCI. Call (949) 824-8658 for information. Additionally, the Division's Research, Evaluation, and Grants Office evaluates various programs and conducts research on topics related to undergraduate education such as student retention, acad\u00ad emic needs, course grades, enrollment patterns, and curricular issues. Placement Testing UCI's Testing Office administers placement tests to new and con\u00ad tinuing students to ensure correct placement in selected introduc\u00ad tory courses and to help students assess their readiness for Univer\u00ad sity-level work. These tests are selected or developed by UCI faculty who also determine the grading criteria for each test. Results from placement tests are used by students and their acade\u00ad mic counselors to formulate a plan of study which is best suited to the students' learning needs and career goals and to determine enrollment in introductory courses. Additional information, such as entrance examination scores, Advanced Placement (AP) scores, and high school work, also may be used to determine course placement. Placement tests are given in the areas of chemistry, physics, precal\u00ad culus, mathematical analysis, Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, and English as a second language: 1. Chemistry Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in an introductory chemistry course (Chemistry lP, 1A, or H2A) are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. 2. Physics Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Physics SA, 7 A, or 7B are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. 3. Precalculus Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Mathematics 2A are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. 4. Mathematical Analysis Test. Students who plan to enroll in Mathematics lA or 1B, or who have not had a prior course in precalculus and who plan to enroll in mathematics courses at UCI are strongly encouraged to take this test. 5. Chinese Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Chinese lA, lB, lC, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, or 3C are required to take this test. A satisfactory score on this test will also satisfy the Lan\u00ad guage Other Than English breadth requirement. 6. Japanese Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Japan\u00ad ese lA, lB, lC, 2A, 2B, 2C, or 3A are required to take this test followed by an oral interview.

A satisfactory score on the test and oral inter\u00ad view will also satisfy the Language Other Than English breadth requirement. UC IRVINE - 1999-200048 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students Peter the Anteater, UCI's mascot, works the campus before home basketball games and other special events. 8. French Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in French lA, lB, lC, or 2A are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. 9. English as a Second Language (ESL) Placement Test. This test is required of students (a) whose native language is not English, (b) whose verbal score on the SAT I: Reasoning Test is 430 or less, (c) who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement, and (d) who have received a letter from the ESL Program requiring them to take the ESL Placement Test. Scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the Test of Stan\u00ad dard Written English (TSWE) are not considered. The ESL Placement Test also is required of students referred to the ESL Program on the basis of their score on the Universitywide Sub\u00ad ject A Examination. See the section on Admission of Interna\u00ad tional Students for additional information. All newly admitted freshmen will receive a detailed brochure describing the placement tests and the testing schedule for the summer. Students should take required tests before registering for classes and should discuss their results with an academic counselor or faculty advisor. Students enrolling for the first time in fall quar\u00ad ter are strongly advised to take placement tests at the earliest possi\u00ad ble date (usually in May or June) in order to allow time to receive their results and discuss them with an academic counselor during the summer registration period and prior to enrolling in courses. For the convenience of continuing students, placement tests also are administered every quarter during the academic year; consult the Schedule of Classes for dates. The Testing Office also administers language tests for exemption to the Language Other Than English breadth requirement, and is responsible for the campus-based administration of the Subject A examination. Further information on placement and language testing may be obtained by calling (949) 824-6207 or by visiting the Office's Web site at http://www.due.uci.edu/-due/plt/. The Office is a unit of the Division of Undergraduate Education. University Subject A Examination The University of California system has established the University\u00ad wide Subject A Examination (see University Requirements). Results from this examination are used to place students in UCI writing and, if needed, ESL courses. There is a $55 nonrefundable administrative fee associated with the examination. The fee pay\u00ad ment process and waiver information are explained in materials students receive in April from the Educational Testing Service. Students who receive admission application fee waivers will auto\u00ad matically have this exam fee waived. Please refer to the section on Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree for complete information on the Universitywide Subject A Examination. Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate student is assigned to the school or program that offers the student's selected major. Students who have indicated \"Undecided/Undeclared\" as a major on their UC Application for Admission receive assistance from the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program until they select an academic major. This program is located in 256 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-6987. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and acade\u00ad mic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or depart\u00ad ment to which a student is assigned or, in the case of undecided/ undeclared majors, with the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Each academic unit provides academic advising for its students and processes requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, or change majors. Stu\u00ad dents are responsible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned. While each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising, these systems differ from unit to unit. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. All advising offices include academic counselors, professionals who assist students in planning their program, selecting a major, and making progress toward a degree. Peer academic advisors (trained upper-division students) assist students in many of the same areas as academic counselors. In addition, they are able to answer ques\u00ad tions relating to student life issues, providing a student perspective. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advi\u00ad sors rests with the dean or chair of the appropriate academic unit. This is done normally by letter; however, students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or chair. Telephone numbers for academic advising offices are listed in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue and in the Schedule of Classes. New students are encouraged to plan their academic programs with an academic counselor shortly after being admitted. The optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the student determine whether the classes the student wishes to take are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the requirements for graduation. In some schools and programs, consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Regardless of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, students are responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with their assigned faculty advisor. The actual frequency of these meet\u00ad ings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the unit's governing regulations. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appropriate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes for advice concerning class enrollment. These procedures for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Finish in Four Many UCI students graduate in four years, with appropriate plan\u00ad ning. In addition, UCI provides a Finish in Four Program for all undergraduates who wish to be assured of earning their degree in a UC IRVINE - 1999-2000timely manner. The goal of the program is to provide information and advising to enable students to make plans and decisions .that will result in completion of their degrees in four years. The pro\u00ad gram involves a series of commitments on the part of the Univer\u00ad sity and the student. Information about the Finish in Four Program is available from the academic advising offices. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores, who are uncertain about their major, and who wish to explore, experiment, and then decide, participate in the Undecided/Unde\u00ad clared Advising Program administered by the Division of Under\u00ad graduate Education. The Division is devoted to enriching the learn\u00ad ing environment for lower-division students, especially those in the freshman year. Further information is available in the Majors and Careers section of this Catalogue. Learning and Academic Resource Center The Learning and Academic Resource Center (LARC) is a cam\u00ad puswide academic assistance unit that provides programs designed to help students acquire the skills needed to develop intellectually, become successful learners, and achieve their academic and profes\u00ad sional goals. LARC staff and programs provide students with personal contact and support necessary for academic success on a large and diverse campus where students need to enroll in many large lecture courses. The Center works closely with faculty to develop pro\u00ad grams that meet both curricular objectives and the changing needs of students. LARC programs stress the development of academic abilities that all university students need regardless of major: effec\u00ad tive study strategies, critical reading, and analytical writing. Other programs focus on specific disciplines and offer students the opportunity to improve their academic skills in such areas as biol\u00ad ogy, chemistry, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and com- puter sciences, among others. \u00b7 The Center offers adjunct classes, workshops, individual counsel\u00ad ing, small peer tutoring groups, and support in all forms of acade\u00ad mic writing. Students may enroll iii LARC programs through TELE or by calling (949) 824-6451 to make appointments. Additional information including schedules for adjunct classes, workshops, and tutorials may be obtained on the World Wide Web at http:// www.uci.edu/-due/larc/. Writing Workshops, sponsored by the Division of Undergraduate Education, seek to provide in-depth writing assistance of a focused and methodical nature to newly admitted students who may find English and Comparative Literature WR39A difficult because of insufficiencies in their University preparation. This assistance addresses specific compositional weaknesses and endeavors to pro\u00ad vide students, at an early stage of their course work, with neces\u00ad sary verbal skills. Assistance is given in the form of workshops attached to special sections of English and Comparative Literature WR39A. The Writing Workshops enable instructors to give inten- sive and individualized attention to students. \u00b7 Student Academic Advancement Services Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS) provides indi\u00ad vidual counseling and academic support for students who are first\u00ad generation college students or low-income students, as well as dis\u00ad abled students (those with physical and/or learning disabilities). SAAS sponsors several major projects and a variety of workshops. A primary responsibility of SAAS is to monitor the academic progress of its students. To best assist students who are having dif\u00ad ficulty with their course work, professional counselors maintain a close liaison with academic departments. When needed, referrals to Division of Undergraduate Education 49 other campus support services are provided. In conjunction with these academic and service units, a variety of workshops are offered throughout the year by SAAS, as well as a graduate school preparatory course for those students whose career interests require graduate study. SAAS also sponsors and conducts the Summer Bridge at UCI for underprepared students who demonstrate the potential to succeed at the University. Summer Bridge is designed to provide and refine basic academic skills necessary for students to successfully com\u00ad plete their course work during the regular school year. Students are encouraged to make appointments with Student Acad\u00ad emic Advancement Services; telephone (949) 824-6234. Honors Opportunities UCI offers several challenging honors opportunities to its most motivated students. These include a comprehensive Campuswide Honors Program, which is open to outstanding students from all majors from the freshman through senior years; a variety of major\u00ad specific honors programs at the upper-division level; the Humani\u00ad ties Honors Program, also offered at the upper-division level, but open to all majors on campus; and several Excellence in Research programs. These programs offer some of the advantages usually associated with selective liberal arts colleges: rigorous, small, personalized classes and the intellectual exchange that creates a community of scholars. The difference, however, is that UCI's programs have the support and benefit of the 26-million-volume University of Califor\u00ad nia Library system (of which UCI Library collections number some two million volumes) and of the numerous state-of-the-art laboratories on campus. Honors students are also encouraged to participate in the Education Abroad Program and/or the International Opportunities Program during their junior or senior year. See the Center for International Education section in this Catalogue for additional information. Campuswide Honors Program Founded in 1988, the Campuswide Honors Program (CHP) is available to selected high-achieving students in all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. It maintains an active roster of approximately 400 students. About 90 percent of CHP students have continued their studies after graduation from UCI at some of the most prestigious graduate and professional schools in the country. CHP provides outstanding UCI students with a special curriculum consisting of small, seminar-style classes, close interaction with peers, mentorship by UCI's top faculty, and the opportunity to par\u00ad ticipate in undergraduate research. Students also receive assistance in applying for scholarships, internships, education abroad, and rel\u00ad evant work experience. Completion of the Campus wide Honors Program is noted on the student's transcript and baccalaureate diploma. Admission to the program as an incoming UCI freshman is by invitation only; all eligible candidates are reviewed and selected by faculty representatives from each academic unit. Transfer and other students are eligible to apply for admission to CHP up until the first quarter of their junior year, if they have a minimum grade point average of 3.5. CHP seeks to admit students who have a demonstrated passion for learning, a willingness to explore and take risks, a focus within their primary area of interest, and, at the same time, academic excellence in a range of disciplines outside of their major area. Students pursue three year-long interdisciplinary Honors core courses (one course per quarter), satisfying several categories of the breadth requirement. Many of these courses provide an inter\u00ad disciplinary approach to major subjects and issues. Faculty from UC IRVINE - 1999-200050 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students a variety of disciplines are chosen especially for their teaching ability and scholarship. During their junior and senior years, par\u00ad ticipants pursue original research under the direct supervision of faculty members, culminating in the production of a senior honors thesis, creative project, or publication-quality paper. Many CHP students also participate in major-specific honors programs. The senior honors thesis that is developed and produced through these programs satisfies the CHP thesis requirement. CHP students begin their course of study by taking honors sections of the Humanities Core Course or Arts Core sequence. Team-taught by professors from various disciplines in the School of Humanities, the Humanities Core Course is organized around major themes. The current focus of the course is Exploration and Discovery\u00ad Intellectual Discovery: Logic, Rhetoric, Narrative, Image. The course investigates what it means to explore and discover new ideas and experiences in terms of philosophical argument, imagina\u00ad tive expression, and cinematic and literary forms. It looks into the theme of the journey or quest, and some different ways that the exploration and discovery of \"America\" has been conducted, imag\u00ad ined, and recorded. The Arts Core sequence introduces students to concepts and prac\u00ad tices fundamental to the arts and to the activities and faculty of the UCI School of the Arts. It explores the ongoing and evolving rela\u00ad tionship between the arts and culture/society. The Critical Issues in the Social Sciences sequence is team-taught by professors from the Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Topics include human vision; authority (dis)obedience, and human society; decisions and compromises and their rewards and penalties; human language and its disablement; and exotic soci\u00ad eties (including our own). The Idiom and Practice of Science interdisciplinary sequence explores the role science plays in addressing socially significant problems. Students develop the ability to understand scientific models and to judge the content, merit, and limitations of many issues of science in the modern world. The development of analyti\u00ad cal and writing skills is emphasized. Honors General Chemistry, designed for CHP members and other \u00b7 highly qualified students, covers the same material as Chemistry !A-B-C, but in greater depth. The Honors Introduction to Computer Science sequence is open to CHP students majoring in Information and Computer Science and other students by consent. The first course introduces basic con\u00ad cepts, fundamental laws and principles of software and hardware organization, program construction, applications, and policy and social issues. The second course covers in-depth concepts of pro\u00ad gramming and mathematical tools for analyzing programs, and the third builds on this background with respect to mathematical tools and analysis. Extracurricular Activities. CHP students are invited to participate in many social and cultural activities, including weekly coffee hours, beach bonfires, poetry readings, faculty home visits/infor\u00ad mal lectures, movie and play nights, trips to museums, and camp\u00ad ing retreats. Honors students also produce a quarterly free-form creative writing journal, and continuing Honors students may vol\u00ad unteer for the Peer Mentor Program and Honors Ambassador Pro\u00ad gram, providing assistance to incoming Honors students. On-Campus Housing. CHP students have the option of living on campus in various locations. Freshmen may choose to live in Mid\u00ad dle Earth in \"The Shire.\" CHP students, including some freshmen, select Arroyo Vista where they can choose from three 16-person, one 24-person, and two 32-person houses. These residences offer a valuable living/learning experience with other honors students and the community spirit that is a special feature of CHP. Students bring to the living experience their vitality, creativity, and dynamic dedication to learning. Activities have included get-togethers with honors faculty, staff, and students, international potlucks, off\u00ad campus retreats, study breaks, and other events such as workshops and special speakers that are dependent upon the interests of the residents. Additional information is available from the Campuswide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; World Wide Web: http//:www.honors.uci. edu/-honors. Honors Programs Honors programs for qualified junior-and senior-level students also are available to Drama majors in the School of the Arts; to students from all schools regardless of their majors, by the School of Humanities; to Chemistry and Physics majors in the School of Physical Sciences; to Anthropology, Economics, International Studies, Linguistics, Political Science, Psychology, Social Science, and Sociology majors in the School of Social Sciences; to Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science majors; and to all majors in the School of Social Ecology. The focal point of each of these programs is the development of analytical and research skills through the pursuit of research under faculty supervision. An honors-level thesis is required in all the programs except Drama. Many major-specific and Humanities Honors Program students also participate in the Cam\u00ad puswide Honors Program. The honors-level thesis that is devel\u00ad oped and produced through these programs also satisfies the CHP thesis requirement. Additional information is available in the spe\u00ad cific academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Excellence in Research Programs The School of Biological Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the Department of Cognitive Sciences offer students the opportu\u00ad nity to pursue research through their Excellence in Research Pro\u00ad grams. Students work on their research projects under faculty supervision and have the opportunity to present their results to peers and faculty and, in certain instances, to have their research papers published. Additional information is available in the spe\u00ad cific academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Scholarship Opportunities Program UCI encourages high-achieving students to learn how they can compete successfully for the most prestigious scholarships, research grants, and graduate fellowships available, and to begin learning about the process as early as possible. The Scholarship Opportuni\u00ad ties Program (SOP), offered through the Campuswide Honors Pro\u00ad gram, presents workshops throughout the year, provides individual and group counseling, and sponsors the Winners' Circle, a club in which students help each other apply for scholarships, fellowships, and other awards.

UC IRVINE - 1999-200052 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students UCI's annual Go Abroad Fair informs students about opportunities to study, teach, volunteer; or intern outside of the U.S. Center for International Education The Center for International Education (CIE) includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and International Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram (lOP). CIE is a comprehensive resource and counseling center which helps students take advantage of the many worldwide oppor\u00ad tunities that exist for study, work, internship, volunteering, research, and non-credentialed teaching, and prepares students for participa\u00ad tion in these programs. Participating in an international educational experience typically introduces students to ways of thinking differ\u00ad ent from their own, broadens their understanding of the historical and contemporary world, sharpens their interest in particular fields, and enhances their overall intellectual development. Professional staff and international peer advisors, who have returned from an lOP or EAP experience, are available to guide students in making appropriate choices of international programs for their educational goals. All EAP and lOP participants are pro\u00ad vided with pre-departure orientations, an EAP or lOP Student Guide handbook, and reentry orientations upon their return to UCI. The Global Issues and International Perspectives class, offered by the School of Social Sciences, introduces prospective EAP and lOP participants to intellectual and adjustment issues that they may face during an extended stay in a foreign country. Students can keep up-to-date on CIE events, deadlines, and new international opportunities by subscribing to the biweekly elec\u00ad tronic newsletter, CIE-NEWS. For information on how to sub\u00ad scribe, contact CIE. CIE, EAP, and lOP are located in 1100 Student Services II; tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6343; e-mail: cie@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http:// www.cie.uci.edu/-cie/. EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia offers students the opportunity to experience a different cul\u00ad ture while making progress toward degree objectives. EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with about 100 host universities and colleges in about 30 countries throughout the world. One quarter's participation in EAP fulfills the Interna\u00ad tional/Global Issues breadth requirement (category VII-B). Partici\u00ad pation in selected EAP programs also may satisfy the Language Other Than English breadth requirement (category VI); see an EAP counselor for a list of approved programs. Admission of UC undergraduate students to the Education Abroad programs is subject to the following qualifications: well-defined goals and clear academic plan for integrating EAP studies into the student's UC degree program; a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the time of application and maintained through departure for most programs; junior standing by departure (for most programs); completion of language study as required, with an overall minimum grade point average of 3.0 or the equivalent; and the recommendation of the campus EAP Selection Committee. Some programs require prior language study, while others either recommend it or do not require it. University of California faculty who serve as directors and associ\u00ad ate directors at most Study Centers provide academic counsel to students while abroad. Full credit is granted for courses satisfacto\u00ad rily completed, and courses are recorded on official UC transcripts. With careful planning, most EAP students make normal progress toward their UC degrees. Application of credits earned abroad toward major or graduation requirements is determined by the aca\u00ad demic unit in which the participant's major is offered. Students interested in the language, literature, art, culture, history, government, or social institutions of the countries where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain substantially from first-hand academic experience. Classes in the natural and physical sciences, engineering, and computer science are available at many prestigious host institutions. In addition, whatever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their outlook and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign country, as well as experience vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of thinking while making progress toward a UC degree. The cost of studying abroad through EAP is often comparable to the cost of studying at UCI. EAP participants are responsible for the same fees as they pay at UCI, including UC registration and educational fees, campus fees, and room, board, books, and per\u00ad sonal expenses. The only additional costs directly related to the program are for their round-trip transportation and orientation and intensive language program (depending on the Study Center). Most University of California financial aid, including grants, scholar\u00ad ships, and loans, is available to EAP students who qualify. EAP also offers several other scholarships including individual country incentive scholarships awarded to all students studying in these specific programs; EAP Opportunity Grants available to economi\u00ad cally disadvantaged students; and a competitive EAP Alumni Scholarship. Contact CIE for additional information. Normally, students participate in EAP during their junior year, so application for EAP usually is made in the sophomore year, how\u00ad ever, students may apply for participation as fourth-or fifth-year seniors. Some programs are also open to sophomores. In addition, students who have completed at least one full year of graduate study and who have support of their academic department and graduate dean may apply. Students interested in EAP should con\u00ad tact CIE early in the fall quarter to obtain an informative brochure, application forms, and information concerning application deadlines. Academic Program. EAP offers three types of programs: (1) Full Immersion Programs. UC students take regular classes at the host university, in the language of the host country, side-by-side with native students. This option is available in many English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries, and students typically take classes in their major or related fields; (2) Language and Society Programs. These are designed for students at beginning or interme\u00ad diate language levels for the purpose of learning or improving lan\u00ad guage skills. UC students normally take classes side-by-side with other foreign students learning the language of the host country; and (3) Special Focus Programs. EAP offers a number of programs with a specific, limited academic focus, for example, Tropical Biology in Costa Rica, and Global Security and Economic Devel\u00ad opment in Japan.

UC IRVINE - 1999-200054 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students The courses and fields of study open to EAP participants vary at each center. Each of the host universities has special areas of excellence and strength, as described in brochures for each country which are available at CIE and at http://www.uoeap.ucsb.edu/ on the World Wide Web. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM UCI's International Opportunities Program (lOP) is the link between UCI students and any international educational experience that occurs outside the boundaries of the U.S. and is not a part of UCI's Education Abroad Program (EAP). Any UCI student (under\u00ad graduate, graduating senior, or graduate) in good academic stand\u00ad ing, regardless of major, class level, or foreign language ability, may participate in lOP. lOP staff provide information and counseling to assist students in finding an appropriate program to meet their needs and interests. Students may choose from academic study (with transferable credit), paid work, paid or unpaid internships, unpaid or compen\u00ad sated volunteer service, field research, and paid teaching opportu\u00ad nities in nearly every country in the world. This includes all acade\u00ad mic programs sponsored by U.S. institutions that occur on foreign soil or water (as in the case of the Semester at Sea program), direct enrollment at foreign institutions, summer session abroad programs through UCI and other UC campuses, and UCI Independent Study (199) done in foreign countries under the supervision of a UCI fac\u00ad ulty member. With careful planning lOP students participating in study programs can make progress toward their UCI degree by fulfilling major, minor, or breadth requirements. Students may apply for transfer credit and UCI financial aid by completing the International Study Advance Contract. Many scholarships are also available. To acquaint students with opportunities abroad, lOP sponsors the yearly Go Abroad Fair and periodic presentations, orientations, and workshops. It also maintains a library of international resources and publications listing opportunities abroad. REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE There are four groups of requirements that must be met to earn a baccalaureate degree from UCI: general UC requirements, UCI requirements, school or program requirements, and degree-specific requirements. UC and UCI requirements are described below. School or program and major-specific requirements are described in full in the academic unit sections. Students with identified learning and/or physical disabilities, including language-acquisition problems, are eligible to receive support through the Office for Disability Services; telephone (949) 824-7494 (voice), 824-6272 (TDD). Staff can assist students from the time they are admitted to UCI until they graduate. Catalogue Rights Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major): (a) those in effect at the time of entrance; or (b) those subsequently established after entrance. A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for three or more consecutive quarters (excluding summer sessions) must adhere to the graduation requirements: (a) in effect for the quarter in which the student is readmitted; or (b) those subsequently established. Students transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements either: (a) those in effect at the time of enrollment at UCI; (b) those subsequently established; or (c) those in effect at UCI when the student first entered a previous, accredited collegiate institution, provided that the student has been continuously enrolled in a collegiate institution and that entry was not more than four years prior to the time of enrollment at UCI. A transfer student who has had a break of enrollment of two con\u00ad secutive semesters or three consecutive quarters (excluding sum\u00ad mer sessions) may follow the requirements in effect at UCI: (a) at the time of enrollment at UCI; (b) those subsequently established; or (c) those in effect at the time of reentry into a previous, accred\u00ad ited collegiate institution, provided that reentry was not more than four years prior to enrollment at UCI.

Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must satisfy the requirement before the begin\u00ad ning of their fourth quarter at UCI. Students who have not sat\u00ad isfied the requirement by that time will be ineligible to enroll for a fourth quarter. Students enrolled in Humanities 20A-B-C-D (Writing for Stu\u00ad dents for Whom English is a Second Language) must enroll in a Subject A course (English and Comparative Literature WR 37, WR 39A, or Humanities lAS/A) immediately after they are authorized to do so. The Subject A requirement may be met after admission by one of the following three options: 1. Passing the Universitywide Subject A Examination given in mid-May (and on subsequent dates) to all entering freshmen admitted for fall quarter, 1999 (see Placement Testing). Transfer students who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement should contact the UCI Composition Program Office ( 420 Humanities Instructional Building); telephone (949) 824-6717. 2. Enrolling in sections of the Humanities Core Course designated \"S/A.\" (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in aS/A section of the Core Course during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a letter grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. Stu\u00ad dents who do not receive a letter grade of C or better in Humanities 1A S/A in fall quarter and who continue to be held for Subject A must enroll in Humanities 1B S/A during the win\u00ad ter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a letter grade of C or better.) 3. Taking English and Comparative Literature WR 37 or WR 39A and receiving a letter grade of at least a C in that course. The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be used to satisfy the Subject A requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the Subject A requirement. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy the Subject A requirement. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree 55 AMERICAN HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS This requirement may be met by one of the following options: 1. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of C or better, or one semester of United States his\u00ad tory and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better. 2.

UCI Requirements UNIT REQUIREMENT Credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work is required. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. GRADE REQUIREMENT A minimum grade average of at least C (2.0) is required (1) over\u00ad all, (2) in all of the courses required for the major program, and (3) in the upper-division courses required for the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors pro\u00ad grams. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT Credit for the last 36 units of work immediately preceding gradua\u00ad tion must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. Exceptions to this rule may. be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to stu\u00ad dents enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. BREADTH REQUIREMENT Among the many possible purposes for breadth requirements, the one that stands out at UCI is that of introducing students to the basic modes of thought that characterize academic disciplines. In order to know ourselves and the world, we need to know first the ways these can and have been known. Thus the breadth require\u00ad ment at UCI requires students to devote a substantial amount of their course work, especially in their first years, to connected series of courses which provide a coherent experience within such areas as the natural and social sciences, humanistic inquiry and the arts, and the nature of symbolic systems. UC IRVINE - 1999-200056 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students Several other aims that UCI regards as especially desirable are consistent with this chief purpose and are embodied to varying degrees in the UCI breadth requirement: to cultivate a historical consciousness of society and culture; to acquaint students with fun\u00ad damental ways of thinking different from their own or that of their gender, class, and culture with a view to expanding their sense of human possibilities and awakening an awareness of the condi\u00ad tioned nature of their own assumptions about the world; to equip students with a broad understanding of the contemporary world and its cultural, political, scientific, and technological problems; to equip students with the skills essential to understanding and grap\u00ad pling with these problems; to establish bridges and to understand relationships between academic disciplines; and to provide stu\u00ad dents with some intellectual experiences which virtually all can be assumed to have had in common and thus to introduce them to what, after all, a university has traditionally been supposed first and foremost to be, an intellectual community. The breadth requirement is a graduation requirement and, with the exception of the lower-division writing requirement, need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, courses are required in each of the following categories: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems VI. Language Other Than English VII. Multicultural Studies and InternationaVGloballssues The specific course combinations and sequences in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. A number of the courses listed are available in more than one academic unit. When a breadth course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the breadth requirement. Students should refer to the actual descrip\u00ad tions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. These course combinations were selected to ensure that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an aca\u00ad demic area, as well as to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. With the exception of categories I and VII, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three quarter courses in philosophy toward breadth categories II, III, IV, V, or VI. Students fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing courses from the list which follows. Students can select from among a vari\u00ad ety of courses, depending upon their area of interest. Some of the course combinations available consist of multiple-quarter courses (such as Chemistry lA-B-C under the Chemistry subsection of \"category II. Natural Sciences\"). Multiple-quarter courses are referred to as being \"sequential,\" meaning that the course work in the earlier courses is prerequisite to the later course work. Students must take each part of a sequential course in alphabetical order (e.g., students must take Chemistry lA before either lB or lC). Sequential courses are separated by hyphens. Other course combi\u00ad nations consist of single-quarter courses (e.g., Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C under the Anthropology subsection of \"category Ill. Social and Behavioral Sciences\") which are related to one another but for which no course in the combination is preparatory to any other course in the combination. Single-quarter course combinations may be taken in any order. Single-quarter courses are separated by com\u00ad mas. Semicolons separate complete course combinations. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to develop\u00ad ing the writing skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this commitment, but the concern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, stu\u00ad dents must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses. Effective fall 1997, students who have not completed the lower\u00ad division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be subject to probation. ESL students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the sev\u00ad enth quarter following the completion of their ESL courses or they will be subject to probation. The third course must be an upper-division writing course, and it must be taken only after the successful completion of the lower\u00ad division requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. English and Comparative Literature WR 39B (Expository Writing) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). 2. English and Comparative Literature WR 37 (Intensive Writing) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). Recommended students only. 3. Two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) beyond satisfaction of the Subject A requirement. NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in a section of the Core Course designated S/ A during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a letter grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. (The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be used to satisfy Subject A.) For these students, the lower-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement may be satisfied only in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course. Students who do not receive a Cor better in Humanities lAS/A in fall quar\u00ad ter and continue to be held for Subject A must enroll in Human\u00ad ities lB S/A during the winter quarter and satisfy the require\u00ad ment by earning a letter grade of C or better. The lower-division writing requirement will be satisfied in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course for these students. 4. Students who complete English and Comparative Literature WR 37 or WR 39B with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division writing requirement one of the following courses in creative writing or nonfiction and journalism: English and Comparative Literature WR 30, WR 31, WR 32, or WR 38. UC IRVINE - 1999-20005. Two quarters of Honors Arts Core Writing (Arts Interdiscipli\u00ad nary HIA-B-C). This option is available to Campuswide Hon\u00ad ors Program students only. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). The require\u00ad ment may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. An upper-division course designated on a list of approved courses in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. NOTE: All courses approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement should have a \"W\" suffix. Students are encouraged to consult the Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the current upper-division writing requirement course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the \"W\" suffix, it does not sat\u00ad isfy the upper-division writing requirement. 2. English and Comparative Literature WR139W. 3. An approved upper-division course in nonfiction and journalism or creative writing. Such courses frequently have special pre\u00ad requisites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division writing requirement. Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the writing requirement should refer to the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations and Procedures section for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course combina\u00ad tion from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Biological Sciences lA-B and one course from 15, 35, 45, 55, 65, or 75 Chemistry: Chemistry lA-B-C and lLB-LC or lLA-LB; H2A-B-C and lLB-LC Earth System Science: Any three courses from Earth System Sci\u00ad ence 10, 15, 20D, three courses Biological Sciences H90, Chemistry H90, Earth System Science H90, 3A-B-C and three quarters of Physics 7 A-B-C-D plus 7LA-LB-LC; three courses from Physics IS, 20A, 20B, 20C, 20D, Earth System Science 10, 14, 15, 20E, 20F, Engineering E5; Physics 17A-B plus one course from 16, IS, 20A, 20B, 20D, Engineering E5 Social Ecology: Environmental Analysis and Design El, E3, E5 III.

Students must demonstrate competency in a language other than English by completing one of the following options: A. College-level course work equivalent to UCI's fourth quarter of study in a language other than English. UCI courses approved to satisfy this requirement are: Chinese 2A East Asian Languages and Literatures 2A Latin 2S Russian 2A Spanish 2A, S2AB, S For information on UCI's prerequisites and course placement policies, consult the School of Humanities, Foreign Language Placement section in this Catalogue. B. Credit for four years of high school study or its equivalent in a single language other than English with a C average or better in the fourth year. C. A score of 4 or S on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination in a language other than English. D. A score of 620 or better on a College Board SAT II examination in a language other than English, with the exception of SAT II: Modem Hebrew for which a score of S40 or better is required. E. Completion of an approved course of study through the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP). Careful planning is required to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled. Check with an EAP counselor at the Center for International Education to determine the programs in countries that fulfill this requirement. F. The equivalent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evaluation. For information on availability of such examinations and testing schedules, consult the Testing Office, Student Services II, (949) 824-6207. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or bet\u00ad ter, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the requirement. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. VII. Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. Students must select one course in multicultural studies and one course on international/global issues from the following lists. In fulfilling category VII, students may use courses which are also being used in fulfillment of other breadth categories. For example, Anthropology 2A simultaneously satisfies category VII-B and a portion of category III. In addition, VII-B may be fulfilled by one quarter's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP). Multicultural Studies (VII-A): African-American 162, 197 Classics Education 104E, 124, 160 English and Comparative Literature CL 9, CL lOS, E 105 Environmental Analysis Studio Art 149 Women's Studies SOA, SOB, SOC, ISO, 160, 161, 162, 163, 197 Studies 171, 173 Chinese 3A-B-C, 100A-B-C, 101A-B-C, 11S, 180 Classics 176 Criminology, Law and Society J191 Dance 80, 81, 90A-B-C, 91A-B-C Drama 40A, and Literatures 3A-B-C, 55, 101A-B-C, 110, 11S, 117, 120, 130, 150, 1SS, 160, 180, 190 UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Economics 148D, 152A, 40C Environmental Analysis and Design El16, El43U Film Studies 160 French 50, lOlA-B-C, 110, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 125, 127, 139, 150, 160 German 50, 100A, 100B, 100C, 101, 102A, 102B, 117, 101C Japanese 3A-B-C, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, 11, 12, 170C, 44, 77, 165A, 175A, 175B School, Departmental, and Major Requirements In addition to the University and UCI requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the Humanities course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Students are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one requirement. Information on specific degree requirements and courses is available in the academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation), and should make certain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major . have been accomplished. Transfer students should read the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. Students should note that with the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate .dean. Add~tional infor\u00ad mation on grading is located in the AcadeiiDc Regulations and Procedures section. Transfer Students: Fulfilling Degree Requirements 59 Minor Programs For certification in a minor, a student must obtain a minimum overall grade point average of at least C (2.0) in all courses . required for the minor program. No more than t\":o courses a~phe? to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. CompletiOn of the mmor IS noted on a student's transcript. (Students are not required to minor in a program in order to graduate from UCI.) Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior yeru:, but no l~~s than six months before the expected day of graduatiOn. Specific deadline dates for filing are established quarterly by each academic unit so that candidates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. These dates vary among academic units. Students should contact their academic counselors for deadline dates. INFORMATION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS: FULFILLING REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE This section provides a guide for transfer students in understanding how their course work from another collegiate institution applies to fulfilling UCI degree requirements. Transfer students .should us~ this information in conjunction with the previous sectiOn, Requue\u00ad ments for a Bachelor's Degree. Transfer students are required to meet university, breadth, school, department, and major require\u00ad ments described in the Catalogue. The courses and descriptions in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer studen~s as ~ guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpo~e I~ their own institutions. No student who has taken a course which IS accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools and which has been mutually determined with a commu\u00ad nity college as being acceptable toward complet~o~ of ~e m_:I breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit m satisfactiOn of the requirement. Transfer students are strongly advised to check with the academic counselor in their prospective major or the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools about courses that may be used to sat\u00ad isfy UCI requirements. Transfer Student~: Completion of the UCI Breadth Requirement Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment by completing either: (a) the current UCI breadt_h require: ment, (b) one of the options listed in the CatalogueRights sectiOn on page 54, or (c) the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum. With the exception of students who complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum, transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must be completed prior to matriculating to UCI. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-le~el courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any tzme during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the l?w~r\u00ad division writing requirement, which must be completed Withm the first three quarters of residency at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1999-200060 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing an approved one-year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division writing requirement. Any student entering UCI with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Subject A requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. Stu\u00ad dents enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Con\u00ad tinuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement is met by (a) taking an approved one-year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, general chemistry, basic physics; or by (b) taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in biological sci\u00ad ences or physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. This requirement is met by taking a year of approved work in any of the following areas: anthropology, economics, geography, linguistics, people and soci\u00ad ety, political science, psychology, social sciences, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take an introductory course followed by a second course in the same area or an introductory course from each of any two areas. Stu\u00ad dents on the quarter system may elect to take an introductory course followed by two courses in one area, or an introductory course followed by a second course in the same area plus an intro\u00ad ductory course from another area. (History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral sci\u00ad ence but rather an area of humanistic inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in one of the fol\u00ad lowing areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English lit\u00ad erature, comparative literature, women's studies, dramatic litera\u00ad ture, or the history of art, dance, or music. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, or logic. VI. Language Other Than English. This requirement is met by (a) completing the third semester or fourth quarter of approved col\u00ad lege-level study in a language other than English; (b) credit for four years of high school study, or its equivalent, in a single lan\u00ad guage other than English with a C average or better in the fourth year; (c) a score of 4 or 5 on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination in a language other than English; (d) a score of 620 or better on a SAT II examination in a language other than English, with the exception of SAT II: Modem Hebrew for which a score of 540 or better is required; (e) completion of an approved course of study in an Education Abroad Program; or (f) the equivalent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evaluation. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the requirement. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. VII. Multicultural Studies and InternationaVGlobal Issues. This requirement is met by completing: one course in multicultural studies and one course on international/global issues. One quarter's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) also satisfies the international/global issues portion of the requirement. Courses satisfying the multicultural requirement specifically address the history, society, and/or culture of one or more minority groups in California and the United States. Courses satisfying the interna\u00ad tional/global requirement focus on significant cultural, economic, geographical, historical, political, and/or sociological aspects of one or more foreign countries. INTERSEGMENTAL GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSFER CURRICULUM California community college transfer students may receive credit for the UCI breadth requirement by completing the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) prior to transfer. The IGETC consists of a series of subject areas and types of courses which, if completed prior to transfer, will satisfy the breadth and general education requirements at any campus of the University of California. Fulfillment of the IGETC does not satisfy the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who do not complete the IGETC prior to transferring to UCI must fulfill the UCI breadth requirement in its entirety. Courses used to fulfill the IGETC must be completed with a grade of C or better. (Courses may also be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis provided Pass is equal to a letter grade of C or better.) Lists of specific approved courses which may be taken in ful\u00ad fillment of the IGETC are available from California community colleges and on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum 1. Language Other Than English: Proficiency equivalent to two years of high school study in the same language. 2. English Communication: One course in English Composition and a second course in Critical Thinking-English Composition. 3. Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning: One course in mathematics or mathematical statistics which has a prerequisite of intermediate algebra. Courses on the application of statistics to particular disciplines are not acceptable. 4. Arts and Humanities: Three courses, at least one in arts and one in humanities. 5. Social and Behavioral Sciences: Three courses in at least two different disciplines. 6. Physical and Biological Sciences: One physical science and one biological science course; one must include a laboratory. Transferability of Credit The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the edu\u00ad cational needs of students who transfer from other California colle\u00ad giate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. UNIT CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The University of California grants unit credit for courses com\u00ad pleted at other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equiv\u00ad alent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI a minimum of 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Community Colleges A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) at a community college toward a University degree. No fur\u00ad ther unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The counselors, with the aid of that college's UC Transfer Course List Agreement (UCTCA), can advise students about California community college courses and units which will transfer to the University. In addition, staff in the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools can advise students about the transferability of courses. UCTCAs for all California community colleges are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. While limi\u00ad tations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institutions. However, see the Residence Requirement in the UCI Requirements section. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in resi\u00ad dence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Exten\u00ad sion courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Transfer Students: Fulfilling Degree Requirements 61 The UCI Student Center is the hub for many campus activities throughout the year including sorority and fraternity Rush, noon concerts on the patio, and presen\u00ad tations by student clubs. The Center houses restaurants, the UCI Bookstore, study rooms, music listening lounges, and more. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the student's academic dean. COURSE CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all UC campuses. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be trans\u00ad ferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, courses from many California community colleges have been reviewed by UCI faculty and approved as acceptable toward meeting lower-division major or breadth requirements. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement may be liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. Many California community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's breadth, school, and departmental major require\u00ad ments may be readily communicated to prospective transfer stu\u00ad dents. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. It is recommended that transfer students complete as much of the lower-division breadth, school, and major requirements as possible prior to trans\u00ad ferring to UCI. Articulation agreements are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools for information on planning a program for transfer. Prospective transfer students with specific questions about course work in their major should contact the respective school or department at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1999-200062 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students Centered in Aldrich Park, Celebrate UC/, the campus' annual open house, features the Wayzgoose Medieval Fair, entertainment, ethnic food, informational presentations, and campus tours. ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning enroll\u00ad ment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be officially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Registration does not become offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid, and the student enrolls in classes with the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments are correct. A quarterly calendar of dates for enrollment and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. This booklet is dis\u00ad tributed at the UCI Student Center to continuing students during the seventh week of each quarter for the ensuing quarter and also may be purchased at the UCI Bookstore. New students receive the booklet by mail. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary authorizations for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seri\u00ad ously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines. Enroll in classes during the published registration period. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obliga\u00ad tions must be satisfied at this time also. NOTE: Late fee payment and/or late enrollment in classes may re\u00ad quire the student to enroll in classes using the Add-Card procedure. TELEPHONE REGISTRATION TELE, UCI's telephone registration system, allows students to enroll in classes from anywhere in the world. Students may add and drop classes, inquire about open sections, change their grading option or units for a variable-unit class, and list their confirmed class schedule. Immediate feedback on the availability of a class and a student's eligibility to enroll is provided; schedule changes may be made during the registration period or the adjustment period. Complete information about TELE is available in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. PAYMENT OF FEES AND ENROLLMENT Registration fees are assessed quarterly and appear on ZOTBills mailed to students by the Campus Billing Services Office. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published registration period are subject to a late service fee. This fee is graduated: $25 through the end of the second week of classes; $50 thereafter. Students who do not enroll in classes during the published registra\u00ad tion period are subject to a late service fee. Between the deadline and the end of the second week of classes, the late service fee is $25 for undergraduate students. Thereafter it increases to $50. The fee is $50 for graduate students after the second week of classes. A signature of the student's dean is required for late enrollment once the quarter begins. The student is subject to both late service fees (either $50 or $100) if fees are not paid to the Cashier's Office and the student does not enroll in classes by the registration deadlines, which are published quarterly in the Schedule of Classes. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, stu\u00ad dents are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the published registration deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. Late registration (payment of fees and/or enrollment in classes) is permitted only in exceptional circumstances with the authorization of the student's dean. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Late services charges may be waived only if the Uni\u00ad versity is responsible for the late transaction. CHANGE OF CLASS ENROLLMENT After officially enrolling with the Registrar, a student may add or drop classes, change sections of a course, change units in a vari\u00ad able unit course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change Card, available from the student's academic counseling office or the Registrar's Office. In the first two weeks of classes, instructors may authorize the use of TELE for adding, dropping, and changing the grade option. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permission of the student's academic dean or, for undecided/ undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limitations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. During the first six weeks of instruction, a student may add classes provided approval is granted by the instructor in charge of the class. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000To change the grading option of a class during the first two weeks of instruction, students must obtain the signature of the instructor in charge. The Change Card must then be submitted to the Regis\u00ad trar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruc\u00ad tion. Changes in the grading option from the third through the tenth week require approval of the instructor and the student's aca\u00ad demic dean. Students may drop classes from the first through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, with the signature of the instructor in charge. After the sixth week of instruction, students may add or drop a class only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and is not sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, and only if dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student, of the class as a whole, or both. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop Card is received in the Registrar's Office. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class they attend. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop Card must be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change Cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. NOTE: Instructors and deans may have earlier deadlines than those mentioned above. Change of Major Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and policies and proce\u00ad dures. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Reduced-Fee Part-Time Study Program Part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree is available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. To take advantage of reduced fees for part-time status, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to eight units or less for graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students enrolled in excess units after the Friday of the third week of instruction are liable for full fees. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students; the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status only for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In addition to all other required fees, students approved for part\u00ad time status pay one-half of the Educational Fee and, if applicable, one-half of the Nonresident Tuition Fee or Professional School Student Fee. Undergraduate petitions are available from academic counselors or the Registrar's Office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Since there are certain restrictions on receiving Enrollment and Other Procedures 63 undergraduate credit for part-time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Under\u00ad graduate Admissions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Financial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section. Additional information is available in the Schedule of Classes. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed deadline; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the student's records and the student will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by each student. Support documents for the acade\u00ad mic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their academic record quarterly. (Student copies of the academic record are avail\u00ad able at the Registrar's Office shortly after the close of each quar\u00ad ter.) Discrepancies in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immediately. After one year, it is assumed that the stu\u00ad dent accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source documents are destroyed. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic record will be released only upon receipt of a signed request from the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $5 per copy. All out\u00ad standing debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (1) if the request is accompa\u00ad nied by a written authorization signed by the student whose tran\u00ad script is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Other tran\u00ad scripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agency such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSD AS) or the American Medical Col\u00ad lege Application Service (AMCAS). When a student orders a transcript to be sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the student to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a tran\u00ad script to be received by another institution or agency. UC IRVINE - 1999-200064 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students Verification of Student Status The Registrar's Office provides verifications of student status. Ver\u00ad ifications may be needed for reference checks, bank loans, applica\u00ad tions for good-student-driver insurance rates, and Social Security payments. There is a $3 fee for each verification, however verifica\u00ad tions for the purpose of student loan deferments are free of charge. For verification purposes, enrollment in 12 units or more in regular sessions is considered full-time status; enrollment in 6.0-11.9 units is considered half-time status; enrollment in 5.9 units or less is considered less than half-time status. Enrollment in eight units is considered full-time status for summer session. Cancellation/Withdrawal Undergraduate students who pay fees for a regular academic quar\u00ad ter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean (or the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students) and the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable (see Fee Refund section); and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal used in determining the percent\u00ad age of fees to be refunded is the date on which the student submits the withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office or to the Curricular Affairs Office. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which enrollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of withdrawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. (See W notation in the Grad\u00ad ing System section.) A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to with\u00ad draw and intends to return within one year should submit both the Cancellation/Withdrawal form and an application for a Leave of Absence. Further information appears in the Research and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies section. New undergraduate students are encouraged to seek advice from their admissions or academic counselor to understand the conse\u00ad quences of withdrawal and their eligibility to return. If an undergraduate student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal notice of with\u00ad drawal is not necessary. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the readmission policy in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time they ceased attending and who have filed read\u00ad mission applications by the deadline. Former UCI students who wish to be readmitted should contact the undergraduate counseling office of the school or program which offers their intended major. Readmission is subject to dean's approval and campus deadlines (August 1 for fall quarter, November 1 for winter quarter, and Feb\u00ad ruary 1 for spring quarter). To apply for readmission, a student must first pay a nonrefundable $40 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office, and then file the Application for Readmission with the Reg\u00ad istrar's Office. Remittance of the $40 Application Fee may be made by bank draft or money order made payable to Regents-UC. New undergraduate students who cancel registration prior to the first day of the quarter must reapply to UCI; they are not eligible to file for readmission as described above. If a student has been academically disqualified from the University or has left the University while on probation or subject to disquali\u00ad fication, the student must apply for readmission. The application, however, is subject to the approval of the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Admission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admis\u00ad sion applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Intercampus Visitor: Undergraduates Only A currently registered UCI undergraduate student in good standing may apply for intercampus visitor status at another campus of the University for one quarter. Forms and instructions are available at the Registrar's Office. California Residence Detailed information about California residence is available in the Catalogues Expenses and Fees section. All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the establishment of California residence (including exceptions pertaining to minors, aliens, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the University of California, Irvine, Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6129. Commencement UCI Commencement ceremonies are held each June for all stu\u00ad dents who graduate any quarter of that academic year. Commence\u00ad ment protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in the spring and also is available from academic counselors. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Commencement Office; telephone (949) 824-6378; World Wide Web: http://www. commencement.uci.edu/. Application for Graduation. In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student must file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Specific deadline dates for filing the application are established quarterly so that candidates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. Students should contact their academic counselor and see the Schedule of Classes for deadline information. Diplomas. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is three to four months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then pick up their diplomas at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to send their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations out\u00ad side the United States. There is a service charge of $5 for certified mail, $10 for registered air mail, payable to Regents-UC. All out\u00ad standing debts due to the University, with the exception of long\u00ad term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning academic regulations applying only to graduate students is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Student Academic Records Student's official academic records are maintained permanently by the Registrar and are used for purposes such as academic advising, scholarship awards, admission to professional or graduate schools, and future employment. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their enroll\u00ad ment and academic records and may do so throughout the acade\u00ad mic year. Students must promptly notify the Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Since each student's current quarter class enrollment is put directly into the academic record system from telephone enrollment or source documents completed by the student, it is extremely impor\u00ad tant for each student to complete these entries or source documents (e.g., Add/Drop/Change Cards) carefully and accurately. Student academic records may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than one year if Academic Senate regulations specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or it will automati\u00ad cally be converted to the grade \"F\" or \"NP\" (under Senate Regula\u00ad tion IR 345). After a student's degree has been certified by the student's dean, the academic record may not be altered except in those cases where a procedural or clerical error on the part of an instructor has occurred. GRADING SYSTEM A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass (equal to grade C-or below) S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so desig\u00ad nated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so des\u00ad ignated by the Committee on Courses or Graduate Council, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately pre\u00ad ceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. The instruc\u00ad tor may replace an NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or may authorize the student to drop the class, which would result in the NR becoming a W). Academic Regulations and Procedures 65 UR-Unauthorized Repeat. A UR notation is recorded for the grade when a student already has a passing grade for a nonre\u00ad peatable course and has repeated the course again. W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's perma\u00ad nent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be disregarded in deter\u00ad mining the student's grade point average and will not be consid\u00ad ered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus and minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. GRADE POINTS AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, I point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit, with the exception of the A+ grade which is assigned 4 points per unit. Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of certain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of baccalaure\u00ad ate credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the following text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course taken for a letter grade times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades, as well as workload credit, are excluded in computing grade point average. Baccalaureate credit counts toward degree requirements and is used to compute the grade point average. Workload credit is used to determine full-time status for financial aid, housing, student loans, and other purposes. For most courses at UCI, baccalaureate credit and workload credit are identical. Courses differing in this credit or \"workload credit only\" courses are identified in the course description. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. No grade may be revised by reexamination or, with the exception of I and IP grades, by com\u00ad pleting additional work. If a student is dissatisfied with a grade, the student should review their work with the instructor and receive an explanation of the grade assigned. A grade may be appealed on any UC IRVINE - 1999-200066 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students reasonable grounds to the instructor, the chair of the department, and the dean of the school. If the matter is not resolved, the student may go for counsel to the Office of the University Ombudsman. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Proce\u00ad dures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. INCOMPLETE GRADES An I or Incomplete grade is assigned to a student by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been temporarily excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for mak\u00ad ing up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. The student should consult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. It is strongly rec\u00ad ommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. Once the work is completed within the time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the counseling office of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one cal\u00ad endar year in which to replace an Incomplete grade. However, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two addi\u00ad tional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assign\u00ad ment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of graduation require\u00ad ments is made are /'s treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. PASS/NOT PASS The Pass/Not Pass option is available to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in computation of the grade point aver\u00ad age which appears on a student's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. Some courses are designated by academic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. Students do not have the option of taking these courses for a letter grade. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the foll(!wing provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. 2. In addition, students may count a total of 12 units of courses des\u00ad ignated Pass/Not Pass Only toward their graduation requirements. ' 3. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-or below, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the stu\u00ad dent's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 4. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a gradu\u00ad ate student must enroll. 5. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made dur\u00ad ing the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the dean of the student's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction of the quarter. 6. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option unless the course is offered on that basis only. SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY GRADES (GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. With the approval of the Graduate Council, cer\u00ad tain graduate courses are graded S/U Only. Also, the grade S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon com\u00ad pletion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provi\u00ad sional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a pro\u00ad visional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the UC IRVINE - 1999-2000course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. The gradeS is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. GRADES IN PROGRESS IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Aca\u00ad demic Senate Committee on Courses or Graduate Council for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the num\u00ad ber of quarter units completed. GRADES NOT REPORTED A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enroll\u00ad ment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. REPETITION OF COURSES With approval from their school or program, undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received or when the course has been approved for repetition. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP (if repeated for a letter grade) was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all additional grades assigned. All courses which were originally taken for a letter grade must be repeated for a letter grade. Courses originally taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis may be repeated for a Pass/Not Pass or for a letter grade if the course is so offered. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. If a student repeats a course for which a passing grade has already been received and the course is not approved as repeatable for credit, the student will receive a UR and no credit will be given. Information regarding the repetition of foreign language courses is available in the School of Humanities section. SATISFACTION OF THE WRITING REQUIREMENT Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Academic Regulations and Procedures 67 I. Students who fail to attain a letter grade of Cor better in Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature WR 37 must repeat the course or enroll in the equivalent. It is recommended that these stu\u00ad dents enroll in WR 39A followed by WR 39B-C to assure com\u00ad pletion of this requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in WR 39C must repeat the course. 2. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in one or both courses of the English and Comparative Literature WR 39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 3. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course after satisfying the Subject A requirement by attaining a grade of Cor better in Humanities 1A S/A, should substitute English and Comparative Literature WR 39C if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the requirement, or Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature WR 39B-C if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of Cor better in Humanities 1A S/A, enroll in Humanities IB S/A and attain a grade of Cor better, but fail to attain a grade of C or better in the writing component of Humanities 1C, should substitute English and Comparative Lit\u00ad erature WR 39C to complete the requirement. 4. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in either Humanities 1A S/A or Humanities IB S/A, should substitute English and Comparative literature WR 39A-B-C to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of Cor better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). See the UCI Requirements section for fur\u00ad ther information. Effective fall 1997, students who have not completed the lower\u00ad division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be subject to probation. ESL students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the sev\u00ad enth quarter following the completion of their ESL courses or they will be subject to probation. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who nor\u00ad mally teaches that course. Detailed procedures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (I) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipu\u00ad late whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as a let\u00ad ter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the exami\u00ad nation, grades and grade points (if applicable) will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. UC IRVINE - 1999-200068 UCI 1999-2000 Information for Admitted Students Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The independent-study option allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a clear relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or simi\u00ad lar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergradu\u00ad ates is limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations, or their equivalent, are obligatory in all under\u00ad graduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, as individu\u00ad ally determined by the Committee on Courses. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quar\u00ad ter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. Special arrangements may be made for disabled students. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Student Copies of Quarterly Grades After each quarter, a complimentary copy of the student's perma\u00ad nent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements completed (Subject A, American History, and American Institutions). Declaration of Major All students are required to declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation) or they will become subject to disqualifi\u00ad cation from further registration in the University. Refer to the Enrollment and Other Procedures section for more information. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of certain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). CLASS LEVEL Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0 45.0 90.0 135 + COURSE LOAD LIMITS 44.9 89.9 134.9 An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units, stu\u00ad dents must obtain the authorization of their dean or, for undecided/ undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Refer to the Reduced-Fee Part-Time Study Program section. ACADEMIC STANDING To remain in good academic standing a student must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic proba\u00ad tion if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on probation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. NORMAL PROGRESS REQUIREMENT Regular undergraduate students will become subject to probation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the Uni\u00ad versity if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaure\u00ad ate degree, which progress includes declaration of a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation). 1. Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units com- pleted at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 12-15 8-11 7 2 24-30 16-23 15 145-150 142-144 141 11 162-165 160-161 159 12 180 2. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed the number of units in the range specified in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (1) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Sub\u00ad ject to Probation\" category under (1) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent or, for undecided/undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Unaffiliated Students or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (1) is subject to disqualification by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent or, for undecided/ undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Unaffiliated Stu\u00ad dents or its designated agent. 3. Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on aca\u00ad demic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (1) are subject to disqualification. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. UC IRVINE - 1999-20004. For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University _with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Entrance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following two circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (4) above: (a) Advanced Placement Examination; (b) con\u00ad current enrollment in college courses while in high school. 6. The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (including baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaure\u00ad ate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offering the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. 7. The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress requirement for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a stu\u00ad dent becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school or, for undecided/undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Unaffili\u00ad ated Students. If the record indicates little probability that the stu\u00ad dent will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enroll\u00ad ment.

If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools to be transferable, do not duplicate other credit granted, and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for a limited number of acceptable gradu\u00ad ate-level courses completed at another institution or through Uni\u00ad versity Extension before enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must submit a formal petition, including an original transcript, after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the student's graduate advisor and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies is required.

Organized Research Units Organized Research Units (ORUs) normally consist of an inter\u00ad departmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of multidisciplinary or interdisci\u00ad plinary research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some OR Us is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. The following ORUs have been established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University. CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE The Cancer Research Institute provides leadership and support for researchers working toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Institute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and directing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from several departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. It provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, viral carcinogenesis, immunology, and basic molecular processes relevant to cancer. The Cancer Research Institute serves as the basic science arm of UCI's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehen\u00ad sive cancer center. Other units of the center include the Chao Fam\u00ad ily Clinical Cancer Research Center and the Cancer Surveillance Program of Orange County. CENTER FOR THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY The Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory (CNLM), founded at UCI in 1983, is a multidisciplinary research institute that fosters and supports collaborative research on the brain processes underlying learning and memory. CNLM's research teams consist of faculty, professional and postgraduate researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and visiting scholars. They investigate the formation, maintenance, and retrieval of memory at several levels of analysis-from studies of molecular and cellular processes in the brain to studies of the effects of drugs and hor\u00ad mones on memory in animal and human subjects. Current research projects include investigations of the role of spe\u00ad cific genes in memory formation, how neurons organize and com\u00ad municate to enable learning and memory acquisition, the way experience alters the structure and organization of the brain, how we retrieve short-and long-term memories, and emotional influ\u00ad ences in memory formation. State-of-the-art techniques, including computer modeling of neural processes and imaging of brain sys\u00ad tem activation, are used. The Center's basic research has important implications for understanding and treating human disorders and diseases of learning and memory. CNLM organizes seminars and colloquia throughout the year, as well as periodic workshops and international conferences for the neuroscience community. In addition, it sponsors programs for local schools and the general public, including a lecture series on health issues related to brain and memory. CNLM members include faculty from the UCI Departments of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cognitive Sciences, Pharmacology, and Physics and Astronomy, as well as faculty from several other UC campuses and the University of Southern California. CNLM is located in the Bonney and Qureshey Research Laboratories of the Herklotz Research Facility. CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ORGANIZATIONS The Center for Research on Information Technology and Organiza\u00ad tions (CRITO) is a multidisciplinary Organized Research Unit that conducts theoretical and empirical research in the field of informa\u00ad tion technology (IT). CRITO focuses on the management, use and impact of IT in the emerging global, competitive marketplace and on the policy issues raised by its use. Under its umbrella, CRITO researchers pursue three programs of study: organizational implica\u00ad tions of information technology, management of information tech\u00ad nology, and technology policy and societal issues. Faculty from the Graduate School of Management (GSM), the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS), the School of Social Sciences, and the Department of Education conduct research through the unit. There are approximately IS faculty asso\u00ad ciates and 20-30 students involved in research administered by CRITO. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000CRITO was recently designated by the National Science Founda\u00ad tion (NSF) as one of six Industry-University Information Technol\u00ad ogy Research Centers in the United States. Though there are more than 50 NSF Research Centers across the country, including the six focusing on information and technology, CRITO is the only one of the national centers to focus on the social and economic impact of information technology. The new NSF center brings together nationally prominent UCI fac\u00ad ulty with researchers from participating corporations to study the impact of new information technologies-<:omputers, telecommu\u00ad nications, multimedia, and the Internet-on business, consumers, and the workplace. .. CRITO's research projects also reflect a multidisciplinary nature. Ongoing research includes: nationwide study of computers and educational reform in schools; nationwide study of computers, multimedia, and the Internet in the home; cross-national study of the payoffs from investments in computers; national study of the effects of computers on firm performance in Fortune 1000 compa\u00ad nies; computers and coordination in manufacturing firms; the impacts of computing on work groups; the effects of IT on the restructuring of work, employee performance, and quality of work life; and studies of the global spread of production and use of com\u00ad puters and the Internet. Faculty research also involves the effects of computerization on work in organizations; interorganizational systems; effectiveness of computers in government; computer sup\u00ad port systems for group decision making; informatization of society; and estimation of demand for computing in the U.S. In support of these research programs, CRITO sponsors regular seminars among faculty, students, and members of the business community; cosponsors and hosts talks by nationally and interna\u00ad tionally distinguished researchers in the field; assists in the prepa\u00ad ration of proposals to government, foundations, and industry for extramural funding to support research programs and training of the next generation of researchers; and maintains a working paper series of reports and publications documenting its research. CRITO works with the campus academic units to match students with graduate assistantships and work-study positions that are available in conjunction with CRITO research projects. CRITICAL THEORY INSTITUTE The Critical Theory Institute provides a locus for the conduct and support of collaborative, interdisciplinary research focused on the theoretical underpinnings of such fields as history, literature, phi\u00ad losophy, art, anthropology, and politics. The Institute's principal function is to provide a forum for debate among competing move\u00ad ments in contemporary critical theory so that existing theoretical models can be challenged and refined. The Institute's research con\u00ad sists not only of the application of theory to data but also of self\u00ad reflexive investigation of theoretical presuppositions in order to produce alternative theoretical constructs and strategies. The Institute investigates problems according to three-year research programs, which are concluded with the publication of results. A recently completed research project of the Institute con\u00ad cerns the interest in the concept of \"culture\" in various kinds of critical theory and cultural study in recent years. The results of this research project have been published as \"Culture\" and the Prob\u00ad lem of the Disciplines, edited by John Carlos Rowe (Columbia University Press, 1998). The Institute's newest research project, \"The Forces of Globaliza\u00ad tion,\" will investigate four networks contributing to new theories of international and global organization: corporate, cultural, tech\u00ad nological, and environmental. This project began with research contributions from members of the Institute and distinguished visi\u00ad tors to the Institute in 1995 and will be completed in 1999. Research 81 The Institute organizes colloquia, lectures, seminars, and work\u00ad shops in which leading theorists from the United States and abroad participate in its research projects. It also sponsors the annual Wellek Library Lectures in which a leading theorist gives a series of lectures on a topic of importance in critical theory. DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CENTER The Developmental Biology Center (DBC) provides focus and sup\u00ad port for research in developmental biology in several departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. The research activities are concerned with identifying the activities of cells that convert the fertilized egg into a fully formed and func\u00ad tioning organism. DBC investigators are studying the processes of cell division, migration, and differentiation at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels using a variety of experimental organ\u00ad isms, as well as human material. DBC manages shared facilities for confocal microscopy, computer-based image processing and analysis, flow cytometry and single-cell microinjection. These facilities are part of the Optical Biology Shared Resource Facility of UCI's National Cancer Institute-designated Chao Family Com\u00ad prehensive Cancer Center. Two National Institutes of Health training grants administered by DBC, one in developmental mechanisms underlying congenital defects and one in developmental neurobiology, provide support for both graduate students and postdoctoral investigators. DBC sponsors regular seminars; organizes local, national, and international conferences; and hosts visiting scientists for collabo\u00ad rative research. The results of the work will contribute to the understanding of normal development, growth control, and the regeneration of body parts as well as abnormalities that lead to birth defects, cancer, and nervous-system malfunction in the human body. Additional information is available on the World Wide Web at http://mamba.bio.uci.edu/-pjbryant/dbc/index.htm. INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN AGING AND DEMENTIA The goal of the Institute is to mobilize and unify University resources to discover meaningful ways to prevent decline in brain function with aging prior to its inception and to reverse loss of function once it has occurred. The elusive, yet attainable goal of \"successful aging,\" maintaining functionality in one's later years, is one of the great challenges facing the nation. While many indi\u00ad viduals continue to maintain and even improve their intellectual and cognitive skills, others suffer a serious and seemingly irre\u00ad versible loss of cognitive function and develop dementias, most commonly Alzheimer's disease. The Institute is a fully integrated basic science/clinical research program that operates: a Dementia Assessment and Treatment Clinic; a Brain Imaging Acquisition/ Analysis Unit; a Tissue Repository for cellular and molecular analysis of the aged and Alzheimer's brain; and a comprehensive database of clinical and research data. Research is multidiscipli\u00ad nary employing the latest techniques in computer science, artificial intelligence, molecular biology, and neuroscience. The Institute also sponsors a specialized educational track in brain aging and dementia for advanced students who wish to develop a career opportunity in an exciting and expanding field. The Institute is the site of a National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a State of California Department of Health Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Faculty from the Departments of Neurobiology and Behavior, Neurology, Radiology, Anatomy and Neurobiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genet\u00ad ics, Cognitive Sciences, Information and Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the School of Social Ecology comprise the Institute's core group of investigators. UC IRVINE - 1999-200082 UCI 1999-2000 Research and Graduate Studies INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES The goal of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences is to foster research in the application of mathematical models and methods to describe and to better understand human behavior, both individual and social. The Institute sponsors specialized seminars and colloquia, a visiting scholars program, summer workshops, and focused research groups of faculty, students, and visitors, and it maintains a Technical Report Series. Facilities include a computer network for research purposes. Participants include faculty from the Departments of Cognitive Sciences, Economics, Political Sci\u00ad ence, Anthropology, and Sociology in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences; the Department of Mathematics in the School of Physical Sciences; the Department of Philosophy in the School of Humani\u00ad ties; the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the School of Engineering; and the Graduate School of Management. INSTITUTE FOR SURFACE AND INTERFACE SCIENCE The Institute for Surface and Interface Science (ISIS) brings together faculty and researchers in the fields of chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering for collaborative projects aimed at advancing knowledge through interdisciplinary research. ISIS affil\u00ad iates engage in the study of phenomena which occur at the bound\u00ad aries between phases of matter. The properties of surfaces and interfaces control a wide variety of technologically important effects and processes. Among these are corrosion and lubrication incidents, the behavior of semiconductor devices, the fabrication of integrated circuits, and the performance of catalysts used in auto\u00ad mobile exhaust systems and throughout the chemical industry. Research conducted within the Institute is funded by a variety of extramural sources including private industry as well as several federal agencies. Collectively, research funds also help support a number of ISIS-sponsored activities, including a Distinguished Lecturer Program which brings senior scholars from around the world to UCI, visiting fellows programs, postdoctoral fellowships, seminar presentations, student research forums, and workshops. INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), a University of Cali\u00ad fornia Multicampus Research Unit with branches at Irvine, Davis, and Berkeley, was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. A fundamental goal of the Institute is the stimulation of interdisciplinary research on contem\u00ad porary transportation issues. ITS research at UCI involves faculty and students from the Schools of Engineering, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences; the Graduate School of Management; and the Department of Information and Computer Science. The Institute also hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facilitate collaborative research and information exchange, and sponsors \u00b7 conferences and colloquia to disseminate research results. Research at ITS covers a broad spectrum of transportation issues. Current funded research projects at ITS Irvine focus upon: intelli\u00ad gent transportation systems, particularly advanced transportation management systems; activity-based travel demand analysis; plan\u00ad ning and analysis of transportation systems; transportation systems operation and control; artificial intelligence engineering; administra\u00ad tive issues in public transit; and environmental and energy issues. The Institute is part of the University of California Transportation Center, a Federally designated center for transportation research. The Center for Activity Systems Analysis (CASA) within the Insti\u00ad tute supports research directed toward the development of activity\u00ad based approaches to travel behavior analysis. The ITS Advanced Transportation Management Systems (ATMS) Laboratories provide facilities for the teaching, research, and development of intelligent transportation systems. These laboratories form the backbone of the State of California's research initiative in ATMS. The transportation research program at UCI is supported by the ITS Transportation Library at UC Berkeley. In addition, ITS at UCI subscribes to all transportation research journals and offers a vari\u00ad ety of computer-based information retrieval services. The Institute maintains a regular publication series which docu\u00ad ments research conducted within its programs. ITS also is the edi\u00ad torial headquarters of four international journals-Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice; Transportation Research Part B: Methodological; Transportation Research Part C: Emerg\u00ad ing Technologies; and Accident Analysis and Prevention. These journals are received by over 2,000 subscribers worldwide. The Institute works closely with campus academic units to enhance graduate education in the areas of transportation planning, engi\u00ad neering, management, and policy. Courses of study leading to graduate degrees in the Schools of Engineering, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences, and in the Interdisciplinary Program in Trans\u00ad portation Science, are available for students interested in trans\u00ad portation studies. ITS extends its support to a large number of graduate students from these various disciplines, enabling students to enrich their studies by participating in ongoing research. Irvine Research Units Irvine Research Units (IRU) are established on the Irvine campus for the purpose of providing an organizational structure for the conduct of research that is difficult or infeasible to be carried out within the normal school or departmental structure. IRUs normally are established for a period of five years, and may provide the basis for establishment of extramurally supported research centers or Organized Research Units. ADVANCED COMPUTING The IRU in Advanced Computing (known as RUAC) was created with the purpose of providing a common research home for all investigators who use highly complex and advanced computing in theoretical or experimental research. RUAC promotes focused or interdisciplinary research where high-performance computing or computational sciences are the main tool or objeCtive. RUAC has also initiated an Industry/University Consortium Center for Numerical Algorithm Development. Its activities include, but are not limited to: seminars, public lectures, symposia, formal or infor\u00ad mal gatherings, and one-day work group sessions which include industry. Undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and continuing education research opportunities are actively pursued as part of RUAC's activities. ANIMAL VIROLOGY The Program in Animal Virology combines basic science and clini\u00ad cal faculty in the Departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biol\u00ad ogy, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Neurobiology and Behavior in the School of Biological Sciences, and the Depart\u00ad ments of Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Neurology, and Pathology in the College of Medicine in an interactive and collaborative environment united with a com\u00ad mon interest in aspects of animal virology. The program is also an integral part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCI. The major goal of the program is to provide a collaborative resource for the dissemi\u00ad nation of expertise in a number of animal virus systems as models and vectors for the study of molecular aspects of pathogenesis, gene expression, and gene delivery, including laboratory facilities for work with recombinant virus for gene therapy. It also sponsors a seminar series, symposia, and laboratory training for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in animal virology and viral-based gene therapy. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000GLOBAL PEACE AND CONFLICT STUDIES The IRU in Global Peace and Conflict Studies (GPACS), housed in the School of Social Sciences, draws affiliated faculty from the humanities, Social Ecology, and the natural sciences. The goals of GPACS are: (1) to support interdisciplinary research on the sources, modes, interpretation, and management of conflicts among states and peoples; (2) to promote graduate and undergraduate edu\u00ad cation in these areas; and (3) to disseminate the knowledge gener\u00ad ated within the larger scholarly and UCI communities. GPACS research focuses on three themes, each of which is at the core of a cross-disciplinary working group: international environ\u00ad ment, globalization and governance, and security and peace build\u00ad ing. GPACS also awards individual faculty grants and graduate fellowships. In addition, GPACS sponsors a public forum series and specialized research seminars. GPACS publications include an annual student journal and a series of working papers. HEALTH POLICY AND RESEARCH The IRU in Health Policy and Research (HPR) fosters multidisci\u00ad plinary research addressing access to medical care and prevention of illness and injury among special populations in community set\u00ad tings. Research teams of faculty, professional researchers, and stu\u00ad dents from the College of Medicine, Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecology, and the Graduate School of Management uti\u00ad lize the disciplines of medicine, anthropology, law, economics, sociology, and psychology to address important questions in this area. HPR promotes this research through sponsorship of seminars encouraging critical discussion of ongoing or planned research and manuscripts, guest lectureships conducted by nationally distin\u00ad guished researchers and practitioners, and workshops on topics related to HPR's focus. The seminars, lectureships, and workshops are open to faculty, students, government officials, and community members. In addition, HPR assists researchers with the preparation and submission of grant proposals and provides professional administration and management of funded research. HPR's goals are to provide an environment that encourages and facilitates multidisciplinary research; to address important issues related to access to medical care, and illness-and injury-prevention in special populations; to explore interventions and health-policy options that will improve life for these groups; to provide empiri\u00ad cal data to inform policy makers in decisions about health-care ini\u00ad tiatives for special populations; and, to encourage and facilitate collaboration between faculty, students, professionals, and the community in the development of high-impact research. Ongoing streams of research include evaluation of: (1) cancer\u00ad related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among special popula\u00ad tion; (2) culturally appropriate cancer-prevention strategies; (3) pedestrian and vehicle-related injury prevention among children; (4) the effects of insurance status and delivery systems on cancer outcomes; (5) employee health-plan choice and switching behavior under managed competition; and (6) a curriculum integrating pub\u00ad lic health principles with clinical practice in managed care. SOFTWARE Computer software development and maintenance is a major com\u00ad ponent of the county's, state's, and nation's economy. The IRU in Software (IRUS) is focused on enhancing abilities to design, pro\u00ad duce, assess, and maintain diverse types of software through a pro\u00ad gram of applied research and technology partnerships with indus\u00ad try. Technical emphases of IRUS include software architecture, hyperware, and World Wide Web protocols, tools, and standards; software processes, workflow, and process improvement; com\u00ad and extensible systems; distributed object technologies; and mobile code. IRUS faculty are drawn from both the Software and Computing, Organizations, Pol\u00ad icy, and Society (CORPS) groups within the Department of Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science. In support of these objectives IRUS sponsors two monthly techni\u00ad cal interchange meetings and multiple focused technology sym\u00ad posia, workshops, and special events each year. These events attract over 1,000 regional, national, and international participants annually from both academia and industry. Information on IRUS and its activities can be obtained via the World Wide Web at http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/, or by telephone at (949) 824-2260. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs (FRP) are established for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdis\u00ad ciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the develop\u00ad mental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. The following group is recognized as a Focused Research Program. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LABOR STUDIES Twenty faculty and graduate students from the Schools of Humani\u00ad ties, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences who share a strong inter\u00ad est in the interdisciplinary study of labor have created a research niche at UCI to focus on the multifaceted experiences of the work\u00ad ing class. The FRP in Southern California Labor Studies seeks new paradigms for understanding the global changes currently recon\u00ad structing and reshaping the work, community, and culture of work\u00ad ing people, particularly in Southern California. The participants, each with distinction in their respective fields, seek to develop innovative approaches to understanding the forces that modify labor processes and working peoples' lives. Several activities, including a speakers series, seminars, seed grants, and conferences are sponsored by the FRP. GRADUATE EDUCATION With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medi\u00ad cine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies administers graduate education in accordance with aca\u00ad demic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Graduate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for undergraduate education. Information about graduate education at UCI is published here in the UCI General Catalogue and in individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies is prepared to answer questions about admission, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other matters of concern to appli\u00ad cants or graduate students. The Office is located in 120 Adminis\u00ad tration Building; telephone (949) 824-6761; World Wide Web: http://www.rgs.uci.edu/. The University of California recently reaffirmed that a diverse stu\u00ad dent and faculty population is integral to academic excellence and is critical to promoting the lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and perspectives that are essential to advanced scholarly research. The University remains committed to expand outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts. Through the Graduate Diversity Program, steps are taken to increase the participation of UC IRVINE - 1999-200084 UCI 1999-2000 Research and Graduate Studies diverse groups who may be disadvantaged in graduate education in the United States. It is the goal of UCI's Office of Graduate Studies to award fellow\u00ad ships to a diverse group of students. Diversity fellowships for new and continuing graduate students are based on demonstrated scholas\u00ad tic achievement, full-time status, and U.S. citizenship. Although Proposition 209 prohibits selection based on race, gender, ethnic\u00ad ity, religion, or national origin, socioeconomic and educational limitations can be considered. Each academic department identifies those students whose background and life experiences can enhance the level of diversity within the department or discipline. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recognized acade\u00ad mic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is required. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program on the basis of such factors as acad\u00ad emic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, test scores, and examples of previous work. A critical question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be sat\u00ad isfied by a graduate program on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all appli\u00ad cants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Application Procedures HOW TO APPLY The Application for Graduate Admission must be completed either electronically or by using a paper application. The electronic appli\u00ad cation is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.rgs.uci. edu/. A paper application may be obtained by contacting a specific graduate program or the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. The application fee is $40 and is nonrefundable. Payment instruc\u00ad tions are available in both the electronic and paper versions of the application. Need-based application fee waivers are available for domestic students. Detailed instructions for both the electronic and paper applications are included in their respective formats. For additional information or to obtain a paper application, call (949) 824-6761, or send e-mail to ogsfront@ccmail.rgs.uci.edu. WHEN TO APPLY For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assist\u00ad antship awards. Some academic units will accept applications for winter or spring quarter admission for which deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. In order to process applications in time for the applicant to receive full consideration, letters of rec\u00ad ommendation, official transcripts, and test scores must be received before the published deadlines. Some schools and departments have earlier or later deadlines for filing the application. Applicants should consult their prospective department or school for informa\u00ad tion. Telephone numbers for the schools and departments may be obtained by calling (949) 824-6761. Required Supporting Documents LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recommendation forwarded directly to their prospective major department or pro\u00ad gram. Recommendation forms are enclosed in the application packet. Only one set of recommendation letters needs to be submit\u00ad ted in support of an application for admission and fellowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recom\u00ad mendation be completed by professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. GRADUATE RECORD EXAMINATION {GRE) SCORES All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion (GRE) General Test, with the following exceptions: (1) the Graduate School of Management requires that M.B.A. applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) no standardized tests are required of those who seek the Master of Fine Arts degree or the Master of Arts in Teaching. There is no minimum GRE score. Several programs also require, or strongly recommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Subject Test. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. (A computerized version of the GRE is now offered Monday through Saturday at Sylvan Technology Learning Centers.) The standard written GRE is administered five times a year in the United States and in 96 other countries. In addi\u00ad tion, several administrative service tests are given each year in major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE may be obtained from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000. ACADEMIC RECORDS Domestic applicants should request that official transcripts be for\u00ad warded directly to their prospective major department or program. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. University of California transcripts must also be submit\u00ad ted by applicants, with the exception of those who are UCI under\u00ad graduates. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree programs before the intended date of enrollment at UCI and must submit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. FOREIGN ACADEMIC RECORDS Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the prospective major department or program at UCI. Records of academic study from foreign institutions must be official, bearing the signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing institution. Applicants should not send the original of an academic record which cannot be replaced; they should obtain instead properly cer\u00ad tified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original lan\u00ad guage must be submitted with an authorized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject each term or year and the marks or ratings in each subject or examination passed. In all cases the institutional grading scale or other standard of eval\u00ad uation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an official attachment. Official evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evidence of rank in class if available. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000TEST OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE (TOEFL) Applicants whose primary language is not English are required to submit TOEFL scores for admission consideration. However, the TOEFL requirement will be automatically waived for applicants who have received an advanced degree from aU .S. college or university. A computer-based TOEFL test is now available, as well as the paper-based test. Please note that the scales used for scores for the two tests are significantly different. For the paper-based test, a score of 550 or better is required for admission consideration. For the computer-based test, a score of 213 or better is required. (The Graduate School of Management requires a minimum paper-based test score of 600 or 250 for the computer-based test.) The paper-based TOEFL test should be taken at the earliest avail\u00ad able date to allow scores to be reported in time to meet application deadlines. Score results from the computer-based test are available much more quickly. Results of institutional administrations of the TOEFL or test results which are more than two years old are not acceptable. Applicants must ask the Educational Testing Service to forward scores directly to the UCI Office of Research and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies. Information about the TOEFL is available from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA. TEST OF SPOKEN ENGLISH (TSE) All applicants whose primary language is not English and who wish to be considered for a Teaching Assistantship must take the Test of Spoken English (TSE) and pass with a score of 50 or above. The TSE is given six times during the year at TOEFL test centers around the world. Information may be obtained by writing to the Test of Spoken English, P.O. Box 6157, Princeton, NJ 08541-6157, USA. The TSE is given at UCI. SPECIAL NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS Foreign applicants are required to certify that they possess suffi\u00ad cient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the first year of their studies at UCI. A Foreign Applicant Ques\u00ad tionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon admission to graduate study. The required finan\u00ad cial verification must be provided before visa forms can be issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. The official notification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registration for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter. Information on registration dates and procedures will be mailed to new appli\u00ad cants prior to the registration cycle. If any applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quarter, the Office of Research and Graduate Studies must be noti\u00ad fied in writing. After formal admission has been offered, a request for deferral must be approved by the academic unit. Limited Status University of California academic regulations provide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two purposes: (1) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses; or (2) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a graduate degree. The Graduate Education 85 Researchers in UCI's new Virtual Reality Laboratory, directed by Professor Michael D'Zmura (right), use VR gloves and stereoscopic head-mounted displays for exploring simulated environments. general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admission to a UCI graduate degree pro\u00ad gram at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate standing, admission is offered by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the rec\u00ad ommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Graduate courses taken while in Limited Status ordinarily qualify for transfer credit toward advanced degree requirements, but will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admitted. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed graduate advisor or director of gradu\u00ad ate studies. The graduate advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitor\u00ad ing the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The graduate advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic policies of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, approving study lists, and evaluating acade\u00ad mic petitions. In many academic units the graduate advisor is instrumental in the nomination of students for fellowship support, the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appoint\u00ad ments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an associate dean for graduate studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both graduate advisors and deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guid\u00ad ance; however, student academic petitions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. UC IRVINE - 1999-200086 UCI 1999-2000 Research and Graduate Studies Academic Policies The academic policies described here apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education creden\u00ad tials. Other regulations and procedures are covered in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections, and in the description of each graduate program. SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Coun\u00ad cil, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic ses\u00ad sion (unless on an approved leave of absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, upon petition, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfac\u00ad tory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment such as Reader, Grad\u00ad uate Student Researcher, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. GRADING With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfac\u00ad tory or Unsatisfactory (Stu). With \"the approval of the Graduate Council certain graduate courses are graded Stu only. A grade of S is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program and may not be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incom\u00ad plete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment but stricter lim\u00ad its may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change-of-grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript notation must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F or NP which will remain permanently upon the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point aver\u00ad age for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations section. ACADEMIC DISQUALIFICATION After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the fac\u00ad ulty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet acade\u00ad mic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Dean of Graduate Studies ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to sub\u00ad mit other information or comments in writing, or to request a sec\u00ad ond review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of Graduate Studies, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualifica\u00ad tion, the student may appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies only on the basis of procedural error. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an acad\u00ad emic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one acade\u00ad mic quarter of residence may be earned by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two six-week sum\u00ad mer sessions, or four units of credit in an eight-or ten-week sum\u00ad mer session. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecu\u00ad tive sessions. ENROLLMENT POLICY Full-time academic enrollment is expected of graduate students at the University of California. Study for the Ph.D. requires a full-time commitment from the doctoral student. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate aca\u00ad demic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses UC IRVINE - 1999-2000with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recognizes the legiti\u00ad mate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to providing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part-time students wherever good edu\u00ad cational reasons exist for so doing. In general, part-time status is available in master's and credential programs where part-time study has been judged academically feasible by faculty and approved by the Graduate Council. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less. Within the guidelines and limitations on the applica\u00ad tion form available in the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, graduate students may petition for part-time status and, if the peti\u00ad tion is approved, shall pay the full University Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee,. and if applica\u00ad ble, one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee and one-half the Profes\u00ad sional School Student Fee. CONTINUOUS REGISTRATION A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular academic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dis\u00ad sertation. Enrollment is not official until all required fees have been paid and the student has enrolled in classes. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of Califor\u00ad nia for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official leave of absence has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, a student who does not register by the final deadline for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, -and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resum\u00ad ing graduate study in the University, a former student must suc\u00ad cessfully apply for readmission. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quar\u00ad ter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be con\u00ad ferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a leave of absence. If the leave is approved, the stu\u00ad dent remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. LEAVE OF ABSENCE A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a leave of absence. A leave of absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. Graduate Education 87 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a Univer\u00ad sity fellowship, research grant, or financial aid program, and may not hold an academic appointment or comparable Univer\u00ad sity employment. During a period of leave, a student may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn acade\u00ad mic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institu\u00ad tion approved in advance by the Dean of Graduate Studies). University resources and facilities, including housing, are ordi\u00ad narily unavailable to students on leave. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic ses\u00ad sion following the expiration of leave will lose graduate stand\u00ad ing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. READMISSION A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Admission with a $40 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Graduate Studies may grant read\u00ad mission when recommended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candi\u00ad dacy. A readmitted student must register and then .be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the sec\u00ad ond quarter following readmission. INTERCAMPUS EXCHANGE PROGRAM A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one quarter of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the respectiv\u00b7e deans of graduate studies is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participating student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the Uni\u00ad versity in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus after the term has ended. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties. TRANSFERS OF CREDIT At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work com\u00ad pleted at another institution or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count UC IRVINE - 1999-200088 UCI 1999-2000 Research and Graduate Studies toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another graduate division of the University of California. After enrollment, the stu\u00ad dent must initiate a formal petition for such credit and submit an original transcript. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a leave of absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the depart\u00ad mental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assigned. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preceding UCI summer sessions, provided that the formal date of admission pre\u00ad cedes summer session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI summer sessions. Graduate Degrees MASTER'S DEGREES The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quar\u00ad ter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree nor\u00ad mally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the mini\u00ad mums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific pro\u00ad gram for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of the Arts (M.F.A. in Dance, Drama, Music, or Studio Art) ) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful com\u00ad pletion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional devel\u00ad opment. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including summer session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) degrees are awarded by the School of Social Ecology upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in contempo\u00ad rary methods of planning and policy analysis. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate criti\u00ad cal judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time residence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full\u00ad time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary exami\u00ad nation on the student's mastery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrating a high level of schol\u00ad arship on this examination and after further study, the student will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to for\u00ad mal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when quali\u00ad fying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the academic unit on behalf of the Graduate Council. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form I) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon pay\u00ad ment of the $50 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the academic unit chair (on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guid\u00ad ance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION DEGREE The Doctor of Education (Ed. D.) is awarded by UCI in conjunction with the School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles. Refer to the Department of Education section of this Cat\u00ad alogue for more information. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000THESES AND DISSERTATIONS Candidates for the Ph.D., Ed.D., and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a dissertation or thesis in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the dissertation or thesis ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the academic unit, on behalf of the Graduate Council, two copies of the dissertation or thesis must be filed for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the Uni\u00ad versity's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. A thesis and dissertation manuscript preparation manual is available for sale in the UCI Bookstore, in the Library for photocopying, and on the World Wide Web at http://www.lib.uci.edu/rrsc/tdmanual.html. Dissertations and theses must be filed by the deadline published in the quarterly Schedule of Classes in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Those students who complete requirements and submit theses/dis\u00ad sertations after the end of the tenth week of classes and prior to the start of the subsequent quarter will earn a degree for the following quarter, but will not be required to pay fees for that quarter. Please note that in order to avoid payment of fees, manuscripts, all forms, and degree paperwork must be submitted prior to the first day of the quarter in which the degree is to be earned. THE FILING FEE Under certain circumstances, a student who has advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for a graduate degree may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of registration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student ser\u00ad vice for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registra\u00ad tion. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following read\u00ad mission and will be accepted immediately following a leave of absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for pay\u00ad ment of the Filing Fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quarter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the student must subse\u00ad quently register and pay all applicable fees. NONRESIDENT TUITION Following advancement to candidacy, doctoral students who are not California residents will have their Nonresident Tuition Fee reduced by 75 percent for a period of up to three years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after receiv\u00ad ing the reduced fee for three years will be charged the full Nonres\u00ad ident Tuition Fee that is in effect at that time. CONFERRAL OF GRADUATE DEGREES Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies. The student should consult the departmental graduate advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. Graduate Education 89 Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is approximately six months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate stu\u00ad dents at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants\u00ad in-aid, and student loans. All graduate students are encouraged to submit a financial aid application each year to access state and federal grants and loans. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is available in the Office of Graduate Studies and the Financial Aid Office after Janu\u00ad ary 1, with a deadline of March 2 each year. The Financial Aid sec\u00ad tion in this Catalogue and the Financial Aid Handbook, available from the Financial Aid Office, contain information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fel\u00ad lowship should contact the Graduate Advisor for their program. The awarding of fellowships for the following academic year begins in the winter quarter. UCI subscribes to the agreement of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards of financial support are given until April 15 to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universi\u00ad ties may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment without first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents', UCI Chancellor's Fellowships, to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philoso\u00ad phy, Doctor of Education, or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards may include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not residents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supple\u00ad mented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the academic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. A graduate assis\u00ad tant who is not a California resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate Diversity Program, a number of diversity fellowships and assistantships are awarded to entering and continu\u00ad ing graduate students who may be disadvantaged in higher educa\u00ad tion in the United States. Departments nominate candidates on the basis of their merit and contribution to the diversity of the depart\u00ad ment or discipline. Individuals from diverse cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply to UCI's graduate programs. In conformance with State law, applicants may not be given preferential treatment on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or national origin.

Special Programs of Study CONCENTRATION IN MEDIEVAL STUDIES The concentration in Medieval Studies allows undergraduate stu\u00ad dents in the Schools of the Arts and Humanities to augment their major by completing a coherent program of courses in the area of medieval studies. See the School of Humanities section for addi\u00ad tional information. MINOR IN DIGITAL ARTS The Minor in Digital Arts is geared toward students with computer skills who want a grounding in the arts. This program allows stu\u00ad dents to acquire a working knowledge of digital imaging and related technological skills within an arts context. See page 92 for additional information. MINOR IN RELIGIOUS STUDIES The interdisciplinary minor in Religious Studies focuses on the comparative study of religions in various cultural settings around the world. The curriculum seeks to provide a wide-ranging aca\u00ad demic understanding and knowledge of the religious experience in society through study in the Schools of Humanities, Social Sci\u00ad ence, Social Ecology, and the Arts. See the Interdisciplinary Stud\u00ad ies section for additional information. CAMPUSWIDE HONORS PROGRAM The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www. honors.uci.edu/-honors. EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM Upper-division, and in some cases graduate, students have the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in coop\u00ad eration with host universities and colleges throughout the world. See the Education Abroad Program section for additional information. 3-2 PROGRAM WITH THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT Outstanding Arts majors who are interested in a career in arts man\u00ad agement may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this pro\u00ad gram early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement section for further information. Honors Students who have distinguished themselves academically will be considered for honors at graduation. General criteria are that stu\u00ad dents must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a Uni\u00ad versity of California campus and must have a grade point average of 3.0 or better. More specific criteria include, but are not limited to, cumulative grade point average in the major, curriculum breadth, and extracurricular efforts such as service to the major or the School, and creative/artistic activities; additional information is available from the individual departments. In keeping with the Academic Senate Resolution no more than 12 percent of the gradu\u00ad ating seniors may receive honors. Other important factors are con\u00ad sidered (see page 50). ArtsBridge Program Among the first of its kind in the nation, the UCI ArtsBridge pro\u00ad gram provides scholarships of up to $1,000 per quarter and hands\u00ad on opportunities for talented, energetic UCI students to become \"artists-in-residence,\" bringing arts education to schools and other community venues. Linking with a range of subjects in the K-12 curriculum, ArtsBridge reestablishes art programs in elementary and secondary schools where arts education has been greatly reduced or eliminated. UCI student-scholars bring drama produc\u00ad tions, instrumental workshops, musical theatre, photography, paint\u00ad ing, dance, and storytelling classes to local schools as well as to UC IRVINE - 1999-2000other community-based institutions such as libraries and hospitals. The program also serves to cultivate an appreciation for the value of arts in society and to develop the creative and analytical skills of both the artist-teachers and the students. The program provides a unique opportunity for students to augment and diversify their learning experience outside the classroom, as well as to prepare them for a job market that increasingly requires the creativity of artists. The ArtsBridge program is open to all majors and minors in the School of the Arts, by application and/or audition. Scholarships The School of the Arts has some scholarship monies available to incoming and to continuing students on both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments. Graduate Program The primary endeavor of the School of the Arts is the creative act. Research activities are pursued both as an end in themselves and as a source that can inform both performance and the studio experi\u00ad ence. The intellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and performance. The aim of the M.F.A. programs in Dance, Drama, Music, and Studio Art is, thus, to produce artists literate in both traditional and digital media who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, disciplined, and capable of integrating existing knowledge into creative projects. The UCI-UCSD joint doctoral program in Drama and Theatre provides opportunity for significant crossover research and teaching between the two campuses in a wide range of areas in drama and the theatre. It is the strong belief of the UCI School of the Arts that intellectual integrity and creative excellence cannot exist without each other. ADMISSION TO THE PROGRAM Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordi\u00ad narily must be completed by March 1 for all the Master of Fine Arts degrees and January 15 for the doctoral degree, as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of the Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for auditions, inter\u00ad views, and the submission of portfolios, compositions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for schol\u00ad arships and fellowships should do so by January 15, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 92 UCI 1999-2000 School of the Arts Aid Office. The School of the Arts has a modest number of teach\u00ad ing assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are auto\u00ad matically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following aca\u00ad demic year. Upon admission to the program the student is assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of under\u00ad graduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if full benefit from graduate study is to be derived. Arts Interdisciplinary 101 Mesa Arts Building; (949) 824-6646 Stephen Barker, Director Faculty Stephen Barker, Ph.D. University of Arizona, Director of Arts Interdiscipli\u00ad nary and Professor of Drama The program in Arts Interdisciplinary is designed for undergradu\u00ad ate students who wish to investigate particular issues in specific disciplines in and beyond the arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the his\u00ad tory, theory, and criticism of the arts in the School's various departments and their relations to other disciplines. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of the Direc\u00ad tor or an appropriate advisor. Because the program is designed for students with a strong sense of personal direction and a desire for an academic appreciation of the arts, students wishing to enter the program must submit a statement of purpose to the Director prior to the quarter in which they intend to declare their major. Admis\u00ad sion to the program is based upon the statement of purpose and upon the student's prior record of high academic performance. The program leads to a B.A. degree in Arts Interdisciplinary. The University's Education Abroad Program may be of particular interest to the Arts Interdisciplinary major. Centers emphasizing study in the history, theory, and criticism of the arts are located in Vienna, Austria (music, art), Copenhagen, Denmark (medieval studies), Paris, France (French critical thought and film criticism), Gottingen, Germany (music, archaeology), and Bologna, Italy (music, art, drama). Arts courses also are part of the general cur\u00ad riculum in other study centers in France, Hungary, Spain, Israel, and Sweden, in addition to arts courses in English-language study centers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, Egypt, and India. MINOR IN DIGITAL ARTS The minor in Digital Arts is geared toward students with computer skills who want a grounding in the arts. This program allows stu\u00ad dents to acquire a working knowledge of digital imaging and related technological skills within an arts context. It provides the tools necessary to understand the basic aesthetic components of the new digital media, relating digital arts to traditional art forms. These tools range from a basic understanding of \"art\" to sophisti\u00ad cated applications of state-of-the-art computer software, in various forms of art production including CD-ROM, digital video and pho\u00ad tography, website and other network applications, installations, and others. For entry into the minor, students must show ability to use e-mail, surf the net, and use productivity tools such as word processing or spreadsheets. It is highly recommended that students in the minor have their own computer. Additional information is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.arts.uci.edu/saffairs/.

The program focuses on studio experi\u00ad ence in the techniques of classical ballet, modem dance, jazz, tap, and selected ethnic dance forms. Theoretical studies include his\u00ad tory; philosophy, aesthetics, and criticism; Laban studies; dance training methods; and dance science. The objective of studio work is to develop kinesthetic resources, precision, flexibility, creativity, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive dancer. The techniques of classical ballet, modem dance, and jazz constitute crafts and styles for the dancer that serve not only as a basis for the training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. The theoretical, historical, and scientific courses are designed both to broaden the perspective of those students whose first interest is performance or choreography, and to provide a foundation for those students who plan to pursue careers in the academic, scien\u00ad tific, or administrative fields of dance. The dance archives in the UCI Library Special Collections offer a rich source of research materials which enhance the Dance program. Among other special holdings, the archives include the extensive Ruth Clark Lert collection of dance books, journals, photographs, original costume sketches, and memorabilia of dance in Europe and the United States from pre-World War I to the present. CAREERS FOR THE DANCE MAJOR Careers in dance require excellent training and extraordinary disci\u00ad pline, tenacity, and dedication. Graduates of the Department have an excellent record of placement in the many fields of dance. Some have become professional dancers in ballet companies (including the San Francisco, Frankfurt, and Tanz-Forum companies); in modem dance companies (including the Lim6n West Dance Project, MOMIX, and Martha Graham Dance Ensemble); in musicals (including tour\u00ad ing companies of Phantom of the Opera, Carousel, and off-Broad\u00ad way, Anything Goes); and in films, television, and theatre. In addition to training for professional dance performance and choreography, the major in dance serves as a basis for graduate study or job opportunities in fields such as dance history, dance sci\u00ad ence, dance pedagogy, dance reconstruction, dance criticism, and dance video. Related fields, such as arts administration, law in rela\u00ad tion to the arts, arts therapies, design and production, and music also offer positions for graduates. Students who are interested in a career in physical therapy or dance science will find a major in Dance, with related course work in chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics, to be excellent preparation for further study. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 94 UCI 1999-2000 School of the Arts THE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) is designed for those who wish to obtain a broad undergraduate background as preparation for careers or graduate work and related fields. It offers students a dance edu\u00ad cation that stresses performance and choreography, and, at the same time, intellectual depth and scope. In addition to the core, 12 units of elective Dance courses are required. The remaining elective units required for graduation may be chosen from Dance or other disciplines in relation to a student's individual interest. While the program of study in Dance stresses technical proficiency and aca\u00ad demic understanding in dance, the B.A. degree program also enables students to pursue elective subjects in their special areas of interest in other academic disciplines. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree program with special\u00ad izations in Performance and Choreography, is designed for students who wish to prepare intensively for careers in those areas. The courses required in addition to the core are primarily in Dance. The B.F.A. program allows for a few free electives in other areas. Admission to the B.F.A. program with a specialization in Choreog\u00ad raphy is by faculty approval only. The B.F.A. program with a specialization in Performance does not require additional faculty approval beyond the required audition for admission to the Dance major; students should declare their intention to pursue this specialization during spring quarter of their sophomore year. Proficiency Levels In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to UCI, applicants must demonstrate technical/creative promise. The Department holds annual entrance auditions for potential freshmen and transfer students during winter quarter prior to the fall quarter when entrance is anticipated. First-year students wishing to major in Dance must be at technique level II in at least one of the three major genres (ballet, modem, jazz). Placement auditions for admitted students are held during Welcome Week to determine levels of technical ability for placement in courses. It is suggested that transfer students wishing to pursue a B.A. degree in Dance complete, in addition to their breadth require\u00ad ments, one course in choreography, two courses in dance tech\u00ad nique, and one course in music for dancers prior to transfer to UCI. Previously admitted majors who wish to obtain a B.F.A. degree must notify the School of the Arts Student Affairs Office during the spring quarter of their sophomore year. Admission to the B.F.A. Choreogra\u00ad phy specialization requires the submission of an application which may be obtained from the undergraduate advisor in Dance. Students applying for this specialization must have completed or be in the process of completing Dance 60A-B-C. Transfer students wishing to pursue the B.F.A. degree must declare their intention in writing at the time of their entrance audition and demonstrate technique and/or choreography levels appropriate to their year. It is suggested that transfer students complete, in addition to their breadth requirements, one course in choreography, two courses in dance technique, one course in music for dancers, and one course in dance performance prior to transfer to UCI. Students deficient in level of performance or academic preparation should be prepared to extend their studies beyond the normal four\u00ad year program in order to meet the requirements for graduation.

California State University, Long Beach, Lecturer in Drama (costume design) The program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Drama combines broad liberal study and comprehensive training in several subdisci\u00ad plines of drama. Each Drama major studies and practices in each of several mutually related areas of the theatre: performance, liter\u00ad ature, history, criticism, design and stage management, and produc\u00ad tion. The curriculum is structured to relate studio practices, techni\u00ad cal resources, and production techniques to the development of dramatic literature and current critical theory. The program is designed for students who, while not necessarily planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama, as well as for stu\u00ad dents preparing to work professionally in the theatre, often after more specialized training at the graduate level. CAREERS FOR THE DRAMA MAJOR A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employ\u00ad ment in theatre or film. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and television. They serve as artistic directors, designers, art directors, business man\u00ad agers, and performers at more than 100 theatre companies, and as faculty at more than 75 institutions of higher learning. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts management, advertis\u00ad ing, and teaching; others pursue further study at UCI or elsewhere. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements for the Major One year survey in the development of dramatic literature (Drama 40A, B, C); one year in acting (Drama 30A-B-C); three courses in design (Drama 50A, B, C); an introductory course in production theory (Drama 10); one year in the development of theatre (Drama 120A, B, C); two upper-division courses in dramatic literature; . three upper-division courses in addition to the two in dramatic lit\u00ad erature mentioned above (these may be in studio work and/or dra\u00ad matic literature, playwriting, and criticism); two quarters in dance (these courses may be taken Pass/Not Pass); eight units of theatre production (Drama 101) of which four units must be completed during the first year of residence at UCI. Students are required to take Drama 40A, B, C in their sophomore year, after completion of the lower-division writing requirement.

The eligibility requirements for junior-level transfer students are: (1) one year in good standing as a UCI Drama major; (2) comple\u00ad tion of Drama 130A-B at UCI; (3) honors students must possess UC IRVINE - 1999-2000and maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.2, with a GPA of 3.4 or higher in all acting courses; (4) completed performance in at least one official Drama at UCI production (including mainstage, stage 2, stage 3, workshop, or cabaret); (5) completion of four out of eight units of Drama 101; and (6) completion of eligibility form. A student's audition will determine final admission to the Honors in Acting program. Only truly exceptional students, no more than 10 to 20 percent of those eligible, will be admitted. The Honors auditions, for eligible candidates only, are held at the end of fall quarter and by special arrangement. Auditions will consist of a standard presentation. Honors in Acting Program students receive: (1) the \"Honors in Acting\" notation on their official transcript; (2) nomination and recommendation for national University/Resident Theatre Associa\u00ad tion (U/RTA) auditions; (3) eligibility, on a space available basis, for South Coast Repertory Theatre internships, currently available only to M.F.A. students; (4) eligibility to audition at UCI-screened Shakespearean Festivals; and (5) eligibility to audition for the Santley Showcase Productions. The Santley Showcase is a UCI-sponsored professional showcase production presented annually in New York and Los Angeles for casting directors, agents, directors, and producers. All travel and production funds are provided from the Santley bequest. Honors in Acting status does not guarantee final selection for the Santley Showcase, but only Honors in Acting students, third-year M.F.A. students, and alumni are eligible to audition for this presentation. Honors in Directing The Honors in Directing Program provides the opportunity for Drama majors to concentrate on the study and practice of stage direction. Honors in Directing students study basic and advanced directing techniques, participate in the Directing Laboratory with graduate Directing students, take a course in directorial themes and/or the history of directing, and direct two full plays in the Drama Workshop series. Honors students also have the opportunity to receive credit as the assistant director of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Department show; as a production internship with a professional theatre company; or for production/direction responsibility with the Playwright's Workshop. Admission to the Honors in Directing Program is competitive. Candidates must first complete Drama 170 (Directing) with a grade of B or higher, which qualifies them to enroll in Drama 185 (Advanced Directing). Candidates must apply, as a director, for Drama 198 (Drama Workshop) by submitting a proposal to direct a play in the Drama Workshop series. If the proposal is accepted, the candidate must declare to the Head of Directing that the production is to be counted as an audition for admission to the Honors in Directing Program. A committee of three Drama faculty members, including the Head of Directing, will then see and evaluate the pro\u00ad duction for clarity of interpretation, unity of style, strength of act\u00ad ing, and ensemble performance, and will examine the candidate's self-evaluation and the evaluations of the director by members of the cast. The Head of Directing will inform the candidate of the committee's decision as to whether or not the candidate is admitted to the Honors Program. Undergraduate Drama majors can be admitted into the program as early as the winter quarter of their freshman year but no later than the spring quarter of their junior year. Students may be admitted to the program retroactively if all the requirements for Directing Honors have been met by their final year, but only if a faculty committee of three has seen their workshops and agrees to admit the candidate. To achieve the Honors in Directing distinction, students must ful\u00ad fill all the courses required of the regular Drama major, with an Drama 99 overall GPA of 3.2 or higher. In addition, students must complete the following courses with a GPA of 3.4 or higher: 1. Drama 170 (Directing). This course is taught each year in the fall quarter only. 2. Two courses in Drama 185 (Advanced Directing). Drama 185 is offered annually in winter quarter and sometimes in spring quar\u00ad ter. In this course, undergraduate Directing students present work in the Directing Laboratory along with graduate Directing students. 3. Two Drama Workshops, one of which must be taken as Drama 198 (Drama Workshop) with the candidate serving as director. The candidate must stage a second Drama Workshop as Drama 199 (Projects in Theater), for which a letter grade is earned. 4. Four additional units to be satisfied by any of the following: Drama 199 (as a summer internship, approved by the Head of Directing, with the candidate serving a professional theatre com\u00ad pany as director, assistant director, or production assistant; Drama 199 (as a production/directing project for Playwright's Workshop); Drama 100 (as assistant director to a faculty direc\u00ad tor of a Stage 1 production); or Drama 199 (as assistant director to a graduate director's thesis production). Honors candidates meet with the Head of Directing at the begin\u00ad ning of every quarter to evaluate their progress and to check that all grade and course requirements are being satisfied. Successful graduating seniors will receive the \"Honors in Directing\" notation on their official transcript. NOTE: All of the above courses are open to all students even though they may not qualify for the Honors Program. Honors in Music Theatre Program The Honors in Music Theatre Program is a unique series of courses which provide advanced training in scene study, song interpreta\u00ad tion, dance, voice, acting, audition technique, and study in the his\u00ad tory of the American musical. Performance experiences vary from fully staged musicals to intimate revues. Honors students are intro\u00ad duced to Broadway performance techniques through the Advanced Music Theatre Workshop and the New York Satellite Program (a four-week intensive series of master classes held in New York dur\u00ad ing the month of May). Admission to the Honors in Music Theatre Program is competitive. After completing the prerequisite, Drama 165 (Beginning Music Theatre Workshop), candidates may audition for Drama 166 (Advanced Music Theatre Workshop). This audition will assess the student's proficiency at singing, dancing, and acting along with music reading skills at the piano.

DOCTORAL DEGREE PROGRAM The UCI Department of Drama and the UCSD Department of The\u00ad atre and Dance offer a joint doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Drama and Theatre. Preparation Students with a B.A. (minimum GPA of 3.5), M.A., or M.F.A. degree in Drama and Theatre are eligible for admission to the doc\u00ad toral program. Students with training in literature (or another area in the humanities) will also be considered, provided they can demonstrate a background in drama or theatre. Experience in one of the creative activities of theatre (acting, directing, playwriting, design, dramaturgy) enhances a student's chances of admission. All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion and to submit samples of their critical writing. While not required for admission, a working knowledge of a sec\u00ad ond language is highly desirable (see Language Requirement). UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Course of Study Students are required to take a minimum of 144 units, which is equivalent to four years of full-time study (full-time students must enroll for a minimum of 12 units each quarter). Forty of these units are taken in required seminars; the balance is made up of elective seminars, independent study and research projects (including preparing the three qualifying papers), and dissertation research. Students must take a minimum of one seminar per year in the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. The program of study makes it possible for students to take a significant number of elec\u00ad tive courses and independent studies both with faculty in Drama and Theatre and in other departments. Required Courses Students must take a minimum of 12 units (three seminars) each of Drama 290 (Dramatic Literature and Theatre History Prior to 1900) and 291 (Dramatic Literature and Theatre History, 1900 to Present), and 16 units (four seminars) of 292 (Cultural and Critical Theory). All graduate courses may be repeated when the topic varies. Descriptions of the topics to be treated in a given academic year are published by the Department in the fall. Enrollment in each course requires the consent of the instructor. The courses are lim\u00ad ited to registered doctoral students. These 10 required seminars must be completed by all students, including those who have an M.A. or an M.F.A. degree, before the . end of the third year. In addition, students must pass comprehen\u00ad sive examinations at the end of their first and second years. Drama 293 (Directed Studies) and 294 (Dissertation Research) are also required. Comprehensive Examinations In the first year, students prepare for the Written Comprehensive Examination, which is based on a reading list of approximately 150 titles ranging from the Ancient Greeks to the present. Students take this examination at the beginning of the fall quarter of their second year. (Comprehensive examinations are scheduled at the beginning of fall quarter in order to allow students the summer to prepare.) Students who fail the Written Comprehensive may retake it no later than the first week of winter quarter of their second year. Students who fail the Written Comprehensive for a second time are dismissed from the program. In their second year, students prepare for the Oral Comprehensive Examination. The reading list for this examination is designed to permit students to acquire a knowledge of their dissertation subject area, broadly conceived. The reading list is compiled by the stu\u00ad dent and the dissertation advisor, in consultation with other mem\u00ad bers of the faculty, as appropriate; the reading list must be estab\u00ad lished by the end of winter quarter of the second year. Students take the Oral Comprehensive at the beginning of the fall quarter of their third year. Students also submit a dissertation prospectus (approximately five pages) when they take this examination. Stu\u00ad dents who fail the Oral Comprehensive may retake it no later than the first week of winter quarter of their third year. Students who fail the Oral Comprehensive for a second time are dismissed from the program. Advancement to Candidacy: Three Qualifying Papers Students normally select a dissertation advisor during their second year and must do so before the end of spring quarter of that year. In consultation with the dissertation advisor and other faculty members, students develop topics for three qualifying papers, which are written during their third year. The three qualifying Drama 101 papers-one long (approximately 50 pages) and two short (approx\u00ad imately 30 pages each)-must be completed by the end of the third year; these completed papers provide the basis for the Oral Quali\u00ad fying Examination. Students write the long paper under the direc\u00ad tion of their dissertation advisor; it is understood that the long paper is preparatory to the dissertation. The short papers deal with other related topics, subject to the approval of the student's advi\u00ad sors; the two short papers are understood as engaging in exploring the larger contexts of the dissertation. Students normally pass the Qualifying Examination and advance to candidacy at the end of their third year; students must advance to candidacy no later than the end of fall quarter of their fourth year. Once advanced to candi\u00ad dacy, students write their dissertation which, upon completion, is defended in a final oral examination. Students may select a dissertation advisor from either the UCI Department of Drama or the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. All UCI doctoral dissertation committees must include at least one faculty member from UCSD. Language Requirement Students are required to complete an advanced research project using primary and secondary material in a second language (mate\u00ad rials may include live and/or recorded performance; interviews with artists, critics, and scholars; and other non-documentary sources, as well as more conventional textual sources). This requirement may be satisfied by writing a seminar paper or a quali\u00ad fying paper (see Advancement to Candidacy above) that makes extensive use of materials in a second language. The second-lan\u00ad guage requirement must be satisfied before the end of the third year. This requirement will not be waived for students who are bi\u00ad or multilingual; all students are required to do research-level work in more than one language. It is assumed that students will have acquired a second language before entering the doctoral program, although second-language proficiency is not a requirement for admission. While students may study one or more second languages while at UCI or UCSD, lan\u00ad guage courses may not be counted toward doctoral program requirements. Teaching Students are required to teach a minimum of four quarters. No more than eight units of apprentice teaching may be counted toward the required 144 units. Departmental Ph.D. Time-Limit Policies Students must advance to candidacy by the end of the fall quarter of their fourth year. Departmental normative time for completion of the degree is five years; total registered time in the Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram at UCI or UCSD cannot exceed seven years. Financial Support Ph.D. students entering the program with a B.A. may be supported (either by teaching assignments or fellowships) for five years. Stu\u00ad dents who have an M.A. and have been given transfer credit may be supported for four years. Such support depends upon the funds available, the number of students eligible, and the student's rate of progress.

PROGRAMS OF STUDY The Department of Music offers two undergraduate degrees (the Bachelor of Arts in Music and the Bachelor of Music) and the Master of Fine Arts degree in Music. The minor in Music is unavailable until further notice. The Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) degree program is performance\u00ad oriented. It offers students the opportunity to specialize in one of the following: bassoon, clarinet, composition, contrabass, flute, French hom, harp, jazz instrumental, lute and voice. (The specialization appears on the student's UCI transcript.) In addition, B.Mus. students may qualify for the Spe\u00ad cial String Performance option, an intensified curriculum for pro\u00ad fessional-level students. All B.Mus. students receive weekly pri\u00ad vate instruction, for a maximum of 12 quarters for entering freshmen or six quarters for transfers and composition students, and present a solo recital during their senior year. B.Mus. students participate in performance classes each quarter. Vocal performance students focus on diction, movement, stage presentation, repertory, criticism, and style. Guitar and lute students focus on ensemble work, repertory with other instruments and voice, criticism, and pedagogy. Piano students give weekly solo performances before other students, and also focus on criticism, style, and interpreta\u00ad tion. String, wind, brass, percussion, and also piano students focus on quartet work, small ensembles, and solo sonatas privately coached and presented in afternoon recitals. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree program enables students to pursue elective subjects in music (such as analysis, history, or jazz), in the arts, or in other academic disciplines. Students receive two years of instrumental or vocal instruction and participate at the same time in two years of ensemble or repertory classes. Students also complete a senior project in an area of interest: a historical project, a composition, or a lecture/performance. Music scholarships are offered to promising undergraduate per\u00ad formers. Scholarship awards are generally based on the preadmis\u00ad sion auditions which are held in February. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad during their junior year. Music majors may enroll in conservatories and universities in several countries; highly qualified performers may be eligible to attend the Conserva\u00ad torio G. B. Martini in Bologna, Italy. See the Educational Abroad Program section for additional information. In each baccalaureate degree program, students receive private lessons on their instruments or in voice, and perform in orchestral or choral concerts, in chamber ensembles, and in solo recitals; however, such participation varies according to which degree the student pursues. A five-year program coordinated with the UCI Department of Edu\u00ad cation is available for students interested in obtaining a California Teaching Credential. The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degree program in Music emphasizes Accompanying, Choral Conducting, Composition and Technology, Guitar/Lute Performance, Instrumental Performance, Jazz Composition, Jazz Instrumental Performance, Piano Perfor\u00ad mance, and Vocal Performance. PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES ChoraWocal Choral ensembles at UCI offer all students, regardless of major, the opportunity to sing. Regular ensembles include the California Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Madrigal Singers, Men's Chorus, Music 105 Women's Chorus, and Women's Chamber Choir. Performances range from international concert tours, to Southern California con\u00ad cert venues, to campus concerts. The Department produces the annual Madrigal Dinner celebrating the court of Henry VIII. Annual invitational choral festivals are an integral part of the pro\u00ad gram. Opera and oratorio performances feature student soloists. Instrumental The UCI Symphony Orchestra offers participants an opportunity to explore the great masterworks of the standard orchestra repertory. The most proficient students have an opportunity to perform a con\u00ad certo with the orchestra by winning the annual concerto competi\u00ad tion. The symphony performs six times a year including collabora\u00ad tions with the UCI Opera Theatre and the Departments of Dance and Drama. Productions have included Bizet's Carmen and Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel. A cornerstone of instrumental study at UCI is the chamber music program. Small ensembles, coached by the faculty, have frequent opportunities to perform. Additional student performance opportunities are available with four conducted ensembles: the Wind Ensemble performs great works from the concert band literature; the Jazz Big Band performs a variety of jazz big band repertoire; the Charles Mingus Jazz Ensemble performs improvised ragtime to the most current avante\u00ad garde jazz; and the UCI Band plays at athletic events, including home basketball season games. Composition Students have the opportunity to compose works for performances by undergraduates and graduates, chamber groups, and a student modem music chamber ensemble. Selected student works may be read by the large performing ensembles. CAREERS IN MUSIC A degree in Music offers many career opportunities. Music is a highly competitive profession and a degree may or may not lead to professional employment with an orchestra or as a concert artist. Many graduates do, however, become successful freelance mem\u00ad bers of symphony orchestras, composers, and performers. Many others go on to pursue graduate degrees in performance, music his\u00ad tory, conducting, arts management, music librarianship, composi\u00ad tion, or secondary or postsecondary education. Some graduates have made careers in music publishing and in the recording industry. RECOMMENDED PROFICIENCY LEVELS FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN All applicants for admission are required to pass an audition in their principal performing medium and will receive infor\u00ad mation concerning the mandatory audition approximately 60 days following the close of the application period. Freshmen students wishing to enter either of the baccalaureate degree programs in Music must demonstrate appropriate perfor\u00ad mance proficiency and should have had a minimum of two years of instrumental or vocal instruction. They should know scales, funda\u00ad mental notation, triads, and have the ability to read music in both treble and bass clefs. Basic keyboard skill is highly desirable, as is experience as a solo performer. Choral, orchestral, band, or stage experience is desirable.

Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face the human race in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated people understand the contributions that biological sciences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of human beings. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biol\u00ad ogy in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to learn the principles and facts in this ever-expanding field of biology. The curriculum is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and nonmajors. In keeping with the responsibili\u00ad ties of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportunity for under\u00ad graduates to participate in research, through the Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 program. Each quarter more than 900 undergraduate stu\u00ad dents and 200 graduate and postdoctoral students participate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the nine-quarter Biological Sciences Core. Upper-division laboratories and satellite courses developing the major concepts of modem biology expand upon and intensify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences meaningful and interesting and to inform inteiligent citizens of biological phe\u00ad nomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in the biological mechanisms of behavior are advised to consult the course listings here in the School of Biological Sciences section. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course listings in the School of Social Ecology and the Department of Cognitive Sciences sections of the Catalogue. Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Social Ecology. Information is available in the School of Social Ecology section. Degrees Biological Sciences ................................................

Undergraduate Program ADMISSION TO THE MAJOR IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES In the event that the number of students who elect Biological Sci\u00ad ences as a major exceeds the number of positions available, appli\u00ad cants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions requirements. Freshmen: Preference will be given to those who rank the highest using the selection criteria as stated in the Undergraduate Admis\u00ad sions section of this Catalogue. Transfer students: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission. All applicants must complete the following required courses: one year of general chemistry with lab\u00ad oratory and an approved sequence of biological sciences courses. No student may enter as a double major, but students interested in other areas may apply to become double majors after the first quar\u00ad ter, if the second school or program approves. A strong academic performance in the second area is requisite for acceptance as a double major. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES CHANGE OF MAJOR POLICY FOR CONTINUING UCI STUDENTS Biological Sciences majors have first priority for enrolling in required biology courses. Students who are Undecided/Undeclared, Unaffiliated, or in majors other than the Biological Sciences will be able to attempt to enroll in required biology classes on the sec\u00ad ond Monday of instruction of each quarter. There is no guarantee that students outside of the Biological Sciences major will be able to enroll in biology courses required for the Biological Sciences degree. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The following criteria must be met to be considered for admission into the School of Biological Sciences as a continuing student. Change of Major applications are accepted and reviewed by the School throughout the year. Students are encouraged to submit their change of major request as soon as they have met the follow\u00ad ing requirements: Students Who Entered UCI as Freshmen: (a) completion of Chemistry !A-B-C and 1LB-LC with an average GPA of 2.0; (b) completion of an additional two required science courses for the major with an average GPA of 2.0 (example: any two of Biological Sciences 94, 96, Mathematics 2A-B-C, 7); (c) an average 2.0 GPA in any required science course sequence completed for the major (i.e., the separate GPAs for biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics must each average a 2.0 GPA or above; (d) a cumulative GPA of 2.0, and less than 120 quarter units completed; (e) completion of the Subject A Requirement; and (f) a quarterly GPA of 2.0 or better in the quarter immediately pre\u00ad ceding the change of major. Students Who Entered UCI as Transfers: (a) completion of at least three quarters of work done at UCI; (b) completion of Chem\u00ad istry 1A-B-C and 1LB-LC with an average GPA of 2.0 (if this was completed at another institution before transferring to UCI, then at least three required science courses for the major must be com\u00ad pleted at UCI with an average GPA of 2.0); (c) an average 2.0 GPA in any required science course sequence completed for the major (i.e., the separate GPAs for biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics must each average a 2.0 GPA or above); (d) a cumulative GPA of 2.0; and (e) a quarterly GPA of 2.0 or better in the quarter immediately preceding the change of major. Selection criteria are subject to change. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for current information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S. DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES University Requirements: See pages 5<k-59. School Requirements Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (94, 96, 97, 98, 99, lOOL, 108, 109, 110, 194S); four satellite courses (see School Residence Requirement below; Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C or Physics 147A-B-C can be used to partially satisfy the satellite requirement; Psychology/Biological Sciences double majors can also use Psy\u00ad chology 112A-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement); three 114L, 116L, and Humanities 1A-B-C, or its alternative, the lower\u00ad division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and an approved three-quarter series of courses in the humani\u00ad ties. See the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for a list of approved courses. Prerequisites for all Biological Sciences Core courses are rigor\u00ad ously enforced. Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum, four satellite courses, and three upper-division laboratories. School Residence Requirement: All required satellite courses and upper-division laboratories must be successfully completed at UCI. The School of Biological Sciences strictly enforces the UCI resi\u00ad dence requirement. Credit for the last 36 units of work immedi\u00ad ately preceding graduation must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. (The School considers courses taken in the Education Abroad Program to be in-residence courses.)

UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have com\u00ad pleted the School requirements and who have passed any two quar\u00ad ters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alter\u00ad native with a grade of C or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception of: Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences; Category VI, Language Other Than Eng\u00ad lish; and Category VII, Multicultural Studies and International/ Global Issues. Transfer students will also be required to satisfy the upper-division writing requirement. Specifically, the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) or its alternative satisfies Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also sat\u00ad isfies the lower-division writing requirement when two quarters of the writing component are passed with a grade of C or better. Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 100L with a grade of C or better satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Chemistry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Category V, Mathematics and Sym\u00ad bolic Systems, is satisfied by completion of the School mathemat\u00ad ics requirement. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the phys\u00ad ical sciences, it is very important for students to take their required physical sciences early, particularly general and organic chemistry. Students who have not completed high school chemistry are well advised to complete a preparatory chemistry course before entering UCI. The academic program shown is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take Humanities lA, Chemistry lA, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2A) during the fall quarter. Students will then continue with Biological Sciences 94 and 96 and complete their general chemistry and humanities requirement the remaining winter and spring quarters. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 122 UCI 1999-2000 School of Biological Sciences Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry 51 A or 52A), continue the Biological Sciences Core with 97, 98, 99, and lOOL; students enrolling in lOOL must have completed or be concurrently enrolled in Biological Sciences 194S. Sophomores also complete the Humanities requirement if they have not taken it during their fresh\u00ad man year and often begin taking courses in other disciplines to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. During their junior year, most majors complete the Biological Sci\u00ad ences Core and take physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry will be required to take Physics 5A-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and usually start their research and their upper-division laboratory and satellite courses. Since research and the content of satellite courses are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually prefer\u00ad able for students to have completed most of the Core before under\u00ad taking certain satellite courses or research projects. Finally, during their senior year, students continue their research and their optional specializations by completing the remaining required upper-division laboratory and satellite courses. Students in the Biological Sciences major are required to make progress toward their degree. Students' progress will be monitored. If normal academic progress toward the degree in Biological Sci\u00ad ences is not being met, students will be subject to probation.

Students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing require\u00ad ment. Students taking Humanities !A must enroll in the Subject A section of this course if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. 2 Students may take Chemistry 52A-B-C, 52LA-LB instead of S!A-B-C, S!LA-LB. 3 Prerequisites for Biological Sciences 1 OOL are completion of or concurrent enrollment in Biological Sciences 98 and 194S, and satisfactory completion of the lower-division writing requirement. Biological Sciences !OOL must be com\u00ad pleted prior to taking the three upper-division laboratories. 4 In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A\u00ad B-C or 131A-B-C, Physics 147A-B-C, and Psychology 112A-B-C (for Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. 5 Electives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. Special Programs and Courses Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sciences has the opportunity to pursue independent experimental laboratory or field research under the direct supervision of a professor in the School of Biological Sciences or in the College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of science and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although the School of Biological Sciences does not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that students possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign lan\u00ad guage needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biologi\u00ad cal sciences is best accomplished by students working together with a faculty advisor. Students are permitted to take a maximum of five units per quarter in all independent study courses taken under any school or program. White Mountain Research Station (WMRS) Supercourse: Environmental Biology The White Mountain Research Station Supercourse exposes and trains students in diverse approaches to solving problems about plant and animal interactions with each other, and with their envi\u00ad ronments, both pristine and human-perturbed. In this course, the Owens Valley of eastern California serves as a microcosm of nat\u00ad ural resource exploitation, symbolic of many global systems, where a major resource (water 1n this instance) is collected and exported, potentially to the detriment of the source ecosystems. Students are in residence at the WMRS facility in Bishop, Califor\u00ad nia, for the entire spring quarter. Research studies include both tra\u00ad ditional natural history-based field methods, and modern labora\u00ad tory-based techniques. Students enroll in three concurrent courses, worth 4 units each-Physiological Ecology (Biological Sciences 126), Field Ecology (Biological Sciences 133), and Conservation Biology (Biological Sciences 170). In addition, students enroll for 4 units of independent research and give a poster presentation at the annual Physiological Ecology meeting held at WMRS. Call the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at (949) 824-6006 for more information. Undergraduate Biological Sciences Minority Advanced Research Training The Undergraduate Biological Sciences Minority Advanced Research Training program was established for underrepresented minorities and women pursuing biological and biomedical research.

Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Science degree include laboratory technology, publishing, technical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare students for employment in education, medical technology (usually one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and tropical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, molecular biol\u00ad ogy, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medi\u00ad cine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Office. They also should check deadlines for taking the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other required tests and appli\u00ad cation deadlines. The MCAT and the Dental Admission Test, required by most medical and dental schools, are administered in spring and fall each year at UCI. These tests should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter med- ical or dental school. \u00b7 Leaders in nearly all health professional schools recommend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of den\u00ad tistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training at UCI. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and fulfilling concurrently the specific course requirements of the den\u00ad tal, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose electives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physical chem\u00ad istry, or other specific courses required or recommended by gradu\u00ad ate schools. The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office offers specialized services, for a fee, to all students applying to postgraduate profes\u00ad sional schools in the health sciences, including a personal file con\u00ad taining the student's letters of recommendation, and a service of sending all recommendations for a student to professional and graduate schools. Student Participation AED. Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is a national honor society for students preparing for careers in the health professions. AED strives to stimulate an appreciation of health careers through inter\u00ad action among prehealth students, health educators, and practition\u00ad ers in a variety of health care fields. Guest speakers from every aspect of the health care field highlight weekly meetings. AED annually sponsors workshops on interview techniques and a series of talks on selecting, applying to, and financing medical school. Blood drives sponsored by AED are offered in conjunction with the American Red Cross and take place twice a year. AED recruits new members early in the fall and spring quarters. Because AED is an honor society, membership is contingent upon class ranking (the top 35 percent), completion of five quarters of academic work, and a brief pledge period, during which commitment to the society is assessed. All Students for Health.

Graduate Study in Biological Sciences 131 GRADUATE STUDY IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sci\u00ad ences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biol\u00ad ogy, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Neurobiology and Behavior) and four basic science Departments of the College of Medicine (Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Bio\u00ad physics), representing respective concentrations of study under the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, cooperate in the conduct of graduate education administered by the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences. Although these programs admit students for study leading to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree, the Master of Science (M.S.) degree may be earned in pursuit of the Ph.D. Additionally, a master's program in Biotechnology, leading to the M.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is offered. Each department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of the individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated by the department or program to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other relevant qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the particu\u00ad lar department or program whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests and background. MASTER OF SCIENCE AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy pro\u00ad grams are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs, with the exception of the master's program in Biotech\u00ad nology. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the Biological Sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the stu\u00ad dent plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. In addition, it is possible for students to transfer to another program in the School, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, provided they are accepted into that program. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and aca\u00ad demic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assis\u00ad tants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. Master of Science Depending upon the program, there are two plans by which a Mas\u00ad ter of Science degree may be obtained. Plan 1: Thesis Plan. The student completes seven upper-division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 132 UCI 1999-2000 School of Biological Sciences Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan. The student com\u00ad pletes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the stu\u00ad dent's field specialization. This program is terminated with a com\u00ad prehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence. The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence. This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the School, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies and the Graduate Council. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study. Graduate student status or consent of instructor is a prerequisite for all 200-299 courses. Master of Science with a Concentration in Biotechnology The field of biotechnology has developed explosively since the discovery of gene cloning and sequencing methods in the mid- 1970s. The field is now embodied by many successful companies and an intense demand has developed for well-trained people with up-to-date familiarity with research techniques in the manipulation of nucleic acids, proteins, immunological reagents, and pathogenic organisms. The program in Biotechnology, leading to an M.S. degree in Biological Sciences, provides extensive training in actual research settings (individual faculty laboratories) in techniques rel\u00ad evant to industry, and seminar exposure to the nature of industry. It is designed to train students to enter the field of biotechnology as skilled laboratory practitioners. Emphasis is placed on learning state-of-the-art technology in protein isolation and characterization, animal and microbial cell culture, and recombinant DNA method\u00ad ology. Students are trained in experimental rationales for solving actual research problems and are encouraged to take summer internships in industry during the course of their studies. The Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry evaluates applicants to the program on the basis of grades, letters of recom\u00ad mendation, GRE scores, and other relevant qualifications. Appli\u00ad cants should have successfully completed courses in calculus, physics, organic chemistry, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biol\u00ad ogy, microbiology, immunology, and virology, as well as labora\u00ad tory courses in biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, and either animal virology or immunology. However, it is possible to defer up to two of the required laboratory courses to be taken dur\u00ad ing the first year of graduate study. The program emphasizes immediate participation in research. First-year students take core technical laboratories in protein isola\u00ad tion and characterization, animal and microbial cell culture, and recombinant DNA methodology and participate in research projects in faculty laboratories. Research training is supported by formal course work in nucleic acids, proteins, genetic engineering, and molecular/cellular biology. A seminar course devoted to product development and marketing also is required. In addition, students are trained rigorously in data recording and presentation and are required to maintain a laboratory notebook for faculty review. Emphasis during the second year is devoted almost solely to par\u00ad ticipation in research projects in faculty laboratories with one for\u00ad mal required course in molecular biology/cell biology. The program is terminated at the end of the second year by a comprehensive examination. While the Biotechnology program is designed to produce skilled laboratory practitioners for industrial positions, some students may wish to continue in a program leading to the Ph.D. degree. The Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry is a member of the interdisciplinary graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry, a program which leads to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences. Biotechnology program students who wish to enter the interdisciplinary graduate program upon completion of the M.S. degree should apply for admission during their second year. INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School is structured in a manner that encourages an interdisci\u00ad plinary approach to scientific problems. Interaction and coopera\u00ad tive efforts across traditional institutional boundaries are especially evident in the School's participation in various organized research units (described in the previous Research and Graduate Studies section) and in two interdepartmentaUinterschool graduate pro\u00ad grams described below. Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry 145 Biological Sciences Administration; (949) Web: http://www.bio.uci.edu/ Rozanne M. Sandri-Goldin, Director The graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bio\u00ad chemistry (MBGB) brings about 100 faculty from the Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Develop\u00ad mental and Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Physiology and Bio\u00ad physics. Each faculty member's area of research is listed at the beginning of the departmental sections on the following pages. The departments administer a graduate concentration in association with the MBGB program, which leads to the Ph.D. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences. The MBGB program is designed to offer students a unified curriculum, broad training, and a wide range of research opportunities in the following areas: cancer biology, cell biology, developmental biology, genetics, immunology and pathogenesis, mechanisms of gene expression, molecular neurobiology, molecu\u00ad lar physiology and biophysics, structural biology/protein engineer\u00ad ing, and virology. The goal of the combined program is to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth compre\u00ad hension in a given subspecialty. During the five years established as the normative time for com\u00ad pleting the Ph.D. degree, students complete the MBGB program requirements during their first two years, and in the remaining three years, complete the requirements of one of the five affiliated concentrations. In the first year of study, emphasis is placed on immediate research participation supported by formal course work in protein and nucleic acid biochemistry, cell biology, and gene expression, and one genetics course. At the end of the first year, student competence and critical thinking in the molecular aspects of biological sciences are tested through a comprehensive prelimi\u00ad nary examination and overall evaluation. Selection of an advisor usually occurs prior to the preliminary examination. Regular teach\u00ad ing of undergraduates is part of graduate student training in the second year of study. At this time, students also begin to lay the experimental foundation for their dissertation project proposal. During the second year and beyond, students participate in the departmental journal club and seminar series of the department in which they have elected to carry out their dissertation work, as UC IRVINE - 1999-2000specified by the concentration requirements. In years three and beyond, students fulfill requirements of a departmental Ph.D. con\u00ad centration. Further information is available in the Catalogue sec\u00ad tions of the participating departments and through the MBGB pro\u00ad gram office. Applicants should have significant laboratory experience and be well-prepared in calculus, physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry.

The School of Biological Sciences, in conjunction with the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences and the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering and Materials Science in the School of Engineering, offer an interdisci\u00ad plinary graduate program leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, or Engineering with a concentration in Protein Engi\u00ad neering Science. The program brings together faculty with research interests in: structure/function of enzymes, metalloproteins, recep\u00ad amino acids; NMR spectroscopy; and X-ray crystallography. Upon entrance to the program, students choose a Protein Engineer\u00ad ing curriculum leading to one of the three degrees. First-year stu\u00ad dents take courses in molecular biology and protein chemistry, structure, and engineering, and complete three laboratory rotations of their choice. Additional elective courses, current literature semi\u00ad nars, and research presentations are used to broaden training in subsequent years. A qualifying examination is administered at the end of the first year for students in the Schools of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and Engineering. For students in Chemistry, a written exami\u00ad nation is administered early in the second year. Students are then expected to select a laboratory and begin work toward completion of a Ph.D. dissertation based upon their own original research. Developmental and Cell Biology 133 Students advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. by presenting their dissertation proposal to an examining committee which also guides and advises the students and monitors research progress throughout their graduate training. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years. ' DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND CELL BIOLOGY 5207 Biological Sciences II; (949) 824-1721 J.

Faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology study questions pertinent at a variety of lev\u00ad els of biological organization, from molecular aspects of evolution, to organismal structure and performance, to the ecology of ocean ecosystems. Research is conducted in both the laboratory and field and includes work on a variety of organisms from phage and bacte\u00ad ria, to higher plants and animals. Primary attention is given to evolu\u00ad tionary, ecological, and functional questions rather than to particular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often col\u00ad laborative and interdisciplinary in approach. Departmental research activities include physiological ecology energetics, plant-herbivore UC IRVINE - 1999-2000and plant-pollinator interactions, microbial ecology and coevolu\u00ad tion, quantitative genetics, life history evolution, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors provide a balance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolutionary, organismal, and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional cir\u00ad cumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. pro\u00ad gram. A basic course sequence consisting of Ecology and Evolu\u00ad tionary Biology 205, 206, 207, and 208 is recommended for most entering students during their first year.

The Department of Neurobiology and Behavior offers graduate training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Graduate stu\u00ad dents must complete a sequence of core courses (lectures and labo\u00ad ratories) during their first year, and maintain an overall GPA of 3.3 or better. They also must take a minimum of four advanced courses before graduation and must participate in directed research and teaching each year. During their second year, students prepare a UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 138 UCI 1999-2000 School of Biological Sciences Master's thesis, which must be defended by the end of that year. All students meeting minimal requirements will receive an M.S. degree, but only those students judged well qualified will be rec\u00ad ommended for continuation in the Ph.D. program. To advance to candidacy for the Ph.D., students must further prepare a research proposal and must pass an oral examination by the end of the third year. Graduation depends on successful preparation and oral defense of a dissertation based on the student's research. Students are expected to complete this program in six years of study. Ideally, applicants for this program should have taken undergradu\u00ad ate courses in biology (one introductory year plus some advanced work), psychology (experimental, physiological, and learning), chemistry through biochemistry, introductory physics, calculus, and statistics. They also must submit GRE Aptitude test scores. Because graduate training emphasizes research, preference is given to applicants having laboratory research experience as undergradu\u00ad ates.

University of La Verne, Lecturer (school law, labor relations) The Department of Education is dedicated to academic scholar\u00ad ship and the application of research to educational practice. The Department offers programs leading to credentials required for teaching or administration in the public schools of California, a minor in Educational Studies, and an Ed.D. degree in Educational Administration. Faculty associated with the Department of Education include researchers and scholars of national and international reputation. Many faculty have taught or served as administrators in public schools, and all are committed to the continued improvement of education through conducting research and the development of more effective approaches to teaching. Teaching and Service Credential Programs The Department of Education offers professional education pro\u00ad grams which lead to California teaching and service credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known generally as the Ryan Act. The Department of Education offers full-time programs leading to California's two basic teaching credentials-the Single Subject Credential and the Multiple Subject Credential. There are two paths available to obtain the teaching credential: the Intern Teaching Cre\u00ad dential Program and the Student Teaching Credential Program. Additionally, the Department offers Administrative Services Cre\u00ad dential programs. Preliminary and Professional Clear Teaching Credentials The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon com\u00ad pletion of a baccalaureate degree, the professional education course sequence, a course in the teaching of reading, student teaching, a college-level course or examination covering the U.S. Constitution, the passage of the California Basic Education Skills Test, (CBEST), and verification of subject matter competence, e.g., Praxis II, Sin\u00ad gle Subject Assessment for Teaching (SSAT), or an approved sub\u00ad ject matter preparation program. (See Verification of Subject Mat\u00ad ter Competence). In addition, candidates for a Multiple Subject Credential are required to pass the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA). This test may be taken during or immediately following completion of the professional education program. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The Professional Clear Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the fifth year of study, which is defined as 45 quarter units of upper-division or graduate-level postbaccalaureate courses. State-approved courses in computer education (Education 30IA, 301LA or 302A, 302LA), special education (Education 162), and health education (Education 380) are required for the Professional Clear Credential. In addition, postbaccalaureate courses taken as part of the professional education program can be used to satisfy fifth\u00ad year requirements. Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential requirements. The stipend is paid by the school district. To serve as an intern, the student must be admitted to the Department of Education Intern Program and be eligible for an Intern Credential. Eligibility includes a baccalaureate degree, cur\u00ad rent tuberculin test clearance, a Certificate of Clearance, passage of the CBEST, verification of subject-matter competence, and a course or college-level examination on the U.S. Constitution. Intern teachers are selected by participating school districts and UCI based on the background and experience of the candidate, the needs of the particular school district, and the candidate's eligibil\u00ad ity for UCI's Education program. Interns are required to take the following courses. Multiple Subject Interns: Education 106A, 111A, Interns: Education 101, 102A-G (students enroll in the section of their proposed 380t. For further information see the intern program coordinator in the Department of Education. t Ed. 162 and 380 are required for the Professional Clear Credential and must be taken within five years of issuance of the Preliminary Credential. With approval, students may enroll in these courses during the preliminary program. * Ed. 173 is a prerequisite and must be successfully completed prior to beginning the credential program. Ed. 176 may substitute for Ed. 173. Student Teaching Credential Program The Student Teaching Credential Program is characterized by a full year of involvement in the public schools beginning with school observations in the fall quarter and culminating in student teaching during the winter and spring quarters. (Students are required to begin the school observations when the public schools open in September. Student teaching concludes as the public schools com\u00ad plete the school year in June.) Intensive course work in the fall quarter prepares students for full\u00ad time student teaching experiences which begin in the winter and continue through the spring quarter. Course work related to student teaching continues at a reduced level during the winter and spring quarters. The student teaching experiences are supervised by the Department of Education faculty and school-site teachers trained as University Associates. SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL A Single Subject Credential authorizes teaching in a specific sub\u00ad ject area, as is commonly practiced in California high schools and middle/intermediate schools. UCI offers Single Subject Teaching Credentials in art, English, languages other than English, mathe\u00ad matics, music, sciences, and social science. Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Educa\u00ad tion 101, 102A-G (students enroll in the section of their proposed credential authorization), 102H, 105B, 162tt, 173**, Sample Fifth-Year Program- Single Subject Credential FALL WINTER SPRING Ed 101 Ed 102H Ed 102H Ed 102* Ed 302A, LA Ed 320C, D, E Ed 105B Ed 320A, B Ed 174 :j: Section is dependent upon content area. MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL A Multiple Subject Credential authorizes teaching multiple sub\u00ad jects as commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: 301A, 301LA, and 38Qtt. tt Ed. 162 and 380 are required for the Professional Clear Credential and must be taken within five years of issuance of the Preliminary Credential. With approval, students may enroll in these courses during the program. **Ed. 173 is a prerequisite and must be successfully completed prior to beginning the program. Ed. 176 may substitute for Ed. 173. NOTE: In addition to Ed. 173, Ed. 124 is a prerequisite for students pursuing the CLAD/BCLAD emphasis. (Ed. 160 may be substituted for Ed. 124. Interns are not eligible for the CLAD/BCLAD emphasis.) Sample Fifth-Year Program -Multiple Subject Credential FALL WINTER SPRING Ed lOSA Ed 104A Ed 105A Ed 110A, B, C, D Ed 105A Ed 110A, B, C, D Ed 174 Ed 110A, B, C, D Ed. 300C, D, E Ed 301A, LA Ed 300A, B The Student Teaching Experience Student teaching for Single Subject candidates (grades 7-12) is defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for one full public school semester in an appropriate classroom setting. Student teaching for Multiple Subject candidates (grades K-6) is defined as a full-day, four-day per week assignment during the first quarter of student teaching and a full-day, five-day per week \u00b7 assignment during the second quarter. The assignment will include two levels within the K-6 range. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Department of Education and are contingent upon the Certificate of Clearance, a current tuberculin test clearance, academic preparation clearances including CBEST, and verification of subject matter competence. A grade of B or better is required in all courses and student teach\u00ad ing for successful completion of the program. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching pro\u00ad gram and all other requirements are met, the student is eligible for a credential recommendation by UCI. Administrative Services Credential Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel ser\u00ad vices, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs leading to the Administrative Services Credential generally required for school administrators. There are two tiers of the Administrative Services Credential. In the first tier, a candidate obtains the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential by completing the approved program of 36 quarter units and a comprehensive examination. This credential also requires a valid basic credential, three years of full-time teach\u00ad ing or services experience, and passage of the CBEST. When an administrative position is obtained, the individual begins pursuing UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 146 UCI 1999-2000 Department of Education the Professional Clear Administrative Services Credential (tier two). The Professional Clear program requires the completion of an additional 38 quarter units (120 hours of non-University work or other structured programs may substitute for 12 of these units) and two years of successful full-time school administrative experience in a position which requires the Preliminary Administrative Ser\u00ad vices Credential. Some courses in the Professional Clear Adminis\u00ad trative Services program are applicable to the Ed.D. degree in Edu\u00ad cational Administration at UCI. Students interested in these credentials should make an appoint\u00ad ment with a counselor in the Department of Education. Preparation for Applying to the Credential Programs Eligibility for admission is supported by passing the CBEST, pro\u00ad viding evidence of possession/application for a Certificate of Clearance, and successfully completing the appropriate subject area examinations or an approved subject matter program. Registration for examinations must be made well in advance of test dates. Students are urged to contact the Department of Education for information about the tests and test dates at least one year before application deadline. The Department of Education requires appropriate field experi\u00ad ences prior to entering the program. Course credit for field experi\u00ad ence is available through Education 100, 103, and 160!160L, as well as through other University programs. Field experience can also be earned by other appropriate activities, e.g., tutoring, assist\u00ad ing in public school classrooms, and active participation in the Teachers of TomOIJ'OW Club. An application is enhanced if prerequisite courses (Education 173 for all teaching credential programs and Education 124 for the CLAD/BCLAD emphasis) have been completed. Education 176 may be substituted for Education 173, and Education 160 may be substituted for Education 124. Education 124 and 173 are also offered online. ADMISSION TO THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS Information and applications are available from the Department of Education, 2001 Berkeley Place. Admission is based on a broad index, including but not limited to the following: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 will support consideration of admission to the Department of Education. Undergraduates who enroll in courses leading to a cre\u00ad dential are not guaranteed admission to the program; admission through the regular graduate admissions process is required. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation are required for admission. These letters should relate to the student's potential for success in teaching or administration and should indi\u00ad cate the student's ability to perform academic work. For applicants to the teaching credential programs, at least one letter should focus on experiences related to teaching. CBEST. Evidence of having passed the California Basic Educa\u00ad tional Skills Test must accompany the application for admission. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a Certificate of Clearance from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). Applicants must provide evi\u00ad dence of filing for this Certificate along with their application for admission to the Department of Education. Contact a counselor in the Department of Education for advice on how to handle this process. Verification of Subject Matter Competence Single Subject Credential. California requires all credential can\u00ad didates to demonstrate subject matter competence prior to student teaching. This can be achieved by passing the appropriate Praxis II subject assessments and the SSAT specialty area tests or by com\u00ad pleting a CCTC-approved subject matter program in the teaching area. (Students pursuing a subject matter program may student teach with a minimum of four-fifths of the subject matter program completed. However, the entire subject matter program must be completed for the credential.) Students should consult a counselor in the Department of Education for detailed information. Subject Matter Programs. UCI offers CCTC-approved subject matter programs in English and social science. Consult a counselor in the Department of Education for information. Multiple Subject Credential. The Praxis II: Multiple Subject Assessment for Teachers (MSAT) or CCTC-approved subject mat\u00ad ter program is a requirement for the Multiple Subject Credential. (UCI does not have a subject matter program for multiple subjects but will honor approved programs from other universities.) The MSAT consists of two sections: Content Knowledge and Content Area Exercises. It includes the following areas: English, mathemat\u00ad ics, science, social science, physical education, human develop\u00ad ment, and visual and performing arts. All students must pass the MSAT prior to beginning student teaching or must complete at least four-fifths of an approved subject matter program. Comple\u00ad tion of the entire subject matter program or the passage of the MSAT is required for the credential. Supplementary and Additional Teaching Authorizations After acquiring a basic credential, it is possible to add further teaching authorizations. Students wishing to be authorized in more than one subject area may qualify in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in specific college-level course work to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas other than the major teaching area. Consult a counselor in the Department of Education for details. 2. Students may pass the appropriate examinations in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional teaching autho\u00ad rization in that subject. CLAD/BCLAD EMPHASIS PROGRAM The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing has adopted credential regulations to authorize both Single Subject and Multi\u00ad ple Subject teachers to serve the State's growing number of Eng\u00ad lish Language Development (ELD) students. In accordance with these regulations, UCI offers the Crosscultural Language and Aca\u00ad demic Development (CLAD) emphasis and the Bilingual Crosscul\u00ad tural Language and Academic Development (BCLAD) emphasis in Spanish. (The CLAD/BCLAD emphasis is not available through the intern program.) After meeting prerequisites Education 173 and 124, and verifica\u00ad tion of experience related to a second language, and immediately before the teacher preparation year, CLAD/BCLAD candidates attend a summer seminar and practicum (Education 165, 166, and 167). Additionally, BCLAD candidates must demonstrate advanced language proficiency in Spanish and meet all bilingual teaching course requirements. Upon successful completion of the CLAD/BCLAD summer pro\u00ad gram and the academic year teacher education program, students are eligible for a preliminary teaching credential with a CLAD/ BCLAD emphasis. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Undergraduate Minor in Educational Studies The minor in Educational Studies allows students to explore a broad range of issues in the field of education, and provides a strong foundation for K-12 teaching. The program consists of a coordinated set of courses which includes an introductory level course and several advanced courses in the field of education. A number of the minor's elective courses are offered by other acade\u00ad mic units. Students who plan to apply for admission to a credential program in the UCI Department of Education (or at other institutions) will enhance their admissibility through taking the minor's coordinated set of courses and will acquire a strong basic foundation for their advanced work. Students who do not eventually choose education as a career path will have gained a valuable knowledge base applicable to many other occupations and to roles as citizens, par\u00ad ents, and volunteers. A Statement of Intent is required of all students wishing to enroll in this minor; forms are available in the Department office, 200 1 Berkeley Place. Requirements The minor requires completion of a minimum of seven courses (at least five of which must be upper-division) totaling 28 units drawn from the four required areas of study shown below and from the approved electives. No more than two courses from the student's major area of study may be used for completion of the minor. 1. Educational systems, issues and reforms area: Education 50 (Origins, Purposes, and Central Issues in K-12 Education). 2. Learning and the learning process area: either Education 173 (Learning Theories and Classroom Practices) or 176 (Psychol\u00ad ogy of Learning, Abilities, and Intelligence). Each of these courses also fulfills the prerequisite requirement for the Depart\u00ad ment's fifth-year teacher education credential programs. 3. Educational contexts and influences area: has two dimen\u00ad sions-subject area and field experience. The latter requires students to be involved in direct observation and/or service in the schools. Students may select from Education 100 (Educa\u00ad tional Strategies for Tutoring and Teacher Aiding), 160 (Practicum in After-School Learning and Inquiry), or other approved courses which include involvement with K-12 schools. 4. Subject matter content and pedagogy area: requires completion of one approved course focusing on an academic discipline of the student's choice which has direct applicability to K-12 instruction. NOTE: In addition to the courses shown above, a variety of others may be applied toward areas 3 and 4. Detailed information is avail\u00ad able from the Faculty Advisor for the minor and from the Depart\u00ad ment's counselors. Electives. The remaining courses to complete the seven-course program requirement may be selected from any of the courses noted above that have not been used to meet an area requirement, from a list of approved electives available from the Department, or from other courses deemed appropriate by the Chair or Faculty Advisor. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper\u00ad division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Education 147 Graduate Degree Programs MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY OR MATHEMATICS WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the Departments of Chemistry and Mathemat\u00ad ics, the Department of Education offers coordinated programs lead\u00ad ing to the California Single Subject Teaching Credential and a Master of Science degree in Chemistry or Mathematics. Additional information is available from the Department of Education coun\u00ad seling office and the graduate affairs office in the Departments of Chemistry and Mathematics. DOCTORAL DEGREE IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION The Department of Education, in cooperation with the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, offers a program of part-time study lead\u00ad ing to the Ed.D. degree in Educational Administration. The Ed.D. program aims to prepare outstanding educational leaders who are able to articulate and accomplish important improvements in edu\u00ad cational practice while attending to the complex demographic, social, and economic challenges faced by K-12 education. The program emphasizes a range of social and behavioral science frameworks and research methodologies relevant to scholarship about schooling and thus provides a broad base of knowledge applicable to K-12 school leadership. Emphasis also is placed on using theory and research to select, orchestrate, and implement useful and effective educational practices. Admission Requirements Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and scores from the General Test of the Graduate Record Examination. Other requirements include samples of written work and demon\u00ad strated evidence of potential for leadership in school administra\u00ad tion, educational policy, or other fields pertinent to school practice and educational scholarship. Program of Study The program is designed for full-time employed professionals. Course work is covered in three academic years and four summers of study prior to the dissertation. Eighty-eight quarter units are required. Students enroll for no more than eight units per quarter during the academic year. All courses are required, except that a student may petition to take a substitute course at UCLA. Students admitted to the program are expected to take all courses on schedule. First-Year Requirements First-year courses. During the first year, the following courses covering fundamental issues in the study of educational leadership and school reform are required: First-Year Seminar (Education 259A); Issues in Educational Policy and Reform (Education 251); Organizational Theory, Planning, and Application (Education 271); Philosophy and Ethics of Educational Leadership (Education 272); Studies of Professional and Staff Development (Education 274B); Studies of School Finance and Political Economy (Education 276B); Studies of Diversity and Inequality in Education (Education 278B); Evaluation of Educational Programs (Education 281); Applications to Education of Social and Psychological Theories and Research Methods (Education 285B). First-year comprehensive examination. At the end of the first year, a comprehensive examination evaluates student progress in acquiring the substantive knowledge and analytical skills which the program strives to impart. Students who do not pass the examina- . tion the first time are given one opportunity to retake it. '\\ UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 148 UCI 1999-2000 Department of Education Second-Year Requirements Second-year courses. Second-year study, which begins in the sec\u00ad ond summer, involves four courses that round out the study of fun\u00ad damental issues in leadership and reform: History of School Reform and Central Themes of the Current School Reform Move\u00ad ments (Education 250); Information and Communication Technolo\u00ad gies for Administrators (Education 270); School Restructuring and Resource Allocation (Education 277B); Student Assessment (Edu\u00ad cation 273A). In the second summer, students begin UCLA course work and take a UCLA course in each of the subsequent summers. The balance of second-year course work focuses on (a) understand\u00ad ing fundamental perspectives on knowledge and theory, and (b) developing competency in the use of research and evaluation tools. These courses include: Functional, Interpretive, and Critical Analy\u00ad ses of Schooling (Education 260) and Research Applied to Admin\u00ad istrative Practice (Education 279). In addition, students take a three-quarter directed field research experience: Seminar in Field Research in Education (Education 290A-B-C) and Directed Field Research (Education 291A-B-C). A substantial research paper based on the field research is required at the end of the second year. Third-Year Requirements In the third year, students complete their study of research and eval\u00ad uation tools with two courses: Applications to Education of Social and Psychological Theories and Research Methods (Education 285A) and Data Analysis in Education Research and Evaluation (Education 287). Students also spend the third year developing their dissertation proposals: Third-Year Seminar (Education 259B-C). Oral Qualifying Examination. In the third year, students take an oral qualifying examination administered by a five-person Candi\u00ad dacy Committee. The examination consists of a review by the com\u00ad mittee of the student's dissertation proposal and examination of the student's competence in areas specified in the proposal. Students who do not pass in the first attempt have one opportunity to retake the examination within three months. Advancement to Candidacy After the completion of all required courses, and passing the first\u00ad year written comprehensive examination and the oral qualifying examination, students will advance to candidacy. Dissertation Research and writing of the dissertation are undertaken in the fourth (and fifth, if necessary) year of the program. Students enroll in Dissertation Research (Education 299) once they begin their dis\u00ad sertation research. At the completion of the dissertation work, the doctoral committee conducts a final oral examination during which the candidate defends the dissertation. Time Limits The required program of study is designed to be completed on a part-time basis in four to five years. A leave of absence or other exception to the program of study will only be considered under special circumstances.

Aca\u00ad demic study combined with individual and group research projects prepare students for the professional practice of engineering. Pro\u00ad grams of study at all levels emphasize fundamental principles in order to provide the basis for lifelong professional development as technology continues to evolve. The School offers undergraduate majors in Aerospace Engineering (AE), Chemical Engineering (ChE), Civil Engineering (CE), Com\u00ad puter Engineering (CpE), Electrical Engineering (EE), Engineering (a general program, GE), Environmental Engineering (EnE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME). The majors in Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commis\u00ad sion of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Aerospace Engineering considers the flight characteristics, perfor\u00ad mance, and design of aircraft and spacecraft. An upper-division series of courses in aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and con\u00ad trol follows a common core with Mechanical Engineering. The skills acquired in those courses are integrated in the capstone aero\u00ad space design course. The intent of the program is to produce highly proficient engineers who can tackle the aerospace engineering challenges of the future. See pages 188-193. Chemical Engineering applies the knowledge of chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, and humanities to solve societal problems in areas such as energy, health, the environment, food, textiles, shelter, and materials. Employment opportunities exist in various industries such as chemical, petroleum, polymer, pharma\u00ad ceutical, food, textile, fuel, consumer products, and materials. See pages 167-170. Civil Engineering addresses the challenges of large-scale engi\u00ad neering projects of importance to society as a whole, such as water distribution, transportation, and building design. Specializations are provided in Structural, Transportation, and Water Resources and Environmental Engineering. See pages 172-176. Computer Engineering addresses the design and analysis of digi\u00ad tal computers, including both software and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as computer architecture, VLSI cir\u00ad cuits, design automation, system softwl)re, and data structures and algorithms. Courses include programming in high-level languages such as Pascal, C, FORTRAN; use of software packages for analy\u00ad sis and design; design of system software such as editors, compil\u00ad ers, debuggers, and operating systems; application of computers in solving engineering problems, and laboratories in both hardware and software experiences. See pages 180-186. ' Electrical Engineering is one of the major contributors to the modernization of our society. Many of the most basic and perva\u00ad sive products and services are either based on or related to the sci\u00ad entific and engineering principles taught at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Students can specialize in three general areas of studies-Electro-optics and Solid-State Devices, Power Systems, and Systems and Signal Processing-all at the forefront of technological advancement. See pages 180-186. The major in Engineering is a special program of study for upper\u00ad division students who wish to combine the study of engineering principles with other areas such as the physical and biological sci\u00ad ences, social and behavioral science, humanities, and arts. Students may construct their own specialization. See pages 159-161. Engineering 155 Environmental Engineering concerns the development of strate\u00ad gies to control and minimize pollutant emissions, to treat waste, and to remediate polluted natural systems. Emphasis areas include air quality and combustion, water quality, and water resources engi\u00ad neering. See pages 172-176. Mechanical Engineering considers the design, control, and motive power of machinery ranging from household appliances to space\u00ad craft. Specializations allow students to focus their technical electives in the areas of Aerospace Engineering, Combustion/Propulsion, Heat Transfer/Fluid Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineer\u00ad ing, and Mechanical Systems. See pages 188-193. Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; Elec\u00ad trical and Computer Engineering, with concentrations in Electrical Engineering, Computer Networks and Distributed Computing, and Computer Systems and Software; Engineering, with concentrations in Biomedical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Protein Engineering Science; and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Specialized research opportunities are available within each of these programs. Bioreac\u00ad tion and bioreactor engineering, recombinant cell technology, and bioseparation processes are research areas in Biochemical Engi\u00ad neering. In Civil Engineering, research opportunities are provided in structural/ earthquake engineering, reliability engineering, trans\u00ad portation systems engineering, environmental engineering, and water resources. Research opportunities in Electrical and Computer Engineering are available in the areas of parallel and distributed computer systems, VLSI design, computer architecture, image and signal processing, communications, control systems, and optical and solid-state devices. Research in combustion and propulsion sci\u00ad ences, laser diagnostics, supersonic flow, direct numerical simula\u00ad tion, computer-aided design, robotics, control theory, parameter identification, material processing, electron microscopy, and ceramic engineering are all available in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Additional publications describing undergraduate and graduate aca\u00ad demic study and research opportunities are available through the School of Engineering, and the Departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering and Materials Science, Civil and Envi\u00ad ronmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and the graduate program in Protein Engineering.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 156 UCI 1999-2000 School of Engineering UNDERGRADUATE STUDY Student Affairs Office 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer; (949) 824-4334 John LaRue, Associate Dean PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Advising Academic advising is available from academic counselors and peer advisors in the School's Student Affairs Office, 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer, and from faculty advisors. Students must realize, however, that ultimately they alone are responsible for the planning of their own program and for satisfactory completion of the graduation requirements. Students are encouraged to consult with the academic counselors in the Engineering Student Affairs Office whenever they desire to change their program of study. All Engineering majors are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least once each year. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part-time employment or extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can stay on track by enrolling in summer sessions at UCI or at other institutions when a petition has been approved in advance. High-achieving students may declare a double major. Early consul\u00ad tation with the School is advisable. Required courses may be replaced by other courses if the student substantiates the merits of the program of study and obtains prior approval from faculty in the School. Students should be aware that most Engineering courses require the completion of prerequisites. The sample programs shown in. each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students must complete all of the required lower-division courses in the freshman and sophomore years in order to enroll in any upper-division Engineering course. School of Engineering policy does not permit the addition of Engi\u00ad neering courses after the third week or deletion of Engineering courses after the sixth week of the quarter. Individual instructors may have more stringent add/drop policies; students should request a statement of the instructor's policy at the beginning of each quar\u00ad ter's class. Qualified undergraduate students who have high academic stand\u00ad ing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School's Undergraduate Studies Committee may take certain graduate-level courses. Students are required to complete UCI's lower-division writing requirement (see the Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree sec\u00ad tion) during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in writing and computing (using a higher-level language such as FORTRAN, C, c++, and/or Pascal) is expected in all Engineering courses. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in certain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are courses which do not fulfill the major requirements and the breadth courses (except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Subject A and upper-division writing requirements). Admissions The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year make it beneficial for students to begin their studies in the fall quarter. Applicants wish\u00ad ing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 2000 must have submitted their completed application forms during the priority filing period (November 1-30, 1999). \u00b7 High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering pro\u00ad gram must have completed four years of mathematics and are advised to have completed one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced place\u00ad ment courses, is fundamental to success in the Engineering pro\u00ad gram and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to an Engineering major during periods of restricted enrollments. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submit\u00ad ted their SAT I and three SAT II examination scores by mid\u00ad January, 2000. Applicants must apply for admission to a specific Engineering major. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. Transfer students may be admitted to a program in the School of Engineering either from another major at UCI or from another col\u00ad lege or university, including a community college. A student seek\u00ad ing admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission with advanced standing and should have completed the appropriate prerequisites for the major they wish to enter. It is to the student's advantage to complete as much of the UCI breadth and lower-division requirements as possible prior to transferring to UCI. Since the requirements vary from major to major, those con\u00ad templating admission with advanced standing to the School should consult each Department's Catalogue section and the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, (949) 824-6703, for the specific requirements of each program. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with the Office so that a smooth transition can be planned. Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the approval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exer\u00ad cises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a stu\u00ad dent has completed at UCI. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE All students in the School of Engineering must fulfill the following requirements. University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements The minimum subject-matter requirements for graduation are: 24 units of mathematics; 28 units of basic science; and 61 units of basic Engineering, departmental core, and technical electives, depending on the major. Design Units: All undergraduate Engineering courses have both a total and a design unit value. Design unit values are indicated at the end of the course description. Each student is responsible for the inclusion of courses whose design units total that required by the program of study. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University residence requirement, at least 36 upper-division engineering units specified by each major must be completed successfully at the University of California. Variations: Variations from the general School degree require\u00ad ments may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Students wishing to obtain variances should submit peti\u00ad tions to the School's Student Affairs Office. Undergraduate Programs Specific information about courses fulfilling School and major requirements can be found on the following pages. Note that some majors require more units than the School requirements.

Minor in Global Sustainability The interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. See the Interdisciplinary Studies section of this Catalogue for more information. CAREER ADVISING The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. In addition, special career planning events are held throughout the year including an annual Career Fair. Individ\u00ad ual career counseling is available, and students have access to the Career Library which contains information on graduate and profes\u00ad sional schools in engineering, as well as general career information. HONORS Graduation with Honors. Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engineering are computed by using 50 percent of the overall UCI GPA and 50 percent of the upper-division Engineering GPA. (Engineering E190 is not used in the calculation of the upper-division GPA.) A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of Califor\u00ad nia campus. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Other important factors are considered (see page 50). Engineering 157 Dean's Honor List. The quarterly Dean's Honor List is composed of students who have received a 3.5 GPA while carrying a mini\u00ad mum of 12 graded units.

For more information, contact the UROP Office, 1100 Student Ser\u00ad vices II; telephone http://www.urop.uci.edu/-urop. Accelerated M.S. and M.S./Ph.D. Program in the School of Engineering Exceptionally promising UCI undergraduate Engineering students with a minimum cumulative 3.5 GPA may, during their junior or senior year, apply for streamlined admission into an M.S. program within the School of Engineering. Streamlined admission would allow a student to petition for exemption from UCI's GRE require\u00ad ment for graduate school admission. (The exemption applies only to current UCI students applying for admission to one of the M.S. programs in the UCI School of Engineering; other graduate schools may still require the GRE.) The student would request GRE exemption at the time of applying. Streamlined admission applicants would otherwise and in all other ways be evaluated in the same manner as other applicants to the School's graduate programs. Occasionally, a candidate for stream\u00ad lined admission may be required by the faculty to submit GRE scores in support of the graduate application. In such cases the student will be informed in writing within two weeks following receipt of the application package. Students offered admission under the streamlined procedures may, upon completion of the undergraduate degree program and follow\u00ad ing matriculation as a graduate student, petition to credit toward M.S. degree requirements up to 18 units of graduate-level course work completed in excess of requirements for the UCI bachelor's degree. Students who wish to apply for early admission to the M.S./Ph.D. program may do so in their senior year but must take the GRE prior to admission. Undergraduate streamlined admission students admitted to an M.S. or M.S./Ph.D. program within the School of Engineering may also petition their department to use up to eight units of 199 Individual Study to meet undergraduate degree requirements, either as design units or as preliminary preparation for their master's thesis work. Education Abroad Program Upper-division and graduate Engineering students may participate in a number of programs which offer unique opportunities for edu\u00ad cation and training abroad. The University's Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram (EAP) offers engineering course work for UCI academic credit at a number of universities. Some of the EAP-affiliated engi\u00ad neering schools require proficiency in the host country's language, while others are English speaking. Study abroad may postpone the student's graduation for one or two quarters, depending primarily on the student's language preparation (which can begin in the fresh\u00ad man year), but the added experience can add to the student's matu\u00ad rity and professional competence. EAP students pay regular UCI fees and keep any scholarships they may have. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the Education Abroad Program section. STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND ORGANIZATIONS Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving personnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encouraged and expected to par\u00ad ticipate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruction for each course is requested each quarter. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organi\u00ad zations. Most of these organizations are professionally oriented and in many instances are local chapters of national engineering soci\u00ad eties. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular tech\u00ad nical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of the groups also participate in the annual Engineering Week activities and in other School functions. Associated General Contractors (AGC). A student chapter of the national organization, ACG at UCI is an academic engineering club for students interested in the construction field. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). The AIAA is a technical society of 40,000 professional and student members devoted to science and engineering in the field of aero\u00ad space. The local chapter's primary activities include seminars, tours of industries, and mentoring for students by professional members. American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). AIChE, a student chapter of the national organization, provides Chemical Engineering majors with the opportunity to interact with faculty and professionals in the field. American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE). One of the larger engineering clubs, ASCE at UCI is a student chapter of the national organization. The ASCE focuses its efforts on interactions with pro\u00ad fessional engineers, sponsorship of Engineering Week activities, and participation in the annual ASCE Southwest Conference.

Additional infor\u00ad mation is available in the Catalogue section entitled Research and Graduate Studies. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those possessing a B.S. degree in engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some rare cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those admitted from an allied field may be required to take supplementary upper-division courses in basic engineering sub\u00ad jects. The Graduate Record Examination General Test is required of all applicants. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Teaching assistantships and fellowships are available to qualified applicants (who should contact the Department to which they are applying for information). Research assistantships are available through individual faculty members. It is beneficial for applicants to contact the faculty member directly to establish the potential for research support. Early applications have a superior chance for financial support. PART-TIME STUDY Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residence requirements necessitate the successful completion of a minimum number of units in graduate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, part-time students should seek the advice of the graduate counselor in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of their program. M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the following section on Transfer of Courses. Biomedical Engineering 161 TRANSFER OF COURSES Upon petition, a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work under\u00ad taken in another graduate division of the University of California, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 162 UCI 1999-2000 School of Engineering Biomedical engineering combines engineering expertise with med\u00ad ical needs for the enhancement of health care. It is a branch of engineering in which knowledge and skills are developed and applied to define and solve problems in biology and medicine. Stu\u00ad dents choose the biomedical engineering field to be of service to people, for the excitement of working with living systems, and to apply advanced technology to the complex problems of medical care. Biomedical engineers may be called upon to design instru\u00ad ments and devices, to bring together knowledge from many sources to develop new procedures, or to carry out research to acquire knowledge needed to solve new problems. During the last 20 years, we have witnessed unprecedented advances in engineering, medical care, and the life sciences. The combination of exploding knowledge and technology in biology, medicine, the physical sciences, and engineering, coupled with the changes in the way health care will be delivered in the next cen\u00ad tury, provide a fertile ground for biomedical engineering. Biomed\u00ad ical engineering, at the confluence of these fields, has played a vital role in this progress. Traditionally, engineers have been con\u00ad cerned with inanimate materials, devices, and systems, while life scientists have investigated biological structure and function. Bio\u00ad medical engineers integrate these disciplines in a unique way, com\u00ad bining the methodologies of the physical sciences and engineering with the study of biological and medical problems. The collabora\u00ad tion between engineers, physicians, biologists, and physical scien\u00ad tists is an integral part of this endeavor and has produced many important discoveries in the areas of artificial organs, artificial implants, and diagnostic equipment. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engi\u00ad neering with a concentration in Biomedical Engineering are offered. Required Background Because of its interdisciplinary nature, biomedical engineering attracts students with a variety of backgrounds. Thus, the require\u00ad ments for admission are tailored to students who have a bachelor's degree in an engineering, physical science, or biological science discipline, with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher in their upper-division course work. The minimum course work require\u00ad ments for admission are four quarters of calculus, three quarters of calculus-based physics, three quarters of chemistry, and two quar\u00ad ters of biology. Students without an engineering undergraduate degree may be required to take additional relevant undergraduate engineering courses during their first year in the program; any such requirements will be specifically determined by the BME Graduate Committee on a case-by-case basis and will be make known to the applicant at the time of acceptance to the program. A minimum GRE score of 1,200 (quantitative plus verbal) is required, or minimum combined MCAT scores in Physics, Quanti\u00ad tative Methods, and Science problems of 30 are recommended, although not required. A minimum score of 600 on the Test of Eng\u00ad lish as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is recommended of all for\u00ad eign students whose native language is not English. In addition, all applicants must submit three letters of recommendation. Exceptionally promising UCI undergraduates may apply for admis\u00ad sion through the School of Engineering's accelerated M.S. and M.S./Ph.D. program, however, these students must satisfy the course work and letters of recommendation requirements described above. Core Requirement All students are required to take a set of core courses which total 15-16 units: Developmental and Cell Biology 231B, Engineering E210A, B, of CEE283, ECE240A, MAE200A, or MAE200B. Elective Requirement The 20-21 units required to fulfill the course require\u00ad ments for the M.S. and Ph.D. degree are comprised of elective courses offered within the Schools of Engineering, Biological Sci\u00ad ences, and Physical Sciences, and the College of Medicine. A mini\u00ad mum of 12 of the elective units must be taken from the School of Engineering. The group of elective courses must be approved by the BME Graduate Committee; for M.S. students, or, for Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents, the student's graduate advisory committee, and are chosen to meet the specific needs of each student. The electives must provide breadth in biomedical engineering, but also provide specific skills necessary to the specific research the student may undertake as part of the degree requirements. Areas of Emphasis Although a student is not be required to formally choose a specific research focus area, three research thrust areas have been identified for the program: biophotonics, biomedical nanoscale systems, and biomedical computational technologies. The three areas capitalize on existing strengths within the School of Engineering and UCI as a whole, interact in a synergistic fashion, and will train biomedical engineers who are in demand in both private industry and academia. Biophotonics. This research area includes the use of light to probe individual cells and tissues and whole organs for diagnostic and thentpeutic purposes. The research areas include both fundamental investigation on the basic mechanisms of light interaction with bio\u00ad logical systems and the clinical application of light to treat and diagnose disease. Current and future foci of the faculty are: (1) microscope-based optical techniques to manipulate and study cells and organelles; (2) development of optically based technologies for the non-invasive diagnosis of cells and tissues using techniques that include fiber-optic-based sensors, delivery systems, and imag\u00ad ing systems; and (3) development of optically based devices for minimally invasive surgery. Nanoscale Systems. This class of research areas encompasses the understanding, use, or design of systems that are at the micron or submicron level. Current strengths within the School of Engineer\u00ad ing and the UCI faculty as a whole include biomaterials, micro\u00ad electromechanical systems (MEMS), and the design of new bio\u00ad medical molecules. The focus of biomedical engineering research in this area is the integration of nanoscale systems with the needs of clinical medicine. Projected areas of growth include: (1) micro\u00ad electromechanical systems (MEMS) for biomedical devices and biofluid assay; (2) programmable DNA/molecular microchip for sequencing and (3) biomaterials and self-assem\u00ad bled nanostructures for biosensors and drug delivery. Biomedical Computational Technologies. Biomedical computa\u00ad tional technologies include both advanced computational tech\u00ad niques, as well as advanced biomedical database systems and knowledge-base systems. Computational technologies that will be developed in this research area include: (1) methods for biomedical analysis and diagnosis such as physical modeling of light-tissue interactions, atomic-level interactions, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine-learning algorithms; (2) language instruction and platform standardization; and (3) machine-patient interfaces. Areas of research related to biomedical database sys\u00ad tems include the development of new technologies which can cap\u00ad ture the rich semantics of biomedical information for intelligent reasoning. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the stu\u00ad dent to specify an area of specialty, and to complete a minimum of 36 units, 24 of which must be at the 200 level including the 15-16 units that comprise the core courses as described above. The degree will be granted upon the recommendation of the Director and the School of Engineering Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Plan 1: Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must select a thesis advisor and complete an original research investigation including a written thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. A maximum of eight M.S. research units (i.e., ECE296) may be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree requires the achievement of an original and sig\u00ad nificant body of research that advances the discipline. A student with a B.S. degree may enter the Ph.D. program directly, provided they meet the background requirements described above. Each student is matched with a faculty advisor, and an individual program of study is designed by the student and a faculty advisory committee. There are no additional course requirements beyond that of the M.S. degree. Three milestones are required: (1) success\u00ad ful completion of a preliminary examination; (2) formal advance\u00ad ment to candidacy by successfully passing a qualifying examina\u00ad tion; and (3) the submission of an acceptable written dissertation and its successful oral defense. The preliminary examination is a written examination prepared by the Graduate Committee and taken by students at the end of their first year. Students who fail the examination may retake it once within six months of the initial attempt. Students who fail the sec\u00ad ond attempt are not allowed to continue in the program. After pass\u00ad ing the preliminary examination, students are matched with a BME faculty advisor, and an individual program of study is designed by the student and advisor. Advancement to candidacy must be completed between the ninth and twelfth quarters of enrollment, usually during a student's third year. (Special exceptions can be made, but a formal request with justification must be supplied in writing to the Director.) The quali\u00ad fying examination follows campus and School of Engineering guidelines and consists of an oral and written presentation of origi\u00ad nal work completed thus far, and a coherent plan for completing a body of original research. The qualifying examination is presented to the student's graduate advisory committee, which is selected by the student and faculty advisor and must have a minimum of five faculty (including the faculty advisor). Of these five faculty, a min\u00ad imum of three must be BME faculty. In addition, a minimum of two faculty must have part of their primary appointment in the School of Engineering. The Ph.D. is awarded upon submission of an acceptable written dissertation and its successful oral defense. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the graduate advisory committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Completion of the Ph.D is expected in the fifth year although a maximum of seven years (28 academic quarters) is allowed.

Sanders: Environmental and computational fluid dynamics, water resources engineering Jan Scherfig: Biological treatment, water reclamation and reuse, waste treatment Roland Schinzinger: Electric energy systems William A. Sirignano: Combustion, pollutant formation, fire spread, noise suppression Environmental Engineering addresses the development of strate\u00ad gies to control anthropogenic emissions of pollutants to the atmos\u00ad phere, waterways, and terrestrial environment; the remediation of polluted natural systems; the design of technologies to treat waste; fire safety; noise suppression; energy efficiency; and the evaluation of contaminant fate in urban environments. Environmental engi\u00ad neering issues are now an important component in the development of many engineering technologies and consequently are an impor\u00ad tant aspect of an engineering education. The discipline itself is interdisciplinary and requires a curriculum that provides students with an understanding of fundamentals in air-and water-quality sciences, contaminant fate and transport, and design concepts for pollutant emission control and treatment. To avoid the develop\u00ad ment of environmental engineering solutions which only transform one form of pollution to another, modem engineering education programs must require exposure and familiarity with a greater number of subjects than ever before. Environmental engineers with an interdisciplinary background are particularly sought to address the complex infrastructure needs of today's society, where they must be able to communicate with teams of scientists and engineers from different disciplines. Envi\u00ad ronmental engineering graduates who meet this description can expect to remain in strong demand in the private and public employment sectors, and their range of career opportunities is UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 164 UCI 1999-2000 School of Engineering highly diverse. Examples of career fields and activities include the development of new technologies to genetically engineer m_icroor\u00ad ganisms for waste treatment, design of combustion and control processes that minimize pollutant emissions and maximize energy efficiency, resolution of complex pollutant transport processes in naturally heterogeneous systems, development of new physical\u00ad chemical treatment approaches, and characterization of pollutant transformation mechanisms in natural systems. Curricular and research subjects of interest in Environmental Engi\u00ad neering include environmental air and water chemistry, environ\u00ad mental microbiology, combustion technologies, aerosol science, transport phenomena, reactor theory, unit operations and systems design, mathematical modeling, energy systems, soil physics, fluid mechanics, hydrology, and meteorology. Interdisciplinary research endeavors commonly bridge many of these different subjects and a current focus is maintained on new and emerging technologies. Curriculum objectives have also been set to maintain a balance between the depth and breadth of program scope for each student. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engi\u00ad neering are offered. Required Background The interdisciplinary nature of the program allows students with a variety of backgrounds to undertake studies in this field. Students with a background in engineering-particularly chemical, civil, environmental, and mechanical engineering-as well as scientists from biology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics, are encouraged to participate. Students admitted to the program are expected to have had rigor\u00ad ous undergraduate exposure to a number of relevant subject areas including air quality, environmental chemistry, fluid mechanics, microbial processes, and reactor theory and design. The degree to which each student meets the program's background requirement is determined by participating faculty at the time of admission. Stu\u00ad dents with an insufficient background who are offered admission will be required to take a set of appropriate prerequisite courses. Prerequisite work typically involves at least two and frequently as many as five or six upper-division, undergraduate courses each of which must be completed with a final grade of B or better. Occa\u00ad sionally, lower-division work in chemistry, mathematics, or physics is required. The student's specific prerequisite course work require\u00ad ment, if any, is stated the letter of admission. The background requirement establishes a common foundation for graduate study in the program. Not all students are required to take prerequisite course work; those who are may do so following matriculation in the graduate program. In addition, M.S. students may use a limited amount of upper-division course work taken to meet the background requirement in partial fulfillment of graduate degree requirements. Although this list is not exhaustive, commonly required prerequi\u00ad site courses within each of the required background areas are as follows: Air Quality: Engineering MAEllO, MAE162, MAE130A Reactor Theory and Design: Engineering ChE160 Core Requirement Students must complete an advanced mathematics course, either Engineering CBE220 (Applied Chemical Engineering Mathemat\u00ad ics), CEE283 (Mathematical Methods in Engineering Analysis), or MAE200B (Engineering Analysis II). Areas of Emphasis Each student selects a primary area of emphasis within Environ\u00ad mental Engineering: Water Quality, Water Resources, or Air Qual\u00ad ity and Combustion. To achieve the interdisciplinary objectives of the program, students are required to take at least two electives outside their primary area, one each in two different areas. These outside electives may also be taken from approved courses in other academic units, including the Schools of Social Ecology and Phys\u00ad ical Science, and the College of Medicine. Electives within each of the emphasis areas in Engineering are listed below. Water Quality: Engineering CBE230 (Transport Phenomena), CBE240 (Bioengineering with Recombinant (Reaction CBE262 CBE270 (Bioremediation), CEE261 CEE262A, B (Colloid Transport Phenomena I, II), CEE263 (Water and Waste Treatment Technology), CEE264 (Chemical Equilibria in Natural Waters), CEE265 (Chemical Dynamics in Natural Waters), CEE266 (Aqueous Geochemistry), CEE267 (Advanced Treatment Models), CEE269 (Hazardous Waste Remediation). Water Resources: Engineering CEE271 (Unsaturated Flow in Soils), CEE272 (Groundwater Hydrology), CEE274 (Transport Phenomena in Porous Subsurface Hydrology), CEE276 (Stochastic in Water Hydrology). Air Quality and Combustion: Engineering MAE210 (Advanced Fundamentals of Combustion), MAE215 (Advanced Combustion Technology), MAE233A, B (Numerical Methods in Heat, Mass, and Momentum Transport), MAE230A (Advanced Incompressible Fluid Dynamics I), MAE231 (Fundamentals of Turbulence), MAE232 (Atmospheric Turbulence), MAE260 (Issues Related to Atmospheric Processes), MAE261 (Air Pollution Modeling), MAE264 (Combustion Particulates and Aerosols), MAE280 (Digi\u00ad tal Data Acquisition and Analysis). MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for M.S. degree students: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the completion of 36 units of study. Study plans for both options must also include two graduate courses from outside the student's pri\u00ad mary area of emphasis. Plan I. Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must com\u00ad plete an original research investigation and a thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. Of the 36 required units, at least 20 must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either Engineering CBE220, MAE200B, or CEE283. A maximum of eight M.S. research units and up to eight units of upper-division undergraduate elective courses may be applied to the degree with the approval of a faculty advisor. Plan II. Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. At least 24 units must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either Engineer\u00ad ing CBE220, MAE200B, or CEE283. Up to 12 units may be taken as upper-division undergraduate elective courses. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration in Environmental Engineering requires the achievement of original and significant research that advances the discipline. Doctoral students are selected on the basis of an out\u00ad standing record of scholarship and potential for research excellence. The doctoral study program is tailored to the .individual student in consultation with a faculty advisory committee.There are no spe\u00ad cific course requirements, however, additional mathematics courses beyond those required for a M.S. degree are generally required, reflecting the student's specific research interests. Within this flexi\u00ad ble framework, the School maintains specific guidelines that out\u00ad line the milestones of a typical doctoral program. All doctoral stu\u00ad dents should consult the Environmental Engineering program guidelines for details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty, passage within the first year of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success, research prepara\u00ad tion, formal advancement to candidacy by passing a qualifying examination, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. Committees for preliminary and Ph.D. qualifying examinations and the doctoral committee must have at least one Environmental Engi\u00ad neering faculty member from outside the student's area of emphasis. The student's dissertation topic must be approved by the student's doctoral committee. The degree is granted upon the recommenda\u00ad tion of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Doctoral programs must be completed within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

Shi: Semiconductor processing and dielectric; metal and thin film materials; amorphous materials; nanoparticles and aerosols; the\u00ad ory and modeling S. Tsai: Integrated optic devices, circuits, materials; acoustic microscopy with applications to materials, device characterization Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is concerned with the generation and application of knowledge relating the composition, structure, and processing of materials to their properties and appli\u00ad cations. During the past two decades, MSE has become an impor\u00ad tant component of modem engineering education, partly because of the increased level of sophistication required of engineering mate\u00ad rials in a rapidly changing technological society, and partly because the selection of materials has increasingly become an inte\u00ad gral part of almost every modem engineering design. In fact, fur\u00ad ther improvements in design are now viewed more and more as primarily a materials issue. Both the development of new materials and the understanding of present-day materials demand a thorough knowledge of basic engineering and scientific principles including, for example, crystal structure, mechanics, mechanical behavior, Materials Science and Engineering 165 electronic, optical and magnetic behavior, thermodynamics, phase equilibria, heat transfer, diffusion, and the physics and chemistry of solids. The field of MSE ranks high on the list of top careers for scientists and engineers. The services of these engineers and scientists are required in a variety of engineering operations dealing, for exam\u00ad ple, with design of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, development of new technologies based on composites and high\u00ad temperature superconductivity, biomedical products, performance (quality, reliability, safety, energy efficiency) in automobile and aircraft components, improvement in nondestructive testing tech\u00ad niques, corrosion behavior in refineries, radiation damage in nuclear power plants, and fabrication of steels. Subjects of interest in Materials Science and Engineering cover a wide spectrum, ranging from metals, optical and electronic materi\u00ad als to superconductive materials, ceramics, advanced composites, and biomaterials. In addition, the emerging new research and tech\u00ad nological areas in materials are in many cases interdisciplinary. Accordingly, the principal objective of the graduate curriculum is to integrate a student's area of emphasis-whether it be structural materials, chemical processing, mechanics of solids, or electronic devices-into the whole of material science and engineering. Such integration will breed familiarity with other disciplines and provide students with the breadth they need to face the challenges of cur\u00ad rent and future technology. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engi\u00ad neering are offered. Recommended Background Given the nature of Materials Science and Engineering as a cross\u00ad disciplinary program, students having a background and suitable training in either Materials, Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical), or the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Geology) are encouraged to participate. Recommended background courses include an introduction to materials, thermodynamics, mechanical behavior, and electrical/opticaVmagnetic behavior. A student with an insufficient background may be required to take remedial undergraduate courses. Core Requirement Because of the interdepartmental nature of the concentration, it is important to establish a common foundation in Materials Science and Engineering for students from various backgrounds. This foun\u00ad dation is sufficiently covered in MSE courses that are listed below and that deal with the following topics: Crystal Structure and Crystal Defects: MSE200 (Advanced Con\u00ad cepts in Materials). Physical and Electrical Properties: MSE205 (Physical and Electric Properties of Engineering Materials). Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena: one course from MSE252A (Theory of Diffusion), MSE253 (Kinetic Phenomena in Materials), CBE280 (Fundamentals of Phase Transformation), or Chemistry 230 (Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory). Processing of Materials: one course from ECE116 (Wafer Fabrica\u00ad tion Processes), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), or MSE257B (Solidification Processes). UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 166 UCI 1999-2000 School of Engineering Electives These electives represent courses in areas of emphasis. Typical examples for elective courses in various areas of emphasis are listed below. Chemical Processing: CBE210 (Thermodynamics), CBE220 (Applied Chemical Engineering Mathematics), CBE230 (Reaction Engineering). Electronic Devices), ECE279A, B (Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics I, II). \u00b7 Mechanics of Solids: CEE242 (Advanced Strength of Materials), CEE243 (Mechanics of Composite Materials), CEE246 (Structural Performance and Failure), CEE281 (Finite Element Method in Continuum Mechanics). Physics and Chemistry of Materials: Chemistry 213 (Chemical Kinetics), Chemistry 225 (Polymer Chemistry), Chemistry 230 (Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory), Chemistry 252 (Special Topics in Physical Chemistry), Physics 221 (Elasticity), Physics 239A (Plasma Physics), Mathematics 292A (Applied Mathematics). Structural Materials: MSE210 (Materials Characterization Tech\u00ad niques and Analysis), MSE251 (Dislocation Theory), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), MSE255B (Science of Compos\u00ad ite Materials), MSE256A (Fracture of Engineering Materials), MSE258 (Computer Techniques in Experimental Materials Research), MSE259A (Theory of Electron Microscopy), ME200B (Engineering Analysis). It should be noted that specific course requirements within the areas of emphasis are decided based on consultation with the Director of the MSE concentration and the faculty advisor; that in selecting electives, students are encouraged to take courses which are not in their area of emphasis; and that MSE courses which are not selected to satisfy the core requirement can also serve as elec\u00ad tives under the Structural Materials emphasis. Furthermore, stu\u00ad dents in the MSE concentration who are interested in an area of emphasis other than Structural Materials are urged to take one course which covers aspects related to mechanical behavior such as Dislocation Theory (MSE251) and Fracture of Engineering Materi\u00ad als (MSE256A). MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE A minimum of 36 units is required for the M.S. degree. Two options are available, a thesis option and a comprehensive exami\u00ad nation option. For the thesis option, students are required to com\u00ad plete a research study of great depth and originality and obtain approval for a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis. At least 21 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and 9 units are in the area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of MSE296, ECE296, CBE296, or CEE296 and up to eight units of undergraduate elec\u00ad tive courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. For the comprehensive examination option, students are required to com\u00ad plete 36 units of study. At least 24 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and 12 units are in the area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration in Materials Science and Engineering requires a commitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and collaboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After sub\u00ad stantial preparation, Ph.D. candidates work under the supervision of faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the follow\u00ad ing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor during the student's first year of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination; preparation for doing research, comple\u00ad tion of the School of Engineering teaching requirements, and the development of a research proposal; passing the qualifying exami\u00ad nation which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed research; successful completion of the research; development and approval of the dissertation; presenta\u00ad tion of the dissertation and a final examination on its contents. There is no foreign language requirement. The preliminary examination, to be taken during the second year of the Ph.D. program, is based on the core courses in MSE and courses taken in the area of emphasis. The examination committee is appointed by the MSE Director with subsequent approval by the School's Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Doctoral programs must be com\u00ad pleted within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

This is an important asset since sciences such as chemistry, molecular biology, biomedi\u00ad cine, and solid-state physics are providing the seeds for future technologies. Chemical engineering has a bright future as the disci\u00ad pline which will bridge science with engineering in multidisciplinary environments. Biochemical Engineering is concerned with the processing of bio\u00ad logical materials and processes that use biological agents such as living cells, enzymes, or antibodies. Biochemical Engineering, with integrated knowledge of the principles of biology and chemi\u00ad cal engineering, plays a major engineering role in the rapidly developing area of biotechnology. Career opportunities in Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering are available in a variety of industries such as biotechnology, chemical, environmental, food, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The principle objectives of the graduate curriculum in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are to develop and expand students' abilities to solve new and more challenging engineering problems and to promote their skills in independent thinking and learning in preparation for careers in manufacturing, research, or teaching. These objectives are reached through a program of course work and research designed by each student with the assistance, advice, and approval of a primary faculty advisor and a faculty advisory committee. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are offered. Graduate study and research in materials includes investigations of electronic materials and processing, polymers, composite materials, creep, fracture and fatigue, ceramics, and superplasticity. Several faculty in the Department are also members of the graduate program in Protein Engineering, which is described in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Catalogue.

Scholz: Construction and project management Civil Engineering has been described as the art of harnessing the great powers of nature for the use and convenience of human \u00b7 beings. The success of this endeavor is evident all around us. The inhospitable arid plain which greeted the early settlers in Southern California has been transformed into a thriving metropolis largely by the application of civil engineering. The goal of the Civil Engineering curriculum is to prepare graduates for a career in practice, research, or teaching. At the undergraduate level a common core of fundamental subjects is provided, and stu\u00ad dents are required to specialize in their senior year. Specializations are offered in Structural, Transportation, and Water Resources and Environmental Engineering. Graduate opportunities are in three major thrust areas: structural analysis, design, and reliability; trans\u00ad portation systems engineering; and water resources and environ\u00ad mental engineering. The career opportunities in civil engineering are varied as in any other discipline. Graduates may look forward to long-term careers in major corporations, public bodies, the military, private consult\u00ad ing firms, or to being self-employed in private practice. History has shown a civil engineering education to be a good ground for many administrative and managerial positions. Environmental Engineering involves designing environmental protection or remediation strategies for multiple resources-water, air, and soil, often with combinations of physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods in the context of a complex regula\u00ad tory framework. The goal of the Environmental Engineering curriculum is to pre\u00ad pare graduates with a strong basic science background, particularly in chemistry and biology, and to provide students with a broad exposure to several environmental engineering science disciplines. Courses relating to transport processes, water quality control, air quality control, and process design are included in the core. Career opportunities in environmental engineering are diverse. Graduates generally find careers related to pollution control and the remediation of air, water, and soil environments. Undergraduate Major in Civil Engineering The program objective is to prepare civil engineering graduates for a career in the profession or for entry into graduate school. The curriculum provides the opportunity to obtain a firm foundation in engineering science and to develop the techniques of analysis and design, which are basic for the successful practitioner. Emphasis is placed on developing problem-solving skills. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 156. Transfer Students.

Graduate Study in Civil Engineering Civil Engineering addresses the technology of constructed environ\u00ad ments and, as such, embraces a wide range of intellectual endeav\u00ad ors. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering focuses its graduate study and research program on three areas: structural engineering, including aspects of structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, and reliability and risk assessment; trans\u00ad portation systems engineering, including traffic operations and management, expert systems applications, travel behavior, and transportation systems analysis; and water resources and environ\u00ad mental engineering, including water resources, contamination man\u00ad agement, and pollution control technologies. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Civil Engineering are offered. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE The M.S. degree reflects achievement of an advanced level of competence for the professional practice of civil engineering. Two plans are available to those working toward the M.S. degree: a the\u00ad sis option and a course work option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and presentation of the thesis research findings in a public seminar. Of the 36 units, a minimum of 20 units must be in nonresearch, graduate-level courses. Plan II: Course Work Option The course work option requires the completion of 36 units of study, at least 30 of which must be in nonresearch graduate-level courses. The remaining six units may be earned as graduate-level course work, individual research, or upper-division undergraduate units. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree indicates attainment of an original and significant research contribution to the state-of-the-art in the candidate's field, and an ability to communicate advanced engineering concepts. The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and back\u00ad ground of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty advisor and the Graduate Advisor of the Department. There are no specific course requirements. Within this flexible framework, the School maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral program. All doctoral students should consult the Civil Engineering program's guidelines for details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; early assessment of the student's research potential (this includes a preliminary examination), research preparation, formal advancement to candidacy by passing the qualifying examination, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no foreign language requirement. Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be com\u00ad pleted in seven calendar years from the date of admission. THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies at Irvine (ITS) is part of a multicampus research unit of the University of California. Several faculty studying transportation systems engineering in the Depart\u00ad ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering participate in the Institute. Students choosing to focus their studies in transportation will find strong interdisciplinary opportunities between the Depart\u00ad ment and ITS. See the Research and Graduate Studies section of the Catalogue for additional information.

Santina: Control systems Michael Schroter: Bipolar semiconductor devices for integrated circuits Electrical and Computer Engineering is a broad field encompassing such diverse subject areas as computers, control, electronics, digi\u00ad tal systems, communications, signal processing, electromagnetics, and physics of electronic devices. Knowledge'of the mathematical and natural sciences is applied to the theory, design, and imple\u00ad mentation of devices and systems for the benefit of society. Some electrical engineers focus on the study of behavior of elec\u00ad tronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of com\u00ad plex electronic systems. Others study the generation, transmission, and. utilization of electrical energy. A large group of electrical engi\u00ad neers studies the application of these complex systems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Still another group studies the behavior of complex electronic systems such as computers, automatic controls, telecommunications, and signal processing. Of this latter group, those engaged in designing a variety of electronic computers and computer-based application systems are often called computer engineers. The undergraduate curriculum in Electrical Engineering provides a solid foundation for future career growth, enabling graduates' careers to grow technically, administratively, or both. Many electri\u00ad cal engineers will begin work in a large organizational environ\u00ad ment as members of an engineering team, obtaining career satisfac\u00ad tion from solving meaningful problems that contribute to the success of the organization's overall goal. As their careers mature, technical growth most naturally results from the acquisition of an advanced degree and further development of the basic thought processes instilled in the undergraduate years. Administrative growth can result from the development of management skills on the job and/or through advanced degree programs in management. The undergraduate curriculum in Computer Engineering addresses the design and analysis of digital computers, including both soft\u00ad ware and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as com\u00ad puter architecture, VLSI circuits, design automation, system soft\u00ad ware, and data structures and algorithms. Computer Engineering courses include programming in high-level languages such as C; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system software such as compilers, debuggers, and operating systems; and application of computers in solving engineering problems. Labora\u00ad tories in both hardware and software experiences are integrated within the curriculum. Graduates of Computer Engineering will find a variety of career opportunities. The information technology areas include computer hardware and software design, design of computer-based control systems, application software, data storage and retrieval, graphics, pattern recognition, computer modeling, parallel computing, and operating systems. Undergraduate Major in Computer Engineering The undergraduate Computer Engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Engineering courses in fundamental areas fill in much of the remaining curriculum. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 156. Transfer Students.

To achieve their goals, mechanical engineers use mathematics, physics, and chemistry together with engineering science and technology in areas such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, dynamics, controls, and atmospheric science. Mechanical Engineering students at UCI learn the problem-solving, modeling, and testing skills required to contribute to advances in modem technology. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Mechanical Engineering undergraduates complete required courses that provide engineering fundamentals and technical electives that allow students to study particular areas of interest. Specializations are available in: Aerospace Engineering, Combustion/Propulsion, Environmental Engineering, Heat Transfer/Fluid Mechanics, Mate\u00ad rials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Systems. Indepen\u00ad dent research opportunities allow students to pursue other avenues for focusing their studies. Since mechanical engineering covers a wide spectrum of subjects, many students use the undergraduate curriculum as preparation for further studies in engineering or in areas such as medicine, law, and management. Aerospace Engineering deals with all aspects of aircraft and space\u00ad craft design and operation, thus requiring the creative use of many different disciplines. Aerospace engineers work on the forefront of technological advances and are likely to be leaders in scientific discoveries. The undergraduate curriculum in Aerospace Engineering includes courses in subsonic and supersonic aerodynamics, propulsion, con\u00ad trols and performance, light-weight structures, and advanced mate\u00ad rials. In the senior capstone course, students work in teams on the preliminary design of a commercial jet transport. Career opportunities for Aerospace Engineering graduates are in the broad range of aerospace industries, including manufacturers of aircraft, spacecraft, engines, and aircraft/spacecraft components; makers of aircraft/spacecraft simulators; and government research laboratories. Areas of graduate study and research are the thermal and fluid sci\u00ad ences, combustion and propulsion, mechanical systems and robot\u00ad ics, environmental engineering, and aerospace engineering. Appli\u00ad cation areas in mechanical engineering include combustion, heat engines, refrigeration, and robotics. Application areas in aerospace engineering include propulsion, aerodynamic design, and guidance and control. Undergraduate Major in Aerospace Engineering The undergraduate Aerospace Engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

Sys\u00ad tems and design faculty are studying robust control, parameter identification for flexible space struct\\)res, computer-aided design, and robotics-including mechanical design, robot navigation, and coordination of multiple robot systems. Thermal and fluid sciences encompasses multiphase heat transfer and fluid flow, convection, turbulent transfer, atmospheric processes, and supersonic shear flows. Combustion and propulsion research efforts include studies of the processes of fuel-air mixing, turbulent transport, liquid sprays, and the formation of gaseous and solid pollutants in gas, liquid, and coal-fueled combustion systems, including gas turbines, boilers, incinerators, and rockets. Aerospace engineering research efforts combine specialties from each of the three thrust areas as well as study in propulsion, aero\u00ad dynamics, trajectory optimization and guidance, and control of flexible space structures. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering are offered. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available to pursue study toward the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Opportuni\u00ad ties are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study; the completion of an original research project, the writing of the thesis Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 191 describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. This plan is available for those who wish to gain research experi\u00ad ence or as preparation for study toward the doctoral degree. To complete the required 36 units, students must complete a minimum of 20 units in graduate courses numbered MAE200-289, and 16 units from unrestricted courses of which not more than eight units are in MAE296 and not more than five units are in other courses numbered MAE291-299. The courses planned for study must be approved by a faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires completion of 36 units of study, 24 units of which must be from graduate courses numbered MAE200-289. With a faculty advisor approval, the remaining 12 units can include execution and documentation of a research or design project (which can count for up to seven of the 36 required units). The courses planned for study must be approved by a faculty advisor and by the graduate advisor. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. Within this flexible framework the Department maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral pro\u00ad gram. All doctoral students should consult the Departmental Ph.D. guidelines for program details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; comple\u00ad tion of six non-research courses beyond M.S. degree requirements; passage of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral pro\u00ad gram; course work; meeting departmental teaching requirements, which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy through a qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; development of a research pro\u00ad posal; completion of a significant research investigation, and com\u00ad pletion and defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no for\u00ad eign language requirement. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Grad\u00ad uate Studies. A program of part-time study is not available for the Ph.D. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Before seeking admission, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to communicate directly and in some detail with prospective faculty sponsors. The student's objectives and financial resources must coincide with a faculty sponsor's research interests and research support. Financial aid in the form of a teaching assistantship or fel\u00ad lowship may not cover the period of several years required to com\u00ad plete the program. During the balance of the period the student will be in close collaboration with the faculty research advisor.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES Karen R. Lawrence, Dean 143 Humanities Instructional Building Undergraduate Counseling: (949) 824-5132 Graduate Counseling: (949) 824-4303 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/ The School of Humanities comprises three fundamental areas of knowledge: history; literature, film, and the arts; and philosophy. The intellectual activity of departments and programs in the School reflects the discrete concerns of these basic disciplines and inter\u00ad sections among them. By expanding our knowledge in these three areas and developing skills in rhetoric, expository composition, and foreign languages, humanists influence the fundamental tech\u00ad niques of communication used throughout the modem university and our whole society. They analyze and question those techniques and examine the web of cultural beliefs in which they are practiced. At the core of the educational mission of the humanities is the goal of imparting to students critical tools of analysis, ways of seeing, knowing, explaining, describing, and understanding, that will allow them to comprehend the world around them. Consider some of the challenges that we all face: the pressures created by demographic change, rapid economic expansion, and increased ethnic and cul\u00ad tural diversity; the development of new technological forms, par\u00ad ticularly those related to computers and the Internet; and the increasingly complex problem of human interaction with the envi\u00ad ronment. Equipping students to understand and analyze such phe\u00ad nomena is precisely what a liberal education in the humanities accomplishes. In the words of a \"Manifesto for the Humanities,\" prepared for the President of the University of California, it is humanities that provide \"the ability to express oneself clearly and accurately; the skill of critical evaluation, both of ideas and actions; the courage to make choices based on shared values and priorities; the opportunity to conduct an intensive conversation with the traditions, present and past, that help make us who we are, and above all, who we will be; and as a result, the ability to under\u00ad stand and make sense of other people and their cultures.\" Human\u00ad istic inquiry is in no way isolated from the \"real world,\" cordoned off in some ivory tower; rather its central goal is to equip students to enter into that real world as critically thinking citizens. Because language is the humanist's essential tool and the tradi\u00ad tional medium of historical record, philosophical speculation, and literary creation and criticism, the School of Humanities places special emphasis on language and training in composition. The campus wide Writing Program is housed in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, as are our distinguished programs in creative writing and the Program in English as a Second Language. The School of Humanities also offers programs in over a dozen foreign languages, both classical and modem, and requires that its majors take two years or the equivalent of foreign language study. The pursuit of critical literacy involves analyzing and understand\u00ad ing our immediate culture, and one way to do this is through the study of foreign languages and the cultural systems they entail. We rarely scrutinize or analyze something we know as intuitively as our native language, yet it is by means of this language that we organize and express our thoughts. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language permits us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. The knowledge of one's native language, gained by this kind of comparative observation, is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, scientific, or other. Serious study of a foreign language is, therefore, crucial to any university education that aims at fostering critical thinking and objective self\u00ad reflection. A crucial part of the School's curriculum is the Humanities Core Course, which integrates the study of philosophy, literature, film and the arts, and history along with lower-division writing. Inter\u00ad disciplinary studies are also an essential feature of the Humanities Honors Program and programs in Film Studies and Comparative Literature, and a number of UCI's Interdisciplinary Programs are affiliated with the School of Humanities: African-American Studies, Asian-American Studies, Latin American Studies, and Women's Studies; as well as the minor in Religious Studies. See the Interdisciplinary Programs section of the Catalogue for information. Because humanists deal analytically with the most complex prob\u00ad lems and issues affecting people, and because they are especially adept at analyzing language and texts, students majoring in the humanities are particularly well-prepared for careers in all fields in which analysis, judgment, and argument are important. Students from the School of Humanities at UCI have moved into business, the law, education, politics, public policy, academia, and journal\u00ad ism. Employers in all sectors are placing increasing emphasis on the recruitment of college graduates who can write and think. These skills are ultimately more important to many employers than a specific form of technical training, and it is these skills that are imparted most effectively in the School of Humanities. For stu\u00ad dents who leave the School with a solid grounding in critical analysis, research, and communication, the sky is the limit.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Honors at Graduation Students are nominated for honors at graduation on the basis of scholarship and special achievements. To be eligible for nomina\u00ad tion the student must, by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year, file an Application for Graduation and meet the following criteria: (1) achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.50, (2) complete at least 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC cam\u00ad pus, and (3) receive strong recommendation from the major depart\u00ad ment. Eligible students are automatically considered for Honors at Graduation. Other important factors are considered (see page 50). HUMANITIES INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCE CENTER AND COMPUTING FACILITY The Humanities Instructional Resource Center (HIRC) and the Humanities Computing Facility (HCF) share space in Humanities Hall and provide comprehensive technology support for instruc\u00ad tion, research, and faculty and staff development. HIRC and HFC also serve as the center for innovative technology-mediated instruc\u00ad tion within the School of Humanities. HIRC services and facilities include video editing, video and audio tape libraries, and audio production. HCF includes the computer laboratories, fee-based laser printing, and computing consultation. Both facilities provide technology-related research and develop\u00ad ment assistance for faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students. HIRC shares space with HCF and houses three instructional labo\u00ad ratories and one drop-in laboratory (more than 90 stations). HIRC also houses one analog and two digital video editing bays and a video library, a software library, and a wide range of computer ser\u00ad vices (scanning, document conversion, workshops, and more). HCF's Macintosh and AST laboratories provide a wide variety of instructional resources including, among others, multimedia appli\u00ad cations and development stations, foreign language word process\u00ad ing and language learning materials, and logic simulations. Both laboratories are connected to a central server and to the campus backbone for access to the Internet, World Wide Web, MELVYL, and other research resources. The Macintosh laboratory consists of networked Centris 650 machines with CD-ROM drives. Both labo\u00ad ratories are available to Humanities students, instructors, and staff for class instruction and drop-in purposes. Additional information may be obtained from the HCF Computer Consultant's Office, 213 Humanities Hall, telephone (949) 824-8493, or the HIRC main offices, 269 Humanities Hall, tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6344. Undergraduate Programs HUMANITIES UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 143 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-5132 Robert G. Moeller, Associate Dean In addition to 15 majors and 17 minors, the School also offers a formal concentration in Medieval Studies and courses in Italian, Portuguese, and Russian. The academic counselors in the Humanities Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office, located in 143 Humanities Instructional Building, help all students in planning a program of study. Transfer students in particular need to consult an academic counselor to determine major requirements. Students who expect to pursue graduate study also should consult with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores who are interested in the humanities but who have not chosen a major in the School. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate education and are especially knowledgeable about University regulations, require\u00ad ments in and outside the School, course content, options to major, Humanities 197 and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the vari\u00ad ous disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the undeclared student keep options to a major open, plan a coherent program of humanis\u00ad tic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Many courses are composed of both lectures and required discussion sessions. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on com\u00ad mittees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, by participating as mentors for new Humanities majors, by working as peer academic advisors in the Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. HUMANITIES PEER MENTOR PROGRAM The Humanities Peer Mentor Program is designed to address some of the academic, cultural, and social needs of disadvantaged stu\u00ad dents in the School of Humanities. The program features two\u00ad tiered mentoring, with successful upper-division students mentor\u00ad ing small groups of new students, and the student mentors in tum working with faculty and staff. An undergraduate intern coordi\u00ad nates the activities. Another focus of the program is to encourage and assist student mentors to go on to graduate school. Participants attend workshops on topics such as study skills, library research, time management, and careers, as well as a vari\u00ad ety of social events, and keep journals in which they express their ideas and raise issues for their mentors. Call (949) 824-5132 for additional information. HUMANITIES HONORS PROGRAM 143 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-5132 Richard L. Regosin, Director The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is a two-year, upper-division program designed to challenge superior students from all fields by providing special opportunities for interdiscipli\u00ad nary work within an intellectually charged framework. Small semi\u00ad nars and the opportunity for independent research are some of the advantages offered by the program, which is open by invitation to all UCI students regardless of their majors. Students in the program benefit from their involvement in the cam\u00ad pus community of Humanities scholars. They enjoy a close rela\u00ad tionship with the faculty and profit from intense interaction with their intellectual peers. A comprehensive advising program involv\u00ad ing Honors faculty advisors as well as specially trained Honors peer advisors ensures that Humanities Honors students continually receive timely, individualized advice about their academic careers. Formal as well as informal gatherings, including student-organized social activities ranging from coffee hours to theater parties, aug\u00ad ment a wide range of campus activities. Humanities Honors students have the opportunity to become some of the campus' best informed scholars on a broad range of topics: from artificial intelligence to medical ethics, from Shakespeare to Gilbert and Sullivan, from problems of the ancient Near East to the dilemmas of modernity. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 198 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities Humanities Honors students complete a two-part course of study. In their junior year, students take three quarters of an interdiscipli\u00ad nary Proseminar (Humanities H120) organized about a single topic or problem, such as crime and punishment, the other, the develop\u00ad ment of religion in the West, the self, nature, or the American dream. The sequence is designed to compare and contrast modes of analy\u00ad sis and critical thinking in history, literary studies, and philosophy. In a small seminar setting, students are encouraged to become reflective about their own chosen disciplines. In their senior year, students take a sequence beginning in the fall with a Senior Honors Seminar (Humanities H140), and continuing in the winter and spring with the Senior Honors Thesis (Humani\u00ad ties H141) and the Senior Honors Colloquium (H142), prepared as an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member on a topic chosen by the student. Students present their theses in an informal gathering with their faculty advisors in the spring, and a prize is awarded for the year's outstanding thesis. In both sequences the Honors students benefit from their close association with exceptional scholars and the challenge and sup\u00ad port of their intellectual peers. Students interested in learning how the Humanities Honors Pro\u00ad gram will fit into their regular courses of study are encouraged to contact the Senior Academic Counselor in Humanities; telephone (949) 824-5132. CAMPUSWIDE HONORS PROGRAM The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www. honors.uci.edu/-honors. CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION The Center for International Education, which includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, vol\u00ad unteering, and research. School of Humanities majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of their fields by studying for one year at a university in such countries as China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, or the United Kingdom through EAP. Students can also augment their exposure to other cultures with programs sponsored through lOP. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements Satisfactory completion of the following, which. must be taken for letter grades: Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in compo\u00ad sition, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission; apply in the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modem or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. NOTE: Within the beginning and intermediate foreign language instructional sequences (lA-B-C and 2A-B-C, and for Latin and Greek, 1A-B-C and 25), students must earn a grade of C or better in order to advance to the next level of instruction. Foreign Language Placement. Students entering UCI with previ\u00ad ous foreign language training are placed as follows: in general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school foreign language will normally enroll in 1B-, 1C-, 2A-, or 2B-level language courses, respectively. Exceptions must have the approval of the appropriate course director and the Associate Dean, Under\u00ad graduate Study. Transfer students may not repeat foreign language courses for which they received credit upon matriculation to UCI. Native Speakers of Languages Other Than English. A native speaker of a foreign language, defined by the University as some\u00ad one who attended the equivalent of secondary school in another country where the language of instruction was other than English, may be exempted from taking third-year language study in that language for some majors offered by the School of Humanities. In this case, the student must substitute appropriate upper-division courses in the major to replace the number of exempted courses. For example, if a native speaker of French is exempted from French lOOA and 100B, that student must replace those two courses with two other upper-division French courses offered by the Department of French and Italian. Repeating Deficient Foreign Language Grades. First-and second-year foreign language courses and third-year foreign lan\u00ad guage composition courses are sequential and each is prerequisite to the next. This is generally true also of fourth-year Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. Students wishing to repeat a deficient grade in one of these courses must repeat it prior to continuing on to the next level of the language. A student may not take a lower-level course for credit once a more advanced level has been completed with a passing grade. Maximum Overlap Between Major Requirements: Students completing double majors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both majors simultaneously (i.e., a double major in Comparative Literature and Spanish can count only two upper-division Spanish literature courses for both majors). Maximum Overlap Between Major and Minor Requirements: Students completing majors and minors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both a major and a minor. No course may be counted for two minors. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed successfully at UCI. Completion of a minor program is optional; however, for cer\u00ad tification in a minor, at least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. See individ\u00ad ual major and minor requirements for specific courses. Exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and decided in consultation with the appropriate department or faculty member. Off-campus Internship Policy. In most cases, students are not allowed to earn credit for off-campus internships taken as Indepen\u00ad dent Study in the School of Humanities. However, when the stu\u00ad dent's department or program determines that the internship is aca\u00ad demically appropriate to the student's program and promotes the student's academic goals, credit may be given. A maximum of four units total may be earned for internships; how\u00ad ever, the units may not be counted toward the student's major requirements. The sponsoring department or program and the instructor will in all cases require a substantial academic product, such as a paper, growing out of the internship. A student who wishes to seek approval for an off-campus intern\u00ad ship must file an Independent Study form with the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office prior to beginning the internship. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Graduate Programs HUMANITIES GRADUATE STUDY 176 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-4303 Steven J. Mailloux, Associate Dean The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. Exceptions are the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) and the two-year Master of Arts of Teaching in Spanish. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught by faculty members from various departments. Further, sev\u00ad eral departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students are accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the UCI Department of Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School by serving on committees of the various departments and sitting with the faculty in its meetings.

The program is concerned with both the formal structure of the visual arts and their function within society. Students majoring in the history of art thus are urged to take appropriate courses in classics, history, philosophy, literature, and in other areas of the arts. All majors also are encour\u00ad aged to study a second language beyond the minimum departmen\u00ad tal requirement of two years in a single foreign language at the University level. Art History 199 The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. Study centers of particular interest to Art History majors are in Vienna, Venice, Padua, Madrid, Cairo, Jerusalem, Leningrad, Latin America, France, Great Britain, Ire\u00ad land, and Scandinavia. In addition, students focusing in Asian art may be interested in programs in China, India, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, or Japan; and Chengchi University in Taipei offers a track in English that is devoted to Chinese art and art history. Spe\u00ad cial scholarships are available for Pacific region programs. CAREERS FOR THE ART HISTORY MAJOR A Bachelor's degree in Art History is excellent preparation for pur\u00ad suing either a career as an art historian, art conservator, or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely different discipline. Art History majors have gone on to graduate and professional school to study art history, archaeology, architecture, law, library science, business (in some cases with special focus in the arts), or teacher education. The study of the history of art is a valuable part of a liberal education that provides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present.

Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Professor Emeritus of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Patrick Sinclair, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Department Chair and Associate Professor of Classics (Latin prose, lexicography) Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Professor of Classics (Greek and Latin drama, Greek poetry, Anglo-Latin literature) Undergraduate Program The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergraduate stu\u00ad dent with a working knowledge of the origins and heritage of Greco-Roman civilization. The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of Classical Civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin lan\u00ad guage and literature; and (2) helping students, through courses in Classical literature, history, civilization, mythology, and religion taught through English translations, to appreciate the high achieve\u00ad ments of Greek and Roman culture and their pervasive influence on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics (with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and a major in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion in which most of the required courses are in English transla\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, study of the Classics must be based on competence in both Greek and Latin. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first-year Greek or Latin the student has already been introduced to some of the major Classical authors in the original. From then on, courses are devoted to reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. In addition to their training in the languages, students gain first-hand knowl\u00ad edge of the literature, history, and thought of the ancient world through the close study of some of its finest writers. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for students who do not plan to concentrate on the Classical languages or pursue gradu\u00ad ate study in the Classics, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound knowledge of the Classical world. This major requires one year of study (or its equivalent) in either Greek or Latin and a minimum of 1 0 courses taught in English translation concerning such topics as Classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, drama, and philosophy. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization should obtain a copy of the brochure, Undergraduate Study in Classics, available in the Department office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training can be given advanced standing. Usually, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school Latin (or Greek) will enroll in Latin (or Greek) lB, 1C, 25, and 101 respectively. Placement may vary, depending on the extent of the student's preparation. Students with transfer credit for Greek and/or Latin may not repeat those courses for credit. Students with high school training in the Classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the under\u00ad graduate majors, participate in all open departmental meetings. Representatives are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' interest in curricu\u00ad lum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the acad\u00ad emic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding language placement, prerequisites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, 120 Human\u00ad ities Office Building II, telephone (949) 824-6735. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agree\u00ad ment between the School of Humanities and the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Courses are offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements for Majors Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization.

Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C, or equivalent; or 45A-B-C; four upper-division Classics three additional courses in Classical history, Classical phi\u00ad losophy, or Classical art. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be successfully completed at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Departmental Requirements for Minors The Department offers minors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilization. Greek: Greek 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Greek 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level. Latin: Latin 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. or Classics 45A\u00ad B-C; five upper-division Classics courses, one of which may be in a related field such as history, art history, or philosophy. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising and program planning. Students planning to major (or minor) in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possi\u00ad ble moment to learn about the various programs. Teaching Credentials: For students interested in teaching careers, the UCI Department of Education offers both single subject and multiple subject teaching credential programs. Students who would like to earn a single subject credential to teach Latin at the sec\u00ad ondary level may complete subject-matter requirements through the Department of Classics course offerings. Interested students should consult the Department of Classics Undergraduate Program Direc\u00ad tor and a Department of Education advisor for more information. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The study of the ancient world is a valuable possession for modern life. The discipline of Classics is an important part of a well\u00ad rounded education. Greek and Latin language and literature, his\u00ad tory and philosophy, mythology and religion make an excellent basis for exploring all periods of Western culture down to the pre\u00ad sent day. Classics is an interdisciplinary study, exploring human culture by a variety of methods from a variety of points of view. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in medicine, law, management, and other fields welcome students with training in the Classics. So do many business corporations. Business, industry, and technology are well acquainted with the value of a Classical education. They are aware that students with a strong background in a respected and challenging major such as Classics are disciplined thinkers who can express themselves in clear, coherent, and cogent lan\u00ad guage, capabilities that are considered valuable in future physi\u00ad cians, lawyers, and managers. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the gradu\u00ad ate in Classics or Classical Civilization. A major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate fur\u00ad ther study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, philosophy, and lin\u00ad guistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of the humanities and social sciences. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Classics 203 The Department of Classics encourages students to take advantage of educational opportunities abroad while making progress toward their UCI degree. Classics and Classical Civilization majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of the field by studying for periods ranging from one quarter to one year at any number of universities all over the world through the UC Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program. Students can also augment their exposure to Greek, Latin, and Classical civilizations by studying for a summer or during the academic year in Greece or Italy at programs spon\u00ad sored by other academic institutions through the International Opportunities Program. See the Department of Classics Undergrad\u00ad uate Program Director for additional information.

Students accepted into the program may enroll at any of the three campuses, but normally apply for admission through UCI, which is the main location for instruction and administration. Applications are reviewed by an admissions committee composed of faculty members from all three campuses. The goal of the program is to provide a graduate education that unites the main currents of modern literary, cultural, and social\u00ad scientific theory with the traditional skills and methodologies of classical philology. Candidates for degrees are expected to exhibit facility in Greek and Latin, competence in research, including the\u00ad oretical approaches to texts and objects, technical mastery of com\u00ad puting for research and teaching, and experience in teaching. These goals are realized through the four core courses (Classics 200 A-B\u00ad C and 201), seminars (Classics 220), and reading courses (Classics 205). All entering students are admitted into the Ph.D. program. With the exception of those granted advanced standing because they hold the M.A. degree in Classics from another institution, entering stu\u00ad dents are concurrently enrolled in the M.A. program. The requirements for the M.A. degree are two years (six quarters) of course work, passage of a special set of examinations, and com\u00ad pletion of a master's paper. The normal course load is three 200- level courses each quarter. Minimum course requirements are Clas\u00ad sics 200A-B-C and 201; five quarters of Classics 205; and four quarters of Classics 220. (Classics 280 may be substituted for these courses at the discretion of the faculty.) A reading knowledge of either German, French, Italian, or an equivalent language, demon\u00ad strated by examination or other means, is also required. At the end of a student's M.A. studies, a positive vote of the program faculty is necessary for continuation in the Ph.D. program. The expected time for completion of the M.A. degree is two years. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree are three years (nine quar\u00ad ters) of course work. Minimum course requirements are Classics 200A-B-C and 201; five quarters of Classics 205; and nine quar\u00ad ters of Classics 220 or an equivalent course. (Classics 280 may be substituted for these courses at the discretion of the program fac\u00ad ulty.) Students are encouraged to take courses and seminars in rele\u00ad vant areas outside the program at any of the three campuses. Stu\u00ad dents must demonstrate reading proficiency in a second modern language by the end of their third year. At this stage, and during the fourth year of study, students are expected to have read exten\u00ad sively in the primary texts, in literary history and theory, and in ancient history. In addition, experience in supervised teaching and/or research activity is normally required. In order to qualify as a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage, a student must pass an individually designed set of qualifying examinations, including translation examinations in Greek and Latin, written examinations or lengthy papers in special authors and field, and an oral examination. The expected time for the completion of the Ph.D. degree is six years. The facilities, course offerings, programs, and individual faculty mentorship of all three campuses are available to students in the UC Tri-Campus Graduate Program in Classics. In addition, pro\u00ad gram resources are enhanced through a cooperative teaching arrangement among the Tri-Campus Program and the Classics graduate program at UC Los Angeles and at the University of Southern California. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) is a research center at UCI. TLG has created a digital library of Greek literature, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies. Although administratively separate, TLG is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics. Information is available on page 10.

DEPARTMENT OF EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 443 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-2227 Steven D. Carter, Department Chair Faculty Steven D.

Huang, Ph.D. Washington University, Associate Professor of Chinese (narrative theories and traditional Chinese fiction) Kyung Hyun Kim, Ph.D. University of Southern California, Assistant Professor of Korean Culture (East Asian China, modern Korea, cultural theory) Susan B. Klein, Ph.D. Cornell University, Assistant Professor of Japanese (premodern and modern theater and dance, Japanese religions, feminist critical theory) Affiliated Faculty Kenneth L. Pomeranz, Ph.D. Yale University, Associate Professor of History and East Asian Languages and Literatures (modern Chinese) Anne Walthall, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Professor of History and East Asian Languages and Literatures (early modern and modern Japan) R. Bin Wong, Ph.D. Harvard University, Professor of History and East Asian Languages and Literatures (modern Chinese, comparative economic history) The curriculum in East Asian Languages and Literatures enables students to understand the extensive and rich literary, historical, social, and aesthetic traditions of East Asia through the intensive study of an East Asian language and of literary texts in translation and in the original language. Students take a total of four years of courses in the modem language, in which comprehension, speak\u00ad ing, reading, and writing are stressed. Studies of texts take place throughout the curriculum: the first three years students read texts in translation and the fourth year they read in the original language. The literature-in-translation courses consist of general introductory overviews as well as more specific topics at the intermediate level for those students whose language proficiency is insufficient to cope with difficult literary texts. At the advanced level, course con\u00ad tent focuses on reading texts in the original language and rotates among significant literary and cultural topics. In these courses, the curriculum integrates the study of East Asian literatures with theo\u00ad retical issues that shape the study of world literature in general. In this way, the student gains the dual perspectives of studying East Asian cultures on their own terms as well as recognizing the affini\u00ad ties these civilizations share with the emerging world culture. CAREERS FOR THE MAJOR Studies in East Asian languages and literatures will give the stu\u00ad dent the intensive linguistic and cultural preparation needed to pur\u00ad sue a career involving these important Pacific Rim nations. In an era in which the United States is seeking to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities presented by this vital area of the world, the training in language and literature offered by the depart\u00ad mental faculty will serve the student well in a variety of endeavors, such as international business, law, government service, journal\u00ad ism, teaching, and other careers involved with public affairs. Undergraduate studies in an East Asian language are also a valu\u00ad able preparation for those students intent upon pursuing graduate study in any field of East Asian language or culture. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program The Department offers three undergraduate majors: the B.A. degree program in Chinese Language and Literature, the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in Japanese Language and Literature, and the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in East Asian Cultures. In addition, minors are offered in Chi\u00ad nese Language and Literature and Japanese Language and Literature. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program that both fulfills the requirements of the major and covers the student's areas of interest in allied fields outside East Asian Languages and Literatures. Students are placed in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school language taken in the United States is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school work will most often enroll in levels lB, lC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Students with background in an Asian language gained through primary or secondary school work taken in Asia must consult with the faculty to determine their proper placement level. Those who have gained substantial knowl\u00ad edge of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean either through secondary school work or through college-level language courses may not UC IRVINE - 1999-2000repeat those courses for credit. Prospective majors who place out of the upper-division language requirement are expected to substi\u00ad tute an equivalent number of other courses to be selected in con\u00ad sultation with their advisor. The faculty encourages students to study abroad, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently, after completing at least two years of study (or its equivalent) of the rel\u00ad evant language at UCI. Additional information is available in the Department office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements for the Majors Three separate majors: Chinese Language and Literature, Japanese Language and Literature, and East Asian Cultures. Chinese Language and Literature: Completion of Chinese 3C or equivalent; Chinese 100A-B-C, 101A-B-C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the literature or cul\u00ad ture of another East Asian country; and at least four additional courses in Chinese literature, history, art history, linguistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower-division East Asian course offered by the Department. Japanese Language and Literature: Completion of Japanese 2C or equivalent; Japanese 3A-B-C, 100A-B, 101A-B-C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the litera\u00ad ture or culture of another East Asian country; and at least five additional courses in Japanese literature, history, art history, lin\u00ad guistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower\u00ad division East Asian course offered by the Department. East Asian Cultures: Completion of Chinese 3C, Japanese 3C, or East Asian Languages and Literatures (Korean) 3C; two quarters of East Asian Languages and Literatures 155, with different topics; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; and nine additional upper-division courses, at least three of which must pertain to a country other than the one of language specialization; up to four of these courses may be taken outside the Department, with the approval of the undergraduate advisor. Residence Requirement for the Majors: At least five upper\u00ad division courses required for the major must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. Students are encouraged, however, to complete up to a year of their language study in approved programs of study abroad. Requirements for the Minors Two separate minors: Chinese Language and Literature and Japan\u00ad ese Language and Literature. Chinese Language and Literature: A three-quarter sequence selected from Chinese 3A-B-C, 100A-B-C, or 101A-B-C; and four courses selected from the East Asian Languages and Literatures offerings on Chinese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Chinese. Japanese Language and Literature: Either Japanese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B, or 101A-B-C; and four courses (or five courses, if the lOOA-B sequence has been chosen) selected from the East Asian Languages and Literatures offerings on Japanese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Japanese. Residence Requirements for the Minors: A minimum of four upper-division courses required for the minor must be successfully completed at UCI. East Asian Languages and Literatures 207 Graduate Program The Department offers a program of graduate study leading to the Ph.D. degree in East Asian Languages and Literatures, with con\u00ad centrations in Chinese, Japanese, and East Asian Cultural Studies. The M.A. degree may be awarded to Ph.D. students in progress toward the doctoral degree. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. The graduate program emphasizes rigorous training in language and textual analysis, with equal attention given to the historical, social, and cultural dimensions of literary study. In addition to more traditional vocabularies of criticism and theory, the curricu\u00ad lum encourages exploration of recent challenges to established conceptual and methodological frameworks. The program builds on the foundation of a faculty whose research interests engage major issues in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean literature and cul\u00ad ture, while developing connections with the larger community of scholarship at UCI. An emphasis in Critical Theory is available to graduate students in all departments of the School of Humanities. Because the graduate program is designed to prepare students for both college-level teaching and advanced research, each student will be required to serve, under direct faculty supervision, as a teaching assistant in an appropriate undergraduate course offered through the Department. As noted below, one quarter's worth of this teaching may be counted as part of the required course work toward completion of the degree. Assuming that a student is enrolled full-time and enters the pro\u00ad gram with no major deficiencies in background or training, normal time needed to complete the Ph.D. degree is six years from matric\u00ad ulation. For students admitted with an M.A. degree or its equiva\u00ad lent from another institution, certain course requirements may be waived upon the approval of a faculty advisory committee, with a consequent reduction in normative time for completion of the Ph.D. MASTER OF ARTS IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Students are not admitted to an M.A.-only degree program but may be granted an M.A. in recognition of progress toward the Ph.D., normally after six quarters of course work and submission of two approved seminar papers, which will serve as the M.A. examination. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Requirements for Admission In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, specified by the Office of Graduate Studies, all students must present the following for review by an admis\u00ad sions committee composed of members of the faculty in East Asian Languages and Literatures: records of prior scholastic perfor\u00ad mance, including all college transcripts; three letters of recommen\u00ad dation; samples of written work; and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. Although the Department does not require entering students to have received an undergraduate degree comparable to its own, it recommends as much preparation in an East Asian language as possible. It also welcomes applications from students whose language training may not be as extensive but who have shown promise in the study of related disciplines. The study of appropriate European languages is encouraged as well. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 208 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities General Requirements Upon admission to the program, the student is assigned a graduate advisor, in consultation with whom an advisory committee consist\u00ad ing of two additional faculty members is constituted. The student and committee plan a program of study consisting of 15 graduate courses. Before advancement to candidacy (normally after three years of graduate study), the student must have: (1) completed required course work as detailed below; (2) prepared one paper of publish\u00ad able quality; (3) completed language requirements as listed below; (4) prepared five research reports on current scholarly articles to be decided upon in consultation with the faculty advisor; and (5) passed the qualifying examinations on four topics to be selected in consultation with the faculty advisory committee no more than two quarters before the examinations are to be taken. At least one of the topics should be related directly to the student's projected area of specialization in dissertation research. Students who complete the qualifying examinations successfully are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. They then write their doctoral dissertation on a topic developed in consultation with the faculty advisory committee. Some period of study abroad, for enhancement of language proficiency and/or dissertation research, is strongly encouraged. Concentration in Chinese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Chinese 201-204; Chinese 211A-B or 212A-B; Chinese 213A\u00ad B; Chinese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consulta\u00ad tion with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on a relevant topic in liter\u00ad ary or cultural theory. Courses taken to fulfill language require\u00ad ments may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Language Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all students must have completed four years of modem Chinese, two years of classical Chinese, and three years of modem Japanese, and have demonstrated reading proficiency in another appropriate language. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. In addition, the requirement for a second year of classical Chinese may be fulfilled by taking three reading courses in classical literature. Concentration in Japanese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Japanese 201-204; Japanese 211A-B or 212A-B; Japanese 213A-B; Japanese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon con\u00ad sultation with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on relevant topics in literary or cultural theory. Courses taken to fulfill language require\u00ad ments may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Language Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all students must have completed four years of modem Japanese and one year of classical Japanese, and have demonstrated reading pro\u00ad ficiency in another appropriate language. In addition, students emphasizing classical Japanese are required to take one year of classical Chinese. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. Concentration in East Asian Cultural Studies Course Work. Each student is required to complete: four Theory and Cultural Studies graduate courses; four graduate courses in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consultation with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on rele\u00ad vant topics. Courses taken to fulfill language requirements may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Other Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all stu\u00ad dents must have completed examinations in four areas as deter\u00ad mined upon consultation with faculty advisors. These areas will vary according to the interests of the student; examples might be Colonial and Postcolonial Theories; Modernity and East Asia; Cri\u00ad tique of Asian Studies as a field; Gender, Class and East Asia; Visual Culture and Japan; and Theorizing Minority Status in East Asia. All students must have completed four years of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, or the equivalent. Three years or the equiva\u00ad lent in a second East Asian language is recommended. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. Courses in Chinese UNDERGRADUATE 1A-B-C Fundamental Mandarin Chinese (5-5-5) F, W, S.

Wlecke, Ph.D. Michigan State University, Professor Emeritus of English (English and American Romanticism, teaching of composition) Geoffrey Wolff, Novelist and Biographer, Director of Fiction, Programs in Writing, and Professor of English and Creative Writing (creative writing, fiction, biography) The Department of English and Comparative Literature is con\u00ad cerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criticism to the intel\u00ad lectual issues of the day. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is crit\u00ad ical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 212 UCI1999-2000 School of Humanities Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental affairs through elected representatives to departmental committees. Each quarter both undergraduate and graduate students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate their courses and teachers. CAREERS FOR THE ENGLISH OR COMPARATIVE LITERATURE MAJOR The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public rela\u00ad tions, business, and management. An undergraduate major in either English or Comparative Literature is an especially good prepara\u00ad tion for graduate study. Departmental advisors encourage their students to investigate vari\u00ad ous careers-especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these students have completed their undergraduate educations. For those students interested in going on for a credential in sec\u00ad ondary school teaching, UCI has a CCTC-approved single-subject\u00ad matter preparation program in English. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a variety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of English, American, and comparative literature. The Programs in Writing, which offer an emphasis in the writing of poetry or fiction. Undergraduate courses in nonfiction are also available. The aim of these programs is to encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category I). The Program in Comparative Literature, which, though admin\u00ad istratively a part of the Department, is basically interdisciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modem and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern educated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the his\u00ad tory of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal compe\u00ad tently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bach\u00ad elor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bache\u00ad lor's degree in Comparative Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements for the English Major Three courses selected from E 28A (orE 28D), E or CL 50A (in some cases, students who change their majors to English after taking E 6, E 7, E 8 may petition to substitute one of those courses for a course from theE 28 series); CR lOOA; CR lOOB and 102B, E 102C, E 102D; at least three more Departmental courses numbered 102 or above (excluding E 140, E 150, WR 139, or WR 179); and either E 105 or CL 105. Competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at UCI (in classical languages, lA-B-C, 25, 101, 102) plus (in modem languages) one course in a foreign literature in which texts are read in the original language. (Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Russian, may ordinarily require three years of language study as preparation for the study of literature; students who wish to use such languages should consult with the Department about satisfaction of this requirement before doing so.) Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flexibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. Residence Requirement for the English Major: CR lOOA, CR lOOB, and three E 102s must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the English Minor Three courses selected from E 28A (orE 28D), E 6, E 7, E 8, CL 8, including at least one quarter of E 28; and at least five English or writing courses numbered 102 or higher (excluding WR 139), although two courses from the following may be substituted: CR lOOA, CR lOOB, WR lOOB, CL 100, Residence Requirement for the English Minor: Four upper\u00ad division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or clas\u00ad sical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Literature majors are normally required to take CL 50A, B, C. Transfer stu\u00ad dents may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR lOOA, CL 100 twice, two courses (one 101 and one above 101) in a selected foreign language, or two lOis in two dif\u00ad ferent foreign languages, or two years of a classical language; two courses from CL 103 or CL 104; three additional upper-division courses chosen from the offerings in comparative literature, Eng\u00ad lish, literary criticism, and creative writing. Courses in allied areas, e.g., history, philosophy, social science, may be counted toward the major if they deal with literary or philosophical texts, though prior approval of a faculty advisor is necessary. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Major: CR 100A and four upper-division English or Comparative Litera\u00ad ture courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL 50A, B, C, CR lOOA, CL 100, CL 103 or 104 (three courses), and one upper-division literature course taught in a foreign language. Residence Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students should plan coherent programs of study with their faculty advisors, including undergraduate seminars, workshops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an English or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional training in government, law, or medicine. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. UCI has a CCTC-approved single subject preparation program in English: interested students should contact the Department for fur\u00ad ther information. Students who intend to pursue a single-subject or multiple-subject teaching credential should consult the UCI Depart\u00ad ment of Education as early as possible to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to study abroad through the Education Abroad Program. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or your academic counselor for additional information. Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of work on the undergradu\u00ad ate level-English and American Literature, Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well. The faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature may stress in their qualifying examinations and dissertations. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature pro\u00ad grams unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies, admits students to these programs. Each program has a .director appointed by the Department Chair, but there are close administra\u00ad tive and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be established by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, for\u00ad eign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. English and Comparative Literature 213 Applicants for graduate degrees in English must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Subject Test in Literature in English; applicants to the Comparative Literature program need not submit the Subject Test in Literature in English. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the acade\u00ad mic year. The normal expectation is enrollment in three courses each quarter; Teaching Assistants take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teach\u00ad ing should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken .within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English or the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teach\u00ad ing and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. can\u00ad didates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to partici\u00ad pate in this program. Candidates for the Ph.D. are expected to acquire experience in teaching. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. The Murray Krieger Endowed Fellowship in Literary Theory was awarded for the first time in the 1996-97 academic year. It is intended for an outstanding entering graduate student who is pur\u00ad suing the Ph.D. in English or Comparative Literature and who demonstrates a primary interest in theory as theory relates to liter\u00ad ary texts. This prestigious grant is the foremost fellowship in the Humanities and one of the largest at UCI. The five-year support package is worth over $92,000. Also included is a readership and study space in the Rene Wellek Collection at the UCI Library, in addition to benefits such as priority housing and access to child care. A range of other fellowships is also available to students in the Department. Emphasis in Feminist Studies A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. ENGLISH Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accom\u00ad plished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Grad\u00ad uate Committee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable, and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. The Department of English and Comparative Literature sponsors a Summer M.A. Program in English designed for teachers. The M.A. degree in English is awarded to candidates who complete 32 units of graduate course work through two consecutive summers in the program and submit an acceptable Master's essay. Applicants from outside the State of California may apply for the program. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 214 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities Master of Fine Arts in English . The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-to three-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two-thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the stu\u00ad dent's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length man\u00ad uscript of poetry or short stories or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); profi\u00ad ciency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, modem or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on des\u00ad ignated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the student's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading compe\u00ad tence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evidence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Competence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of translation; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the .student is examined in four areas: (1) literary theory and criticism; (2) literary form; (3) histor\u00ad ical period of English and/or American literature; and (4) selected major authors. The student has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an indi\u00ad vidual to demonstrate breadth of historical knowledge and literary understanding and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examina\u00ad tion as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to disser\u00ad tation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral examination on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. COMPARATIVE liTERATURE Applicants to the Comparative Literature program must hold a B.A. or equivalent degree and should normally have majored in Comparative Literature, English, or a foreign literature. Majors in other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, history) can \u00b7be considered, pro\u00ad vided that a sufficient background in literature and literary theory, as well as in at least one foreign language, is demonstrated. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a professional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually expected of all doctoral students, but other languages (for instance, Spanish, Italian, Russian, or an Asian language) may be substituted. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialization may require the mastery of still other languages. An important part of the foreign language requirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary or theoretical text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions in\u00ad volved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. In addition to the emphases in Feminist Studies and Critical The\u00ad ory available in the School of Humanities, graduate students in Comparative Literature may choose to complete an emphasis in French. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Entering students are assigned a faculty advisor who usually serves as the chair of the student's M.A. examination committee (which consists of at least two other members of the faculty). The M.A. examination is normally taken during the quarter in which the stu\u00ad dent completes the course work; nine courses, including at least one CL 220, an~ required. The candidate submits an M.A. paper as well as a statement of purpose outlining past and future course work and preliminary plans for the qualifying examination. The M.A. examination itself consists of a discussion of the student's paper and the statement Of purpose. In practice, the examination resembles an extended advising session, but with particularly close attention given to the student's paper. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program in Comparative Literature is designed to pre\u00ad pare the student for a professional career in literary studies. Details of the program may be found in the departmental graduate student handbook. Normally, students who have not done graduate work at another university complete at least 16 courses before the qualify\u00ad ing examination, including two translation seminars (CL 220). Upon completion of the course work, the student takes a general examination based on six topics formulated by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the four faculty members who will make up the exam\u00ad ination committee. The topics should combine historical breadth and some generic variety with special fields. The examination is part written, part oral, according to a formula decided by the stu\u00ad dent and the committee. The examination as a whole should reflect the student's ability to work in at least two foreign languages. After passing the qualifying examination, the student forms a dis\u00ad sertation committee of three faculty members, formulates a disser\u00ad tation topic in consultation with them, and submits a prospectus for the dissertation along with a preliminary bibliography. The study toward the Doctor of Philosophy degree culminates in the writing of a suitable dissertation, often on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general lit\u00ad erary and theoretical problems not confined to any specific litera\u00ad tures are also acceptable.

Whether printed on roadside billboards or broadcast into our homes via television, the media greatly influence our sense of who we are and how we live. Yet so much of our exposure to the sights and sounds of film, TV, video, advertising, and new technologies is taken for granted. Those sights and sounds are so pervasive, and in many cases so enjoyable, that we rarely pause to consider how they act upon us and how we interact with them. An undergraduate education in Film Studies provides students with an opportunity to explore the appeal and to begin to understand the operation of these complex meaning-producing machines we call cinema, tele\u00ad vision, and new technologies. The course work leading to the B.A. degree in Film Studies trains students to read and understand the audio-visual languages of mod\u00ad ern media and new technologies and to analyze images from socioeconomic, political, aesthetic, and historical perspectives. Learning these critical viewing skills involves learning new ways of seeing. The Film Studies curriculum is systematic and compre\u00ad hensive; upper-division courses have between 20 and 50 students and are typically taught by regular faculty. During the 1998-99 academic year, there were more than 95 Film Studies majors enrolled at UCI. Film Studies 217 The program in Film Studies familiarizes students with the history, theory, and art of cinema and other media. Courses focus on a range of topics, including individual directors, period styles, gen\u00ad res, national cinemas, the history and criticism of television, and developments in new technologies. Additional courses offer stu\u00ad dents hands-on experience in video production and screenwriting. The program provides its majors with a thorough appreciation of the modern media's roles in contemporary society. Regular course offerings are complemented by film and video screenings and series at the School of Humanities Film and Video Center. Film Studies, in cooperation with other units at UCI, regularly invites scholars, directors, producers, and screenwriters to campus to share their work and perspectives with students. Film Studies at UCI is unique in its concentration on the history, theory, and criticism of cinema, television, and new technologies. The faculty has published books and articles on topics that include images of the Vietnam war, avant-garde directors, ethnographic film, film and postmodernism, horror cinema, women filmmakers, television performance, and new technologies. In order to cover the extra costs generated by the purchase and rental of media and production equipment demanded by the spe\u00ad cialized Film Studies curriculum, the School of Humanities charges a laboratory fee of $20 per course to all students taking Film Studies courses. Film Studies students can complete professional internships in the fields of film or television production, distribution, writing, and related areas for elective course credit. Film Studies students also have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through the University's Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program. Information in available both in the Film Studies Office and the Education Abroad Program Office. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Film Studies will provide students with a variety of opportunities leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. Graduates from the program have gone on to a host of different careers. Some have pursued graduate work in critical film studies at leading institutions such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Iowa. Others have entered M.F.A. programs in production at places like the University of Southern California, UCLA, or San Fran\u00ad cisco State University. Many are now at work in various sectors of the entertainment industry as feature film editors, executives in video distribution companies, technicians for local news programs, and independent filmmakers. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Rabine, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of French (nineteenth\u00ad century French literature and women's studies) Richard L. Regosin, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of French (sixteenth-century French literature) Undergraduate Program in French The Undergraduate Program in French offers a broad humanistic course of study designed for students in the liberal arts. The orien\u00ad tation of the program is multidisciplinary, where the study of liter\u00ad ature is linked to critical, cultural, and historical concerns. Courses reflect the faculty's interest in the related disciplines of history, philosophy, anthropology, women's studies, cultural studies, and comparative literature, and express its conviction that the study of French literature and culture is enriched by pursuing its relations with other disciplines, fields, and cultures. French and Italian 219 Lower-division language courses encourage students to participate in the creative process of language, to think in French as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. These courses are taught entirely in French, and the approach to teaching stresses the inter\u00ad dependence of the four basic language skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Laboratory is used to comple\u00ad ment classroom activity. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary lit\u00ad erary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversa- . tion, reading, and composition. After the second year, advanced courses in conversation and writing enable students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in the multidisciplinary upper-division program. All upper-division offerings are taught in the seminar mode. Because classes are limited in size, they promote and encourage participation and discussion and facilitate direct contact with pro\u00ad fessors. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied in their historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical concepts and vocabularies. At the more advanced level, the multidisciplinary courses bring together material and methodologies from the various disciplines in order to address interpretive problems of French literature, culture, and history. In recent years, courses have been offered in literature and political opposition, monsters and madness in Renaissance literature, ethnography and literature, women and sexuality, autobiography, and the supernatural in nineteenth-century narrative. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both fac\u00ad ulty and students. Students are placed in French courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school French is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school French will enroll in French lB, lC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Exceptions to this place\u00ad ment formula must be approved by the appropriate course director. Students with transfer credit for college-level French may not repeat those courses for credit. Student representatives serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. CAREERS FOR THE FRENCH MAJOR The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in business and commerce, where they can take advantage not only of their proficiency in French language but also of their knowledge of French literature and culture. Many students also go on to law school, to medical school, and to careers in the diplomatic service. In recent years, graduates have entered the field of education in increasing numbers. The Department's multidisciplinary approach to the study of literature teaches students to think critically and develops analytical skills that can be applied to a wide range of problems. It also helps students to develop the interpretive and writing skills necessary to express their own ideas clearly and per\u00ad suasively. Whether they enter business or professions such as law, education, or government, French majors acquire the intellectual and communicative skills requisite for success. The UCI Career Center provides service to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 220 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements for the Major French lOOA-B, lOlA-B-C, and nine other upper-division courses taught in the Department. Students may take up to two courses from the Department offerings taught in English. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper\u00ad division courses (above 101A-B-C) required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French lOOA-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper-division. Prerequisite: French 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and. the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to fulfill the major requirements. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or indepen\u00ad dently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with faculty members concerning career plans in areas such as teaching, industry, journalism, law, and civil service. Undergraduate Program in Italian The Department offers a minor in Italian. Lower-division courses gradually develop the student's mastery of spoken and written Ital\u00ad ian and, as the sequence progresses, introduce readings in literature and culture. A third-year, two-quarter sequence is designed to improve the stu\u00ad dent's proficiency in aural and written comprehension as well as in speaking and writing skills. A three-quarter introduction to Italian literature acquaints the student with major historical periods and genres, and introduces the student to various critical concepts and vocabulary. Tutorial and seminar courses provide the advanced stu\u00ad dent with an opportunity for in-depth study of a single author, criti\u00ad cal problem, or historical period. From year to year, the Depart\u00ad ment's offerings in literature vary considerably; students interested in planning course work in Italian should consult with Department of French and Italian faculty. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which com\u00ad bines Italian literature, culture, history, art, and music. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Italian lOOA-B, lOlA-B-C, 130, and one other course outside the Department on Italian history, film, art, or other aspect of Italian culture, chosen in consultation with Department of French and Italian faculty. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Graduate Program in French The Department of French and Italian offers a graduate program in French with a strong theoretical, cultural, and multidisciplinary ori\u00ad entation. In addition to their specialties in the traditionally consti\u00ad tuted fields of French literature, the faculty is actively involved in related disciplines such as philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropol\u00ad ogy, history, women's studies, cultural studies, and comparative lit\u00ad erature. A theoretical and multidisciplinary approach to literature is a demanding one requiring, among other things, a restless critique of its own evaluations and concepts. In small seminars designed to stimulate intellectual exchange, stu\u00ad dents and faculty explore literature written in French within the context of relevant historical, cultural, or theoretical issues. They raise questions engaged by literary discourse and study critically the theories formulated to account for it. Courses tend to cross lines between disciplines and to emphasize both the close reading of texts and modern theories of history, culture, literature, and crit\u00ad icism. Students are encouraged to pursue their work in related fields outside the Department. They are also strongly encouraged to study abroad at some point during their graduate career. MASTER OF ARTS IN FRENCH The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doc\u00ad torate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral program. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses. All entering graduate stu\u00ad dents are counseled by the graduate advisor. During the winter quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign lan\u00ad guage in addition to French is required for the M.A. degree (profi\u00ad ciency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass the Master's examination. Plan I allows particularly well-prepared students to receive special permission to take nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. Under Plan II candidates take a mini\u00ad mum of 11 courses and have the option of taking a written exami\u00ad nation or of writing a research paper. The written examination con\u00ad sists of essays that demonstrate skills of literary analysis and an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts. The research paper involves a care\u00ad fully developed and well-documented analysis that reflects exten\u00ad sive critical reading. In all cases students also take an oral exami\u00ad nation that focuses on the written essays or the research paper and that seeks as well to test the student's broader knowledge. The Master's examination is normally given at the end of the win\u00ad ter quarter of the second year of studies. Students who are Teach\u00ad ing Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Students transferring to the program from other graduate institu\u00ad tions may receive credit for up to two courses, subject to the approval of the Department. A maximum of five courses may be transferable from other UC graduate programs, with departmental approval. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN FRENCH Upon successful completion of the Master's examination and admission to the Ph.D. program, or upon admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Committee is appointed in consultation with the student. The Guidance Com\u00ad mittee advises the student in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advance\u00ad ment to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The Committee is com\u00ad prised of five faculty members: three from the Department, one from outside the Department who represents the student's outside area of specialization, and, for the qualifying examination, another faculty member not affiliated with the Department who represents the faculty-at-large. One member of the Committee is expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 15 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A. and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specializa\u00ad tion are required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in the Department and in the Critical Theory Program beyond the minimum number required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with an emphasis in Comparative Literature by taking a minimum of five courses in the Comparative Literature program. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination-Written and Oral: Upon completion of course work, the student takes a series of examinations involving problems of a critical and interpretive nature. The Ph.D. Examina\u00ad tion encourages focus and depth at a time when the student's area of specialization and eventual dissertation topic should be taking an increasingly clearer shape. In consultation with the Guidance Com\u00ad mittee, the student defines the precise nature and scope of four top\u00ad ics for the examination, which consists of written and oral parts. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee which directs the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Saine, Ph.D. Yale University, Professor of German (eighteenth\u00ad century German literature, Goethe) John H. Smith, Ph.D. Princeton University, Associate Professor of German (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature and intellectual history, literary theory) The Department of German pursues a program of German studies as part of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate cul\u00ad ture. Departmental courses are focused on language, literature, and film in context, that is, within the historical, social, intellectual, and political circumstances of their production and continuing recep\u00ad tion. Clearly, we come to understand ourselves and our immediate culture much better through the study of different languages and cultural systems. Therefore, university language study is not merely a matter of memorizing vocabulary and practicing pronunciation. It is the serious investigation of a foreign linguistic system and the cultures which are defined by it. It is difficult-in fact, nearly impossible-for us to scrutinize and analyze something we know as intimately as our native language, and yet this is the order by which we formulate our thoughts and the order which may some\u00ad times formulate our thoughts for us. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language allows us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. This kind of knowledge of one's native language is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, jour\u00ad nalistic, and others. Thus, serious study of a foreign language is absolutely crucial to a university education. The Department teaches its language courses with this principle in mind and seeks to provide its students with a framework for these linguistic and cultural comparisons. Department literature and film courses offer a variety of critical perspectives from historical, social, or politically engaged readings to feminist and post-structuralist analysis. Topics range from stud\u00ad ies of individual authors, periods, and genres to the history of Ger\u00ad man-language literature and film, the theory of criticism, and the relations of German-language literature to other literatures. German 223 Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases, one in literature and another in linguistics. The majority of students choose the lit\u00ad erature major. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses, students develop an understanding of the language and its cultural context while learning the necessary skills for oral and limited written communication. Sessions in the language laboratory, the recently updated Language Learning Resource Center, assist students with their speaking and listening skills. By the end of the first year, stu\u00ad dents have learned the basic structure of the German language as they develop fundamental reading, writing, and speaking skills and listening comprehension. The intermediate and advanced levels reinforce these basic skills, while concentrating on increasing reading speed, writing fluency, and cultural competency. After completion of the intermediate level, students enroll in the Introduction to Literature course (German 101), which provides an introduction to genre, periodization, and the German terminology used in critical analysis. This course is taken in preparation for the upper-division literature and film courses (German 102, 117, 118, 119, 120), which range historically from the Reformation to the present and cover a variety of topics and approaches. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 160) is taught in English for both German students and those who do not speak the language, and covers topics in literary theory and criticism as well as German\u00ad language cinema. Students are encouraged to participate in work-and study-abroad programs during the summer and their junior year. The Department recommends the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP) in Gottingen, Germany. Gottingen is an old university town in central Germany, where EAP students complete an advanced language program and enroll in university courses with great success, usu\u00ad ally achieving native or near-native fluency during this exciting year abroad. All EAP courses taken in Gottingen are accepted for UCI graduation credit and many contribute to fulfillment of the German major and minor requirements. More information is avail\u00ad able from your academic counselor. Students are placed in German courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in Ger\u00ad man lB, lC, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second\u00ad year German instruction. Students with transfer credit for college\u00ad level German may not repeat those courses. CAREERS FOR THE GERMAN MAJOR The ability to speak and write German can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, gov\u00ad ernment, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Because German plays such an important role in modern technology, employers in international law, business, the foreign serviCe, the airline industry, journalism, professional translating, and all levels of education increasingly seek students with a knowledge of German. German is excellent preparation for .profes\u00ad sional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sciences, business and management, and the computer sci\u00ad ences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the arts. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 224 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54--59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements for the German Major with Literature Emphasis German 100A, B, C; German 101; eight upper-division literature courses; and two courses selected from German 140, 150, 160, Linguistics 3, English and Comparative Literature CL 50A, B, C, a course in German history, German philosophy, or German political science, as approved by the advisor for the major. The upper-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement must be met by additional course work either within or outside the Department. Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. Departmental Requirements for the German Major with Linguistic Emphasis German 100A, B, C; German 101; five upper-division literature courses; Linguistics 3, 10, 20; one course selected from Linguistics 170, a Middle High German course, or a course in the history of the German Language; one course selected from German 140, 150, 160. The upper-division writing requirement must be met by addi\u00ad tional course work either within or outside the Department. The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended espe\u00ad cially for students who intend to do graduate work in linguistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five of the upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses, which must include German 100A, B, C and German 101. Not more than one course from German 140, 150, or 160 may be counted for the minor. German 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students into direct contact with some of the outstanding scholars in the field of German Studies. Distinguished Visiting Professors typically visit for one quarter, during which they teach a graduate course and an undergraduate course and present a lecture to which students, faculty, and other members of the University community are invited. Program participants include Bengt Algot S~renson (Odense), Uwe Ketelsen (Bochum), Peter State), Hans Wysling (Zurich), Hans-Wolf Jager (Bremen), Norbert Oellers (Bonn), Hans Rudolf Vaget (Smith College), Heinrich Detering (Gottingen), Martens (Koln), and Ulker Gokberk (Reed College). Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical under\u00ad standing of the nature of literature and culture. Seminars focus on German literary and cultural development after 1700. An emphasis in Critical Theory is available to graduate students in all depart\u00ad ments of the School of Humanities. A graduate emphasis in Femi\u00ad nist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. The graduate program in German is essentially a program leading to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in acade\u00ad mic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after comple\u00ad tion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another insti\u00ad tution, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. MASTER OF ARTS IN GERMAN Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Nor\u00ad mally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered indi\u00ad vidually by the faculty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign lan\u00ad guage other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this require\u00ad ment before entering the program. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German lit\u00ad erature, both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works on the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter of the year in which the candidate expects to receive the M.A. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially famil\u00ad iar. In its final form (including works read during the course of study both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the stu\u00ad dent's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's method\u00ad ological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay .in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the can\u00ad didate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the follow\u00ad ing items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Year of Residence. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN GERMAN The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. These may inchide courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, and others suitable for the individual student's program of study. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current dur\u00ad ing the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individ\u00ad ually as to remaining course requirements. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervision of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 courses required for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the exami\u00ad nation. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the student will choose either (1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examina\u00ad tion (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agreement with the candidate's examination committee. The exam\u00ad ination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the writ\u00ad ten examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate read\u00ad ing knowledge of two languages or extensive competence in one language other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these require\u00ad ments may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and comple\u00ad tion of the dissertation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the signature page of the dissertation.

The Department presents a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disci\u00ad plinary skills: weighing evidence, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. The Department offers a number of lower-division courses open to nonmajors as well as majors, most of which fulfill part of the UCI breadth requirement. The Department requires all majors to take a survey course in world history, United States history, European history, Latin American history, or East Asian history. These courses are also open to nonmajors. Students who are interested in the study of history but are major\u00ad ing in other disciplines may minor in History. The minor incorpo\u00ad rates elements of the Department's program for majors but allows students enough flexibility to pursue programs in other depart\u00ad ments and schools. Upper-division courses range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., Chinese history), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History); to his\u00ad torical analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women in the United States). Students are also provided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of col\u00ad loquia in social history, political history, international history, intel\u00ad lectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The collo\u00ad quia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The research seminar is a one\u00ad quarter seminar in primary materials that culminates in the writing of a research paper. The faculty encourages History majors and minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward their UCI degree. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that can provide other perspectives on history. See the Center for International Edu\u00ad cation section of the Catalogue or your academic counselor for additional information. CAREERS FOR THE HISTORY MAJOR The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to under\u00ad stand themselves and their world. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to grad\u00ad uate school in a variety of fields, including history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and professional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publishing, and government service. History 227 The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements tor the Major Fourteen courses are required: a year-long survey selected from world history (History 21A, 21B, 21C), United States history (His\u00ad European history (History Latin American history (History 42A, history (History 43A, 43B, 43C); five upper-division History courses; two colloquia (History 190), one of which is followed by a research seminar (History 192); and three additional lower-or upper-division History courses. If a student has satisfied the survey requirement with United States or European history, then at least two of the other required History courses selected must deal with Latin American, East Asian, Mid\u00ad dle Eastern, North African, or world history. Conversely, if a stu\u00ad dent has satisfied the survey requirement with Latin American or East Asian history, then at least two of the other required History courses selected must deal with United States or European history. Residence Requirement for the Major: Three history courses, a colloquium, and a research seminar must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. Departmental Requirements tor the Minor Seven courses are required: a year-long survey in world history (History 21A, 21B, 21C), United States history (History 40A, 40B, 40C), European history (History 41A, 41B, 41C), Latin American history (History 42A, Asian history (History 43A, 43B, 43C); and four upper-division History courses. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper\u00ad division History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both advanced histori\u00ad cal skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combi\u00ad nation of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with significant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodologically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of history and theory. Candidates for an advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experi\u00ad ence as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a teaching assistant. Basic to the curriculum is the Department's course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical stud\u00ad ies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity, to the groups who dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most sat\u00ad isfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self-consciousness and methodological facility have been systematically and carefully developed. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 228 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities The colloquium, a reading course that examines a field's chief his\u00ad torical works, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and develops critical reading skills. A collo\u00ad quium series is offered annually in American history; biannually (depending on demand) in modern European history, early modern European history, Latin American history, East Asian history, and ancient history; and occasionally in medieval history. A student may prepare a dissertation in any of these fields. In addition to the History and Theory sequence and the major field colloquia, students also take a proseminar/research seminar sequence during their first year. The proseminar provides an orien\u00ad tation to the literature on a broad historical subject, and the associ\u00ad ated seminar offers guidance in research and writing on problems within this broad area. Students awarded M.A. degrees at other institutions before entering the graduate program at UCI may be exempted from this requirement, subject to evaluation of their M.A. theses. During the second year of study, Ph.D. students normally take a colloquium series in their second field. They also take a two-quar\u00ad ter research seminar where they have an opportunity to work on problems of their own choosing; students who entered the program with an M.A. degree must also take this seminar. In addition, inde\u00ad pendent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop two fields of competence in addition to History and Theory. Compe\u00ad tence in the two fields is demonstrated by the satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of three courses in each of these areas. A comprehensive oral examination on the student's major field follows fulfillment of all degree requirements. However, those students who elect a second field administered by another program or department (e.g., Critical Theory) must complete requirements, which sometimes include a written examination, for that field. Competence in History and Theory is demonstrated by satisfactory completion of History 200A and 200B. History 200C may be taken as an elective. The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Students have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical community at UCI in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. MASTER OF ARTS IN HISTORY Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also accepts students who have previously special\u00ad ized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergradu\u00ad ate grade point average of 3.3 (B+) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation and scores from the Graduate Record Examination. An example of written work in history from undergraduate courses is also required. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is February 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theoretical and historiographical dimensions of history. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate advisor who will supervise the stu\u00ad dent's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: two in History and Theory (History 200A and 200B), three in a collo\u00ad quium series, three in pro seminars (or two in proseminars and one in History 200C), and one in a related first-year research seminar. Students intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirement. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Students in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a one-quarter departmental course in quantitative methods for the M.A. foreign language requirement. Language competency is demonstrated by passing a departmental examination administered by a faculty member proficient in the chosen language. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive oral examination cov\u00ad ering the student's major field (e.g., America, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in acade\u00ad mic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN HISTORY Requirements for Admission. Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and a sample of written work. In addition, a departmental interview may be required. Ph.D. students are advised to begin their graduate work at UCI, since those who have taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in the same courses that are required of all incoming stu\u00ad dents, with the exception of the First-Year Research Seminar. Sub\u00ad ject to evaluation of their M.A. theses, these students will be exempted from this requirement. In the second and third years, the greater experience of those who enter with an M.A. may work to their advantage in speeding them to the qualifying examination. To be admitted formally into the doctoral program, students must satisfactorily pass a departmental evaluation at the end of their first year of study; this includes students who entered with an M.A. from another institution. Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the dead\u00ad line for application for fall admission is February 1. Feminist Studies. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in three different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second field (such as American History or Critical Theory), which is designed as a second teaching field. The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquium series in both fields, First-Year Pros\u00ad eminar/Research Seminar sequence, and the Second-Year Research Seminar. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. However, applicants may be eligible for approved part-time status, which allows students to take a lighter course load at reduced fees for a maximum of two academic years. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the student's general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examination. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of two foreign languages prior to taking the Ph.D. candidacy qualifying examination. Com\u00ad petency in a language may be established either by passing a departmental examination or through extensive language use in one of the research seminars. The specific languages that may be used to satisfy this requirement depend on the student's first field. Students in American history may use a substitute for one of their languages. They may take either the Department's graduate course in quantitative methods or two graduate courses in an allied disci\u00ad pline (e.g., critical theory, political theory, cultural anthropology, feminist theory, art history linguistics). Students pursuing the sec\u00ad ond option are expected to write a substantial paper that demon\u00ad strates the value of the allied discipline to historical inquiry. The two courses for the second option may not count toward fulfilling the requirement for the second field. Qualifying Examination and Dissertation. In preparation for the oral Qualifying Examination, the student will present to the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee a portfolio of three papers totaling at least 45 pages on subjects related to the major field. Successful comple\u00ad tion of this examination results in the student's advancement to Ph.D. candidacy. Within one academic quarter of the oral examina\u00ad tion, new candidates must meet in a colloquy with their Doctoral Committee to present their dissertation proposal. Once the Doc\u00ad toral Committee approves the proposal, the student begins inten\u00ad sive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to four years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation normally will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within seven years.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 234 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities SPECIAL PROGRAMS Undergraduate Major in Humanities The interdisciplinary :major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Phi\u00ad losophy, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Commu\u00ad nity; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation); Italian Society and Culture. The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humani\u00ad ties Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the student's own preference, if possible. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's super\u00ad vision, a long paper (40-50 pages) in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. Inquiries by third\u00ad quarter sophomores should be addressed to the Senior Academic Counselor in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses in Humanities required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI.

One set of courses develops skills in critical reading, writing, and analysis that are necessary in dealing with legal issues. Another set presents theoretical and analytical perspectives on ethical, political, and social issues relevant to the law. A final set focuses on specific legal issues from a humanistic perspective. Lower-division require\u00ad ments primarily develop foundational skills in the first set, whereas upper-division requirements build on these skills by addressing the concerns from the other sets. The minor does not include how-to courses on particular legal practices. Requirements for the Minor Lower-Division: Philosophy 29 (Critical Reasoning) or Classics 75 (Classical Rhetoric); Humanities 1A-B-C (Humanities Core Course) or Philosophy 1 (Introduction to Philosophy), 4 (Introduc\u00ad tion to Ethics), and either 5 (Contemporary Moral Problems) or 9 (Feminist Moral and Political Philosophy).

However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modification of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs con\u00ad cerned. Such students will do about 60 percent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 percent in one or more minor fields. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should con\u00ad tact the Associate Dean for Graduate Study or the graduate advisor in their major department.

Sinclair, Department Chair and Associate Professor of Classics David W. Smith, Professor of Philosophy John H. Smith, Associate Professor of German James Steintrager, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature Brook Thomas, Professor of English Andrzej Warminski, Director of the Comparative Literature Program and Professor of Comparative Literature Robyn Wiegman, Director of the Program in Women s Studies and Associate Professor of Women s Studies, African-American Studies, and English An emphasis in Critical Theory, under the supervision of the Com\u00ad mittee on Critical Theory, is available for doctoral students in all departments of the School of Humanities. Ph.D. students may, with Committee approval, complete the emphasis in addition to the degree requirements of their graduate program. Although there is no change in the existing Ph.D. program requirements or procedures, if the student wishes to have a letter (signed by the Dean and by the Director of Critical Theory) testifying that the student has satisfac\u00ad torily added this theoretical dimension to the graduate program, then additional requirements must be met. Critical theory at UCI is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assump\u00ad tions, problems, and commitments of the various discourses in the humanities. The faculty regards critical theory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional humanistic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any humanistic discipline. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Requirements for the emphasis are: a three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop, three Humanities 270 courses offered under the super\u00ad vision of the Committee on Critical Theory, participation in two mini-seminars (six to eight hours) offered by visiting scholars and sponsored by the Committee, and a research paper (which may be part of the dissertation) written under the guidance of a three-mem\u00ad ber committee selected by each individual student in consultation with the Director. Emphasis in the History and Philosophy of Science An emphasis in the History and Philosophy of Science is available for doctoral students in the Departments of History and Philosophy. The emphasis is administered by the Committee on the History and Philosophy of Science. It provides a means for doctoral students to supplement their general studies in history and philosophy with specific studies directed toward the natural and social sciences. It also allows history of science and philosophy of science students to broaden their knowledge of each other's fields. The history of science encompasses such topics as how science is actually done and how it has been influenced by and has influ\u00ad enced other aspects of culture. The history of science has recently proven a very active and influential field of historical research. It has changed many assumptions about science and mathematics in a way that has deeply influenced the philosophy of science and has arguably influenced the practices of the sciences themselves. The philosophy of science includes such topics as the nature of sci\u00ad entific explanation, the role of logic and language in science and mathematics, the problems inherent in inductive or ampliative inference, the cognitive and epistemic status of scientific laws and theories, and the nature of empirical evidence and its role in theory construction. Students in the emphasis study various ways to assess the epistemological foundations of scientific and mathematical inquiry, account for the apparent successes of the sciences, and resolve problems of philosophical interest that arise within the con\u00ad text of particular sciences. Students are required to take three graduate-level courses in the history of science and three in the philosophy of science, as well as fulfill special examination and dissertation requirements. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Director. Graduate Courses in Humanities Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities. Humanities 200 and 220 introduce study in various disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the literature departments or to those seeking familiarity with disci\u00ad plines other than their own. 200A, B, C History and Theory (4, 4, 4) F, W, S.

Walsh, M.B.B.S., Ph.D. University of Queensland, Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Philosophy, and Anthropology Philosophy addresses itself to questions that arise insistently in every area of human experience and in every discipline within the university. Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as religion and moral thought, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 238 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities CAREERS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excellent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergraduates trained in Philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The ana\u00ad lytical skills developed in Philosophy courses are especially useful in legal education; indeed, many UCI Philosophy graduates have been successful at top law schools. Former Philosophy students have also used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and computer programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the grad\u00ad uate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, there\u00ad fore, classes are severely limited in size in order to permit sus\u00ad tained interchanges between students and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and spe\u00ad cial disciplines such as art or science. The undergraduate advisor should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the spe\u00ad cialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those Philoso\u00ad phy majors whose intention may be either to enter some profes\u00ad sional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. The faculty encourages Philosophy majors and minors to seriously consider expanding their perspective through an experience of study abroad. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities for study and research. Specifically, those interested in analytic philosophy could consider the EAP programs in the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Aus\u00ad tralia, and New Zealand, and those interested in Continental phi\u00ad losophy could consider the EAP programs in France, Germany, and Italy. See the Center for International Education section of the Cat\u00ad alogue or your academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 198. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30A-B, 10, 12, and either 11 or 13; Philosophy 101, 102, 103, and five additional quarter courses from Philosophy 100, 105-199. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy 105A and 105B. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCL Departmental Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of two portions: a lower-division portion and an upper-division portion. Both must be satisfied. Lower division: Three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 4, 5, 30A or three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 6, 7, 30A or three courses selected from Philosophy 10, 11, 12, 13, 30A. Upper division: Four courses in a given subfield of philosophy, some of which have been pre-approved by the Department and are included below: History of Philosophy (Philosophy 11 0-117); Metaphysics and Epistemology (Philosophy 120-124); Value Theory (Philosophy l13B, 130-135); Logic and Methodology (Philosophy 115, 140-148). Other four-course sequences may be pos\u00ad sible, subject to written permission by the Department. Such a sequence must consist of related courses in a coherent subfield. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCL Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all mem\u00ad bers of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual rela\u00ad tionship between graduate students and professors in order to pro\u00ad vide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical devel\u00ad opment and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a faculty member whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the faculty each quarter about progress and any administrative or academic difficulties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of April. When the student has satisfied residency, tools of research, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Com\u00ad mittee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the disserta\u00ad tion itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. MASTER OF ARTS IN PHILOSOPHY There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Please refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section for information on the minimum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not automatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Graduate Studies via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHILOSOPHY There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., so that work can be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The Ph.D. program is designed to take five years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within four years. A Master's degree is not a prerequi\u00ad site for the Ph.D. The following items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Distribution Requirements. Students are required to take a range of courses designed to expose them to the various historical peri\u00ad ods and fields of philosophy. No particular courses are required; when course offerings are announced, students are notified about which courses can be used to satisfy which requirements. In some cases, the requirement satisfied will ultimately depend on the con\u00ad tent of the student's term paper(s). The Distribution Requirements are: 1. History. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in at least four courses covering at least three of the following five historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Modem, Kant and Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. 2. Field. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in two courses in value theory and one course each in metaphysics and epistemology. These requirements must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Logic Requirement. Students entering the program are expected to be familiar with elementary propositional and quantificational logic, including natural deduction techniques for both. A student with a weak background may wish to audit the lower-division courses Philosophy 30A and 30B or review the material in an inde\u00ad pendent study course (299) under the supervision of individual fac\u00ad ulty members. Given that background, to satisfy the Logic Requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in Philosophy 205A and 205B. The first of these covers the language and techniques of elemen\u00ad tary set theory: basic operations with sets, relations and functions, natural numbers and mathematical induction, and cardinal num\u00ad bers. The second covers basic proof theory and model theory of first-order logic, including the deduction theorem, soundness and completeness theorems, compactness, and Lowenheim-Skolem the\u00ad orems. These courses are devised to provide students with (a) the tools to assess logic-based arguments in the contemporary litera\u00ad ture, and (b) a firm foundation on the basis of which students can explore further logical topics as their area of concentration requires. This requirement must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Tools of Research. This requirement allows students to pursue the tool which they and their advisors deem most useful for their area of concentration, either a foreign language or some course of study outside philosophy. To satisfy this requirement, a student must pass an examination in a single appropriate foreign language or receive a grade of B or better in each of three appropriate graduate-level courses in a discipline other than philosophy. The two-hour foreign language examination (administered by the Philosophy Department) requires students to translate, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from one or two philosophical authors. For the second option, courses of study outside philosophy will be approved (by the Director of Graduate Studies) when they bear on a student's area of philosophical concentration. Though the courses must be in a discipline other than philosophy, they may in fact be taught in the Philosophy Department (e.g., a course in mathemati\u00ad cal logic taught by a Philosophy faculty member). This requirement must be completed by the end of the ninth quar\u00ad ter in residence. Philosophy 239 The Portfolio. A portfolio is an extended writing sample designed to demonstrate a student's ability (a) to understand, analyze, and evaluate positions and arguments in classical and contemporary philosophical literature, and (b) to formulate and defend an origi\u00ad nal philosophical thesis. These virtues must be displayed at a level of sophistication that indicates the student's ability to write a Ph.D. dissertation. The portfolio must be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator at the end of the fourth week of the student's seventh quarter in residence. Candidacy Examination. In preparation for the Candidacy Exami\u00ad nation, students consult with their thesis advisor and other appro\u00ad priate faculty to prepare a reading list on their area of concentra\u00ad tion and a brief dissertation proposal. Students apply for candidacy by filing appropriate forms, including a list (devised in consultation with their advisor) of appropriate members for their Candidacy Committee; one of these, the External Examiner, must come from outside the School of Humanities. The Committee is then appointed by the Department, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, to administer the oral Candidacy Examina\u00ad tion on the reading list and proposal to determine whether or not the student is prepared to begin work on the dissertation. This requirement must be completed by the end of the ninth quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Department Chair, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, then appoints a Doc\u00ad toral Committee (typically taken from the Candidacy Committee and naturally including the dissertation advisor) to supervise the writing of the dissertation. Dissertation Defense. Students must defend their dissertation dur\u00ad ing an oral examination administered by their Doctoral Committee. THE SALZBURG EXCHANGE PROGRAM Both faculty and graduate students participate in this exchange of scholars between the University of Salzburg and the UCI Philoso\u00ad phy Department. To be eligible, students must have advanced to candidacy. Students who are selected spend one semester in Salzburg and teach one course in the general area of their disserta\u00ad tion topic. An upper-division course may be taught in English, but lower-division courses must be taught in German. (Some previous visitors have learned serviceable German by attending a Goethe institute during the preceding summer.) Typically, a Salzburg visi\u00ad tor receives a Salzburg Fellowship intended to cover travel expenses, and a stipend; those who teach while in Salzburg also receive a salary intended to cover living expenses (including health and dental insurance). EMPHASIS IN CRITICAL THEORY The School of Humanities offers an Emphasis in Critical Theory. Students may petition the Critical Theory Committee for admission to the emphasis, normally by the middle of the second year of grad\u00ad uate study, after completing the Critical Theory Workshop, and with the recommendation of a workshop instructor or a faculty represen\u00ad tative from Philosophy. In addition to the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philosophy, students must satisfy the following requirements: 1) The Workshop. Students must successfully complete the three\u00ad quarter Critical Theory Workshop. This sequence is conceived as a reading group, normally conducted by a team of instruc\u00ad tors, and developed with the input of all participants. Signifi\u00ad cant texts are discussed and analyzed in class; no term papers are required. (Students receive 0 units and In-progress grades for the fall and winter quarters; passing students receive 4 units and a Satisfactory grade for the spring quarter. 2) Advanced Critical Theory. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three Humanities 270 courses offered under the supervision of the Critical Theory Committee. At least three such courses will be offered each year. With the approval of the UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 240 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities Department, these courses can be used to satisfy the Tools of Research requirement. 3) Students must participate in two committee-sponsored mini\u00ad seminars (six-eight hours each) offered by visiting scholars on their ongoing research. 4) Students must complete a research paper under the guidance of a three-member committee, selected in consultation with the Director of the Emphasis; at least one member must be from outside of the Philosophy Department. This paper may (but need not) be part of the portfolio or dissertation. Upon completion of the Emphasis requirements, a letter certifying that fact, signed by the Dean of Humanities and the Director of the Emphasis, will be added to the student's dossier. EMPHASIS IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE An interdisciplinary group of faculty in the humanities and various sciences offers an emphasis in History and Philosophy of Science. In addition to the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philosophy, stu\u00ad dents must satisfy the following requirements: 1) History of Science. Students receive a grade of B or better in History 275 and two sections of independent readings in the history of science, which are often offered in conjunction with an upper-division undergraduate section of History 135A-F. With the approval of the Department, this sequence can be used to satisfy the Tools of Research Requirement. 2) Philosophy of Science. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three courses from the following list: Philosophy 205C, 206, 240, 245, 247. (These may be repeated as topics vary, except Philosophy 205C.) 3) The portfolio must contain at least one paper in the philosophy of science. 4) The dissertation must contain a significant philosophy of sci\u00ad ence component. With the recommendation of a Department of Philosophy faculty member of the History and Philosophy of Science Committee, the dissertation proposal may be submitted to the Committee for approval. EMPHASIS IN LOGIC AND METHODOLOGY An interdisciplinary group of faculty in the humanities and various sciences offers an emphasis in Logic and Methodology. This Emphasis is offered for students who wish to study topics related to logic, the philosophy of mathematics or logic, or the philosophy of science. In addition to the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philoso\u00ad phy, students must satisfy the following requirements: 1) Mathematics or Science. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three graduate-level courses in mathematics or in the same science which have methodological content. With the approval of the Department, these courses can be used to satisfy the Tools of Research Requirement. Students may elect to sat\u00ad isfy a more stringent requirement (the math track) by taking a series of at least six mathematics courses either at UCI or at UCLA through the Intercampus Exchange Program. The courses are selected in consultation with the student's UCI Phi\u00ad losophy advisor. Regular mathematics department qualifying examinations may be substituted for some of the course work. 2) Philosophy of Science. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three courses from the following list: Philosophy 205C, 206, 240, 245, 247. (These may be repeated as topics vary, except Philosophy 205C.) Courses used to satisfy this requirement cannot also be used to satisfy requirement 1. 3) The portfolio must contain at least one paper in logic, the phi\u00ad losophy of mathematics or logic, or the philosophy of science. 4) The dissertation must contain a significant logic, philosophy of mathematics or logic, or philosophy of science component.

Due to the peculiar relationship of antagonism that has existed between Russia and the United States through most of this century, most career possibilities using Russian in this country have been in gov\u00ad ernment, and specifically in the foreign policy, national security, intelligence, and defense establishments. In recent years, the relationship of antagonism has ended, but Rus\u00ad sia's importance in the world has not been essentially altered. While the demand for specialists in various sectors of government has eased, relationships between our countries at other levels of society are growing more active and business opportunities are exciting and rewarding. Other areas in which the need for Russian language competence is evident right now include trade, environ\u00ad mental protection, social services, law, medicine, and technology. All students in Russian language courses are encouraged to take part in the University's Education Abroad Program and spend a portion of their junior or senior year studying in Russia.

Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school Spanish is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Spanish will enroll in Spanish lB, lC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Exceptions to this place\u00ad ment formula must be approved by the Spanish Curriculum Direc\u00ad tor. Students with transfer credit for college-level Spanish may not repeat those courses for credit. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, stu\u00ad dents attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and abil\u00ad ity to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary level. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year two-quarter sequential course stresses composition and introduces literary analysis. Further, a course in phonetics aims to perfect pronuncia\u00ad tion and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also to be taken in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works rather than the study of many short selections of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization com\u00ad bine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although a major in Portuguese is not offered, advanced literature courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. The faculty encourages Spanish majors or minors who are serious about improving their Spanish language ability in reading, writing, and speaking to take advantage of opportunities to immerse them\u00ad selves in the Spanish language by studying in Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, or other Spanish-speaking countries through the Education Abroad Program (EAP) or through the International Opportunities Program (lOP). Programs are available for the sum\u00ad mer, one quarter, one semester, or one year. While studying abroad through EAP, students can continue to make progress toward their UCI degree. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and pro\u00ad fessional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, international relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Master's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students in direct contact with some of the outstanding intellectuals in the field of Spanish, Latin American, and Chicano/United States Latino literatures and cultures. Distinguished visiting professors teach both graduate and undergraduate courses during two quarters and produce a publication for the Hispanic Studies Series pub\u00ad lished by Juan De La Cuesta. Past program participants have included: Professor Elias J. Rivers (1990-91), State University of New York at Stonybrook, Spanish Golden Age literature; Alfonso Sastre (1991-92), Spanish playwright and intellectual; Professor Heman Vidal (1992-93), University of Minnesota, theorist and scholar in Latin American literature and culture; Professor John Kronik ( 1993-94 ), Cornell University, modem Spanish literature; Professor Jose Agustin (1994-96), leading Mexican novelist and cultural critic; and Professor Alan D. Deyermond (1997-98), Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, internationally known medievalist. Graduate Program All graduate courses in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese are taught in Spanish, unless otherwise indicated in the course description. MASTER OF ARTS IN SPANISH The Master of Arts degree in Spanish is a two-year program of study designed to expose the beginning graduate student to all peri\u00ad ods of peninsular, Latin American, and Chicano/Latino literature Spanish and Portuguese 245 and culture. The degree is awarded upon the successful completion of course work and written and oral comprehensive examinations. A minimum of 11 courses must be completed with a letter grade; at least eight of these must be graduate seminars or proseminars. Required course work includes Spanish 239A, and two courses in linguistics (Spanish 201 and 204 are recommended). To help stu\u00ad dents prepare for their master's examination, the Department offers a sequence of proseminars on peninsular literature (Spanish 210, 214, 225) and on Latin American literature (Spanish 238A, B, C) during alternate years. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of completing 2C) in a foreign language other than Spanish is required; it is recommended that master's students take Portuguese as their foreign language, although other languages are accepted. Students may choose a focus in literature, linguistics, or creative writing. Master's candidates must complete a minimum of three quarters of course work in the Department; the maximum time to complete the master's program is three years. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. MASTER OF ARTS IN TEACHING IN SPANISH This program is specifically designed to meet the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to pro\u00ad vide a group of modem, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program consists of 10 \u00b7 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic civi\u00ad lization; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one\u00b7 course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN SPANISH The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree in Spanish with a specialization in Spanish, Spanish-American, or Chicano/Latino literature and culture. The program integrates period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, sociohistorical studies, and cultural studies. The Department seeks to professionalize its Ph.D. candidates not as narrow specialists but rather as scholars and critics acquainted with a range of fields that relate to and enhance their discipline. Graduate emphases in Criti\u00ad cal Theory and in Feminist Studies are available; other areas of study (for example, film, comparative, literature, history) may be designed with approval from the student's Ph.D. guidance commit\u00ad tee. The Department has been traditionally committed to excel\u00ad lence in teaching, both in its own practice and in the formation of its graduates. Language Requirements In addition to Spanish and English, all doctoral candidates should have the necessary command of Portuguese to take Portuguese 243. An additional foreign language (with proficiency equivalent to the 2C level) is also required; this requirement may be satisfied by examination or course work. The selection of a second foreign lan\u00ad guage must be approved by the student's guidance committee and is based on the specific research interests and field of study of the candidate. Course Requirements A minimum of 24 courses beyond the B.A. or 13 beyond the M.A. are required: two courses in literary theory (including Spanish 239A) two courses in linguistics (one diachronic and one syn\u00ad chronic), one graduate course in Luso-Brazilian literature, and UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 246 UCI 1999-2000 School of Humanities Spanish 292. Note that these requirements may include course work completed in the master's program; the remaining elective courses are selected with the approval of the student's guidance committee \"to prepare for the doctoral examination and the disserta\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to take more than the minimum number of required courses. A student who transfers into the doctoral program from elsewhere must take a minimum of 13 graduate courses at UCI, of which nine must be in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese (of these, six must be regularly scheduled graduate seminars or proseminars). With regard to students who enter the Ph.D. program with their master's degree from another institution, the Ph.D. guidance com\u00ad mittee will determine the number of courses that will be accepted. Teaching The Department recognizes its responsibility to train all Ph.D. can\u00ad didates as teachers and requires that all doctoral students with no prior teaching experience complete a minimum of three quarters of language teaching (Spanish 399). Moreover, all doctoral students are required to complete a teaching practicum by co-teaching an upper-division course with a professor and enrolling in Spanish 292 for a letter grade. Comprehensive Examination The Ph.D. student advances to candidacy by passing by majority vote the qualifying examination. The qualifying examination con\u00ad sists of: 1. An essay of 25-30 pages written on a topic related to the stu\u00ad dent's primary field of study. The essay should be presented as a publishable article for a professional journal with an original scholarly, critical, or theoretical component as well as a critical evaluation of relevant bibliography, and will be discussed dur\u00ad ing the oral examination. It will be circulated to the full com\u00ad mittee two months prior to the date of the written examination. 2. A four-hour written examination on the student's major field of study that requires a cultural perspective of the total literary production of a given period with emphasis on one genre, topic, or problem. The definition of the major field of study is approved by the Ph.D. examination committee and the graduate director. 3. A three-hour written examination in the minor field. 4. A two-hour oral examination that includes discussion of the writ- ten examinations and the essay. Dissertation A dissertation topic is chosen by the candidate in consultation with the dissertation director and committee and normally falls within the major field covered by the qualifying examinations. The candi\u00ad date presents a plan for the work to the dissertation committee which approves the proposal and a preliminary research outline. The student submits drafts of chapters to the dissertation director who corrects and approves the drafts and circulates them to other committee members for commentary. The defense of the disserta\u00ad tion occurs at an appropriate point of its development, certainly before its completion and during residency of the candidate, so that faculty input is maximized. The doctoral committee certifies the acceptance of a completed final dissertation with the signatures of individual members on the title page.

Visual Studies synthesizes methodological insights from both com\u00ad ponent disciplines in order to examine the social practices of visual representation and visuality itself. The program leads to a Ph.D. degree in Visual Studies. While the program (in certain instances) grants an M.A. to students on route to their Ph.D., it admits only those students intending to complete their doctorate at UCI. ADMISSION The program is open to students applying with either a bachelor's or a master's degree, and applicants must meet the general require\u00ad ments for admission to graduate study at UCI. A recent sample of academic writing-such as a representative undergraduate paper, or the master's thesis or a major research paper written at the mas\u00ad ter's level-should be submitted with the application packet. The deadline for application is January 15, and the program accepts applicants for admission during the fall quarter only. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Graduate Advisor for the Visual Studies program. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS All students are required to demonstrate a reading knowledge of at least one foreign language and are strongly encouraged to develop competence in a second. Students consult with the Graduate Advi\u00ad sor and/or their principal advisor(s) to determine the appropriate language to be tested, based on their interests and program of study. Advisors, moreover, may require the demonstration of read\u00ad ing knowledge in additional languages according to the scholarly demands of the student's specific field. All language requirements must be satisfied before students are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. COURSE REQUIREMENTS Beyond the core series (Visual Studies 291, 292, 293), students admitted with a B.A. are required to complete an additional 11 courses for a total of 14 courses. Out of this total, at least 10 courses (including the core series) must be within the program in Visual Studies (i.e., bearing Visual Studies, Art History, or Film Studies course numbers) and at least two courses are to be from UC IRVINE - 1999-2000outside the Visual Studies discipline. In order to establish a level of expertise in one conventionally defined discipline, students enter\u00ad ing with a B.A. must take (among their 10 courses noted above), at least three Art History courses or at least three Film Studies courses. Students admitted with an M.A. must complete an additional five courses beyond the core series, for a total of eight courses. While students may accrue units both for University Teaching (Art His\u00ad tory 399 or Film Studies 399) and Reading for the Qualifying Examination (Visual Studies 298), these do not count toward the required number of courses. QUALIFYING EXAMINATION By the end of the second year for students entering with a B.A., or the end of the first year for those entering with an M.A., students must reach agreement with one or more of the program's profes\u00ad sors to serve as principal advisor(s). During the fall quarter of the following year-in most cases, the final quarter of standard course work-the student will work informally with the principal advi\u00ad sor(s) to establish a five-person committee consisting of the princi\u00ad pal advisor(s), additional faculty members to bring the total of examiners up to four (at least three of these four must be members of the Visual Studies faculty), and a designated \"outside\" member who must be a member of the UCI faculty but cannot hold either a primary or joint appointment in Visual Studies, Art History, or Film Studies. Except in extraordinary circumstances (to be adjudi\u00ad cated by the program's Graduate Committee), students are required to include at least one member from Art History and one from Film Studies on their examination committee. The student and principal advisor(s) define four areas to be exam\u00ad ined by the faculty; no faculty member may supervise more than two of the four areas, and in no case may the \"outside\" member serve as a supervisor. The topics should combine historical breadth and some variety in media and special fields. Over the course of the following two quarters, students normally enroll in eight to twelve units per quarter of Reading for the Qualifying Examination (Visual Studies 298) during which time they prepare reading lists in close consultation with their principal advisor(s) and area super\u00ad visors, and complete the reading of those lists. The examination takes place near the end of those two quarters of study, norma\u00ad tively at the end of the academic year. The first part of the examination consists of a written component, in which the student is called upon to respond to questions posed in three of the selected topics. The student's written responses are circulated to all committee members. An oral examination follows, normally within two weeks, and consists both of a set of questions posed orally about the remaining unexamined topic, and of ques\u00ad tions raised by the student's written responses to the initial three topics. Based on the student's written and oral performance, the committee will determine whether the student has successfully passed the examination; if so (and provided all language require\u00ad ments have been satisfied), the student is then advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D. degree. If the committee is not satisfied with the student's performance, it may also decide to reexamine the student on one or more topics after a specific interval. Except in extraordi\u00ad nary circumstances, no student will be given more than two chances to pass any given section of the examination. Visual Studies 251 DISSERTATION Within six months of advancement to candidacy, each student must submit a prospectus that defines the scope, approach, and rationale for a proposed dissertation. The student and the principal advisor(s) consult to determine the composition of a doctoral committee of three members including the principal advisor(s), which then must unanimously approve the prospectus before the student proceeds with the dissertation. The doctoral committee, on the basis of the candidate's past academic performance and proposed dissertation topic, may require additional course work or other forms of prepa\u00ad ration for the dissertation. The doctoral committee, under the direc\u00ad tion of the principal advisor(s), supervises the student's research program and ultimately approves the dissertation. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. program is five to six years. Graduate Courses in Visual Studies Additional graduate courses satisfying the requirements of the Ph.D. program in Visual Studies are listed in the Department of Art History and the Program in Film Studies sections. 291 Theories of Vision and Visuality (4).

From the largest information processing problems to the control of the engines in our automobiles, these technologies play a Information and Computer Science 253 vital role. This revolution is only a few decades old, but already futurists talk about the twenty-first century in terms of the \"infor\u00ad mation Department of Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence (ICS) is in the center of this revolution, with programs of instruction and research in a variety of areas within computer and information technology. ICS faculty cover a broad spectrum of important topics in their research and teaching interests including: formal and mathematical methods for improving the performance and power of computa\u00ad tional systems; advanced processes for design and engineering of computer systems and communication networks; the software that makes the computer useful, with particular concern for the design and engineering of large software systems for critical applications; the fascinating area of intelligence, and the connections between natural and artificial intelligence; the economics, sociology, and application of the technology in modern organizations, and the use of interactive multimedia in computer systems that facilitate learn\u00ad ing. The faculty are concerned with more than just technology, however. The fundamental intellectual features of the information and computer sciences are applicable to many scholarly and scien\u00ad tific fields. ICS is truly an interdisciplinary department, simultane\u00ad ously grounded in science and oriented toward application. Computer resources available for campuswide use include the Maspar and Hypercube parallel processors, which are made avail\u00ad able by various departments at UCI. Additionally, systems avail\u00ad able from the UCI Office of Academic Computing (OAC) include a Hewlett Packard SPP2000 parallel computer, Sun SPARC servers, a graduate student laboratory with DEC Alpha worksta\u00ad tions, and various peripherals. Commercial dial-up services and campus dial-up lines provide support for home connections to many of these systems as well as systems within the Department of Information and Computer Science. X terminals, Pentium PCs, and Power Macintoshes also are available via laboratories open 24 hours a day. Additional information may be obtained by calling OAC at (949) 824-6116; e-mail: oac@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.oac.uci.edu. Computer resources within the Department of Information and Computer Science include a wide range of instructional and research machines. For instructional computing, these include two UNIX servers (a Sun SPARCserver 1000 multiprocessor and a Sun 670MP multiprocessor), 50 SPARC workstations, 70 Macintoshes, 80 Pen\u00ad tium and Pentium Pro PCs, and some general purpose terminals. For research computing, resources include a Sequent multiproces\u00ad sor and over 250 varying types of Sun workstations and servers. DEGREES Information and Computer Science ....................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately 12 percent of the gradu\u00ad ating seniors. Students are nominated for honors based on criteria such as grade point average (including overall, ICS, mathematics); number of upper-division ICS courses completed beyond the mini\u00ad mum; courses taken outside ICS beyond required breadth; and research activities. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other important factors are con\u00ad sidered (see page 50). CAREERS FOR THE ICS MAJOR Graduates of the Department of Information and Computer Science pursue a variety of careers. Many graduates specify, design, and develop a variety of computer-based systems comprised of soft\u00ad ware and hardware in virtually every application domain, such as UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 254 UCI 1999-2000 Department of Information and Computer Science aerospace, automotive, biomedical, consumer products, engineer\u00ad ing, entertainment, environmental, finance, investment, law, man\u00ad a_gement, manufacturing, and pharmacology. res graduates also find jobs as members of research and development teams, develop\u00ad ing advanced technologies, designing software and hardware systems, and specifying, designing, and maintaining computing infrastructures for a variety of institutions. Some work for estab\u00ad lished or start-up companies while others work as independent con\u00ad sultants. After a few years in industry, many move into manage\u00ad ment or advanced technical positions. Some ICS students also use the undergraduate major as preparation for graduate study in com\u00ad puter science or another field (e.g., medicine, law, engineering, management). \u00b7 Undergraduate Program The ICS undergraduate program prepares students for professions and careers in industry and provides students with the tools for advanced education at the graduate level. Many ICS graduates fol\u00ad low career paths immediately after graduation; others go on to advanced study in a variety of fields, including computer science, management, engineering, law, medicine, and so on. An ICS undergraduate education is a blend of scholarship, science, tech\u00ad nology, and practical application that forms an excellent foundation for professional life in the twenty-first century and prepares a stu\u00ad dent with serviceable skills useful for a lifetime. The basis of the ICS undergraduate program is a set of fundamen\u00ad tal courses in mathematics and computer science, supplemented by breadth requirements from other academic disciplines. A premium is placed on writing and quantitative skills. Students start early with hands-on experience with advanced computing systems, and intense use of computer and network technologies continues throughout the undergraduate program. res students study data organization, algorithm design and analysis, design and organiza\u00ad tion of hardware and network systems, software engineering, artifi\u00ad cial intelligence, social aspects of system design and use, and man\u00ad agement of technology. In the process, students work with state\u00ad of-the-art hardware and software technologies, learn several con\u00ad temporary programming languages, and make extensive use of computer-based utilities such as electronic mail. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis, statistics, probability, or other applied mathematics areas. Students may also wish to consult the list of courses offered by the School of Engineering. Some Engineering courses can count toward intermediate-level and project course requirements for the ICS major. See the upper-division requirements for details. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are interested in digital computer programming and the field of computer science will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Computer Science I (ICS 21) and continue in the programming sequence with Introduction to Computer Science II and Fundamental Data Struc\u00ad tures (ICS 22 and 23) as.far as their interests require and their pro\u00ad grams permit. The ICS Student Affairs Office is staffed by professional academic counselors and peer advisors. These individuals are available to assist students with program planning, questions on University and departmental policies and procedures, progress toward graduation, and other questions that arise in the course of a student's educa\u00ad tion. Faculty also are available for advising, generally for sugges\u00ad tions of additional course work in the student's area of specializa\u00ad tion and on preparation for graduate school. ADMISSIONS Freshmen In the event the major in ICS receives more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions require\u00ad ments. There is a limit on the number of applicants admitted to the major. See pages 37-38. Transfer Student Policy Students transferring to UCI fall 1998 or thereafter must satisfy the following requirements: 1. Completion of one year of college mathematics. Courses equiv\u00ad alent to Mathematics 6A-B-C (Discrete Mathematics) are pre\u00ad ferred as this facilitates scheduling after transfer to UCI. If not available, students should take first-year calculus. A semester of pre-calculus and a semester of calculus may not be used to sat\u00ad isfy this requirement. 2. Completion of one year of computer science courses. The course work must contain one UC-transferable programming course involving concepts such as those found in C++, Ada, Java, Modula-3, or another modern, high-level language. Pro\u00ad gramming-only courses in Basic, Fortran, and Cobal are not sufficient. Programming courses in Pascal or C may be used to satisfy this requirement but are not recommended. Additional courses beyond the programming course must be taken to sat\u00ad isfy the year of computer science. It is strongly recommended that students select UC-transferable courses that do not focus strictly on learning a programming language but rather focus on topics such as data structures or computer architecture, if such courses are available. There is a limit on the number of applicants admitted to the major. NOTE: The lower-division requirement in ICS consists of five courses which must be taken in a certain order and which are pre\u00ad requisites for upper-division courses. Students who transfer to UCI as juniors and must complete all or part of this sequence will there\u00ad fore find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees. To ensure admission consideration for the fall quarter, students should be sure to file their application by November 30 of the prior year. The selection criteria include grades, test scores, and other considerations. Note, however, that in cases where the number of incoming freshmen and advanced standing students who elect ICS as a major exceeds the number of positions available, not all appli\u00ad cants will be accommodated. Alternately, students can come to the campus without declaring a major and take the courses necessary to meet the ICS change-of\u00ad major requirements, Once the course work is completed, and the other conditions for changing majors met, students may then apply for a change of major to ICS. Additional information is available from the res academic counselors. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59.

CONCENTRATION IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATA The goal of the M.S. concentration in Knowledge Discovery and Data is to educate students in both the fundamental principles of computational methods for modeling data, as well as to provide a UC IRVINE - 1999-2000broad foundation in emerging methods for knowledge discovery and data mining. Technological advances in digital data collection, memory capacity, and computational power, have revolutionized our view of data analysis in the past 10 years. The volumes of data being collected in science, business, medicine, and government are truly vast in nature. Across all of these areas, there is a rapidly increasing demand for better theories and tools to provide users with improved understanding of their data and to leverage their data for decision support. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is an emerging disci\u00ad pline within computer science, focused on the principles of how patterns and structure can be inferred from large data sets. It is an area of significant academic interest and research opportunity. For example, a Special Interest Group in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (SIGKDD) was recently started by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to promote both research and pro\u00ad fessional activities in this area; a new journal called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery was started in 1997; and the field spon\u00ad sors an annual international conference with over 500 attendees. In addition, the National Science Foundation has recently begun a large interdisciplinary research program in Knowledge and Distrib\u00ad uted Intelligence (KDI), based in part on recent research and inter\u00ad est in KDD. Industry participation is also very active with broad demand for graduates in this area, across a wide variety of compa\u00ad nies engaged in leveraging scientific and business data for strategic purposes.

Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS (CSN) This area of research and study is concerned primarily with the development of systems software, that is, the software infrastruc\u00ad ture that makes the development and use of applications possible. This includes compilers, operating systems, networking software, performance tools, and software development environments, which are studied from both theoretical and practical points of view. The CSN research group is particularly interested in systems soft\u00ad ware in the context of parallel or decentralized systems, that is, systems having multiple CPUs, including computer networks and both shared-and distributed-memory multiprocessor architectures, which offer great new opportunities in distributed computing and communication as well as performance-oriented scientific comput\u00ad ing, but also pose major technological challenges to researchers and developers of parallel/distributed computer systems. The spe\u00ad cific topics studied by the faculty members of this concentration area include: design and study of paralleling compilers; design and analysis of high-speed multimedia networks; object-oriented frameworks for distributed systems; approaches to portable and mobile programs; development of coordination paradigms for dis\u00ad tributed applications; support for distributed simulations; design and study of extensible and run-time adaptable operating systems and software environments; system support for high-performance scientific computing; and distributed algorithms. Applicants with a focus on engineering may also refer to the con\u00ad centrations in Computer Networks and Distributed Computing, and Computer Systems and Software, offered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (200); Advanced Compiler Construc\u00ad tion (ICS 211); Computer Systems Architecture (ICS 241); Com\u00ad puter Networks (ICS 243); Software Engineering (ICS 221); Data Structures (261 ).

One of these courses may be substituted by an Electrical and Computer Engi\u00ad neering course selected from the following list: Advanced System Software (ECE231); Distributed Computer Systems (ECE252); Real-Time Computer Systems (ECE253); Parallel Database Sys\u00ad tems Engineering (ECE257). Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN (CSD) New application areas are placing increasingly challenging demands on existing comput~r systems. At the same time, advanced tech\u00ad nologies are being developed that make the design and manufactur\u00ad ing of computer systems faster and cheaper. The current trend in computerization is toward application-targeted systems that solve specific problems well. The development of such systems requires an understanding of the complex interactions between applications, software, and hardware. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The Computer Systems Design area addresses the various aspects of bridging the gap between the demands of new applications and available technology. It is designed to produce computer scientists with an increased awareness of the demands imposed on computers by the application domains which have traditionally been viewed as extrinsic to computer science. This application sensitivity will give students a unique advantage in the increasingly important area of integrated software/hardware computer and information systems and will prepare them to meet the challenges of real-world problems. Within the general area of computer systems, ICS faculty special\u00ad ize in hardware/software codesign for embedded systems; CAD VLSI, optimizing compilers; and system-specification and performance-analysis techniques. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); at least three quarters of Seminar in Design Science (ICS 249 or 259); Computer Systems Architecture and Languages (ICS 241); five graduate courses out\u00ad side of Computer Systems Design but within ICS, no more than three of which may be in one area; and four core courses selected from the following: Introduction to Embedded Computing Systems (ICS 212), Software for Embedded Systems (ICS 213), Fault-Toler\u00ad ant Computing (ICS 250), Digital System Verification and Testing (ICS 251), Introduction to Computer Design (ICS 252), Design Description and Modeling (ICS 253), VLSI System Design (ICS 254 or Engineering ECE251), Physical Design Automation (ICS 255 or Engineering ECE238), Design Synthesis (ICS 256), System Tools (ICS 257), Combinatorial Algorithms for Design Synthesis (ICS 258). Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTING, ORGANIZATIONS, POLICY, AND SOCIETY (CORPS) UCI is an internationally recognized center for research on the social and managerial dimensions of computerization. One stream of this research examines the impacts and policy issues that sur\u00ad round computerization. A second stream, which is longitudinal and organizational in emphasis, examines the ways in which users develop computing technologies, including workplace negotiations and coalitions. CORPS researchers study these topics in various public and private settings including government agencies, large and small commercial enterprises, and universities. CORPS has recently added a research focus on computer-supported cooperative work and human-computer interaction. Examples of specific interests are social and behavioral factors affecting the design and adoption of groupware; use of virtual communities, the Internet, and digital libraries; and technical support for organiza\u00ad tional learning and memory. Work in these areas consists of both empirical research and the building <>f prot<>type systems. CORPS researchers focus on understanding the \"reality\" of com\u00ad puterization, in contrast with utopian promises and anti-utopian fears. A large fraction of the research is empirical, and is con\u00ad ducted in vivo-in organizations or other social settings where computer-based systems are developed and used routinely. The empirical studies of work organization and organizational control patterns also have an important theoretical dimension.

CONCENTRATION IN SOFTWARE (SW) Software has transformed society in dramatic and powerful ways. From the World Wide Web to pilotless vehicles to spreadsheets, software systems inform, control, and enhance daily activities. Software research at UCI is aimed at creating new software tech\u00ad nology and solutions, furthering the information revolution. Per\u00ad spectives of engineering, science, mathematics, and human\u00ad computer interaction guide the work. The central goal of all the research is improvement in software development, evolution, deployment, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Specific research emphases of the five faculty members in the con\u00ad centration include: analysis and testing, software understanding, empirically-guided analysis, environments, software architectures, hypermedia, workflow, user interface software, process, formal methods, specification languages, extensible component-based software systems, distributed event-based systems, and program\u00ad ming languages and their implementation. Research projects under\u00ad taken by the faculty and graduate students receive financial support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), and the State of California, among others. A valuable and unusual feature of the concentration is the opportunity to work with the Software group's industrial partners. These companies provide opportunities for internships, support research projects, and provide a test-bed for evaluation of new ideas. Graduates of the program have taken careers in research uni\u00ad versities, industrial research laboratories, colleges, and industry. Background: Students must have basic competency in the follow\u00ad ing computer science topics: programming language concepts, data structures, analysis of algorithms, automata theory or formal lan\u00ad guages, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, and operating systems. The software faculty will evaluate, upon entry to the Ph.D. program, whether a student has satisfied these requirements through courses taken previously (e.g., at the undergraduate level) or through equivalent experience. Satisfaction of any unfulfilled requirements may be achieved through either graduate or under\u00ad graduate classes in an individualized program worked out with a software area graduate advisor. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 260 UCI 1999-2000 Department of Information and Computer Science Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); Software Engineering (ICS 221); Formal Methods in Software Engineering (ICS 222); at least three quarters of Seminar in Software (ICS 229); two courses from: Software Analysis and Testing (ICS 224), Software Processes (ICS 225), Software Measurement (ICS 226), User Interfaces and Software Engineering (ICS 227), Software Environments (ICS 228); two other courses from the Software area (ICS 220-228, including ICS 280s taught by Software area faculty); and four graduate courses outside of Software, drawn from a list maintained by the faculty. Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write a survey paper with an extensive bibliog\u00ad raphy and a research paper of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES (THEORY) The goal of research in theoretical computer science is to produce results, supported by rigorous proof, about problems dealing with computers and their applications. The questions to be investigated are often motivated by practical problems, but the goal of under\u00ad standing the underlying combinatorial properties of the problem is often as important as producing a solution of immediate applicabil\u00ad ity. The actual problems to be solved are often very complicated, so researchers seek some abstraction that can be rigorously studied. In particular, they often seek to investigate the fundamental combi\u00ad natorial structure of a problem abstracted away from the original physical setting. For example, the problem of placing a set of files onto as few floppy disks as possible without exceeding their stor\u00ad age capacity is fundamentally the same as the problem of loading a set of items onto as few trucks as possible without exceeding their weight limit. Many problems, from a variety of application areas, fall into the category of efficient algorithm design. A key property of work in this area is its emphasis on the amount of resources required by a given algorithm; this is called the com\u00ad plexity of the algorithm. The resource most commonly considered is time, but other resources often considered are the amount of memory required and, in the case of parallel computation, the num\u00ad ber of processors required. For many problems, an efficient solu\u00ad tion has been obtained only after deep insights into the nature of the problem. For many problems, the efficiency of the best solution possible remains unknown. Research in algorithms and data structures grapples with such questions. It is a young science with an inherently interdisciplinary flavor. Problems to be investigated have come from a variety of sources, such as computer vision, scheduling, resource allocation, scientific computing, image processing, genetics, transportation, and artificial intelligence. Solution methods are brought to bear from areas such as discrete applied mathematics, probability the\u00ad ory, and a rich body of insights developed within theoretical com\u00ad puter science. The goal of the research, as in mathematics, is to produce results supported by rigorous proof; the emphasis on com\u00ad plexity gives this area its unique flavor. Results that first might appear to be only of theoretical value are sometimes of profound relevance to practical problems.

This program explores how conflict arises, how it is represented and discussed, how it is prevented, mitigated, man\u00ad aged, and used for change in interpersonal relations, within and between organizations and other kinds of groups inside nations, and in conflict between nations. The minor consists of seven four\u00ad unit courses and two two-unit courses. Course descriptions are available in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue. Requirements for the Minor Three core courses: History 11 (Introduction to Peace and Con\u00ad flict), Political Science 43D (Global Security and Cooperation), and Political Science 154G/Anthropology 136D (Conflict Manage\u00ad ment in Cross-Cultural Perspective).

Weinberger, Ph.D. Case Western Reserve University, Professor of Biological Sciences and Cognitive Sciences Peter Woodruff, Ph.D. University of Pittsburgh, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science is intended for students who wish to study the history of science, the philosophical foundations of scientific inquiry, and the relationship between sci\u00ad ence and other fields. The history of science explores how science is actually done and how it has influenced history. This may involve tracking down an idea's source or its influences, evaluating the cultural forces at work in the generation of a scientific theory or the reaction of culture to science, or taking a detailed look at the work of a particular scientist or movement within science. The philosophy of science is concerned with determining what sci\u00ad ence and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. Philosophy of science courses cover such topics as the role of logic and language in science and in mathematics, scientific explanation, evidence, and probability. These courses may also cover work that has been done on the philosophical problems in specific sciences-for example, the direction of time in physics, the model of mind in psychology, the structure of evolution theory in biology, and the implications of GOdel's incompleteness theorems for mathematics. The minor is available to all UCI students. Course descriptions may be found in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue.

Foreign applicants must also sub\u00ad mit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. Requirements All students must complete a core curriculum consisting of eight courses from Civil Engineering, Economics, and Social Ecology plus the graduate colloquium. Students may apply to the Director of Graduate Studies for exemption from specific courses based upon the evidence of prior course work. Students also must suc\u00ad cessfully complete at least six courses from among the four spe\u00ad cialization areas: (1) Methods and Analysis, (2) Transportation Economics, (3) Traffic Analysis, and (4) Planning and Policy Analysis. At least four of these six courses must be from one specialization. Other requirements include: a replication project, in which students replicate the empirical work of a published paper from a major transportation journal; the qualifying examination, which consists of the oral defense of the student's dissertation proposal; and com\u00ad pletion of the dissertation. Research Facilities UCI is a major research university and has an excellent library col\u00ad lection, as well as special interlibrary loan arrangements with other University of California libraries including the Transportation Library at Berkeley. Research is coordinated with the Irvine branch of the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS). About 25 to 30 grad\u00ad uate students are employed as research assistants each year in ITS. Research covers a broad spectrum of transportation issues. Current funded research projects focus upon: intelligent transportation sys\u00ad tems (ITS), particularly advanced transportation management sys\u00ad tems; planning and analysis of transportation systems; transporta\u00ad tion systems operation and control; artificial intelligence applications; transportation engineering; transportation safety; road and congestion pricing; environmental and energy issues and demand for alternative fuel vehicles; public transit operations, transportation-land use interactions, demand for autos, and travel demand. ITS is part of the University of California Transportation Center, one of ten federally designated centers of excellence for transporta\u00ad tion research. The transportation research program at UCI is also supported by the Advanced Transportation Management Systems (ATMS) Laboratories. The Institute maintains a regular publications series documenting research conducted within its programs and is the editorial head\u00ad quarters of four international journals: Transportation Research, parts A, B, and C, and Accident Analysis and Prevention.

Wilson, Ph.D. Yale University, Assistant Professor of African- American Studies and Art History Hu Ying, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of Chinese Women's Studies, like feminism, is a way of asking questions rather than a particular set of answers or conclusions. How does being female affect one's participation in family, literature, history, art, politics, economy, and education? How do language, visual representations, beliefs, and values shape women's and men's status in society and culture? How does the experience of women differ by race, class, nationality, religion, and sexual preference? The intellectual perspectives provoked by such questions have estab\u00ad lished Women's Studies as a dynamic and compelling field of study and have spurred the restructuring of curriculum and knowl\u00ad edge across the other disciplines. The field of women's studies has developed at a phenomenal rate from a handful of student-initiated courses in the early 1970s to more than 600 programs in colleges and universities across the United States offering degrees at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels. The Program in Women's Studies at UCI was founded in 1975 and has grown significantly since that time. The program offers a major leading to the B.A. degree in Women's Studies, an under\u00ad graduate minor, and a graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies. The undergraduate program in Women's Studies draws upon fac\u00ad ulty with expertise in humanities, social sciences, social ecology, and the arts. Through diverse course offerings, the program exam\u00ad ines the contributions of women from different backgrounds to culture and society and explores women's and men's lives in the context of changing gender relations. The program emphasizes interdisciplinary, multicultural scholarship and includes course work in feminist theories; the cultural roles of women; the socioeconom\u00ad ics of gender; women's history; women's literature in a cross\u00ad cultural frame; women, gender, and sexuality in fine arts and film; women of color; and lesbian and gay studies. Women's Studies provides a unique intellectual community where faculty and students share a commitment to interactive teaching and learning. Students work closely with faculty and the program's academic coordinator to plan a coherent program of study and to anticipate work toward advanced degrees and a wide variety of career options. \u00b7 UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 276 UCI 1999-2000 Interdisciplinary Studies CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Women's Studies prepares students for the expanding opportunities available in graduate programs and in numerous careers in both the public and private sectors. As more women work, business and corporations find the need for increased knowledge about women, and the growth of women's organizations and agen\u00ad cies-at the local, national, and global levels-is creating new opportunities for graduates with specializations in Women's Studies. Graduates bring unique skills and knowledge to the professions of law, medicine, social work, teaching, counseling, and to govern\u00ad ment service, all of which increasingly require expertise on issues concerning women and gender. A background in Women's Studies develops critical and analytical skills which prove valuable in the full range of life choices. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. In addition, the Women's Studies Office provides more specialized career counseling and information on graduate programs in Women's Studies and related fields.

GRADUATE EMPHASIS IN FEMINIST STUDIES The Program in Women's Studies offers an emphasis in Feminist Studies, which is available in conjunction with the Ph.D. programs in the Departments of Anthropology, East Asian Languages and Literatures, English and Comparative Literature, French and Ital\u00ad ian, German, History, Sociology, Spanish and Portuguese: the pro\u00ad gram in Visual Studies; and the M.F.A. programs in Drama and Studio Art. Satisfactory completion of the emphasis is certified by the Director of Women's Studies and is noted in the student's dossier. Admission to the Program Applicants must first be admitted to, or currently enrolled in, one of the participating programs noted above. Applicants must submit to the Women's Studies Graduate Program Committee: (1) an application form listing prior undergraduate and graduate course work related to Feminist Studies, institutions attended, and majors(s); (2) a one-to two-page statement of purpose, including career objectives, areas of interest and research, record of research, teaching, community and/or creative work; and (3) a sample of written work related to Feminist Studies. The Committee determines admissions, in consultation with the Women's Studies Core Faculty, based upon the extent to which the applicant's research interests relate to Feminist Studies, the appli\u00ad cant's previous course work, and research or other experience related to Feminist or Women's Studies. Lack of prior course work does not preclude admission, so long as a compelling statement of research interests congruent with the graduate emphasis makes the case. Emphasis Requirements Minimum course work for the graduate emphasis in Feminist Stud\u00ad ies consists of four courses: two core courses, Women's Studies 200A-B, a coherent sequence normally taken in consecutive quar\u00ad ters; and any two courses selected from the list of courses in Femi\u00ad nist Studies approved by the Committee, as long as one of these is a graduate course in the student's own department or area of inter\u00ad est. In keeping with the interdisciplinary focus of this emphasis, it is highly recommended that the other be a course from a discipline outside that department or area. The course requirements for Ph.D. and M.F.A. candidates are the same. For doctoral students, the qualifying examination and dissertation topic should incorporate gender as a central category of analysis. One member of the candidate's qualifying examination committee and of the candidate's dissertation committee is normally a mem\u00ad ber of the Women's Studies Core Faculty. There are no require\u00ad ments concerning qualifying examinations or theses for M.F.A. students. Courses in Women's Studies LOWER-DIVISION SOA Gender and Feminism in Everyday Life (4) F.

Reeburgh, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of Earth System Science Susan E. Tmmbore, Ph.D. Columbia University, Associate Professor of Earth System Science The interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. As a result of population growth and the pursuit of higher stan\u00ad dards of living, humanity has initiated many global trends that can\u00ad not be sustained indefinitely. Some of these trends are physico\u00ad chemical in nature, such as the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing pollution of our environment, including the accumu\u00ad lation of ozone-depleting chemicals with consequent increase of ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, and the buildup of car\u00ad bon dioxide that is almost certainly causing global warming. Other trends are biological ones including the degradation of agricultural land, the destruction of many kinds of wildlife habitat with associ\u00ad ated high rates of species extinction, and the depletion of wildlife populations by over-exploitation. Global changes are also taking place in the human situation including loss of cultural diversity, a growing income gap between rich and poor nations leading to deepening poverty and additional pressure for biological resource exploitation, accelerating urbanization with associated social prob\u00ad lems, and regional population and economic imbalances leading to escalating political tensions and potential for conflict. This program examines the causes of, and interrelationships between, these prob\u00ad lems and considers new approaches to solving them. Its goal is to provide broad, interdisciplinary training that will allow students to better understand and effectively deal with the serious environmen\u00ad tal problems that we will face in the twenty-first century. The minor is open to all UCI students. Course descriptions are available in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue.

The undergraduate minor is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modern man\u00ad agement, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. The Master's degree is professional in nature and is intended to provide future managers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques; the Ph.D. in Management is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. Educational Objectives The Graduate School of Management offers a generalist M.B.A. degree and a learning experience that prepares graduates for a life\u00ad time of professional and personal growth with increasingly impor\u00ad tant enterprise-wide responsibilities. The rigorous curriculum, combined with extensive professional and interpersonal training and opportunities made available through the School's Career Ser\u00ad vices Office and Center for Leadership Development, allows stu\u00ad dents to gain theoretical perspectives that are in turn tested and affirmed with practical application. What results is an environment that fosters the development of professional and personal skills vital to contemporary executives or managers. Students are encour\u00ad aged to develop their ability to lead change by mastering commu\u00ad nication skills, to work productively and actively within a team\u00ad oriented environment, to gain a solid grasp of quantitative skills, and to appreciate and effectively employ those solutions that involve the integration and implementation of information and technology to offer creatively viable business options. GSM has developed a strategic focus on Information Technology for Management (ITM), a theme that is incorporated in many areas of the curriculum. Although a solid grounding in basic business disciplines provides the foundation for effective management, GSM's graduates are encouraged to aim higher. They learn about change as it takes place within the context of a knowledge-based, technology-driven society where information and its effective use are vital to establishing a competitive edge. GSM students, whether they are interested in finance, marketing, general manage\u00ad ment, strategic planning, accounting, operations, health care, human resources, international business, or other areas, will be thoroughly imbued and comfortable with the nature, importance, and handling of information in all of these and other fields. Fur\u00ad ther, they will understand the technology and the technological processes that enable the gathering, analysis, dissemination, and use of information to change the way business is done. The strate\u00ad gic focus of the School is to provide skills that will enable its grad\u00ad uates to be effective managers who are not only proficient in busi\u00ad ness procedures but have the leadership qualities and know-how to affect change by transforming conventional business practices or perhaps even inventing new business processes and management techniques. Management 281 The Graduate School of Management has created an information\u00ad rich environment that cuts across all business disciplines by pro\u00ad viding its students, faculty, and staff with technological tools that enable each member of the School to retrieve and analyze informa\u00ad tion that can be used to develop new processes or solve complex problems. Five ITM laboratories in the core disciplines are a criti\u00ad cal part of the learning experience, and students' familiarity and ease with Information Technology for Management serve as back\u00ad drop for many other courses. Additionally, GSM has also achieved a national reputation for excellence in graduate management education in the health care industry through the Health Care Executive M.B.A. (HCEMBA) program. Industry managers and health care professionals learn about managerial challenges and issues in the health care industry where hundreds of health care providers, medical device and instrumentation companies, and biosciences firms are headquar\u00ad tered. Students also have the opportunity to pursue both the M.D. degree and the M.B.A. degree. Details about these programs can be obtained through GSM's Office of Admissions and Marketing. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Master's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The Univer\u00ad sity admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 600 for all M.B.A. programs. Substantive work experi\u00ad ence is considered for applicants to M.B.A. programs.

There are many appropriate under\u00ad graduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, politi\u00ad cal science, business or public administration, mathematics, com\u00ad puter sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precur\u00ad sors for management (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior, operations and decision technologies, management information systems, finance, account\u00ad ing, marketing, and strategy/policy. Requirements of the Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram include a broad knowledge of core management disciplines. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a dissertation demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 282 UCI 1999-2000 Graduate School of Management The Ph.D. program is divided into two phases: qualification and dissertation.

Master's Degree Programs GSM offers a variety of programs leading to the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) degree. These include a two-year, full-time M.B.A. program, and three part-time M.B.A. programs: a 21-month Executive M.B.A. program, a two-year Health Care Executive M.B.A. program, and a three-year Fully Employed M.~.A. program. M.B.A. PROGRAM GSM admits students to the two-year, full-time M.B.A. program in the fall quarter. Students from a variety of undergraduate disci\u00ad plines, including liberal arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering, are encouraged to apply. The final deadline for completion of all phases of the appli\u00ad cation procedure is May I. In addition to the general University rules governing admission to graduate study, GSM normally requires the following: I. Completion of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). 2. Completion of a course in both introductory calculus and statis\u00ad tics with probability with a grade of B or better. Undergraduate courses in the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, sociology), information and computer sciences, and accounting are strongly recommended. Students also are encouraged to un\u00ad dertake intensive course work in the culture, history, geography, economy, politics, and language of specific foreign countries. The evaluation of an applicant's file for admission consists of an integrated assessment of all materials submitted including test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statements on appli\u00ad cation forms, and letters of recommendation. Above and beyond these factors, substantive work experience is given serious consid\u00ad eration in the evaluation process. The full-time M.B.A. program requires a minill!um of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The curriculum consists of courses divided into two groups designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as follows: 12 required Common Core Courses and 11 elective courses which students select to emphasize career goals and educational interests. A thesis is not required. Required Course Work. Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Management Science or Operations Manage\u00ad ment, Organizational Analysis for Management, Financial and Man\u00ad agerial Accounting for Management, Microeconomics, Macroeco\u00ad nomics for Management or Government and Public Policy, Information Technology for Management, Marketing for Manage\u00ad ment, Managerial Finance, Business Strategy. International Requirement. Students must fulfill the international requirement in one of the following ways; completion of a GSM international elective in a functional area; participation in a GSM international exchange program; or completion of an upper-division or graduate international course offered by a University of Califor\u00ad nia school, with the approval of the GSM Associate Dean. Electives. Eleven electives are required. The major emphasis in the elective courses is to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a par\u00ad ticular set of technical tools and methods. Students select their elec\u00ad tives in light of their educational and career goals and interests. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the full-time Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree, outstanding UCI under\u00ad graduate students may apply to enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with GSM and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advanced admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of their junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degree. Successful completion of the require\u00ad ments in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and the M.B.A. degree after the fifth year. Students should consult with their acad\u00ad emic counselor in their major school for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of their junior year for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergraduates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. Special Opportunities UCI offers students an opportunity to pursue both the M.D. degree and the M.B.A. degree. This opportunity is beneficial for individu\u00ad als who seek a career as a physician with major responsibility for administration and management in health care organizations. Con\u00ad tact the College of Medicine Admissions Office at (949) 824-5388 for information. Within the M.B.A. program, GSM created a specialized track and curriculum in Information Technology for Management that pro\u00ad vides students with sophisticated, state-of-the-art knowledge and practical experience in this rapidly evolving arena. Students in the ITM track take the customary M.B.A. core courses, augmented by a set of ITM application courses in various functional areas. In addition, many of the electives are specialized courses that reflect the changing nature of organizational management. Representative electives are: Network and Electronic Commerce, Management of Information Systems, Information Technology-Under the Hood, Information and Managerial Decision Making, Database Market\u00ad ing, Marketing on the Internet, and Change Management. Addi\u00ad tional activities designed to supplement this innovative curriculum include seminars given by industry leaders and relevant internships. Students are advised to note their interest in the ITM track on the application when they first apply to the M.B.A. program. In addi\u00ad tion to the standard admissions criteria, the Admissions Committee is particularly interested in how prospective candidates envision the current role and future potential of information technology in business. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The Graduate School of Management offers course work in Health Care Management within the M.B.A. program. The courses provide training not only in health care and related issues, but also expose students to professionals in the areas of management, finance, mar\u00ad keting, and strategic planning. Skills in these areas are critical to the success of health care organizations as we face the new millennium. In today's interconnected global business world, it has become increasingly important for management students to learn to operate in an international environment. M.B.A. students in the full-time program can gain first-hand knowledge of the culture and manage\u00ad ment practices of other industrialized countries by participating in an academic exchange with universities located abroad. This expe\u00ad rience, combined with GSM course work in international manage\u00ad ment, prepares students for the demands and complexities of the growing global economic environment. Currently, GSM has exchange relationships with the ESSEC Graduate agement, Cergy-Pontoise, France; Economic Sciences (BUES), Budapest, Hungary; Vienna University of Economics and Business Universitat, (The of Technology and Higher Educa\u00ad tion), Monterrey, Mexico; Bocconi University, Milan, Italy; and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong. To complement the academic curriculum, a Consulting Practicum course provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. The Consulting Practicum pro\u00ad vides students with an opportunity to put into practice concepts, skills, and tools acquired in other parts of the GSM program. Sem\u00ad inar sessions augment internship experiences with analyses of rele\u00ad vant administrative issues. Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO), which was recently designated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as one of six industry-Univer\u00ad sity Information Research Centers in the United States. CRITO is a consortium of corporations working together with faculty at UCI and elsewhere to better understand the evolving fabric of the infor\u00ad mation society and its implications for the design, use, and man\u00ad agement of information and technology in various user environ\u00ad ments. These environments range from the individual user's environment to work-groups, organizations, social communities, and society. The aim is to determine how organizations can more effectively use information and better design and manage new technology for improving organizational performance and society more generally. CRITO faculty associates are recognized internationally for their excellence in the study of information technology as it applies to complex organizations. This tradition of excellence has been estab\u00ad lished by faculty from the Graduate School of Management, the Department of Information and Computer Science, and the School of Social Sciences. These associates have collaborated since 1974 on theoretical and empirical research projects studying a broad array of questions about the relationship between information tech\u00ad nology and organizational structure, society, political behavior, productivity, and performance. Research conducted through CRITO focuses on the management, use, and impact of informa\u00ad tion technology in the emerging global, competitive marketplace and the policy issues raised by such use. CRITO facilitates a match between the technical and organizational dimensions and between academic researchers and information technology professionals, and also assists organizations in exploiting the potential offered by information technology. CRITO's goals are to conduct theoretical and empirical research, bring multiple intellectual perspectives and Management 283 methods to bear on interdisciplinary research, and facilitate the collaboration of faculty, students, and the professional community utilizing the expertise, facilities, and activities provided by CRITO. Qualified GSM students are encouraged to participate in the various CRITO research activities and to avail themselves of this unique opportunity to interact with scholars from allied disciplines and to study in-depth the effects of the information technology revolution. M.B.A. Career Services The M.B.A. Career Services Office, located within the School, was established to serve the unique placement needs of M.B.A. stu\u00ad dents and alumni. It has two main functions: (1) attracting a vari\u00ad ety of organizations to interview and hire graduates and (2) coun\u00ad seling students in career opportunities and the techniques necessary to conduct effective job searches, not only for their first jobs but throughout their careers. The relatively small size of the M.B.A. program allows considerable interaction between the Career Ser\u00ad vices Office and students. EXECUTIVE M.B.A. PROGRAM The Executive M.B.A. (EMBA) program presents a challenging 21-month course of study specifically designed for working profes\u00ad sionals and managers with a minimum of eight years of work expe\u00ad rience.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES Ronald J. Stem, Dean 180 Rowland Hall Academic Counseling: (949) 824-6507 World Wide Web: http://www.physsci.uci.edu/ The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Earth Sys\u00ad tem Science, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy. The fac\u00ad ulty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of stu\u00ad dents ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scien\u00ad tists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will pre\u00ad pare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the depart\u00ad mental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomitant increase in understanding of the physical uni\u00ad verse provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contemporary civiliza\u00ad tion, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. Earth system science is grounded in the traditional physical sciences while breaking new paths in the quantitative study of changes in the global environment. DEGREES Chemistry ............................................................... B.S., M.S., Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candi\u00ad dates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approximately 1 per\u00ad cent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research, cumulative grade point average, and performance in upper-division courses in the major. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other impor\u00ad tant factors are considered (see page 50). The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distin\u00ad guished themselves by their work in their major subject. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to complete a coordinated set of courses beyond the introductory level in Mathematics and in Earth and Atmos\u00ad pheric Sciences may pursue minors in these areas. Introductory courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students who choose a major in the School of Physical Sciences have a variety of academic advising and counseling resources available to them. In addition to faculty advisors, there is a Chief Academic Advisor in each department who is responsible for inter\u00ad preting degree requirements, reviewing student petitions, and assisting with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff, employed in the Associate Dean's Office, is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In con\u00ad sultation with their faculty advisor or an academic counselor, stu\u00ad dents should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, students may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-divi\u00ad sion work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these pre\u00ad requisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry usually will include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be accomplished by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 21, Engineering ElO, CEElO, MAElO, ECEll, or Physics 53. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The majority of graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engi\u00ad neering, or postsecondary education. Some students enter profes\u00ad sional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business administration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, marketing, or sales. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS Campuswide Honors Program The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World 1999-2000I 290 UCI 1999-2000 School of Physical Sciences Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. See the Center for International Education section for additional information. 3-2 Program Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Interdisciplinary Minors These interdisciplinary minors are available to all UCI undergradu\u00ad ates. A brief description follows; detailed information is included in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. The minor in Conflict Resolution provides skills in conflict analysis and resolution and a useful understanding of integrative institutions at the local, regional, and international levels. The minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human popula\u00ad tion to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources avail\u00ad able on this planet. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to sat\u00ad isfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry lA-B-C (or the Honors sequence Chemistry H2A-B-C) is prerequisite to all UC IRVINE - 1999-2000study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject mat\u00ad ter of this course serves also as a thorough introduction to the var\u00ad ied aspects of modem chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond the introductory level. In order to enroll in Chemistry 1A, students must pass the Chem\u00ad istry Placement Examination, which is given in late spring, sum\u00ad mer, and during Orientation Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter. A preparatory course, Chemistry 1P, is offered in summer and fall for those who do not pass the Chemistry Placement Exam\u00ad ination or who need additional preparation prior to entering Chem\u00ad istry 1A. A grade of Cor better in Chemistry 1P automatically qualifies the student for Chemistry 1A. Completion of a one-year sequence in organic chemistry, either Chemistry 51A-B-C or 52A-B-C, is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of interest to others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department empha\u00ad sizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research or independent study under the direction of a faculty member. A handout describing the procedures for arranging an undergraduate research opportunity is available from the Chem\u00ad istry Undergraduate Program Office, 248/250 Rowland Hall. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, Japanese, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to contact the UCI Department of Educa\u00ad tion. A two-year post-baccalaureate program leading to the M.S. in Chemistry and a California Secondary Teaching Credential is described in the Chemistry Graduate Program section. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other pro\u00ad fessional schools should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Counseling about preparation for a career in the health sciences is provided by the health science advisors in the School of Biological Sciences. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with a faculty member no later than the fall quarter of their senior year. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Chemistry major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of general chemistry with laboratory and one year of approved calculus.

Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four\u00ad or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Earth System Science, Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and Information and Computer Science, and the Schools of Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences and Engineering, excluding the following: Earth Sys\u00ad tem Science 20E, F, H90, Mathematics H90, Physics 1, Physics 3A-B-C, Physics H90, and courses which are designed primarily for upper-division writing or tutoring credit. No more than two quarters of the requirement may be met with independent study or research courses. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) HONORS PROGRAM IN CHEMISTRY The Honors Program in Chemistry is a research-based program offered to selected Chemistry majors during their final year. Appli\u00ad cants to the program must have completed their junior year with a grade point average of at least 3.3 overall and in their Chemistry courses. They must also have demonstrated the potential of carrying out research of honors quality, as judged by the Chemistry faculty member who will supervise their research. Students in this program enroll in Honors Research in Chemistry (Chemistry H180A-B-C) throughout their senior year and submit a formal thesis late in the spring quarter. They also enroll in the Honors Seminar in Chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry H181), in which they receive instruction in scien\u00ad tific writing and present a formal research seminar. Successful completion of Chemistry H181 satisfies the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who complete these requirements, whose grade point average remains above the 3.3 standard, and whose research is judged to be of honors quality will graduate with Departmental Honors in Chemistry. The Department also offers an Honors General Chemistry sequence, H2A-B-C. This course in general chemistry is designed for members of the Campuswide Honors Program (CHP) and other highly qualified students. It covers the same material as Chemistry 1A-B-C, but in greater depth. Additional information is available from the Chemistry Undergradu\u00ad ate Program Office. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 292 UCI 1999-2000 School of Physical Sciences PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coin\u00ad cide with those of the School of Biological Sciences. For this rea\u00ad son a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences is popu\u00ad lar and requires little extra course work. The Department is approved by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergrad\u00ad uate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not mandatory, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the Department judges to merit a certified degree. Specifically, the following courses must be included in the pro\u00ad gram of study: two courses from Mathematics 2D-F, 3A, 3D; Chemistry 152 and 153; at least one advanced laboratory course from Chemistry 156, 160, 170, and 180. These courses must be taken for a letter grade. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry 1A-B-C or H2A-B-C and lLB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 52A-B-C and 52LA-LB-LC (or 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC); the Physics 5 (or 7) sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement and the Chemistry Department sci\u00ad entific breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in a year sequence of physical chemistry and in Chemistry 1511151L (fall), 107 (winter), and 107L (spring). Chemistry 130A-B-C and 131A\u00ad B-C are equivalent courses in physical chemistry. They have the same prerequisites and expect the same level of chemical and mathematical rigor. Both are acceptable to satisfy the physical chemistry requirement for the major. Chemistry 131A-B-C devel\u00ad ops the topic beginning from a molecular or microscopic point of view and proceeds to the macroscopic description of matter; appli\u00ad cations may address primarily gas phase systems. Chemistry 130A\u00ad B-C, on the other hand, commences with the macroscopic descrip\u00ad tion; this approach may be of particular interest for applications of physical chemistry in biology, materials science, and engineering. Students should choose between the two courses on the basis of their interests. Because of significant differences in the sequence of topics, students starting in one series may not switch to the other in subsequent quarters. During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department elec\u00ad tives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University and departmental requirements. \u00b7 Sample programs for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Soci\u00ad ety-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences double majors are shown in the accompanying charts. Sample pro\u00ad grams for Chemistry majors wishing to emphasize chemical physics, computational or theoretical chemistry, chemical synthesis and reactivity, materials or polymer science, or public school science teaching in their undergraduate programs are available from the Chemistry Undergraduate Program Office, 248/250 Rowland Hall. The faculty encourages Chemistry majors to enhance their educa\u00ad tion by studying abroad for one or more quarters, or during the summer. In most cases, the Chemistry EAP advisor can help stu\u00ad dents plan a program of study that will not extend the time it takes to graduate. Also, study abroad can enhance students' applications for admission to graduate and professional schools. For more infor\u00ad mation about opportunities to study abroad, see the Center for International Education section of this Catalogue or visit the Phys\u00ad ical Sciences Student Affairs Office.

Satellite or Lab or Lab or Lab Breadth/Elective Breadth/Elective Breadth/Elective UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Graduate Program The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recog\u00ad nition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chem\u00ad ical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work and a comprehensive oral examination (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs, all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' compe\u00ad tence in the general areas of chemistry (e.g., organic, physical, inorganic) at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper fundamental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses (or 28 units), including six graduate-level courses (or 24 units), in chem\u00ad istry. The M.S. Plan II (Non-Thesis) program requires that the stu\u00ad dent complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses (or 40 units) and a comprehensive oral examination. Graduate students are expected to attain grades of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Progress toward the Ph.D. degree during the first year is assessed by a written examination administered after completion of the first year of study. This examination covers either research accomplish\u00ad ments during the first year or comprehensive knowledge acquired in course work. The time and content of the examination depends upon the student's specific area of interest. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate program, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least four quarters during their gradu\u00ad ate career. Participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examination for for\u00ad mal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's second or third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project, and an original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doc\u00ad toral dissertation, which must describe the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a fac\u00ad ulty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for pub\u00ad lication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, follow\u00ad ing which the candidate will be examined in public on the contents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. How\u00ad ever, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Chemistry 293 CONCENTRATION IN CHEMICAL AND MATERIALS PHYSICS This is an interdisciplinary program between condensed matter physics and physical chemistry which is designed to eliminate the barrier between these two disciplines. Students with B.S. degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science and Engineering, are encouraged to apply to the program. The goal of the concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) is to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary education in the applied physical sci\u00ad ences that emphasizes modern laboratory and computational skills. The program accepts students for both the master's and the Ph.D. degrees. Upon admission to the program, students are assigned two faculty advisors, one from the Department of Physics and Astron\u00ad omy, and one from the Department of Chemistry, to provide guid\u00ad ance on curriculum and career planning. The curriculum for the master's program includes a summer ses\u00ad sion to assimilate students with different undergraduate back\u00ad grounds; formal shop, laboratory, and computational courses; a sequence on current topics to bridge the gap between fundamental principles and applied technology; and a course to develop com\u00ad munication skills. The core courses are: Chemistry 206, 213, 228, 230, 231A-B-C, 232A-B-C, 236, 266; Physics 213C, 229A-B, 273. In addition to the core, M.S. students complete four electives approved by the student's Advisory Committee and a master's the\u00ad sis. The Master's program prepares students to compete for high\u00ad tech jobs or to begin research leading to a Ph.D. Successful completion of the M.S. degree requirements qualifies students for the Ph.D. program. A candidacy examination consist\u00ad ing of an original research proposal and a research progress report is expected to be completed within a year of starting the Ph.D. program. CONCENTRATION IN PROTEIN ENGINEERING SCIENCE Several faculty in the Department of Chemistry, in conjunction with faculty in the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Engineering, participate in the joint graduate program in Protein Engineering. This interdisciplinary graduate program offers stu\u00ad dents the opportunity to work with faculty in any of the participat\u00ad ing academic units; take course work in the areas of protein struc\u00ad ture, function, and molecular biology; and earn the Ph.D. in Chemistry, Biological Sciences, or Engineering with a concentra\u00ad tion in Protein Engineering Science. Additional information is available in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Cata\u00ad logue and through the graduate program in Protein Engineering office in the Biological Sciences Administration Building. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Chem\u00ad istry Department sponsors a coordinated two-year program leading to the M.S. degree in Chemistry and the California Single Subject Teaching Credential. The M.S. degree may be obtained under either Plan I or Plan II described below. Prospective graduate stu\u00ad dents interested in this program should so indicate on their gradu\u00ad ate application and should request a detailed description of the pro\u00ad gram from the Chemistry Department Graduate Affairs Office or the Department of Education.

In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathematics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the instructor in charge. Mathematics 303 MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MATHEMATICS The Department offers three pathways which lead to the Master of Science in Mathematics degree: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathe\u00ad matics, and the Master of Science with a Teaching Credential. The first two programs are described below; the third is described in the next section. The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some students it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, lan\u00ad guage, and residency requirements, and pass a comprehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. There are two areas of concentration: Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. Each concentration requires the satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate lecture courses; this includes a core of nine courses (36 units), in each of which the stu\u00ad dent must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better, and three elective courses (9 to 12 units). At least eight of these courses must be at the graduate level (200-series courses). The specific requirements are described below. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The stu\u00ad dent's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concen\u00ad tration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, and 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics con\u00ad centration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, and the A-B-C sequence of one of the following: Mathematics 201, 292, 295, or Physics 212. The student must complete three additional approved courses; these may be selected from the preceding list. In order to satisfy the Comprehensive Examination requirement in the regular Master's program in Mathematics, a student in either the Pure Mathematics concentration or the Applied Mathematics concentration must pass two of the three written Area Examina\u00ad tions (see the Ph.D. program below) at the Master's level or better. Students must satisfy the language requirement by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian. The residency requirement ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. Master of Science in Mathematics with a Teaching Credential In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Depart\u00ad ment of Mathematics sponsors a coordinated two-year program leading to the M.S. degree in Mathematics and the California Sin\u00ad gle Subject Teaching Credential. In this program the M.S. degree can be obtained under one of two plans: either Plan I (Thesis) or Plan II (Comprehensive Examination). Prospective graduate stu\u00ad dents interested in this program should so indicate on their applica\u00ad tions and should request a detailed description of the program from the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Education. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN MATHEMATICS A student seeking the Ph.D. in Mathematics must demonstrate mastery in the three basic areas of Real Analysis, Complex Analy\u00ad sis, and Algebra, by (a) passing Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B\u00ad C, and 230A-B-C (or approved equivalents) with a grade of B or better; and (b) passing three written Area Examinations, one for each of these basic areas, at the Ph.D. level. The Area Examina\u00ad tions, which include both undergraduate and graduate material, are normally given twice each year, just before the start of the fall and UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 304 UCI 1999-2000 School of Physical Sciences winter quarters. All students seeking the Ph.D. degree must suc\u00ad cessfully complete these examinations within two years of entering the graduate program; students admitted to the Ph.D. program with a Master's degree in mathematics from another institution must successfully complete at least one of these examinations within one year (and complete the rest within two years). The Department also requires the following for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree: satisfactory performance at the post-Master's level in nine approved one-quarter graduate lecture courses, which must exclude Mathematics 201, 202; 204, 210, 220, 230, 298, 299, and 399; satisfactory performance in one language examination (French, German, or Russian); and satisfactory perfor\u00ad mance in the oral qualifying examination. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy com\u00ad mittee, appointed by Department on behalf of the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and the Graduate Council, including at least one mem\u00ad ber of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. After the student meets the requirements, the Graduate Studies Committee recommends to the Dean of Graduate Studies the advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to participate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative research in mathematics by writing and defending a dissertation that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathematics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doc\u00ad toral committee, appointed by the Department Chair on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts.an oral defense of the dissertation; and rec\u00ad ommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Yodh, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Professor of Physics (particle astrophysics) Clare Yu, Ph.D. Princeton University, Associate Professor of Physics (con- densed matter theory) Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of nat\u00ad ural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest particles of matter (quarks and leptons), nuclei, and atoms; the fundamental forces; the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engi\u00ad neering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers courses for stu\u00ad dents of various interests, from those in the humanities and social sciences, to those in biological sciences, and to those in physics, engineering, and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as ele\u00ad mentary particles, plasma physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. The fac\u00ad ulty is vigorous, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to community action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student\u00ad faculty interaction. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Undergraduate Program The goal of the undergraduate major in Physics is to develop expert problem solvers with a broad understanding of physical principles. The program is flexible and prepares students for careers in industrial research, applications programming, educa\u00ad tion, law, or business, as well as for graduate study in astronomy, biomedical physics, engineering, or physics. Annual mandatory meetings with faculty advisors assist students in selecting a pro\u00ad gram that matches their aptitudes and interests. Students complete either a standard track (such as the track for future Ph.D. physi\u00ad cists), or one of the formal concentrations or specializations (in Applied Physics, Biomedical Physics, Computational Physics, or Astrophysics). In addition, Physics majors may find the minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, offered by the Department of Earth System Science, to be of interest. The four lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized as follows: Physics 3: Intended audience: Premedical students, Biological Sci\u00ad ences Prerequisites: algebra and concurrent enrollment in Mathematics 2A. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics 5C with permission. Physics 5: Intended audience: Chemistry, Mathematics, and Engi\u00ad neering majors. Prerequisites: Mathematics 2A (Calculus); Physics 1 or passing score on physics placement test. Preparation for advanced courses: upper-division courses in physics with permission. Physics 7: Intended audience: Physics majors. Prerequisite: con\u00ad current enrollment in Mathematics 2. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics 51A. Physics 16-24: Intended audience: Nonscience majors. Prerequi\u00ad sites: none. Preparation for Advanced courses: none. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Physics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer stu\u00ad dents from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of approved calculus and one year of calculus\u00ad based physics with laboratory. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Physics 7A-B-C-D with laboratory 7LA-LB-LC; matics 2A-B-C; Physical Sciences 50A-B-C; Physics 51A-B; another or 197; and six additional coherently related four\u00ad unit courses. (The six coherently related courses are normally sat\u00ad isfied by concentrations, specializations, and tracks.) Requirements for the Concentration in Applied Physics The six additional coherently related courses required for the major must be in engineering and be approved by the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Physics and Astronomy 309 Requirements for the Concentration in Biomedical Physics Complete Biological Sciences 97, 98, and 99; Chemistry 1A-B-C, 1LB-LC, 51A-B, (or 52A-B). Requirements for the Concentration in Computational Physics Complete three courses in computer science (Information and Computer Science 21, 22, 23), two courses in numerical analysis plus the accompanying laboratories (Mathematics 105A-B, 105LA\u00ad LB), and one advanced computational course (Mathematics 107, 107L or Physics 131). Mathematics 6A is also recommended as a prerequisite. Requirements for the Specialization in Astrophysics Complete three astrophysics courses (Physics 137, 144, 145) and any two of the four special topics courses (Physics 132, 134, 135, 136). Honors Program in Physics The Honors Program in Physics provides an opportunity for selected students majoring in Physics to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas of the Department. Admission to the pro\u00ad gram is based on an application normally submitted by the sixth week of the spring quarter of the junior year. Applicants must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.4 and a grade point average in physics courses of 3.5 or better. (Exceptions to these procedures and standards may be granted in unusual circum\u00ad stances.) In selecting students for the program, the Department considers evidence of ability and interest in research. Students admitted to the program participate in a year-long course, Physics H196A-B-C, which includes two quarters of research and a final quarter in which a written thesis is submitted. If this work and the student's final GPA are deemed of honors quality by the program advisor, the student then graduates with Departmental Honors in Physics. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical students, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 16 through 24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 should meet with the Department Undergraduate Advisor for placement information. The biological sciences physics require\u00ad ments may be met with Physics 3A-B-C or 5A-B-C. Physics 1 (or a satisfactory examination score as explained in the Physics 5A course description) is a prerequisite for the Physics 5 sequence and offers a review of math and problem-solving tech\u00ad niques in the context of introducing physics. Physics 5 is an intensive five-quarter course for students in chem\u00ad istry, engineering, and other areas who are interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll.in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics 5 should enroll in Mathematics 2D concur\u00ad rently with Physics 5C. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics 5 need not enroll in Mathematics 2D. Note that Physics 5A-B-C-D-E must be taken and passed in sequential order. Physics 7 is an intensive four-quarter introduction to macroscopic physics for Physics majors. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 310 UCI 1999-2000 School of Physical Sciences Physics courses numbered between 16 and 24 are general educa\u00ad tion courses intended for nonscience majors. The content and for\u00ad mat of Physics 21 through 24 will vary from year to year. The introduction to mathematical methods (Physical Sciences 50A\u00ad B-C), microscopic physics (Physics SlA-B), and experimental physics (Physics 52A-B-C) are normally taken in the sophomore year. Courses numbered 111 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. Courses numbered between 111 and 115 empha\u00ad size the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. It should be noted that multi-quarter courses such as 111A-B must be taken and passed in sequential order. Any student who is so inclined may take more than the mini\u00ad mum one quarter of advanced laboratory work. Courses numbered between 132 and 149 introduce active subdisciplines in current research. Independent research (195, 196) is strongly encouraged. Physics 196C, H196C, and 197 stress the written and verbal com\u00ad munication of research findings. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual con\u00ad sultation with a member of the Physics and Astronomy faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Introductory courses in biology and chemistry are recom\u00ad mended options. Note that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. Furthermore, exceptionally prepared students are allowed to enroll in graduate-level courses; to do so requires the approval of the Physics and Astronomy Department Undergraduate Committee.

Students preparing for graduate school in atmospheric science or physical oceanography should complete the minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. The Applied Physics concentration within the Physics undergradu\u00ad ate degree program is designed to provide appropriate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowl\u00ad edge obtained from engineering courses. In addition to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics and Astronomy Department. Examples of appropriate courses include Engineering ECE70, ECE113A completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. Sample Program -Applied Physics Concentration FALL WINTER SPRING Junior Physics concentration is designed for the student who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medi\u00ad cine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required as are nine quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to follow the Biomedical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coordination of a program in the first and second years is essential.

These degrees are awarded in recognition of demonstrated knowl\u00ad edge of the basic facts and theories of physics and of a demon\u00ad strated capacity for independent research. Active programs of research are underway in high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, low-temperature physics, plasma physics, gravitational physics, and astrophysics. In general, graduate study in the physics Ph.D. program is expected to be a full-time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Completion of the Ph.D. typically requires six years of full-time study. Students may pursue the M.S. degree on either a full-time or part-time basis. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. Graduate students are members of an intellectual community and are expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high-energy, and plasma physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in Physics should obtain a copy of the Department's graduate brochure. Students admitted into the graduate program in Physics and Astronomy may elect to pursue the M.S. or Ph.D. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics, as described below. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN PHYSICS The requirements for the M.S. degree are (1) at least three quarters of residence; (2) mastery of graduate course material, which must be demonstrated by passing, with a grade of B or better, a mini\u00ad mum of eight quarter courses including Physics 211, 213A-B, 215A, 223, and at least one other course numbered between 200 1and .259; and ~3) either Option A, a research project and written lhes1s, or OptiOn B, a comprehensive written examination. f'\\ typical program of study for the M.S. degree consists of the fol\u00ad ~owing nine courses: Physics 211 (Classical Mechanics), 213A-B ~Electromagnetic Theory), 215A (Quantum Mechanics), 223 ~Numerical Methods), 224 (Phenomenology), 206 (Laboratory Skills) for experimentalists or 212 (Mathematical Physics) for the\u00ad ?rists, plus two electives chosen from Physics 215B or undergradu\u00ad fte upper-division courses in related areas. ~The requirements for the M.S. degree with a concentration in G=hemical and Materials Physics differ from these, as outlined on r noxt P'g<.) Physics and Astronomy 311 DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHYSICS The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a disserta\u00ad tion reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete certain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign language requirement. Course Requirements. Students are required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences-Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetic The\u00ad ory, Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Physics. A minimum of 12 quarter courses including 211, 213A-B, 214A, 215A-B, 223, and at least three other courses numbered between 200 and 259 must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students are strong!~ encouraged to take Physics 211, 213A-B, 214A, 215A-B, 223, and 206 (for experimentalists) or 212 (for theorists) in their first year of study. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (236A-B-C, 237A-B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C) in their second year of study. (The requirements for the Ph.D. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics differ from these, as outlined on the next page.) Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part,. covering a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate levels, is normally taken in the fall following the student's first year. The first oral examination is administered along with the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be from the Department of Physics and Astronomy. A second attempt at this set of examinations will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordi\u00ad nary circumstances. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approxi\u00ad mately one year after successful completion of the written exami\u00ad nation and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty mem\u00ad bers from outside the Department. The second oral will cover material principally related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters dur\u00ad ing their graduate careers. All new teaching assistants are required to enroll in Physics 269. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original re\u00ad search performed by the student under the supervision of a doctor\u00ad al committee, appointed by the Department Chair on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, will be required for the Ph.D. degree. A criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The dissertation must not have been submit\u00ad ted to any other institution prior to its submission to the UCI Physics and Astronomy Department. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 312 UCI 1999-2000 School of Physical Sciences CONCENTRATION IN CHEMICAL AND MATERIALS PHYSICS This is an interdisciplinary program between condensed matter physics and physical chemistry which is designed to eliminate the barrier between these two disciplines. Students with B.S. degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science and Engineering, are encouraged to apply to the program. The goal of the concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) is to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary education in the applied physical sci\u00ad ences that emphasizes modern laboratory and computational skills. The program accepts students for both the master's and the Ph.D. degrees. Upon admission to the program, students are assigned two faculty advisors, one from the Department of Physics and Astron\u00ad omy, and one from the Department of Chemistry, to provide guid\u00ad ance on curriculum and career planning. The curriculum for the master's program includes a summer session to assimilate students with different undergraduate backgrounds; formal shop, laboratory, and computational courses; a sequence on current topics to bridge the gap between fundamental principles and applied technology; and a course to develop communication skills. The core courses are: Physics 206, 207, 213C, 226, 228, 229A-B, 266, 273; Chemistry 213, 231A-B-C, 232A-B-C, 236. In addition to the core, M.S. students complete four electives approved by the student's Advisory Committee and a master's the\u00ad sis. The Master's program prepares students to compete for high\u00ad tech jobs or to begin research leading to a Ph.D. Successful completion of the M.S. degree requirements qualifies students for the Ph.D. program. A candidacy examination consist\u00ad ing of an original research proposal and a research progress report is expected to be completed within a year of starting the Ph.D. program.

The School is comprised of the Departments of Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; Psychology and Social Behavior; and Urban and Regional Planning. It has more than 50 full-time faculty members, 1,490 undergraduate majors, and 160 graduate students. Social ecology applies scientific meth\u00ad ods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environ\u00ad mental problems. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences on human development over the life cycle, and effects of the physical environ\u00ad ment on health and behavior. In summary, while ecology is the sci\u00ad ence of the relationship between organisms and their environments, social ecology is the science of the relationships between human populations and their environments. The faculty is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists with a variety of specialties (e.g., developmental, clinical, social, and environmental), sociologists, program evaluators, criminologists, lawyers, urban and regional planners, environmental health scien\u00ad tists, and environmental design specialists. Faculty members con\u00ad duct research and teach courses that integrate concepts and perspec\u00ad tives of the several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). A number of faculty members are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities The Social Ecology Buildings I and II feature many facilities for experimental research, including wet laboratories for research and teaching in the environmental health sciences; behavioral assess\u00ad ment laboratories for research in human development, social rela\u00ad tions, and legal studies; and a simulation laboratory for studying the effects of environmental conditions. The wet laboratories are used for studying air and water pollution. The behavioral assess\u00ad ment laboratories are used for studying social phenomena such as parent-child interaction, cooperation among children, hyperactivity, social support processes, and mock jury discussions. The environ\u00ad mental simulation laboratory permits full-scale, realistic simula\u00ad tions of interior environments such as offices, classrooms, and apartments. Within these settings, physical conditions (e.g., ambi\u00ad ent lighting and color patterns, music and noise, spatial arrange\u00ad ments and physical density) and social processes (e.g., group com\u00ad munication patterns) can be varied experimentally so that researchers can assess the separate and joint effects of these condi\u00ad tions and processes upon occupants' performance and well-being.

Selection criteria are subject to change. Students should consult with the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office for cur\u00ad rent information. HONORS PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Social Ecology Honors Prog~am provides the opportunity for selected School of Social Ecology students to pursue advanced independent study. Admission to the program is based on formal application normally submitted in the spring quarter of the junior year. In order to be considered, a student must have satisfied the following requirements: completion of all lower-division Social Ecology courses required for the major; completion of at least five upper-division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achievement of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Invitation to the pro\u00ad gram is based upon evidence of the student's ability, interest in research, and proposed thesis project. Successful completion of the program requires two quarters of supervised, independent work on a thesis research project (Social Ecology H190A-B) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (Social Ecology H190W). CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates of the School of Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The School pro\u00ad vides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in plan\u00ad ning departments, mental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management. The School also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administra\u00ad tion, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminol\u00ad ogy, and urban planning. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional information is available in the Career Center section. FIELD STUDY An important aspect of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is designed to provide students with an opportunity to examine social-environmental problems as they occur in community settings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in the classroom; and to conduct naturalistic observations and investigations at field sites. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students have the opportunity to test their skills in the community, to evaluate procedures and problem-solv\u00ad ing strategies used in the work place, and to observe the links between community practices and academic ideas and issues. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of prob\u00ad lem-oriented institutions and agencies in both the private and the public sector (e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office; Irvine Medical Center; California Coastal Commission; American Red Cross; primary and secondary schools; Fairview Development Center; planning, legal, and design corporations). Students must select a placement site from those listed and approved by the School of Social Ecology. Unlisted or inappropriate placements, as well as those that could give the appearance of nepotism or prefer\u00ad ential treatment, will not be approved. Departmental approval for field study will be determined by the Field Study Coordinator. Field study is open only to upper-division School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy students who are in good academic standing and have com\u00ad pleted all prerequisite course work. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass grading basis. Further information, including field study sign-up procedures and prerequisites, must be obtained from the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office. Planning a Program of Study Because there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major require\u00ad ments, students should consult with the Undergraduate Counseling Office, 163 Social Ecology Building, to design an appropriate pro\u00ad gram of study. Students who elect one of the majors in the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy in their freshman year might begin by taking the introductory courses required by their major. It is a good idea to take these courses early because they include fundamental concepts that are widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (cat\u00ad egory I) should be completed during the first year. In the sopho\u00ad more year, the student might complete three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in their major, and four elec\u00ad tives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, statistics, and other areas UC IRVINE - 1999-2000important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the stu\u00ad dent should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements Criminology, Law and Society J7, Environmental Analysis and Design E8, Psychology and Social Behavior P9, Social Ecology 10, 13, 194, 195 (four units), and one additional upper-division course (four units) chosen from any department in the School of Social Ecology or an additional four units of Social Ecology 195.

Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology 163 Social Ecology; (949) 824-6861 101 Biological Sciences Administration; (949) 824-5318 The School of Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a program of undergraduate instruction leading to a B.S. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental planning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisci\u00ad plinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for students to specialize in an area of their choice. Transfer Applicants: See page 41. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000CAREERSINAPPUEDECOLOGV Careers in the fields of environmental and resource management and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology back\u00ad ground. Many graduates hold technical or administrative positions in, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Department of Fish and Game, and Depart\u00ad ment of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. Industrial health professionals are in demand to help determine the safety of workplace environ\u00ad ments for the labor force. The Applied Ecology major also pro\u00ad vides a strong academic foundation for graduate or professional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environ\u00ad mental health science, microbiology, public health, law, medicine, planning, and administration. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a comprehen\u00ad sive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engineer\u00ad ing perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN APPLIED ECOLOGY University Requirements: See pages 54-59.

Environmental Health Science: Biological Sciences Management: Biological Sciences 122, 127, 178, 189; Environmental and Society 321 DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY Henry N. Pontell, Department Chair The Department of Criminology, Law and Society focuses, first, on the manifestations of criminal behavior and the methods for con\u00ad trolling that behavior, and second, on the relationships and interac\u00ad tions between social processes and legal systems. Basic courses present overviews of American legal systems with particular emphasis on criminal and juvenile justice, the forms of criminal behavior, the role of law in understanding social and psychological phenomena, and the applications of sociological theory in under\u00ad standing law and legal systems. Subsequent course work provides understanding of the theoretical structures used to explain criminal behavior, the effects of crimes from the perspectives of victims, the operations of systems of justice and their underlying institutions, the goals of governmental regulation and the methods used to achieve those goals, and more advanced issues in the interactions of law and such fields as psychology, sociology, and planning. In addition, substantive areas of law, such as criminal, environmental, and family law, are introduced. The undergraduate program leads to a B.A. degree in Criminology, Law and Society. Students are provided with opportunities to become acquainted with the varieties of behavior that society chooses to control or regulate, the methods and institutions used to achieve that control or regulation, and the approaches aimed specifically at altering unacceptable behavior. In addition, there is provision for students to use their increasing knowledge of the law, its procedures, and institutions to enhance their understanding of the social sciences. The course of study provides excellent preparation for law school and for graduate study in sociology, criminology, and criminal jus\u00ad tice. Careers for students who terminate their University education at the baccalaureate level may be developed through placements in criminal justice and regulatory agencies, in organizations determin\u00ad ing public policy, and in programs that deliver services to people who have difficulties with some aspect of the legal system. Students are strongly encouraged to select electives in a variety of departments. Courses in areas such as Psychology, Sociology, Eco\u00ad nomics, and Political Science can provide a further context for the understanding of crime, law, and criminal justice, while courses in areas such as art history, theater, and music can enhance the quality of the student's entire life. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the State juvenile detention sys\u00ad tem, the Orange County Victim/Witness Assistance Program, juve\u00ad nile shelters, legislative offices, and in private legal firms. Information on the graduate program begins on page 332. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 319.

Rook, Department Chair The Department of Psychology and Social Behavior is concerned with human behavior in social contexts. A major objective is to investigate how different social environments (e.g., the family, school, workplace) affect human behavior over the life cycle. Stu\u00ad dents begin with basic course work in developmental, social, health, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work exam\u00ad ines a variety of topics pertinent to the fields of abnormal, devel\u00ad opmental, clinical, health, social, and environmental psychology, and the psychological study of social problems. Courses cover such topics as psychosocial development in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly; childhood behavior disorders and develop\u00ad mental psychopathology; sex differences; attitude formation and change; psychology; and emotion; stress and coping; cross-cultural influences on behavior; and counseling and therapy. Opportunities also are available to work with faculty on research in these and other areas. The undergraduate program leads to a B.A. degree in Psychology and Social Behavior. Students are given a foundation that will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sectors or to do grad\u00ad uate work in psychology, human development, public health, health services, social work, counseling, or education. Field study opportunities include schools, child care facilities, community clin\u00ad ics, counseling centers, hospital settings, and social service agen\u00ad cies, among others. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs at UCI. Students inter\u00ad ested in developmental, clinical, health, social, or environmental psychology, or in psychology and the law, are advised to consult the course listings here in the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior section. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course listings in the Department of Cog\u00ad nitive Sciences and the School of Biological Sciences sections of the Catalogue. In addition to courses in the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior, recommended courses for students who anticipate pursu\u00ad ing graduate study in psychology include: Biological Sciences 35, (The Brain and Behavior); Social Ecology 166A-B-C (Social Sci\u00ad ence Statistics I, II, III); and Psychology 112A-B-C (Experimental Psychology), 140L (Learning Theory), and 140M (Human Memory). Obtaining research experience as an undergraduate also provides a valuable background for entry into many graduate programs. Information on the graduate program begins on page 332.

DEPARTMENT OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING World Wide Web: http://www.seweb.uci.edu/depart/urp_home.html Scott A. Bollens, Department Chair Established in 1992, the Department of Urban and Regional Plan\u00ad ning utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to urban community problem solving. The Department faculty devote their scholarly and teaching efforts to theory-driven and empirically oriented urban research and their interests include community development and social policy, economics and public policy, environmental pol\u00ad icy, land-use policy, transportation policy, community health pol\u00ad icy, and urban design and behavior. Collaborative academic and research ties are maintained with other units on campus including the School of Social Sciences, the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment, and the Institute of Transportation Studies. The Department's teaching, research, and graduate training utilize UCI's close prox\u00ad imity to both urban centers and planned suburban communities, as well as the University's location within the dynamic Southern Cali\u00ad fornia and Pacific Rim regions. Currently, the Department offers a program of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Urban and Regional Planning; the Master of Urban and Regional Planning degree (M.U.R.P), which is fully accredited by the National Planning Accreditation Board; and an undergradu\u00ad ate minor in Urban and Regional Planning. Departmental faculty also teach courses within the School's undergraduate programs in Social Ecology; Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; and Psychology and Social Behavior. The common mission linking the Department's undergraduate, master's, and doctorate-level instruction and faculty research efforts is to bring applied research to the cause of bettering neigh\u00ad borhoods, communities, and regions. Southern California has grown dramatically over the past three decades and will soon become the nation's largest urban corridor. The challenges to main\u00ad tain the quality of life, provide employment opportunities, and reduce the deep socioeconomic disparities of this binational, met\u00ad ropolitan, and multiethnic region are enormous. No other region in the United States has been faced with the kinds of problems and future possibilities that now confront Southern California and its increasingly diverse communities. If the challenges presented by contemporary urbanization are enor\u00ad mous, its promise is equally vast. Extremely diverse, multiethnic communities face the necessity of solving their problems in ways that are acceptable to their populations. Older central city areas that are vital to the region face issues of social and economic sus\u00ad tainability. The need to create employment opportunities, through the application of new technologies in industries and services, will UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 332 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Ecology be one of the most challenging policy questions facing urban regions. At the same time, urban growth and transportation will have to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulation that can safeguard the population's health and the quality of the natural environment. The urban design and landscape of most com\u00ad munities stand to be reshaped as never before, as the building stock ages and the need to redevelop increases. Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning: See page 336. Master of Urban and Regional Planning: See page 333. Urban and Regional Planning Minor Requirements Nine courses (36 units): Environmental Analysis and Design E8, El07U, and seven additional upper-division Environmental Analy\u00ad sis available in the Department of Environ\u00ad mental Analysis and Design section. NOTE: A maximum of three courses may be counted toward both the minor in Urban and Regional Planning and the majors in Envi\u00ad ronmental Analysis and Design or Social Ecology. (Environmental Analysis and Design E8 is by necessity one of the three.) GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate training in the School of Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and phys\u00ad ical environment. Emphasis is placed primarily upon theory and research that have implications for policy and intervention. Prob\u00ad lems are investigated from the complementary perspectives of a multidisciplinary faculty that includes specialists in social, devel\u00ad opmental, clinical, environmental, and health psychology; urban and regional planning and architecture; urban sociology; law; crim\u00ad inology; and environmental health. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences on health and human develop\u00ad ment over the life course, and the effects of the physical environ\u00ad ment on health and human behavior. The graduate curriculum emphasizes an interdisciplinary orientation, training students to draw upon the knowledge offered by several of the traditional aca\u00ad demic fields in order to examine important social, legal, and envi\u00ad ronmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. Programs of study leading to the M.A., M.S., M.U.R.P., and Ph.D. degrees are offered. Doctoral students have the opportunity to pur\u00ad sue an individualized course of study in the principles and methods of social ecology, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology, or a spe\u00ad cialized course of study that leads to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design. Addi\u00ad tional programs lead to one of the following degrees: Ph.D. in Criminology, Law and Society; Ph.D. in Environmental Health Science and Policy; Ph.D. in Health Psychology; Ph.D. in Human Development; or Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning. Master's degree students may elect a course of study that leads to the M.A. in Social Ecology, the M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis, the M.S. in Environmental Health Science and Policy, or the Master of Urban and Regional Planning. In addition, many students in the Ph.D. programs in Human Development, Health Psychology, and Criminology, Law and Society obtain an M.A. in Social Ecology on the way to their Ph.D. Social Ecology faculty members apply diverse methods of scien\u00ad tific inquiry to social and environmental problems. Evaluation research, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi-experimental tech\u00ad niques receive emphasis along with laboratory experimentation. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important com\u00ad ponent of graduate education in the School. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes human stress, health promotion, biobehavioral bases of health and illness, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral dis\u00ad orders, atypical child development, adaptive aging, end-of-life medical decision-making, violence and aggression, legal sanctions and deterrence, white-collar and org;1nized crime, police work, transitions to parenthood, personality and psychopathology, effects of social environments on early child development, urban growth management and policies, transportation policies, poverty and homelessness, water quality and water policy, air quality, biotech\u00ad nology, epidemiology, the use of scientific information in public policy formation and litigation, community approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention, the health impacts of work environments, and processes involved in environmental regulation. ADMISSION Students should submit their complete application file including the application form, transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores by January 9 if they are applying to the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior or by January 15 if they are applying to any other depart\u00ad ment. Additional information is available from the Social Ecology Graduate Counselors; telephone (949) 824-5917, 824-5918. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates enjoy a wide variety of career opportunities and have succeeded in obtaining positions in academic institutions such as Stanford University; Rutgers University; The Johns Hopkins Uni\u00ad versity; Temple University; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; University of Colorado; Uni\u00ad versity of Kansas; University of the Ore\u00ad gon; the University of Wisconsin; Indiana University; Carnegie Mellon University; and the City University of New York. Other graduates have established research and administrative careers in government agencies and private firms throughout the United States and Canada, including the National Institutes of Health, the Toronto Department of Public Health, The United Cerebral Palsy Foundation, The Philadelphia Geriatric Center, The New Mexico Tumor Registry, Orange County Superior Court, Southern Califor\u00ad nia Metropolitan Water District, and in marketing and research firms such as the Yankelovich Group. Master's Programs M.A. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY At the graduate level, the emphasis in the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy is on the Ph.D. program, with the exception of the M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis, the M.S. in Environmental Health Science and Policy, and the Master of Urban and Regional Planning. In very rare cir\u00ad cumstances a student may be admitted directly to the M.A. degree program in Social Ecology. Students interested in this option only must call the Social Ecology Graduate Office at (949) 824-5917 before submitting their applications. Master's degree students are assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of education. The pro\u00ad gram leading to the M.A. degree in Social Ecology requires a the\u00ad sis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), and at least one additional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's academic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate UC IRVINE - 1999-2000courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (Social Ecology 298, 299, or 295). A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee is appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. M.A. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRA\u00b7 TION IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS The M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis offers training in the practical research skills needed to address analytical problems confronting society, busi\u00ad ness, government, and the nonprofit sector. The concentration emphasizes the Pacific Rim and issues defining Southern Califor\u00ad nia's population, such as immigration, changing household and family structure, racial and economic inequalities, and the impact of local and regional population growth. Informed by the interdis\u00ad ciplinary field of demography, the program draws on faculty and courses in the Schools of Social Ecology and Social Sciences. The concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis offers the option of additional professional certification for doctoral students already admitted to the School of Social Ecology. Admission, core course, and thesis requirements are identical to those for the gen\u00ad eral M.A. in Social Ecology. In addition, students must complete 12 units of designated electives in population issues or research methods. Up to two upper-division undergraduate courses may be approved to fulfill the elective requirement. Students interested in this concentration should call the Graduate Counseling Office at (949) 824-5924 for more information. M.S. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY The Master of Science (M.S.) in Environmental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) trains environmental professionals for applied analytical and administrative positions in government, commerce, and the nonprofit sector. In common with the doctoral program in EHSP, training focuses on the integration of natural and social sci\u00ad ence knowledge for the promotion of human health within a sus\u00ad tainable ecosystem. M.S. students must complete a core of five required courses: Environmental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analysis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Social Ecology 252); and three electives. Students must also complete a field study of about six months in duration, resulting in a defended Master's thesis and degree completion within two to three years. MASTER OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING The Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) program trains researchers and professionals in contemporary methods of planning and policy analysis. The program is fully accredited by the National Planning Accreditation Board and has 14 core full\u00ad time faculty. Students gain familiarity with planning problems and practices through a series of courses on the growth and develop\u00ad ment of metropolitan areas, and the environmental, economic, and social challenges that modern communities face. This program views planners as mediators between the market-driven forces of metropolitan change and the environmental, economic, and social impacts of such change. \u00b7 The program leads to the M.U.R.P. degree-Master of Urban and Regional Planning. Students are required to complete 72 units, dis\u00ad tributed between core and elective courses. Required courses are History of Urban Planning (U202), Microeconomics Analysis for Urban Planning (U206), Quantitative Analysis for Planners (U214), Development Control Law and Policy or Environmental Law and Policy (U207 or U252), Analytical Methods for Planning (U215), Regional Analysis or Urban Sociology (U223 or U274), Social Ecology 333 and two quarters of Urban Planning Studio (U280A-B). Master's degree specializations include community development and social policy, economics and public policy, land use policy, environmen\u00ad tal policy and planning, transportation policy, community health planning, and urban design and behavior. In addition, a written comprehensive examination or a professional report is required during the last quarter of residency in the program. Successful completion of the examination or professional report is required before the degree can be awarded. A thesis is not required. Some of the specific planning issues addressed include the envi\u00ad ronmental, social, health, and economic impacts of urban and regional development; regional growth management; state and municipal fiscal policy; poverty-related concerns; urban design; the operation of housing markets; land-use law and regula\u00ad tion; transportation planning; and planning for urban development in newly industrialized countries. Students are provided not only with a rigorous foundation in the tools that public and private sec\u00ad tor planners use, but also with the intellectual wherewithal to use them effectively in addressing these concerns. Practical experience in community planning in the form of part\u00ad time planning internships is strongly encouraged and supported as part of a student's education. Additionally, a two-quarter Planning Studio in the second year of study links classroom learning to work on a community-based and client-based planning project. Students have access to drafting stations and computers for use in planning studies, geographic information systems (ARC-VIEW) courses, and research. Students also have full access to computer laboratories in the two Social Ecology buildings which are equipped with word processing, statistical, spreadsheet, and data\u00ad base programs; electronic mail, and World Wide Web browsers. The range of employment opportunities for professional planners in the public and private sectors is expanding due to rapid metro\u00ad politan growth, rising concerns over health and environmental issues, and the continuing need for redevelopment and social ser\u00ad vices in older communities. Career paths exist in government agen\u00ad cies dealing with urban planning, economic development, trans\u00ad portation planning, regional growth management, air quality and water treatment, public utilities, health care organizations and pub\u00ad lic health agencies, and conservation organizations and agencies. Many employment possibilities also exist with private consulting firms specializing in environmental impact assessment, with resi\u00ad dential and commercial development firms, and many engineering and architectural firms. Ph.D. Programs The doctoral programs offered by the School of Social Ecology prepare students for academic careers in research and teaching. Graduates also are well qualified for employment in private or government agencies, where they can bring advanced academic training, strong methodological and statistical skills, and special expertise to such issues as environmental health and design, urban and regional planning, criminal justice, and social policies affect\u00ad ing mental and physical health across the life course. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. in four to five years of study beyond the baccalaureate. Each incoming Ph.D. student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to dis\u00ad cuss an individualized program of graduate education. The follow\u00ad ing core courses are required of all Ph.D. students except those enrolled in the Environmental Health Science and Policy doctoral program and the Urban and Regional Planning doctoral program: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Meth\u00ad ods (Social Ecology 201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, and one additional approved research methods course. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 334 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Ecology In addition to these five required core courses, doctoral students take additional required and elective courses, as summarized in subsequent sections that describe the individual Ph.D. programs. This additional course work is exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (Social Ecology 297, 298, 299, or 296). School faculty believe that Ph.D. students should become involved in research very early in their graduate careers. To encourage such involvement, doctoral students are encouraged to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The method of research may include experiments, ques\u00ad tionnaire and interview studies, systematic field observation, sec\u00ad ondary analysis, computer simulations, legal research, and other methods. It is expected that students will begin their project during the first year in residence and will complete it during the second year. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree when all requirements except the dissertation have been completed, and when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the School of Social Ecology, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thor\u00ad ough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation, its current status, the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge, a detailed specification of the pro\u00ad posed method of investigating the problem, and a description of the planned methods for analyzing the data collected. It is strongly recommended that students advance to candidacy during their third year of study. In no case will students be allowed to advance to candidacy after the end of their fifth year of study. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree will be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alter\u00ad natively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral com\u00ad mittee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doc\u00ad toral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy. All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by members of the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D. degree, complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the School. Evaluation of Ph.D. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibil\u00ad ity of the student's doctoral dissertation committee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D. degree, each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The training program that leads to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology allows students to develop a tailored course of graduate study that draws upon the knowledge of several traditional academic disci\u00ad plines. This is a small distinguished program intended for gen\u00ad uinely interdisciplinary doctoral students. The emphases of this training program are in keeping with the academic mission of the School, namely, its emphases on an ecological approach to research and policy, an interdisciplinary approach to research and community intervention, and the application of theory and research to community problem solving. Students are encouraged to ~nte\u00ad grate the diverse theoretical and methodological insights of several disciplines in order to analyze important social and environmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. In doing so, students gain familiarity with the classic and contemporary lit\u00ad erature in social ecology and with the application of the ecological paradigm, as it has evolved in the natural and behavioral sciences. This program is ideally suited for independent students who wish to develop a unique interdepartmental program of study in consul\u00ad tation with faculty from several departments. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted above, and six elective courses, chosen in consultation with the faculty advisor. The normative time for com\u00ad pletion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Students are encouraged to become involved in research in their first year of study by participating in the research projects of the faculty. Stu\u00ad dents complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. Research is broadly construed to include experimental methods, questionnaire and interview stud\u00ad ies, systematic field observation, secondary analyses, and legal analyses. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence and must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students complete the breadth requirement during their third year of study. This is accomplished through successful completion of either a written comprehensive examination or the submission of a major paper or series of papers that intensively examine specific substantive problems and bodies of research. Preferably, the per\u00ad spective taken should be multidisciplinary, but a single disciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecol\u00ad ogy faculty members. Students are encouraged to meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and imple\u00ad mented, the examining committee will determine whether the breadth requirement was successfully completed, and will recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. The fourth and possibly fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND DESIGN The doctoral concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design prepares students to conduct research on questions of vital impor\u00ad tance to professionals in environmental analysis and evaluation, in environmental design and behavior, and on related questions on the formulation of environmental and health policy. These questions reflect an overarching concern with the effects of the natural and built environments on the health and social well-being of humans. This doctoral concentration particularly focuses on insights from a social ecological perspective. One of the concentration's strengths is its research sequence which spans the disciplines within the Departments of Environmental Analysis and Design and Urban and Regional Planning. Students typically choose the majority of their graduate classes from those two departments. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Students conduct analyses of sociocultural, behavioral, and envi\u00ad ronmental factors that influence health and well-being, including public and private sector policy. They are also trained to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance the health of individuals and the community as a whole. The curriculum and diversity of faculty within the concentration afford unique opportu\u00ad nities for multidisciplinary research and training. Potential employment sources for graduates include academic and research institutions; federal agencies; policy-making organiza\u00ad tions; urban and regional planning agencies; national, community, and workplace health-promotion programs; and environmental design consulting firms. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted earlier, and eight elective courses drawn from the focal areas within this concentration: Environmental Design and Behavior, Environmental Policy, Earthquake Geology and Environmental Hazard, Social Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Health Promotion. The elective courses cover topics such as environmental and urban design, environmental health risks, urban planning, behavioral epidemiology, demography, urban and regional analysis, technological hazards and change, interna\u00ad tional environmental policy, environmental psychology, and geo\u00ad graphical information systems. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Students are expected to become involved in research activities in their first year of graduate study. Students complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence (preferably by the end of the winter quar\u00ad ter of the second year). The research project must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students com\u00ad plete the breadth requirement, described earlier, during their third year of study. The fourth and possibly fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. Ph.D. IN CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY The study of crime, institutional responses to illegal behavior, and the interaction of law and society are the foci of the doctoral pro\u00ad gram in Criminology, Law and Society. Students examine issues related to the etiology of crime, the process of changing criminal behavior, social regulation, the civil justice system, and the social and cultural context of law. Students gain familiarity with a number of subjects including sen\u00ad tencing; crime rates; modes of modifying criminal behavior; police behavior; white collar and organized crime; hate crimes; behavior of courts, juries, and regulatory agencies; environmental law; immigration law; Native American justice issues; and the interac\u00ad tion among law, culture, and identity. In general, students are intro\u00ad duced to the leading classical and contemporary issues in criminol\u00ad ogy, law and society and to ways of understanding them through interdisciplinary research. The program aims to develop theoretical sophistication and to prepare the graduate student for faculty posi\u00ad tions at major universities; and for research and administrative work in institutions in the legal system, the criminal justice system, and related organizations. In addition to the five core courses required of most Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents, noted earlier, students take at least three required courses, Theories of Crime, (C235), Law and Society, (C239), Legal Rea\u00ad soning, (C237), and four elective courses in Criminology, Law and Society. These elective courses should be chosen in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. Students become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and complete an independent, supervised research project during the second year of graduate study. Methods of research may include questionnaires and surveys, systematic field observation, computer Social Ecology 335 simulation, legal analyses, and archival research. Students com\u00ad plete a written comprehensive examination during year three, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of major theoretical, substantive, and methodological issues in criminology, law and society. The fourth and, possibly, fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and complet\u00ad ing dissertation research. Opportunities for field placements in legal and criminal justice settings also are available. Ph.D. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY Human health and the integrity of the natural environment are interdependent. More now than ever, challenges in public health and the environment must be faced using knowledge both from the social and the natural sciences. The graduate program in Environ\u00ad mental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) is rooted in existing dis\u00ad ciplines, but emphasizes an emerging common base of knowledge that spans both the social and the natural sciences. To optimize flexibility, including options for primary emphasis on laboratory and field work, the curriculum is organized around four concentra\u00ad tions. The concentration in Environmental Biotechnology pro\u00ad vides training in the use of microbial, genetic, or molecular appli\u00ad cations for environmental monitoring, environmental cleanup, and other related purposes. The concentration in Environmental Health Science expands its conventional focus to include ecologi\u00ad cal context. The concentration in Environmental Management and Policy explores the linkages between physical environmental problems and the social institutions that are both their cause and solution. The concentration in Epidemiology and Public Health embeds traditional approaches in these fields within a framework of physical and natural systems. Within each concentration, students are expected to develop inter\u00ad ests in particular substantive problems, for example, those of the core faculty, which include water quality monitoring and bioreme\u00ad diation, toxic metals in the environment (their characterizations, exposure ievels, and health effects), international conflict and cooperation in resource management, habitat restoration and con\u00ad servation biology, the demographic foundation of health and well\u00ad being, and the epidemiology of violence and injury-prevention. Students are prepared to become active researchers, able to assume positions in higher education, government, commerce, or the non\u00ad profit sector-wherever environmental quality is of concern. Prior to graduate program admission, students must elect one of the four EHSP concentrations listed above. For all concentrations, students must complete a core of five required courses: Environ\u00ad mental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analysis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Social Ecology 252). In addition, students must complete six approved electives relating to their respective concentrations. Consistent with the program's multidis\u00ad ciplinary nature, elective courses may be drawn not only from within the Department of Environmental Analysis and Design but (with approval) from throughout the School of Social Ecology and the campus (including, for example, the College of Medicine or the School of Engineering). After the second year, students must sub\u00ad mit a written doctoral research proposal. Advancement to doctoral candidacy is achieved upon successful defense of the proposal dur\u00ad ing an oral, comprehensive qualifying examination. Degree com\u00ad pletion should occur in four or five years. In addition, doctoral stu\u00ad dents must serve a minimum of three quarters as a teaching assistant.

Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Chair of the Department of Cognitive Sciences and Professor of Cognitive Sciences Moira Yip, Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor of Linguistics OVERVIEW Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modem social science. The classic subject areas of anthropology, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are in\u00ad cluded in the School's educational programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the following emphases. First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behav\u00ad ior. Developments in computer science and in mathematics ori\u00ad ented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refine\u00ad ment of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modem social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross ortho\u00ad dox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cognitive anthropology, and psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are built around these interdisciplinary social sci\u00ad ence phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School emphasizes the design of hypotheses and of sys\u00ad tems of interrelated ideas as an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the develop\u00ad ment of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Educational opportunities for students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members or may investigate social science applications via off-campus internships. They are invited to participate in the quar\u00ad terly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School commit\u00ad tees. The School provides a variety of opportunities for faculty-stu\u00ad dent interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory, used for both faculty and student research, occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms and several specialized facilities including a vir\u00ad tual reality facility and infant cognition laboratory. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in chil\u00ad dren and how they learn. Undergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. Three Computer Laboratories provide access to networked IBM\u00ad compatible systems, where students can work on assignments using full-featured word-processing, database, graphics, and statistical packages. In addition, these computers provide students with access to e-mail, Internet services, and the World Wide Web. The new Social Science Plaza facility contains state-of-the-art, high\u00ad tech lecture halls and is fully Internet accessible. The Social Science Academic Resource Center provides personal assistance to all Social Science students on research opportunities, off-campus internships, and graduate and professional programs. The Center also offers counseling on postbaccalaureate programs, provides Internet access and instruction to students, and disseminates information on scholarships, workshops, and other services. A rec\u00ad ommendation coordination service is available to School majors, providing assistance for students applying to graduate and profes\u00ad sional programs. The Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) continues the work of the UCI Focused Research Program on Democratization that was founded in 1991 and sponsors research and training on the process of democratic transition and the expansion of the democratic process in already established democracies. CSD includes a multidisciplinary faculty from four UC campuses. CSD's activities are focused on three areas. First, faculty administer a graduate training program on empirical democratic theory. The National Science Foundation selected UCI in 1995 as a national cen\u00ad ter for the training of doctoral students in democratization issues; the five-year NSF grant provides funding for graduate fellowships and other training activities. Second, the Democracy research program aims at improving the democratic process in the United States and other established democracies as we enter the next century. The program focuses on reforms to increase the ability of citizens to express their preferences and have these preferences represented within the democratic process. Third, CSD supports research on the development of sustainable democracies in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and other new democra\u00ad cies. The New Democracies Initiative contributes to the promotion of democracy in these formerly authoritarian systems.

See the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. HONORS Honors at graduation, i.e., cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, are awarded on the basis of academic performance. Of the graduating seniors, approximately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. To be considered for honors, a student must have a mini\u00ad mum of 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other important factors are considered (see page 50). Social Sciences 345 Undergraduate Program PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with the School of Social Sciences Under\u00ad graduate Counseling Office to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the School majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applic\u00ad able in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the stu\u00ad dent might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, major and school requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathe\u00ad matics, computer technology, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who wishes to major in Psychology and Anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science lA, lP, or 21, or Social Science 3A, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper\u00ad division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Mathematics and Social Sciences The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocab\u00ad ulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an under\u00ad standing of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, how\u00ad ever, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should con\u00ad sult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 346 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Sciences REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements A. Familiarity with basic mathematical, computational, and statis\u00ad tical tools underlying modern social sciences. This requirement is met by passing a three-course sequence in mathematics (Anthropology lOA-B-C, Economics lOA-B-C, Mathematics 2A-B-C, Psychology lOA-B-C, Social Science lOA-B-C, Social Science 100A-B-C, or Sociology 10A-B-C). (NOTE: School of Social Sciences majors may not take Social Science 9A-B-C to fulfill the mathematics requirement.) Computer education is essential for a complete social science education. This require\u00ad ment can be satisfied by passing Information and Computer Science 1A, 1P, or 21, or Social Science 3A. Departments may have preferences for specific courses. See your major depart\u00ad ment for acceptable courses. This course requirement should be taken during the student's first year. B. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and methods of social science. This requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing two introductory courses in the School of Social Sciences bearing a one-digit course number. These courses normally should be taken during the student's first year. C. An understanding of important advanced areas in social sci\u00ad ence. This requirement is met by passing satisfactorily nine upper-division courses in the School of Social Sciences, where at least three of these courses comprise core courses or a mod\u00ad ule. For modules which are listed with more than three courses, the student may normally elect to take any subset of three courses in the module. Appropriate substitutions may be made upon petition. D. Four additional social science courses from any level. Students are reminded that the Pass/Not Pass option is not applic\u00ad able to course requirements A through D above or to any addi\u00ad tional requirements listed for specific major programs. However, Information and Computer Science 1A, 1P, 21, and Social Science lOOA are exceptions to this rule and may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Courses used to meet requirements B through D above are included in the computation of the grade point average in courses required in the major program. TRANSFER STUDENTS Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Following review by the School of Social Sciences, it may be determined that junior transfer students electing to major in one of the School's degree programs, who have good records at other accredited colleges and universities, have satisfied School requirement B and the University requirements. However, all trans\u00ad fer students must fulfill the upper-division writing breadth require\u00ad ment (category I) while at UCI. Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year should plan their curriculum so as to antici\u00ad pate the special mathematics requirement (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN K-12 EDUCATION Undergraduate students who wish to pursue a career in the field of K-12 education are well-served in the School of Social Sciences and the Department of Education. The following interrelated pro\u00ad grams provide opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in this important area. Minor in Educational Studies The minor in Educational Studies allows students to explore a broad range of issues in the field of education and provides a strong foundation for K-12 teaching. Both introductory and advanced courses are included, giving students a solid preparation for later teacher credential programs and many related occupations. NOTE: A Statement of Intent is required of all students wishing to enroll in this minor. See the Department of Education section of the Catalogue for more information. Multiple Subject and Single Subject (Social Science) Preparation Course work in the Social Science major (Social Studies special\u00ad ization) provides excellent preparation for students wishing to obtain a multiple subject teaching credential. Students who take additional course work can satisfy the subject matter requirement for a single subject teaching credential in social science. See page 380 for specific requirements. NOTE: Official enrollment in the single subject program is required to satisfy this requirement. The Counseling Office in 347 Social Science Tower can provide details. Department of Education Programs The Department of Education provides many other opportunities for prospective educators, including: a mentoring program which provides students with valuable experience while they work with credentialed teachers; UC Links, a program in which undergradu\u00ad ates tutor K-8 students in after-school settings; and advising ser\u00ad vices provided by counselors who assist students in planning future careers in education. Further information about these programs is available from the Department of Education counselors at 2001 Berkeley Place. Students interested in obtaining a teaching credential should see the Department of Education section of the Catalogue for information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for additional information. Campuswide Honors Program The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World Wide UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. Additional information is avail\u00ad able in the Center for International Education section. Interdisciplinary Minors A variety of interdisciplinary minors are available to all UCI stu\u00ad dents. See the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue for complete information. The minor in African-American Studies offers undergraduate students an opportunity to study those societies and cultures estab\u00ad lished by the people of the African diaspora and to investigate the African-American experience from a variety of disciplinary per\u00ad spectives and theoretical approaches. The minor in Asian American Studies examines the historical and contemporary experiences of Asians after their arrival in the United States and seeks to provide an awareness of the history, culture (e.g., literary and creative art accomplishments), psychol\u00ad ogy, and social organization of Asian American communities. The minor in Chicano!Latino Studies is designed to provide an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of the language, history, culture, literature, sociology, anthropology, politics, social ecology, health, medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments in the Chicano/ Latino communities. The minor in Conflict Resolution provides skills in conflict analy\u00ad sis and resolution and a useful understanding of integrative institu\u00ad tions at the local, regional, and international levels. The minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science explores how science is actually done and how it has influenced history, and is concerned with determining what science and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. The minor in Latin American Studies is designed to develop in students an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of Latin Ameri\u00ad can issues in the areas of language, history, culture, literary studies, sociology, anthropology, political science, health, folk medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments. The minor in Native American Studies focuses on history, culture, religion, and the environment. The three core courses serve as an introduction to the Native American experience from the perspective of different historical periods and frameworks of analysis. The minor in Religious Studies focuses on the comparative study of religions in various cultural settings around the world and seeks to provide a wide-ranging academic understanding and knowledge of the religious experience in society. The minor in Women's Studies offers a curriculum drawing from the humanities, social sciences, and the arts to examine contributions of women from different backgrounds to culture and society and to explore women's and men's lives in the context of changing gender relations. CAREERS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES Business and industry often look to social science graduates to fill positions in management, finance, marketing and advertising, per\u00ad sonnel, production supervision, and general administration. In the public sector, a wide variety of opportunities are available in city, county, state, and federal government. Teaching is a frequently Social Sciences 347 chosen career at all levels from elementary school teacher to pro\u00ad fessor. In addition, many graduates enter professional practice, becoming lawyers, psychologists, researchers, or consultants in various fields. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational pro\u00ad gram that is interdisciplinary and that prepares students to under\u00ad stand quantitative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well-positioned for research and analysis careers at all levels of government and in private firms. Their solid grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them an excel\u00ad lent foundation for the pursuit of further training in graduate and professional programs. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional information is available in the Career Center section. Graduate Program The School of Social Sciences offers graduate training in the fol\u00ad lowing areas: Anthropology, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Cognitive Sciences, leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology; Econom\u00ad ics, leading to the Ph.D. in Economics; Linguistics, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, lead\u00ad ing to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Politics and Society, leading to the Ph.D. in Political Science; and Sociology and Social Relations, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. In addition, an interdiscipli\u00ad nary concentration in Public Choice is offered within the programs in Economics and Political Science, a specialized concentration in Transportation Economics is offered within the program in Eco\u00ad nomics, an emphasis in Social Networks is offered within the Mathematical Behavioral Sciences concentration, and a concentra\u00ad tion in Political Psychology is offered within the program in Politi\u00ad cal Science. When an applicant's interests lie outside of or across these areas, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, may, on rare occasions, appoint a three-member faculty committee to guide an independent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. The M.A. degree in Economics or Social Science may be conferred upon students in Ph.D. programs after completion of the necessary requirements. Additionally, a program leading to the M.A. degree in Social Sci\u00ad ence with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis is supervised by faculty from the Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecology. Students may apply dire~tly to this M.A. program. A graduate program leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Transportation Science is supervised by an interdepartmental fac\u00ad ulty group. Information is available in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. ADMISSION Potential graduate students should apply by January 15 to receive fullest consideration for financial aid. Applicants should indicate the title of the degree sought (Economics, Political Science, Psy\u00ad chology, or Social Science), and the academic area of concentra\u00ad tion (see above). All applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Examination General Test scores. Letters of recommenda\u00ad tion and the applicant's statement of interest are important factors in the admission decision. In addition to the University admission requirements described in the Research and Graduate Studies section, individual graduate programs may prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Such UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 348 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Sciences requirements are minimum standards only; successful applicants typically must exceed them by a substantial margin. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Many students receive financial support in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Before accepting an offer of admission with financial support for the first year, applicants should inquire about the likelihood of such support in future years. Occasionally, a newly admitted student may receive a multiyear commitment of some specified financial support, but this is not the rule. Students are also advised to seek aid from sources external to the Univer\u00ad sity. (NOTE: Teaching assistantships do not include remission of fees or nonresident tuition.) LENGTH OF STUDY AND RESIDENCE Students who enter with normal academic preparation should be able to earn the Ph.D. within five to seven years. Students admitted to the M.A. concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis should be able to earn the M.A. within one to two years. Because the intellectual training offered by the School requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 4229 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-7602 Leo R. Chavez, Department Chair Anthropology is the comparative study of past and contemporary human societies and cultures. The Department of Anthropology emphasizes contemporary theory in social and cultural anthropol\u00ad ogy, the anthropological tradition of field research, and formal methods for collecting and analyzing anthropological data. The Department has a strong interdisciplinary bent, with research and teaching interests in psychological anthropology, economic anthro\u00ad pology, social history and social change, culture and health, and social structure. Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 346. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 10 courses (40 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Three courses (12 units), no more than one course from any of the following topical areas in anthropology: (1) Kinship and Social Structure (Anthropology 121A, 121B, 121D, 1210, 121H, 1360, 136K, 136M) D. Two courses (eight units) on a geographical area, selected from courses in the Area Studies module (Anthropology 160-169). E. Three additional anthropology courses (12 units) selected from those numbered Anthropology 40-180 or Social Science 70C. Students are strongly encouraged to take Anthropology 71A early in their studies and Anthropology 180A after they have had at least three courses beyond Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C, or 2D. The faculty encourages Anthropology majors or minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Inter\u00ad national Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities. For example, EAP offers excellent opportunities to study anthropology at many univer\u00ad sities abroad and courses taken for departmental requirement C, D, and E would be excellent choices to take. Study abroad also can pro\u00ad vide opportunities for cross-cultural experience, field research, and foreign language training. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue for additional information. Honors Program in Anthropology The Honors Program in Anthropology is designed to allow under\u00ad graduates.to pursue field research and write an honors thesis on topics of their choice under the guidance of Department of Anthro\u00ad pology faculty members. Research projects typically involve a combination of library research, exploratory ethnographic inter\u00ad views, participant observation, and systematic data collection and analysis. The program is open to all senior Anthropology majors with a grade point average of 3.3 or better overall, with 3.5 in Anthropology courses (at least five courses). Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program and the honors thesis satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Although course work for the Honors Program does not start until the senior year, it is highly recommended that during the spring quarter of the junior year, students find a professor willing to serve as their research project advisor on the basis of a mutually acceptable abstract that indicates the goal and significance of their project. If extensive research is to be undertaken at this time, stu\u00ad dents enroll in Anthropology 199. During the fall quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Anthro\u00ad pology H190A and write a proposal describing their research ques\u00ad tion, the relevant background literature, and the method of data collection and analysis. Field work for the project may begin dur\u00ad ing this quarter. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students begin or continue enthnographic field research by enrolling in Anthropology H190B. Field research typically combines exploratory field research with fixed format data collection methods. ~n the spring of the senior year, students enroll in Anthropology H191 and complete a senior honor thesis that is typically 40 to 80 pages long. Honor theses are read and evaluated by the advisor and a second faculty member chosen by the chair of the undergraduate committee in consultation with the advisor. Anthropology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Anthropology are met by taking eight anthropology courses (32 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Three courses (12 units), no more than one from any of the fol\u00ad lowing topical areas in anthropology: (1) Kinship (Anthropology 121A, 121B, 121D, 1210, 121H, 136B) UC I25S, 132B, 134A, 134D, 134E) 136G, 136K, 136M) D. One course (four units) on a geographical area, selected from courses in the Area Studies module (Anthropology 160-169). E.

Joseph G. Jorgensen: Mathematical comparative ethnology; Native American language and culture; explanations, theory, and method in social inquiry Arthur J. Rubel: Medical anthropology, peasants The Department of Anthropology offers a program of study leading to a Ph.D. in Social Science with a concentration in Anthropology. The program focuses on social and cultural anthropology, with emphases in political economy and economic anthropology, cogni\u00ad tive anthropology, ethnography, and medical anthropology, and has multiple faculty interested in ethnicity, gender, historical anthro\u00ad pology, international migration, and social networks. The program also provides rigorous methodological training, with special strengths in quantitative and formal analysis and in the methodology Anthropology 349 of ethnographic fieldwork. The Department is committed to exploring new and innovative approaches to culture and society in a pluralistic and intellectually open academic environment. Program faculty take diverse theoretical and methodological approaches to a variety of substantive issues. They are united, however, in a will\u00ad ingness to question taken-for-granted theoretical premises and ana\u00ad lytic frames, and to engage in good-faith intellectual dialogue about alternative models and approaches. ADMISSION Students are admitted to the concentration based on their applica\u00ad tion materials and evidence of scholarly potential, including grade point average, GRE scores, and letters of recommendation. REQUIREMENTS Students must complete a one-year Proseminar in Anthropology during their first year and one course in Anthropological Fieldwork during their second year. In addition, students are required to com\u00ad plete two quarters of Statistics, one course in Research Design, and six elective courses in Anthropology, which are selected in consul\u00ad tation with their advisor and which normally cover a coherent area of specialization within the field. All course work must be com\u00ad pleted before a student is advanced to candidacy. Students must demonstrate competence to read one foreign language, in accor\u00ad dance with the requirements of the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. At the end of the first year, students must pass a formal evaluation which is made by the Department of the basis of (1) the first-year course work and (2) examinations to be taken as part of the Pros\u00ad eminar. Students should advance to candidacy by the end of the third year; the advancement to candidacy examination is based on a research proposal, a review of relevant literature, and an anno\u00ad tated bibliography. The fourth (and, in many cases, some or all of the fifth) year is normally devoted to extended anthropological fieldwork. The sixth year (in some cases, also part of the fifth) is devoted to writing the dissertation, in close consultation with the advisor. Feminist Studies Emphasis A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Social Networks Track A track in Social Networks within Anthropology may be completed by taking any three Social Networks seminars. This includes the core Network seminars Social Science 241A (Interaction Models), 241B (Network Theories of Social Structure), and 241C (Analysis of Relational Data), as well as other courses listed in the Social Networks section of the Catalogue. Those seminars taught by members of the Anthropology Department count as Anthropology electives, and other seminars as outside electives.

Yellott, Department Chair The Department of Cognitive Sciences is committed to the investi\u00ad gation of the abstract, complex structures that underlie human cog\u00ad nition: language, thought, memory, learning, and perception. The main areas of research strength within the Department are visual and auditory perception, experimental psychology, and mathemati\u00ad cal psychology. Undergraduate Program Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in general psychology including the areas of development, clinical, perception, learning, memory, and cognitive processes are advised to consult the course listings here in the Department of Cognitive Sciences section. These courses are designed to provide students with a strong foundation in general psychology. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course list\u00ad ings in the School of Social Ecology section. In anticipation that the number of students who are qualified to elect Psychology as a major will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fall 2000 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 1999. Continuing-Student Applicants: Students who were not admitted to the Psychology major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major during the first five weeks of any quarter after their freshman year. Applications must be filed in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office. To be considered for admission into the Psychology major, stu\u00ad dents must have completed the following: (a) the lower-division writing requirement and (b) the requirements of two additional campus breadth categories. Students applying to the major should have an overall grade point average of at least 2.7. NOTE: Accep\u00ad tance into the major is not guaranteed. In the event that more appli\u00ad cations are received than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond these minimum criteria. Excellence.in Psychological Research: Psychology majors doing independent research under Psychology 199 may be eligible for participation in the Excellence in Psychological Research program. Participants have the opportunity to have their research papers published in a peer-reviewed student journal. Guidelines for1the program are available from the Department of Cognitive Sciences office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59.

C. A one-quarter course and laboratory in experimental psychol\u00ad ogy or research methods selected from 112A and 112LA, 112D and 112LD, or 115A and 115LA. D. Four upper-division psychology core courses are required (16 units). These courses are designated with the ending number \"0\" and cannot be used to satisfy core course requirements. E. Seven additional courses (four or more units each) with empha\u00ad sis in psychology, distributed as follows: (l)No more than one of the seven may be lower-division. Psy\u00ad chology 7 A may not be used to fulfill this requirement. (2) Three of the upper-division courses used to satisfy require\u00ad ments D and E must be taken from one of the following , modules: Psychology 110-119 (Research Methodologies), 120-129 (General Psychology), 130-139 (Perception and Sensory Processes), 140-149 and 150-159 (Learning and Cognition and Semiotics and Language combined), and 170-179 (Interdisciplinary Studies). (3) Certain courses offered in the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Social Ecology may be used in partial sat\u00ad isfaction of this requirement. Such courses must be chosen from the approved list of psychology-related courses in these disciplines. NOTE: Psychology majors are strongly encouraged to take Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences lA-B and 35 in satisfaction of the natural sciences portion of the breadth requirement (Category II). Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that students who intend to pursue postbac\u00ad calaureate work in psychology take the sequence Psychology ll2A-B-C or 115A-B. Most psychology graduate programs require statistics (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Social Science lOA-B-C, Psychology lOA-B-C, or Social Science lOOA-B-C), but some require calculus (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Mathematics 2A-B-C). Honors Program in Psychology The two-year honors program in Psychology is open to selected juniors who are majoring in Psychology. It provides thorough grounding in research methods and culminates with the opportunity for basic research in some area of psychology under faculty super\u00ad vision. The program has a limited number of openings and seeks to attract outstanding students who plan to undertake postgraduate education in some field of the psychological sciences. Admission to the program is based on a formal application that is normally sub\u00ad mitted in the spring quarter of the sophomore year. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychology courses, although this requirement may be waived in unusual cases. - During the junior year, students who participate in the program are expected to enroll in Honors Experimental Psychology (H111A-B\u00ad C), and in the fall quarter of the Honors Seminar in Psychology (HI OlA). As seniors, following successful completion of these junior-year requirements, Psychology honors students are enrolled in the Honors Seminar in Psychology (HlOlB-C) in the fall and spring quarters. Participants in the honors program are expected to complete course work beyond the breadth requirement in one or more of the following areas: biological sciences, mathematics, computer science, physical science, linguistics, philosophy. The honors seminar may be used to satisfy two of the courses required by Part E of the Psychology major requirements. To graduate with Honors in Psychology, a student must successfully complete the requirements for the B.A. degree in Psychology with an overall grade point average of 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in Psychology courses. In addition, Honors students must success\u00ad fully complete a senior honors thesis as part of the senior-year course work. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Psychology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Psychology are met by taking seven psychology courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Psychology 7 A. B. Three upper-division psychology courses chosen from the fol\u00ad additional psychology courses (four or more units each) no more than one of which is a lower-division course. D. In addition, the School mathematics and computer science requirement (School requirement A) must be satisfied.

Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical psychology and visual perception The Department of Cognitive Sciences offers an integrated course of study leading to a Ph.D. in Psychology, with a specialization in cognitive science, to prepare students for research and teaching careers in academia, industry, and government. The emphasis is on modem techniques of experimentation and theory construction. Special attention is given to providing hands-on research experi\u00ad ence and equipping students with sophisticated mathematical and computing skills. The Department has 22 faculty; two are members of the National Academy of Sciences, and many serve as editors or editorial board members of leading professional journals, and as members of NSF and NIH study panels. Many Cognitive Sciences faculty are also members of UCI's Institute of Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, and the Department is generally regarded as one of the world's leading centers for mathematically oriented research in cognitive psychology. One sign of this is the fact that six of its members serve on the Board of Editors of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. Cognitive Sciences 355 ADMISSION In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. (That background is required for completing the program's research methods courses.) Advanced courses in some of the following fields are considered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Standard requirements for admission include Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores for tests taken within the past five years, official transcripts of all college course work, and three letters of recommendation. Applicants from non-English speaking countries must also take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and achieve a score of 550 or higher; and if applying for a teaching assistantship, the Test of Spoken Eng\u00ad lish (TSE) must also be taken and a score of 50 or more achieved. To receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards, applications must be received by January 15. Late applications may be considered until July 1 on a space-available basis. Since the pro\u00ad gram starts in the fall quarter, students are not normally admitted in the winter or spring, though exceptions may be made. Application materials may be obtained by contacting the Social Sciences Gradu\u00ad ate Office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences in the first year. One is a three-quarter research methods sequence covering the areas of probability, statistics, and experimental design (Psychology 203A-B-C). The other is a proseminar sequence cover\u00ad ing areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics (Psychology 202A-B-C). Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the Department's Director of Graduate Studies. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the stu\u00ad dent's interests will supplement the required courses. Students are expected to enroll in the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar (Psychology 201A-B-C) during all quarters in residence prior to passage of the advancement-to-candidacy examination. In addition, students must take at least six more courses prior to advancement to candidacy. These courses are normally taken from at least three of the following six modules: Foundations (Psychol\u00ad ogy 200-209); Human Cognition (Psychology (Psy\u00ad chology 240-249); Human Performance (Psychology 250-269); and Sensation and Perception (Psychology 270-289). Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each stu\u00ad dent should have completed a research project of a scope and nature that is potentially publishable in a professional journal. Every student is assigned a faculty advisor, and the advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are required to write a paper based on their research project and to present a talk to the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. (Another forum for the second\u00ad year talk may be substituted with the written approval of the Grad\u00ad uate Director.) At the end of each academic year the faculty of the Department meet to discuss and provide feedback on the progress of each stu\u00ad dent in the program. Formal permission to begin a Ph.D. dissertation research project (a step known as \"advancement to candidacy\") is contingent on pas\u00ad sage of an examination, normally taken at the end of the third year or the beginning of the fourth year in the program. The advance\u00ad ment-to-candidacy examination is based on a written dissertation UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 356 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Sciences proposal prepared by the student, and consists of an oral examina\u00ad tion and, at the faculty's option, a written examination as well. Each student is required either (1) to establish proficiency in read\u00ad ing social science technical material in one appropriate foreign lan\u00ad guage or (2) to demonstrate proficiency in computer programming considerably beyond that of the standard computer skills require\u00ad ment. Because of the constantly changing nature of computer lan\u00ad guages and other software, the conditions for fulfilling this com\u00ad puter expertise requirement will be left to the judgment of the Department's subcommittee on computers. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the stu\u00ad dent is expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium.

DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS 3223 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-5788 Linda Cohen, Department Chair Economics is concerned with the way individuals or societies allo\u00ad cate scarce resources and distribute goods and services. Any situa\u00ad tion requiring choice among competing alternatives can be viewed as an economic problem. Economics courses enable students to study the way individuals make these choices (microeconomics), the way governments make these choices (public choice), and the aggregate consequences of these choices (macroeconomics). In addition, the economics curriculum addresses international trade, money and banking, and economic development of the less devel\u00ad oped nations. The Department of Economics is composed of faculty with inter\u00ad ests in a broad range of areas within micro-and macroeconomics, and the evaluation of public policy. It is especially strong in applied econometrics, public choice, and applied microeconomics including transportation, energy, industrial organization, labor, and urban development. Members of the Department maintain close ties with members of the Department of Politics and Society and the Graduate School of Management. Undergraduate Program In anticipation that the number of students who want to major in Economics will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fall 2000 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 1999. In the event the major in Economics receives more qualified appli\u00ad cants than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions requirements. Freshman applicants not selected for Economics at the time of admission will be encouraged to opt for the Undeclared major within the School of Social Sciences or for any other open major for which they qualify. However, lower-division courses pre\u00ad requisite to upper-division major study are available to all students, and selection to the Economics major at the end of the sophomore year will be based on performance in those courses. Continuing-Student Applicants. Sophomore students who were not admitted to the Economics major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major. Such students should apply in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office. The following three criteria must be met to be considered for admission as a junior: the student must have (a) completed two quarters of calculus (Mathematics 2A-B) with a minimum average grade of B, (b) completed the Basic Economics sequence (Eco\u00ad nomics 20A-B-C) with a minimum grade of a Bin at least two of the three quarters, and (c) completed the lower-division writing requirement. Transfer-Student Applicants: For transfer-student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequi\u00ad sites. All applicants must complete the following required courses: one year of microeconomics and macroeconomics with a minimum average grade of B, and one semester or two quarter courses of approved calculus with a minimum average grade of B. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 346. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Economics 20A-B-C; this course sequence is a prerequisite for almost all upper-division economics courses. B. All majors must demonstrate competence in probability and statistics prior to enrolling in any upper-division economics course, or they must be concurrently enrolled in an approved probability and statistics course. Students may satisfy this requirement by completing Economics 10A-B-C or an equiva\u00ad lent course. C. All majors must demonstrate competence in calculus by com\u00ad pleting Mathematics 2A-B or equivalent courses. Students must complete at least Mathematics 2A or an equivalent course prior to enrolling in Economics 100A, and both Mathematics 2A and 2B or equivalent courses prior to enrolling in Economics lOOB. D. Economics lOOA-B-C. E. Four additional four-unit upper-division economics courses. At least one of the four courses must be research-oriented and involve the production of a significant research paper. This required paper may be approved by any faculty member in eco\u00ad nomics. It is strongly recommended that students take either the data analysis sequence (Economics 121A-B-C) or the econo\u00ad metrics sequence (Economics 123A-B-C). Honors Program in Economics The Honors Program in Economics provides outstanding students an in-depth study of economic theory and an opportunity to work more closely with faculty members in smaller honors-designated courses. In their senior year, students complete an honors thesis devoted to the collection and rigorous analysis of data, demonstrat\u00ad ing their achievement of an advanced level of research and analyti\u00ad cal skills. The program is open to selected students who are major\u00ad ing in Economics and admission is based on a formal application that is normally submitted in the spring quarter after students have completed two quarters of calculus and Economics 20A-B. Appli\u00ad cants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.0 and a grade point average of at least 3.0 in Economics and calculus classes. Prospective honors students are encouraged to enroll in the honors section of Economics 10C prior to starting their upper-divi\u00ad sion course work. In the first year of the program, students enroll in Honors Intermediate Economics I, II, III (Economics HlOOA-B\u00ad C), and in the second year, Econometrics I, II, III (Economics 123A-B-C). The honors thesis is usually completed while taking Economics 123C. Upon successful completion of an approved the\u00ad sis, students graduate with Honors in: Economics and their tran\u00ad script notes that they have completed the Honors Program in Eco\u00ad nomics. Successful completion of the thesis also satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. To graduate with Honors in Economics, School requirements must be met and must include 20 courses (80 units) as specified below: A. Economics 20A-B-C. B. Mathematics 2A-B-C must be completed prior to taking Eco- nomics H 1 OOA. C. Mathematics 3A or an equivalent course. D. Economics 10A-B-C or equivalent courses. E. Economics H100A-B-C. F. Economics 123A-B-C or equivalent. Economics 361 G. An honors thesis. H. A minimum of four additional upper-division Economics courses. I. Achievement of a grade point average of at least 3.0 in upper\u00ad division economics courses taken to fulfill requirements.

Uhlaner: Comparative political participation, formal models of polit\u00ad ical behavior The Department of Economics\u00b7 offers a program of study leading to the Ph.D. in Economics. Drawing upon the School's strong quantita\u00ad tive tradition, it specializes in public choice, transportation econom\u00ad ics, urban economics, econometrics, and applied microeconomics. Admission is highly selective and is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requiring a high degree of overlap between faculty and student research interests, the program offers extensive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Motivated and well-qualified students find the graduate program highly attractive because of its small size and its great flexibility. Self-discipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000362 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Sciences ADMISSION The deadline for application for admission is January 15 for fall quarter. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Late applications are considered on a space-available basis. All applicants must take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prior to the application deadline. Foreign applicants must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. REQUIREMENTS All students must show competence in microeconomics, macroeco\u00ad nomics, and econometrics. Normally this is done by taking a three\u00ad course sequence in each of these areas. Students also must master two fields of applied economics by taking a two-course sequence (possibly including independent reading courses) and writing a research paper in each field. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Economics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by discussion of the papers presented and additional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of current eco\u00ad nomic research early in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. Knowledge of one foreign language is required; a computer language may be substi\u00ad tuted at the discretion of the faculty. After meeting the above requirements, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon com\u00ad pletion of an oral examination on a written dissertation proposal. Concentration in Transportation Economics Students can also be awarded a Ph.D. in Economics with a concen\u00ad tration in Transportation Economics. This option draws upon the transportation researchers on the campus within the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the School of Social Ecology. Students benefit from association with the Institute of Transportation Studies, which facilitates student research by providing reseArch assistantships and interdisciplinary seminars on all modes of transportation. Requirements for the concentration are the same as those described above with the following three exceptions: (1) instead of the third quarter of microeconomics and macroeconomics, students may substitute specified courses such as Discrete Choice Econometrics (Economics 223A), Advanced Travel Demand Analysis (Engineer\u00ad ing CE220A), or Operations Research for Management (Manage\u00ad ment 201B); (2) one of the student's two required fields of compe\u00ad tence must be transportation economics; the other must be a related field such as urban economics, labor economics, industrial organi\u00ad zation, or a transportation-related field from outside economics (such as travel demand and flow theory, urban and transportation policy analysis, environmental impacts of transportation, or urban and transportation planning) subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies for Economics; and (3) students must take at least one additional course from a list of designated courses in transportation and related subject areas. Concentration in Public Choice Students can also earn a Ph.D. degree in Economics with a concen\u00ad tration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of Economics and Political Science, which draws on quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Faculty from the Departments of Economics, Political Science, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Management are involved in research that supports the concentration. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the nor\u00ad mal procedures for the program in Economics and must fulfill all the requirements for the Economics degree with the following modifications: (1) one of the student's two required fields of com\u00ad petence must be public choice; included is a three-quarter core course in public choice, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Departments of Economics and Political Science. (A background in economic theory equivalent to Economics HlOOA-B-C, Honors Intermediate Economic Theory, is a prerequisite to this sequence.) The requirement for competence in a second field may be met with a one-quarter course, instead of two, if it provides sufficient fluency in the field; and (2) students must obtain a background knowledge in political science equivalent to that provided by a one-year undergraduate survey course, if they do not already have it. RESEARCH FACILITIES UCI is a major research university with an excellent library, as well as special interlibrary loan arrangements with other University of California libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a com\u00ad puter laboratory. The Economics Department has a small library with current journals and unpublished working papers from other universities. Students also have access to several campus comput\u00ad ers including a Convex C240 mini-super computer. Three Orga\u00ad nized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, provide research opportunities for graduate students: Courses in Economics NOTE: Students are reminded that each quarter of a sequential course (i.e., Economics 20A-B-C, lOOA-B-C) must be taken in order. LOWER-DIVISION 1 Introduction to Economics (4) F, W, S. An analysis of the problems soci\u00ad ety faces in organizing itself to provide goods and services.

(Students are strongly encouraged to go beyond these minimal requirements with additional work in language, literature and culture courses taught in the language.) HONORS PROGRAM IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES The Honors Program allows International Studies majors to engage in research leading to the completion of an honors thesis. The topic for the honors thesis is selected by the student, in consultation with a faculty advisor, and should reflect a theme consistent with the student's module in the International Studies major. The Honors Program is open to all junior and senior International Studies majors with an overall GPA of 3.0 and a 3.5 GPA in the major. Suc;cessful completion of a written honors thesis in the Social Sci\u00ad ence H158C course satisfies the upper-division writing breadth requirement. During the spring quarter of the junior year or during the summer before the senior year, students formally apply to the Honors Pro\u00ad gram. Students will be notified of their selection to the Honors Program by September 1. In the fall quarter of the senior year, stu\u00ad dents enroll in Social Science H158A, Honors Research Seminar. In this course, each student formulates a written research plan (i.e., prospectus) for the honors thesis. Students also select a faculty member who agrees to supervise the research, evaluate the written work, and approve the honors thesis. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Social Science H158B, Honors Thesis Research, with their faculty advisor. The faculty advisor supervises and evaluates data collection and analysis and reads and edits chapter drafts. In the spring quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Social Science H158C, Honors Thesis, with their faculty advisor. The thesis is to be completed by the student and approved by the advisor prior to the end of the quarter. Honors students must also demonstrate a high level of language proficiency by completing two courses beyond the 2A level in lan\u00ad guage, literature, or culture taught in their chosen international lan\u00ad guage. A list of acceptable courses is available from faculty advi\u00ad sors and the counseling office. Students are also strongly encouraged to complete at least two quarters of study, work, or internship abroad in a geographic region where their chosen language is spoken. Linguistics 367 DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS 5221 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-7504 C.-T. James Huang, Department Chair Language is one of the most fundamental human instincts. It is an extraordinarily intricate system that all of us master as young chil\u00ad dren without special teaching, and that gives us the ability to com\u00ad municate, tell stories, and express our deepest feelings. Linguistics is the scientific study of this human language. It is concerned with understanding the nature of language and our knowledge of it, how we acquire it, and how that knowledge is put to use. It is connected to many other fields of study, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, philos\u00ad ophy, and literature. Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 346. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 14-15 courses (56-63 units) as specified below: A. Six core courses: Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 100, 111, and 121. B. Six linguistics courses, at least four of which must be upper\u00ad division. One of these four upper-division courses must be 112, 122, or 143. C. Natural/Formal language requirement. One of the following three groups of courses: ( 1) Three courses in a single language other than English, or equivalent. Courses taken to satisfy breadth requirement cat\u00ad egory VI do not qualify. (2) Two linguistics courses on the structure of foreign languages (e.g., Linguistics 165A, 165B, 165C, 166A, and as the topics might apply, 160 and 164A). (3)Two courses in logic (from the Philosophy series 30A-B or 105A-B-C) or computation (from the Information and Com\u00ad puter Science series 21-22). Residence Requirement for the Linguistics Major: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Honors Program in Linguistics The Honors Program in Linguistics is designed for selected junior and senior Linguistics majors who have shown interest in moving beyond the material covered in the regular undergraduate program and demonstrated their readiness for more advanced work than is usually expected at the undergraduate level. Ari overall grade point average of 3.0 with 3.5 in Linguistics courses is required. Participating students design their program in consultation with the faculty and complete a specified set of courses, culminating in the production and oral defense of a senior thesis. Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Four one-quarter courses are required, including Linguistics H195 (Honors Research Workshop) and H190 (Senior Thesis). Students also select one or two courses from Linguistics 114, 119, 124, 129, 139, 149, 159, and H192. Students also may choose to take either Linguistics 198 or 199. Each of these courses will normally require a term paper, and satisfactory completion of these papers with a grade of A-or better is required for Honors students. These term papers usually are closely connected to the senior thesis topic and contribute to its final form. Two of the courses taken toward UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 368 UCI 1999-2000 School of Social Sciences fulfilling the Honors Program requirements will also count toward the requirements for the major in Linguistics. Linguistics Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Linguistics are met by taking seven linguistics courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Linguistics 3, 10, and 20. B. Four additional linguistics courses, three of which must be upper-division. Residence Requirement: At least three upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI.

Watt: Cognitive semiotics The doctoral concentration in Linguistics, administered by a group of faculty specializing in the field, is focused on theoretical lin\u00ad guistics and its role in the cognitive sciences. The research empha\u00ad sis is directed toward the core areas of theoretical work in syntax, semantics, phonology, and psycholinguistics with a concentration on the formal analysis of natural language. Additional emphasis is on the study of a broad range of languages and language families, including East Asian and Romance. Students are further expected to gain expertise in other areas of the cognitive sciences, especially as this pertains to the study of language. The program leads to a Ph.D. in Social Science with a concentra\u00ad tion in Linguistics. ADMISSION While at least some undergraduate training in theoretical linguis\u00ad tics is desirable, applications are also welcomed from students with backgrounds in other areas, e.g., philosophy, psychology, language studies, computer science. Decisions on admissions are based on students' undergraduate performance, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, and any written research materials submitted by the candidate. Applicants must submit Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (GRE) scores; applicants from non-English speaking nations must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. REQUIREMENTS Course requirements consist of eight core courses (Phonology I, II, III; Syntax I, II, III; and Semantics I, II), four additional Linguistics courses, a proseminar in Cognitive Sciences or an appropriate sub\u00ad stitute, research seminars, and a research workshop. The minor area requirement can be met with two courses in a single minor area (e.g., cognitive sciences, computational linguistics, philosophy) ora critical literature survey in a non-core area of language research. For the qualifying examination, students must write two papers of publishable quality in different core areas (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, psycholinguistics). A dissertation proposal is required for the advancement to candidacy examination. Students are required to demonstrate mastery of a foreign language on the basis of a written examination. The quantitative methods requirement is fulfilled by a course on symbolic logic or formal language theory. Students are expected to defend the dissertation and to give a pub\u00ad lic presentation of their doctoral research. Courses in Linguistics LOWER DIVISION 1 Languages of the World (4).

Petracca, Department Chair Undergraduate Program The Department of Political Science offers a wide variety of courses at the introductory, lower-division, and more specialized upper-division levels. Courses in both micropolitics (individual and group politics) and macropolitics (politics at the state and interna\u00ad tional levels) are offered. The curriculum is organized into five areas: American politics and society, political theory, international relations, comparative politics, and public law. The Department also offers an Honors Program in Political Science for juniors and seniors, culminating in a senior honors thesis. The Department is composed of a strong and diverse faculty espe\u00ad cially interested in analyzing central questions of political science related to such topics as policy-making, political structures, partici\u00ad pation, conflict, change and development, power and authority, and interstate relations. The faculty has particular strength in interdisci\u00ad plinary approaches, in comparative analysis, and in the application of quantitative data to political science issues. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 346. Departmental Requirements for the Major in Political Science School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) as specified below: A.

The graduate program emphasizes empirical democratic theory, with an emphasis on the United States and other industrialized and industrializing nations, within a comparative context. Faculty interests include political behavior, political psychology, public choice theory, political econ\u00ad omy, international relations, systems theory, mass media, and authority relations. Institutions of interest include the executive branch, bureaucratic politics, political parties, and representation and electoral systems. The strengths of the Political Science gradu\u00ad ate program include its small size, its personalized attention to stu\u00ad dents, and its location within an interdisciplinary school. Three Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences, offer opportunities for participation in ongoing faculty research. One group of Political Science faculty share interests in applied Public Choice with faculty members in both Economics and Philosophy; another group is involved with the program in Global Peace and Conflict Studies; and others are involved in the Center for the Study of Democracy. ADMISSIONS The deadline for application for fall quarter admission is January 15. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Additional information is available in the general section on admission to Social Science graduate pro\u00ad grams. Please note especially the required examinations. REQUIREMENTS First-year students must take a core program of graduate seminars, focusing on major substantive areas as well as research methods. Students are required to complete one year of statistics, preferably before enrollment but no later than their first year. Competence in a foreign language is required. Students may substitute mastery of an advanced research skill in place of a foreign language. To acquire such a skill (which could involve course work in such dis\u00ad ciplines as economics, mathematics and computer science, or sta\u00ad tistics), students could take courses in econometrics, advanced multivariate regression, or computer science. Attendance in a col\u00ad loquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year, a review of per\u00ad formance in the graduate program will be conducted for each stu\u00ad dent by the Political Science faculty. A set of three papers, normally completed by the third year of study, tests the student's competence in a set of major domains for intel\u00ad lectual inquiry. These domains are determined by the student and the Political Science Graduate Director. Upon successful comple\u00ad tion of these papers and demonstration of competence in mathemat\u00ad ics and a foreign language or an advanced research skill, a candi\u00ad dacy committee is appointed to oversee the qualifying examination and the formal advancement to candidacy. Students are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral committee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, reviews a dissertation prospectus and supervises work toward completion of the dissertation. Within six months of the oral quali\u00ad fying examination (the formal advancement to candidacy), students are expected to meet with their doctoral committee, in order to dis\u00ad cuss with the members a dissertation prospectus. Concentration in Public Choice Public Choice is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of political science and economics, which draws on sophisticated quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Public Choice examines such areas as theories of voter and party choice; the theory of constitutions; the theory of committees and elections; models of regulation; problems of public goods and externalities; rent-seeking models; and issues in social choice, social welfare, and demand revelation. This concentration is administered by an interdisciplinary commit\u00ad tee of faculty from the Departments of Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the normal procedures for the program in Political Science and must fulfill all the requirements for the Political Science degree, with the following modifications: (1) Students must complete the three-quarter core sequence in Pub\u00ad lic Choice, which is taught jointly by Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics faculty. This sequence is usually taken in the student's sec\u00ad ond or third year. (2) Students must complete three additional graduate-level, four\u00ad unit courses in related fields with the consent of their graduate advisor, chosen from a set of courses designated by the interdisci\u00ad plinary committee. The courses chosen are to be tailored to the individual interests and academic background of the student and usually will include at least two Economics courses (such as Econometrics, Game Theory, and Law and Economics) and one Political Science course (such as those on electoral systems, party systems, constitutions, courts). (3) Students are expected to write their dissertation on a topic related to Public Choice. Usually the dissertation advisor will be a Political Science member of the interdisciplinary committee. Concentration in Political Psychology The last two decades have seen an explosion of interest in the field of political psychology. UCI's graduate concentration is part of this development, but enjoys a rather distinctive place. The concentra\u00ad tion offers students a broader education than is typically available at other institutions. In this vein, the program aims to provide: (1) a strong background in both political science and psychology; (2) an emphasis on theoretical and conceptual issues as well as empiri\u00ad cal and methodological ones; and (3) a familiarity with research being done outside of the United States as well as within it. In this context, a number of research concerns central to the participating faculty are considered, including: social change and democratiza\u00ad tion, ideology, altruism, social and political identity, public policy, community building, mass media effects, voting behavior, and international integration. Believing in academic community, the concentration's sponsoring faculty offer a host of activities includ\u00ad ing colloquia, reading groups, and joint research opportunities to facilitate contact between students and faculty and among the stu\u00ad dents themselves. Political Science 373 Requirements. The purpose of the concentration is to provide a course of study which supplements the Ph.D. degree in Political Science. Therefore, students are required to complete all degree requirements for the Ph.D. stipulated by the Department of Politi\u00ad cal Science. As part of or in addition to these requirements, stu\u00ad dents must take five courses: Introduction to Political Psychology I and II (Political Science 285A and 285B), and three graduate psy\u00ad chology courses which provide a strong background in psychology (selected from an approved group which includes courses such as Personality in Development, Society and Pathology, Personality Assessment, Proseminar in Cognitive Science, and Human Infor\u00ad mation Processing). These courses are taught in the Department of Cognitive Science in the School of Social Sciences and the Depart\u00ad ment of Psychology and Social Behavior in the School of Social Ecology.

THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN SOCIAL SCIENCE The major in Social Science provides an interdisciplinary perspec\u00ad tive on the study of society, both at the individual and group level. Using the knowledge and methods of all of the social sciences, a student majoring in Social Science develops the skills to think clearly about social concepts and issues. Social Science majors use their classroom knowledge in applied and individual learning expe\u00ad riences, either in supervised off-campus settings or with a faculty mentor. The core curriculum for Social Science majors provides exposure to various social science methods and topics, and teaches applied computing methodology. Students then select one of four special\u00ad izations, which guides their upper-division course work. Those selecting Multicultural Studies, for example, examine how Califor\u00ad nia's ethnic and cultural diversity affect the economics, politics, and culture of the State. The specialization in Public and Commu\u00ad nity Service provides students with internship experiences in com\u00ad munity, public, and educational institutions. Students choosing Research and Analytical Methods learn more about the research and methodologies in at least two social science disciplines. The specialization in Social Studies helps to prepare students for teach\u00ad ing at the elementary or high school levels, and includes a State\u00ad certified subject matter program in social science.

Yellott: Mathematical psychology and vision perception The concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences offers a program of interdisciplinary and mathematical approaches to the study of human behavior, providing high levels of training in cur\u00ad rent mathematical modeling and in mathematics and software use and programming. The program is administered by an interdiscipli\u00ad nary group of faculty. Within the concentration, an emphasis in Social Networks is available; specific requirements are detailed below. ADMISSION Admission to the concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences requires evidence of appreciable mathematical skill and knowledge. As an absolute minimum, a candidate should have taken one full year of calculus, including calculus of several vari\u00ad ables, and one course in linear algebra, and should also provide evidence of additional mathematical depth. This depth can be man\u00ad ifested in a number of different ways including, but not restricted to, an undergraduate degree in mathematics or physical science, a high score on the mathematics portion of the GRE, or a strong undergraduate minor in mathematics. In addition, students should have some exposure to a behavioral science field. Especially useful is some experience with behavioral science modeling. Those students interested in the emphasis in Social Networks should make this clear in their application. A student is free at any time after admission to move into or out of the emphasis in Social Networks, but will be subject to the requirements in effect at the time of original admission to the concentration in Mathematical Behavior11 Sciences. Mathematical Behavioral Sciences 391 REQUIREMENTS Four major classes of requirements must be fulfilled. Since a num\u00ad ber of options are available, the student will, in consultation with an advisor, develop a plan of study. Quantitative/Mathematical. To be completed by the end of the third year: (1) one course each in analysis beyond calculus (or dis\u00ad crete mathematics for the Social Networks emphasis), abstract algebra beyond linear algebra (or graph theory for the Social Net\u00ad works emphasis), and logic; and (2) two quarters of mathematical statistics, with calculus as a prerequisite and covering the funda\u00ad mentals of probability and random variables. Language/Computer. All students must be sufficiently familiar with various computer programs and languages to be able to conduct serious research in their field of interest and must submit either pro\u00ad posed courses or some demonstration of competency as part of their plan of study. In addition, students must either (1) attain proficiency in reading social science technical publications in one foreign lan\u00ad guage with a substantial relevant technical literature or (2) demon\u00ad strate proficiency in computer programming considerably beyond that of the standard computer requirement. Because of the continu\u00ad ally changing nature of computer languages and software, the condi\u00ad tions for fulfilling this additional computer expertise requirement is left to the judgment of the faculty subcommittee on computers of the Ph.D. program. Substantive Minor. Students are expected to develop considerable expertise in some substantive field and in the application of models to it. This requires the completion of three courses at the upper\u00ad division or graduate level that do not necessarily entail extensive modeling, and three courses or seminars in which the primary thrust is mathematical modeling. Research Papers and Colloquia. At the end of the second year, a 10-20-page paper reporting original research or a penetrating analysis of some subtopic of mathematical behavioral science (or social networks with a formal or mathematical component) is expected. An oral presentation will be given to faculty and gradu\u00ad ate students. Two faculty members are assigned to read and evalu\u00ad ate the paper and talk. Students are required to take for credit four quarters of the Mathe\" matical Behavioral Sciences Colloquium, Social Science 211A-B\u00ad C, during their first three years. (Although not a formal require\u00ad ment, students are expected to attend the Colloquium on a regular basis whenever in residence.) Students in the Social Networks emphasis are required to attend about 75 percent of these colloquia, including all that are designated as Social Networks colloquia. Social Networks students also must attend occasional colloquia, usually of local faculty and graduate students, which are separate from the general Mathematical Behavioral Sciences Colloquia. Master of Arts Degree The M.A. degree is awarded to UCI Ph.D. students who complete necessary requirements or to students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program (or equivalent) at another institution who are directly admitted for graduate study leading only to the master's degree at UCI. Such applicants must provide evidence that their Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram agrees to this one-year arrangement. Requirements include the submission of a petition to the Graduate Committee along with a proposed plan of study consisting of 36 units of relevant Mathemati\u00ad cal Behavioral Science courses, normally including the core require\u00ad ment in mathematical statistics, and the satisfactory completion of a comprehensive examination.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 406 UCI 1999-2000 College of Medicine College of Medicine Alumni Relations Maureen Hausen, Director (949) 824-7155 The UCI College of Medicine is an outgrowth of what began in 1896 as the Pacific College of Osteopathy (PSO). Some years later PSO became the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, which then became the California College of Medicine in 1962 and subsequently became part of the UC system in 1965. The Office of Alumni Relations provides programs and services for nearly 4,000 alumni of the College as well as for students. From financial sup\u00ad port to Honor's Night awards, mentorships to reunions, the Office of Alumni Relations seeks to provide a cornerstone from which students and alumni can benefit from their relationships to one another and in so doing, strengthen the College of Medicine. THE M.D. PROGRAM Admission and Outreach All inquiries regarding admission programs and procedures of the UCI College of Medicine should be directed to: University of California, Irvine College of Medicine Office of Admissions and Outreach P.O. Box 4089 Irvine, CA 92697-4089 Telephone: World Wide Web: http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/Departments/Medicaleducation/. The UCI College of Medicine is a member of the American Med\u00ad ical College Application Service (AMCAS). All students who seek entrance to medical school must first apply to AMCAS. Requests for applications should be submitted directly to: The American Medical College Application Service (AM CAS) Association of American Medical Colleges Section for Student Services 2501 M Street, N.W., Lobby 26 Washington, D.C. 20037-1300 Applications may be submitted between June 1 and November 1 of the year preceding anticipated admission. Students who wish to apply to the College of Medicine should designate it on their AM CAS application form, and AM CAS will forward the applica\u00ad tion to the College. Last year, the College received approximately 4,000 applications from AMCAS. From these, some 500 candidates were granted interviews, and 92 students were enrolled in the first-year class beginning in September. Applications received by the College are reviewed by its 40-mem\u00ad ber Admissions Committee composed of basic science and clinical faculty, and medical students. Applications are initially screened on the basis of both the student's academic performance (GPA and MCAT scores) and on non-cognitive variables that reflect depth and breadth of life experience. After initial screening, selected applicants are requested to submit additional materials which include letters of recommendation, sup\u00ad plemental information forms, and a nonrefundable application fee of $40. In addition to scholastic achievement, attributes deemed desirable in prospective students include leadership ability and participation in extracurricular activities, such as research and medically related experience, as well as community service. The Admissions Com\u00ad mittee also looks for qualities considered valuable in a physician. These qualities include the intellectual and emotional capacity to provide comprehensive and continuing medical care, the ability to cope with disease and guide patients through a complex array of medical services, a commitment to sensitivity to individual patient needs, and a dedication to the advancement of the art, science, and practice of medicine. Applicants may expect to receive notification about their admis\u00ad sion status from the College any time from November until the beginning of the following fall term. The Admissions Committee maintains a list of alternate candidates for possible acceptance should a vacancy occur before the end of the first week of classes. Accepted applicants must return a written statement of their accep\u00ad tance of the College's offer within two weeks after receipt of the notice of acceptance. No advance deposit to hold a position in the class is required of applicants. Students who are accepted sign a Statement of Intent to Register, but (in keeping with the recom\u00ad mendations of the Association of American Medical Colleges) are free to withdraw prior to enrollment if their medical school or career choice changes. Because the University of California is a state-assisted institution, preference is given to California residents who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States. The College does, how\u00ad ever, participate in the student exchange program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Under this program, qualified legal residents of certain Western states without medical schools (Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming) are con\u00ad sidered along with California residents. The states of origin reim\u00ad burse the State of California for the educational costs of students who are accepted. To be eligible for this program, students must apply to WICHE certifying officers in their own states. For addresses of certifying officers, contact: WICHE Student Exchange Program P.O.

Inquiries regarding the MCAT shouldbe addressed to: MCAT Program Office P.O. Box 4056 Iowa City, 10 52243 (319) 337-1357 Medical Student Advisor System The College's formal advisor system includes basic science advi\u00ad sors and career specialty advisors. Basic Science Advisors Charles Ribak, Ph.D., Chair (949) 824-4610 There are 12 basic science advisors. Six advisors are assigned on an every other year rotational basis to each incoming class and fol\u00ad low that class through their basic science years. The basic science advisors meet on a monthly basis to review students academic progress, and to initiate interventive programs for students in acad\u00ad emic difficulty and at academic risk. They also serve as a source of support and guidance for first-and second-year medical students. Career Specialty Advisors Deborah Stewart, M.D., Chair (949) 824-4610 Associate Dean Student and Resident Affairs Career specialty advisors are generally full-time College of Medi\u00ad cine faculty who are identified as knowledgeable about career and residency options in their field. They are available to students as career-choice consultants. Peer Review and Peer Counseling Program Deborah Stewart, M.D., Chair Associate Dean Student and Resident Affairs Medicine 407 (949) 824-4610 The College of Medicine has an informal peer review process, aimed at early detection and assistance for medical students who are experiencing difficulty such as professional conduct problems, sus\u00ad pected impairment, violation of the honor code, or violation of any University policy, regulation, or rule. The Peer Review Committee is comprised of two representatives from each class, the student body co-presidents, and two advisory faculty members. The com\u00ad mittee operates within guidelines set jointly by the College of Medicine administration and the student body. Cases involving serious professional misconduct are referred to the Dean's Office. The Peer Review Committee conducts hearings and may impose sanctions or provide assistance to the student. Medical Scholars Program Marcia London Albert, Ph.D. Academic Skills Coordinator (949) 824-3415 The Medical Scholars Program (MSP), a student-driven effort, is an innovative, collegial study support program which was implemented in the fail of 1993. This program benefits all students in the College of Medicine and provides a special sense of community for first-year students. A great deal of the informal knowledge concerning medical school is communicated through the components of MSP. Small groups of first-year students are led by second-year co-leaders who develop clinically relevant case-based problems for discussion cov\u00ad ering material learned in first-year basic science courses. Fourth\u00ad year students serve as co-leaders for similar groups of second-year students. First-year discussion groups meet every other week, and groups for second-year students meet once per month. First-and second-year students also receive MSP study packets, which con\u00ad tain test questions and answers from the previous year, and are dis\u00ad tributed prior to each examination. Another component of MSP is designed to meet the needs of stu\u00ad dents as they face the challenges and transitions of their third year. During their various clerkships, third-year students are assisted in four basic areas by fourth-year students: oral examinations, presen\u00ad tation of cases, written examinations, and clinical skills. These fourth-year students not only share their knowledge of the subjects, but also share information about appropriate study material, and what to emphasize in studying for their various test experiences. Both third-and fourth-year students benefit from participating in this program. Medical Scientist Training Program (M.D./Ph.D.) Alan Goldin, M.D., Ph.D., Chair (949) 824-5264 Exceptionally well-qualified students interested in careers in acad\u00ad emic medicine and with demonstrated research accomplishments may be considered for admission to the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Students in this program pursue a combined cur\u00ad riculum leading to an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from any of the graduate programs at UCI. The program requires a minimum of seven years for completion, and students holding either degree are not eligible for MSTP. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the MSTP Coordinator's Office, (949) 824-5264. Applicants must submit a supplementary application (available from the College of Medicine Office of Admissions) to the Medical Scien\u00ad tist Training Program when they are submitting their secondary application information to the College of Medicine. Students accepted into the program have the option of pursuing graduate study in any of the graduate programs at UCI. Although a specific graduate department need not be chosen at the time of admission, UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 408 UCI 1999-2000 College of Medicine students are expected to have selected a field for their graduate stud\u00ad ies. Financial support in the form of a fellowship, which includes a stipend as well as tuition and fees, is provided to a limited number of students each year. Applicants not accepted into MSTP may be considered separately for admission to the College of Medicine. The M.D. Curriculum The M.D. curriculum requires four years to complete. If special needs are identified, the time may be extended to five years. The first and second years are scheduled on a modified quarter system. There is a 10-week vacation period between the first and second years; students may use that time for elective or research work in place of vacation. Between the second and third years is a five-week vacation. In the third year there are seven weeks vaca\u00ad tion; students may use that time for electives. In the fourth year up to 11 weeks of vacation are allowed. Under the recommendation of faculty supported committees, UCI's M.D. program continues to undergo curricular reform within all four years of instruction. The College of Medicine faculty view curriculum development as a continual process and feel that medical education must be the highest priority and that teaching innovations must be encouraged and supported. The curriculum encourages medical students to become participants in their education process, facilitates active rather than passive learning, and encourages cooperative learning among students. The faculty also feel that the curriculum should integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into the early phases of medical education and bringing substantial basic science materials into the later phases of medical education (verti\u00ad cal integration of course material). The College has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of the Patient-Doctor series. The Patient\u00ad Doctor courses are longitudinal multi-disciplinary experiences. Through Patient-Doctor I and II students begin clinical exposure during their first two years of instruction. During Patient-Doctor III and IV, students are given the opportunity to integrate basic and clinical science into a comprehensive forum and review major basic science topics through PCP conferences and patient workups. These courses also include special interest topics such as death and dying, cultural competence, domestic violence, and many others. Horizontal integration of the course material has been achieved through the development of multi-disciplinary courses including the Patient-Doctor series and Neurosciences. The second-year course directors have coordinated the instruction of materials among Pathology, Clinical Pathology, Pharmacology, and Patient\u00ad Doctor II. In addition, the first-year course directors are currently engaged in a cooperative project of integrating the courses within the first-year curriculum. The faculty and administration at the College of Medicine are com\u00ad mitted to the process of curricular reform and foresee continual implementation of new programs to ensure that medical students receive current and innovative education. To satisfy the requirements for the M.D. degree, each medical stu\u00ad dent must successfully complete the full curriculum (basic science, preclinical, clinical, and elective course work) with a passing grade and fulfill the National Board Examination requirement. After the second year, all students are required to take Step I of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. Students mustpass both Step I and Step II of the Boards prior to graduation. In accordance with the College of Medicine policies and procedures, the exami\u00ad nation may be taken a maximum of three times. CURRICULAR POLICIES The curricular policies of the College of Medicine are the responsi\u00ad bility of faculty committees. A listing of these policies, as well as information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, and requirements for academic advancement, are con\u00ad tained in the College of Medicine Handbook, which is available from the Office of Medical Education and is distributed along with other policy statements to all students upon matriculation. The College uses an Honors/Pass/Fail grading system for all stu\u00ad dents who entered after 1994.

The program in Environmental Toxi\u00ad cology provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary and appropriate to teach and/or conduct basic and applied research programs in inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, environmental car\u00ad cinogenesis, biochemical neurotoxicology, chemical pathology, phototoxicity, toxicology of natural products, and toxicokinetics. Toxicology involves scientific study of the entry, distribution, bio\u00ad transformation, and mechanism of action of chemical agents harm\u00ad ful to the body. The program interprets environmental toxicology as the study of the effects and mechanisms of action of hazardous chemicals in food, air, water, and soil, in the home, workplace, and community; and considers experimentally and theoretically such diverse research problems as: (1) new scientific approaches to toxi\u00ad cological evaluation of environmental chemicals such as air and water pollutants, food additives, industrial wastes, and agricultural adjuvants; (2) mechanisms of action in chemical carcinogenesis and mutagenesis; (3) the molecular pathology of tissue injury in acute toxicity; and (4) scientific principles involved in extrapolat\u00ad ing from laboratory animal data to expected effects on human health in environmental exposures. Students entering the program have varied backgrounds, including chemistry, biology, and physiology. The curriculum is based on a foundation of basic and health sciences with applications of scien\u00ad tific principles to environmental problems. Formal course work is enriched by a strong commitment to student-professor interaction throughout the program. An important and integral part of the learning process is an early and intensive involvement of the stu\u00ad dent in ongoing original research projects in environmental toxi\u00ad cology, especially inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, chemical car\u00ad cinogenesis, biochemical toxicology, chemical pathology, and neurotoxicology. In addition to meeting the general admission requirements set by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, applicants must be admitted by an Admissions Committee composed of faculty mem\u00ad bers from the Department of Community and Environmental Medi\u00ad cine.

Division faculty and staff are involved in teaching, research, and patient service. Clinical activities include evaluation, early ascer\u00ad tainment, prenatal diagnosis, prevention, and management of genetic disorders, birth defects, and developmentally disabling con\u00ad ditions. Among faculty research interests are gene mapping and linkage analysis using DNA probes and quantitative methods; delin\u00ad single-gene disorders; the incidence and perception of genetic disease, birth defects, and developmental disabilities in underserved ethnic populations; factors in the etiology of chromosomal abnor\u00ad malities cancer and sexual differentiation; psychosocial issues in genetic disease and prenatal diagnosis; and delivery of genetic services. During the six to eight academic quarters of the program, students must complete a sequence of core courses in medical genetics, bio\u00ad chemical and molecular genetics, cytogenetics, child development, counseling issues and techniques, research methodology, ethical issues, and community resources. Experiential professional training occurs concurrently with formal course work in a variety of clinics at the UCI Medical Center and affiliated hospitals, in the prenatal diagnosis program, in the cytogenetics laboratory, and in certain community agencies. Participation in these and other divisional and departmental professional and educational activities such as lectures, seminars, Pediatric and Obstetrics Grand Rounds, cytoge\u00ad netics rounds, and research, counseling, and patient management conferences is expected throughout the program. Completion of the program requires a minimum of 58 quarter units of credit, a research thesis which should be publishable, and UC IRVINE - 1999-2000418 UCI 1999-2000 College of Medicine demonstration of satisfactory professional skills in genetic counsel\u00ad ing. The program director serves as faculty advisor to students, although teaching and supervision of professional experiential training is shared among all division faculty and staff, who fre\u00ad quently review student progress. In the second year, development of professional skills can be individualized according to the stu\u00ad dent's needs and interests. It is anticipated that graduates will be eligible for American Board of Genetic Counseling certification within a year of completing the program. Recommended undergraduate preparation includes course work in the biological and social sciences, especially in genetics, biochem\u00ad istry, psychology, and human development. Course work in statis\u00ad tics is desirable. Facility in Spanish or a Southeast Asian language is a considerable asset. Extracurricular and/or employment experi\u00ad ences which provide evidence of the student's maturity, interper\u00ad sonal skills, and promise as a genetic counselor figure prominently in the admissions decision. References should speak to these quali\u00ad ties as well as to the academic qualifications of the applicant. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores must be submitted and Subject Test scores will be considered if they are available. Applications are accepted for the fall quarter only and must be completed by February 1. Because of keen competition for places in the program, a two-stage admissions process is employed, with approximately one-fifth of the applicants being invited for inter\u00ad views at UCI following an initial review of applications by the fac\u00ad ulty. Interviews usually are conducted from March through mid\u00ad April, and the final selection is made from among the interviewed candidates by late April.

Leslie Redpath: Cellular and tissue radiobiology including mechanisms of chemical modification of radiation damage; oncogenic cell transformation; genetic aspects of cellular sensitivity Werner Roeck: Engineering aspects of radiographic imaging systems; digital radiography; x-ray tube design The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a cre\u00ad ative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. The primary concentration of the program is in med\u00ad ical imaging. Medical imaging involves the study of the interaction of all forms of radiation with tissue and the development of appropriate tech\u00ad nology to extract clinically useful information from this interaction process. Such information is most often displayed in an image for\u00ad mat. Medical images can be as simple as a projection image as first produced by Roentgen nearly 100 years ago and utilized today as a simple chest x-ray, or as complicated as a computer reconstructed image, as produced by Computerized Tomography (CT) using x-rays, or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using intense magnetic fields. Medical imaging is an exciting and rapidly devel\u00ad oping area of research which is continuing to revolutionize diag\u00ad nostic medicine. It provides students with the rare opportunity to conduct research which will directly, and sometimes immediately, benefit humankind. Radiological Sciences 421 The graduate program has a broad-based, interdisciplinary curricu\u00ad lum which places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive and integrated knowl\u00ad edge of medical imaging in addition to an exceptionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the train\u00ad ing received in medical imaging and its various modalities, as well as in medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiologi\u00ad cal engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospective students should be aware that the program is demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a variety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped research laboratories in imaging physics, radiation physics, radio\u00ad pharmacy, and radiological engineering located on campus and at the hospitals associated with UCI. Prospective students with partic\u00ad ular or well-defined research interests are encouraged to contact faculty members to discuss research opportunities. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Details of the application process and information about financial support and university housing are described in the booklet Graduate Applica\u00ad tion for Admission which is available from the Department or from the Office of Graduate Studies. This booklet also contains the appropriate application forms which must be completed by the prospective student. The application deadline for fall quarter admission for graduate study in Radiological Sciences is June I of the same year. How\u00ad ever, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applica\u00ad tions for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances. In addition to the usual University fellow\u00ad ships, the Department of Radiological Sciences offers a limited number of departmental fellowships for which entering students can be considered. Since the Department does not offer an under\u00ad graduate program of study, no teaching assistantships are available through the Department. Research assistantships may be available to advanced students. Applicants to the program should have a strong background in physics and mathematics. Some course work in the biological sci\u00ad ences would also be helpful, particularly an introductory course in physiology and/or anatomy. Since most students will need some additional work in one or more disciplines, the program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as deter\u00ad mined by Departmental review. Although the program of study is vigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Students currently in the program generally have undergraduate degrees in either physics or electrical engineering. The UCI bache\u00ad lor's degree program in physics with a concentration in biomedical physics is an ideal prerequisite for graduate study in Radiological Sciences. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiological Sci\u00ad ences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also prepares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student com\u00ad pletes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of spe\u00ad cialization and satisfactorily passes the oral and written compre\u00ad hensive examinations at the M.S. level. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000I 422 UCI 1999-2000 College of Medicine Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take addi\u00ad tional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with a grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written qualifying examination given at the end of the first full year of study. This examination, normally given in September before the beginning of the fall quarter, consists of five parts: radi\u00ad ation physics, x-ray (including CT), nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound. A student who fails the quali\u00ad fying examination may repeat it at a later regularly scheduled time. Only one such repeat examination is allowed. Third, within a year after passing the qualifying examination, the student must present a detailed dissertation research proposal to a five-person candidacy committee appointed by 'the Dean, upon the recommendation of the graduate committee, proposed by the student and the student's advisor. Following the unanimous approval of the candidacy com\u00ad mittee, the student will be advanced to candidacy. The attainment of candidacy status signifies that all preparatory work has been completed and that full attention may be given to the dissertation research. Finally, the student must prepare and defend, in a final oral examination a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major ele\u00ad ment in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intel\u00ad lectual synthesis, and creativity. The doctoral committee is a three\u00ad member subset of the candidacy committee and is chaired by the faculty member responsible for providing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. The doctoral committee supervises the stu\u00ad dent's research program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination. Prospective students should contact the Department of Radiologi\u00ad cal Sciences for information about this program prior to applying.

Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multicultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California Constitutions, and from the charter of the University of California which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the pro\u00ad tection of lawful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchal\u00ad lenged within the University. Tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of background, gender, ethnicity, race, and religion are as crucial within our campus community as are tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Education and clear, rational, and vigorous challenges are positive responses to prejudice and acts of bigotry. The University's nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in University programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of University nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or in connection with official University functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with Univer\u00ad sity policy. (See Section 102.08 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activi\u00ad ties, Organizations, and Students.) All who work, live, study, and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Principles of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the University community can successfully conduct its affairs. Student Conduct and Discipline Students enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. A handbook is available which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI students. Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students lists rules concerning conduct and related mat\u00ad ters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the President of the University and also incorporates campus regulations. Copies are available from the Dean of Students, located in the UCI Student Center, and the Uni\u00ad versity Ombudsman, located in 255 Administration Building. Academic Honesty The UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty were approved by the Irvine Division on June 2, 1988; revised on December 12, 1996; revision effective October 1, 1997. A. PREAMBLE The University is an institution of learning, research, and scholarship predi\u00ad cated on the existence of an environment of honesty and integrity. As mem\u00ad bers of the academic community, faculty, students, and administrative offi\u00ad cials share responsibility for maintaining this environment. It is essential that all members of the academic community subscribe to the ideal of academic honesty and integrity and accept individual responsibility for their work. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine. Cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest activities erode the University's educational, research, and social roles. They devalue the learning experience and its legiti\u00ad macy not only for the perpetrators but for the entire community. B. RESPONSIBILITIES All members of the academic community have a responsibility to ensure that scholastic honesty is maintained. Faculty have primary responsibility for: 1. Upholding and enforciqg universitywide principles of academic honesty and integrity and explaining clearly these principles including any qualifi\u00ad cations which may be operative in the classes. they are teaching. 2. Minimizing oppm:tunities for academic misconduct in their courses. 3. Confronting students suspected of academic dishonesty in a way that respects student privacy. 4. Affording students accused of academic misconduct the right to appeal any resulting disputes to disinterested parties for hearing and resolution. 5. Assigning an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty. 6. Reporting all instances of academic dishonesty to appropriate Associate Deans. 7. Protecting the anonymity of any student reporting an incident of acade\u00ad mic dishonesty to the extent permitted by due process required for the accused and other legal requirements. Students have responsibility for: 1. Refraining from cheating and plagiarism. 2. Refusing to aid or abet any form of academic dishonesty. 3. Notifying professors and/or appropriate administrative officials about observed incidents of academic misconduct. The anonymity of a student reporting an incident of academic dishonesty will be protected. C. WHAT IS ACADEMIC DISHONESTY? Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to the following examples: Cheating 1. Copying from others during an examination. 2. Communicating exam answers with other students during an examina\u00ad tion. 3. Offering another person's work as one's own. 4. Taking an examination for another student or having someone take an examination for oneself. 5. Sharing.answers for a take-home examination or assignment unless specifically authorized by the instructor. 6. Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected, then returning it for more credit. 7. Using unauthorized materials, prepared answers, written notes or infor\u00ad mation concealed in a blue book or elsewhere during an examination. 8. Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company). Dishonest Conduct. 1. Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor. 2. Changing or attempting to change academic records without proper sanction. 3. Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit in more than one course without consulting all instructors involved. 4. Forging add/drop/change cards and other enrollment documents, or altering such documents after signatures have been obtained. 5. Intentionally disrupting the educational process in any manner. 6. Allowing another student to copy off of one's own work during a test. Plagiarism Plagiarism is intellectual theft. It means use of the intellectual creations of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism may take two main forms, which are clearly related: 1. To steal or pass off as one's own the ideas or words of another. 2. To use a creative production without crediting the source. Credit must be given for every direct quotation, for paraphrasing or summa\u00ad rizing a work (in whole, or in part, in one's own words), and for information which is not common knowledge. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000Collusion Any student who knowingly or intentionally helps another student perform any of the above acts of cheating or plagiarism is subject to discipline for academic dishonesty. D. PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH INCIDENTS OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY Many, perhaps most, incidents of academic dishonesty involve accusations which are based on clear evidence and which are not contested by the accused student. In such cases, if the infraction is relatively minor and there is no indication that the accused student has previously been involved in such incidents, it is most appropriate that the matter be resolved between the stu\u00ad dent and the faculty member. When this occurs, it is nevertheless important that a written report of the incident be filed to ensure that penalties assessed are commensurate with the offense and that repeated infractions be detected and dealt with appropriately. More serious incidents and repeat offenses which call for stronger discipli\u00ad nary action, may result in campuswide sanctions, in addition to the actions imposed by a faculty member. In such cases, these sanctions, as described in Section 105.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, will be administered by the Academic Associate Deans or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies. Finally, whenever an accusation of academic dishonesty or a grade given by a faculty member is contested by an accused student, the student has recourse for mediation of the dispute. Processes for mediation resolution and/or an investigation may be requested by the student or the Associate (Undergradu\u00ad ate or Graduate) Dean of the faculty member's school through the Office of the Ombudsman. In incidents where a campuswide sanction has been imposed, the student can request a hearing with the appropriate Committee on Academic Honesty which will be convened by the Office of either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, depend\u00ad ing on the status of the accused student. The procedures outlined here are designed to institute a system that recog\u00ad nizes that many cases of academic misconduct are best resolved solely between the student and faculty member involved, while it provides for appropriate handling of serious and repeated offenses and guarantees a fair hearing to an accused student. Authority of Faculty Members When a faculty member has evidence of student academic dishonesty, the faculty member must present the evidence to the student in a private meeting or communicate with the student by some other means. The faculty member must initiate this communication with the student within 15 calendar days of discovering evidence of academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work. The faculty member then has the authority to impose only one or more of the following: 1. Issue a reprimand to the student with letter of explanation to the student's file. 2. Require repetition of the questionable work or examination with letter of explanation to the student's file. 3. Reduce the grade to an 'F' or zero, if appropriate, on the questionable work or examination with written notification to the student and a letter of explanation to the student's file. 4. Assign the student a failing grade in the course with letter of explanation to the student's file. It is essential that any such action be reported in writing to the student in a letter from the faculty member. Copies of this letter must also be sent to (a) the Associate Dean of the faculty member's school, (b) the Associate Dean of the student's school, who will maintain a file of cases of academic miscon\u00ad duct involving students enrolled in that school, and (c) the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate. The faculty member is strongly encouraged to consult with the Associate (Under\u00ad graduate or Graduate) Dean of his or her school before the letter is drafted. Reference to (or a copy of) the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty should be included in the letter. If action (4) is taken, the faculty member is responsible for making certain that the failure is recorded by the Registrar on the student's permanent academic record. Careful documenta\u00ad tion of the incident must be maintained by the faculty member in the event that his or her actions in the case should later be subject to review. Appendix 429 Responsibilities of the Academic Associate Deans 1. The Associate (Graduate or Undergraduate) Dean of either the accused student's school or of the faculty member's school may impose cam\u00ad puswide sanctions. Sanctions imposed by Associate Deans are final unless the student requests a hearing within 15 calendar days of notifica\u00ad tion. The 15-day period starts from the time the Associate Dean has noti\u00ad fied the student of the discipline or has notified the student of the hearing and appeal process by providing a copy of this policy, whichever comes later. It is recommended that each case be brought to a final resolution within 90 days of instruction. 2. The Associate Dean (or equivalent official) of each school is responsible for maintaining confidential records concerning academic dishonesty of students enrolled in that school. All letters reporting faculty-imposed aca\u00ad demic penalties for academic misconduct will be included in these files. 3. The Associate Dean of the accused student's school will be responsible for identifying all incidents which represent repeated offenses by a stu\u00ad dent and may impose a campus wide sanction because of repeat offenses. 4. Associate Deans are required to notify the student of the hearing and appeal process and provide the student a copy of this policy. If an Associ\u00ad ate Dean suspects grounds for a grievance involving discrimination, the student should be referred to Part 3 of The Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, \"Student Academic Grievance Process\" (which is limited to allegations of discrimination). 5. In those classes where academic dishonesty continues to be a problem and the faculty member or another university official has already been approached by the student(s) from the class, the Associate Dean will con\u00ad sult with the appropriate faculty member to address the problem. 6. Students who have on file recorded acts of academic dishonesty, as defined by the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, may be excluded by the Associate Deans from considera\u00ad tion for academic honors at graduation. 7. In those situations where a campus wide sanction is imposed and the stu\u00ad dent requests a hearing, the Associate Dean will forward to the Commit\u00ad tee on Academic Honesty the materials which led him or her to impose the sanction. In addition, the Associate Dean will appear before the Com\u00ad mittee to discuss the case upon request of the Committee. Student Hearings When any student accused of academic dishonesty wishes to contest a sanc\u00ad tion imposed by a faculty member, the student may, within a 15-day period, request mediation by writing to the Associate Dean of the faculty member imposing the sanction or to the Ombudsman. However, it should be under\u00ad stood that all grades are ultimately the responsibility of faculty. The period is 15 calendar days and starts from the time the Associate Dean has notified the student of the discipline or has notified the student of the hearing and appeal process by providing a copy of this policy, whichever comes later. When a campuswide sanction is imposed, the affected student may, within 15 days of notification, request a hearing before the Committee on Academic Honesty. Students considering a hearing in response to campuswide sanctions for alleged academic misconduct are urged to contact the Associate Dean of their academic school and/or the University Ombudsman concerning possible sources of advice and assistance. Students should be advised regarding the grounds for appeal as specified in section 103.11 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. Role of the Ombudsman The services of the Ombudsman may be requested at any time by the student, the faculty member, or the Associate Dean. The role of the Ombudsman is to assist in conflict resolution, mediate the dispute, perform an informal investi\u00ad gation of the case, and clarify policies and procedures for anyone involved. In those incidents where imposition of a campuswide sanction is a considera\u00ad tion and the student has requested a hearing, the case will be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman. An investigation may be conducted by the Ombudsman who will then confer with the Associate Dean and the accused student. However, the findings of the Ombudsman will not be forwarded to the Committee on Academic Honesty. The case may be referred by either the student or the Ombudsman to either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate, who will be responsible for convening the Committee on Academic Honesty. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000430 UCI 1999-2000 Appendix Students should always be informed by the Associate Dean of their school of their right to secure the assistance of the Ombudsman in understanding and addressing the problem or issue. Role of the Deans of Undergraduate Education and Graduate Studies Whenever an incident of academic misconduct is referred to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies by the student or the Ombudsman, a representative of the appropriate offices will meet with the student and, if requested, explain the process and arrange the time and place of a hearing before the appropriate (Undergraduate or Gradu\u00ad ate) Committee on Academic Honesty. The appropriate Dean will maintain a record of all cases of academic dishonesty reported by the respective Associ\u00ad ate Deans. Formal resolution by the appropriate Committee on Academic Honesty may result in the imposition by the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies of one or more of the sanctions described in section 105.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, including suspension or dismissal from the University. E. COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC HONESTY 1. Jurisdiction of the Committees on Academic Honesty There will be two Committees on Academic Honesty. One Committee will hear cases of campuswide sanctions on undergraduate students while the other will hear graduate student cases. The Committees can reduce, affirm, or increase sanctions. 2. Composition of the Committees on Academic Honesty The Committees on Academic Honesty will be standing administrative com\u00ad mittees composed of two faculty, two students, and a representative of either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Dean of Graduate Studies, as appro\u00ad priate. Terms of faculty members will be two years. One faculty member will be appointed annually by either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies, as appropriate for the particular committee. To ensure con\u00ad tinuity, terms will be staggered; during the first year of operation only, one faculty member will be appointed for a one-year term. One additional faculty member will be appointed to serve as an alternate to each of the Committees. The two students shall serve for one year and will be appointed by either ASUCI or AGS as appropriate to the specific committee. One additional student member will be appointed to serve as an alternate to each of the Committees. 3. Role of the Associate Dean The Associate Dean will forward to the committee the evidence which led to his or her decision to impose the campuswide sanction. In addition, the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean will appear before the Committee to comment on the case if the Committee wishes. 4. Hearings a. If the student requests a hearing, the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies shall schedule a hearing of the case before \u00b7 the appropriate Committee. Written notice must be given to the parties involved regarding the date, time, and place of the hearing. b. The chair will be elected by the membership of the committee. The chair will rule on all questions of procedure, the admission or exclusion of evi\u00ad dence, and the need to call witnesses for additional testimony. Hearings shall be held in accordance with generally accepted standards of proce\u00ad dural due process. c. Hearings will be closed unless the parties involved agree to an open hear\u00ad ing. Every effort must be made by all parties to maintain confidentiality during the process. d. Hearings shall be held following the provisions in sections 103.11. (5, 6, and 8) of the Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline, except that the role of the Dean of Students shall be filled by the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies, depending on the status of the student. 5. Report of the Committee on Academic Honesty After the hearing the Committee shall arrive at a decision. When a decision is reached, the student and the appropriate Academic Associate Dean will be informed of the judgment. 6. Final Appeal If the campus wide sanction is upheld by the Committee, the report of the Committee and all supporting evidence can be sent for a final level of review at the request of the student. If the accused student is an undergraduate, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of Graduate Studies. If the accused stu\u00ad dent is a graduate student, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of Under\u00ad graduate Education. This final review process can only result in decreasing the sanctions imposed on the student or leaving them unchanged. There are no further appeals or processes. 7. Implementation Once the judgment has been rendered the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies will implement the judgment in the form of a letter to the student as well as initiate any other necessary administrative actions. F. MAINTENANCE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS Records relating to academic dishonesty will be maintained by the Associate Deans and the Offices of the Deans of Undergraduate Education and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies to promote consistency of penalties for a given offense and to ensure appropriate action against repeat offenders. Records will normally be destroyed after five years, unless the Associate Dean determines in any par\u00ad ticular case that there is good reason to extend the period of retention. In order to ensure that minor and nonrecurring infractions do not negatively impact a student's career beyond UCI, any student may petition to the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean of his or her academic school to have relevant academic discipli\u00ad nary records expunged after the record is two years old or upon graduation, whichever comes first. The Associate Dean has sole authority to consider and to grant or deny such petitions. The University will release a student's disci\u00ad plinary records to potential employers, governmental agencies, other educa\u00ad tional institutions, or other organizations or individuals only if authorized to do so by the student in question or if compelled by law. Any record expunged by the Associate Dean will also be erased in. the Dean of Undergraduate Edu\u00ad cation or Graduate Studies Offices. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This policy is intended to focus solely on issues related to academic dishon\u00ad esty. Certain details of the implementation of procedures specified here can be found in the UCI publication Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, available free of charge from the Office of the Ombudsman, Room 255 Administration, and the Office of the Dean of Stu\u00ad dents, first floor, Student Center. Anti-Hazing Compliance The State of California and the University of California have expressly and repeatedly asserted their opposition to hazing and preinitiation activities which do not contribute to the positive development and welfare of the indi\u00ad viduals involved. In January 1988, the Education Code of the State of Cali\u00ad fornia was modified to reflect changes to the State's anti-hazing statute. In accordance with the revised Education Code, students are advised of the following: Education Code 32050 As used in this article, hazing includes any method of initiation or preinitia\u00ad tion into a student organization or any pastime or amusement engaged in with respect to such an organization which causes, or is likely to cause, bod\u00ad ily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm, to any student or other person attending any school, community college, college, university, or other educational institutions in this state; but the term \"hazing\" does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions. Education Code 32051 No student, or other person in attendance at any public, private, parochial, or military school, community college, college, or other educational institution, shall conspire to engage in hazing, participate in hazing, or commit any act that causes or is likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to any fellow student or person attending the institution. UC IRVINE - 1999-2000The violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($1 00), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or both. Education Code 32052 Any person who participates in the hazing of another, or any corporation or association which knowingly permits hazing to be conducted by its members or by others subject to its direction or control, shall forfeit any entitlement to State funds, scholarships, or awards which are enjoyed by him, by her, \u00b7or by it, and shall be deprived of any sanction or approval granted by any public educational institution or agency. Copies of Sections 32050 through 32052 as well as UCI's policies regarding hazing are available from the Office of the Dean of Students, UCI Student Center. Computer-Use Policy The University of California, Irvine (UCI) provides computing resources and worldwide network access to members of the UCI electronic commu\u00ad nity for legitimate academic and administrative pursuits to communicate, access knowledge, and retrieve and disseminate information. As members sharing these resources, we also share the rights and responsibilities of their use. This document describes the shared rights and responsibilities as well as the consequences of misuse. Please read it as you are responsible for knowing and following these policies. We welcome your use of campus computing resources and your cooperation. Rights and Responsibilities Worldwide, open-access electronic communication is a privilege, and con\u00ad tinued access requires that users act responsibly. Users should be able to trust that the products of their intellectual efforts will be safe from viola\u00ad tion, destruction, theft, or other abuse. As a user sharing computing resources, you must respect and value the rights and privacy of others, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. You are responsible to refrain from acts that waste resources, prevent others from using them, harm resources or information, or abuse other people. To help protect your files, you are responsible for setting passwords appropriately and keeping your password confidential by not giving it to another person. Most UCI owned computers are under the control of a system administrator or lab manager. Like you, these administrators are expected to respect the privacy of computer system users. However, UCI computer system admin\u00ad istrators may access user files or suspend services on the systems they man\u00ad age without notice as required to protect the integrity of computer systems or to examine accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use, misuse, or have been corrupted or damaged. This includes temporarily locking vulner\u00ad able accounts, removing hung jobs, reprioritizing resource intensive jobs, and more. Many UCI departments have their own computing and networking resources and policies. When accessing computing resources, users are responsible for obeying both the policies set forth in this general computing document and the policies of the other departments. Users are also responsible for obeying policies of off-campus network services accessed from UCI. Examples of Misuse Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to, the activities on the fol\u00ad lowing list: Running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended solely for the purpose of damaging or placing excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes, but is not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, hots, flash programs, or password cracking programs. Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security loopholes without prior written consent of the system administrator. This includes creating and/or running programs that are designed to identify security loopholes and/or intentionally decrypt secure data. Appendix 431 Using computers or electronic mail to act abusively toward others or to pro\u00ad voke a violent reaction, such as stalking, acts of bigotry, threats of violence, or other hostile or intimidating \"fighting words.\" Such words include those terms widely recognized to victimize or stigmatize individuals on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, for example. Posting on electronic bulletin boards or web pages materials that violate the University's codes of conduct. This includes posting information that is slanderous or defamatory in nature or displaying graphically disturbing or sexually harassing images or text in a public computer facility or location that are in view of other individuals. Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communi\u00ad cations or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner. Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws. Using the campus network to gain unauthorized access to any computer system. Using a computer account or obtaining a password that you are not autho\u00ad rized to use, or allowing anyone else to use your own account. Masking the identity of an account or machine. This includes sending mail that appears to come from someone else. Performing an act without authorization which will interfere with the nor\u00ad mal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, networks, or which will interfere with others' ability to make use of the resources. Using your account for any activity that is commercial in nature not related to your work at UCI, such as consulting services, typing services, developing software for sale, advertising products, and/or other commer\u00ad cial enterprises for personal financial gain. Deliberately wasting computing resources, such as playing games (for example, MUDS or IRC) while someone else is waiting to use the com\u00ad puter for UCI related work, sending chain letters, spamming newsgroups, treating the printer like a copy machine, storing or moving large files which could compromise system integrity or preclude other users right of access to disk storage, and more. Consequences of Misuse Misuse of computing, networking, or information is unacceptable, and users will be held accountable for their conduct. Serious infractions can result in temporary or permanent loss of computing and/or network privileges, student judicial affairs review and discipline, and/or Federal or State legal prosecu\u00ad tion. California Penal Code Section 502 makes certain computer abuses a crime (such as illegal reproduction of software protected by U.S. copyright law), and penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment. Files may be sub\u00ad ject to search under proper authorization. Minor infractions of this policy, such as poorly chosen passwords, over\u00ad loading systems, excessive disk space consumption, are typically handled internally to the department in an informal manner. More serious infrac\u00ad tions such as abusive behavior, account invasion or destruction, attempting to circumvent system security, are handled formally through the Office of the Dean of Students or by other appropriate officials. For More Information For more information, contact the Office of Academic Computing, E2130 Engineering Gateway Building, telephone (949) 824-6116, or send elec\u00ad tronic mail to oac@uci.edu. Also, students may want to read the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, which is avail\u00ad able from the Office of the Dean of Students, Student Center.

UC IRVINE - 1999-2000432 UCI 1999-2000 Appendix Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records per\u00ad taining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as medical records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students\u00ad include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disci\u00ad plinary records, and financial aid records. At UCI, an \"applicant\" becomes a \"student\" at the time of submission of the Statement of Intent to Register form. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large mea\u00ad sure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and proce\u00ad dures implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit stu\u00ad dents access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Infor\u00ad mation from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of personally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue S.W., Wash\u00ad ington, D.C. 20202-4605; 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the peiformance of their assigned duties. Further, confidential information can be disclosed without prior written con\u00ad sent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or sub\u00ad poena; and (c) when authorized federal or State officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose informa\u00ad tion. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Stu\u00ad dents for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (e-mail, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, number of course units in which enrolled, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these cate\u00ad gories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any hon\u00ad ors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruc\u00ad tion to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of puolic information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the University Ombudsman, 255 Administration. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office cur\u00ad rently informed as changes to personal data occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, copies of which are avail\u00ad able in the Office of the Dean of Students and on the World Wide Web at http://www.students.uci.edu/-students/JUDICIAUuci_policy.html/.

Crime within the UCI Community While crimes do occur within the UCI community (campus and Medical Center), the rates of both violent crime and property crime have remained low. Burglary and theft (including automobiles and bicycles) are the most prevalent crimes reported. The following data are provided in compliance with the Federal Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-542), and similar California legislation (AB 3918 and 1094). Additional data, along with required campus policy and program information, are published annually in September by the UCI Police Department in the Crime Awareness Bulletin, which is distributed to new and continuing stu\u00ad dents, as well as to faculty and staff, at both the campus and the Medical Center. When a serious threat to the UCI community exists, informational crime bulletins are posted and circulated. SAFETY TIPS Day and night, no matter where students go, they should be aware of their surroundings, should exercise good common sense, and should use safety precautions as they would elsewhere. UCI provides a Campus Escort Ser\u00ad vice, which is available by contacting the UCI Police Department at (949) 824-5223. Theft is the most common security problem. Students living on campus should keep their doors locked at all times. In offices, valuables should be kept locked up. Doors to laboratories and buildings should be locked by the last person to leave. The presence of unknown visitors should be reported to the UCI Police Department. Vehicles (including bicycles) should be locked when parked. TO REPORT AN INCIDENT On campus, dial 9-1-1 for a police, medical, or fire emergency, or should use the emergency call boxes (identified by the blue light on the box) located around the ring mall, in parking structures, and in other parking areas. At the Medical Center, dial (714) 456-6123 for a police emergency or (714) 456-6234 to report a fire or medical situation. UCI police officers are duly sworn State peace officers. They are armed and possess the same legal authority as do the municipal and county police agen\u00ad cies. They enforce the law, arrest violators, investigate accidents, and provide a full range of police-related services, including immediate response to med\u00ad ical aid situations and fire emergencies. POLICIES ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WEAPONS UCI is designated a drug-free environment, and only under certain conditions is the consumption of alcohol permitted. State laws and University policies are enforced, and violators are subject to disciplinary action, criminal prose\u00ad cution, fine, and imprisonment. Section 626.9 of the California Penal Code makes it a felony to bring or to possess a firearm on the grounds, or within buildings (including private resi\u00ad dences), of the University of California.
