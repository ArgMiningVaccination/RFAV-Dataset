In the context of the recent hepatis outbreaks related to the cons umption of dietary turmeric supplements, this paper reviews the hepatotoxicity of turmeric and provides a UK exposure assessment in relation to the ADI for curcumin (the active ingredient). Brief h istory of recent hepatitis outbreaks 2. Between December 2018 and 2 0th July 2019, a total of 21 individual cases of acute cholestatic hepatitis \"likely to be linked to the consumption of food supplements based on curcumin and piperine\" were reported on Italian territory 1. A total of 18 turmeric supplements have been associated with this hepatitis outbreak , one of which ( \"Curcuma Liposomal & black pepper\" by Nutrimea ) was recalled by Belgium's Federal Agency for Food Chain Safety (AFSCA) 2. 3. Whilst the AFSCA said that \"the exact source of contamination had not yet been established \" 2, an update from Italy's National Institute of Health does not appear to mention contamination of the curcumin supply as a cause for the hepatitis 1. The Institute said \"the interdisciplinary group, section dietetics, and the technic al committee for animal nutrition and health concluded that, to date, the causes are likely to be related to individual susceptibility, pre -existing alterations, latent hepato - biliary function or even the use of drugs\" . The Institute adopted a warning for the labelling of the supplements in question (to take effect from 31st December 2019), advising against their use for subjects with altered hepato -biliary function, and recommending medical advice when other medications are being taken. The Institute adds that for turmeric powder, which was implicated in one hepatitis case, no particular recommendations are needed especially considering its history of consumption as a food . 4. Contamination of turmeric supplements has been of health concern in the past. For example, the FSA recently received an enquiry where a family had been consuming raw turmeric (grown on lead -rich Indian soil ) for over a year ; following a blood test, the enquirer tested positive for lead. Furthermore , in March 2009, a brand of turmeric -based supplement s called Fortodol (also sold as Leppin Miradin) was associated with 11 liver -related adverse event reports in Sweden and a further five in Norway, including deaths. The supplement was found to contain nimesulide, a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug known to cause liver problems 3. Turmeric powder can be adulterated wit h powders of other species of Curcuma (Reyma et al. zedoaria , a common adulterant in turmeric powder, is known to be toxic; the high -protein flour of C. zedoaria caused 100 % mortality within 6 days when given at 320 g/kg diet to 5 week -old rats (Latif et al. 1979). The identity of questionable samples of turmeric powders can be examined under light and/ or scanning electron microscop y in comparison with authentic samples (Li et al. 2011), in addition to DNA based techniques (Remya et al. 2004). Background of turmeric supplements 5. Turmeric is the common name for the rhizome ( under ground stem ) of Curcuma longa L., a perennial herb cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world . India is the largest producer of turmeric, supplying over 90 % of the world's demand (Olojede et al. 2009). There are about 70 varieties of C. longa cultivated in India (Sasikumar 2005). For centuries, turmeric has been widely used for imparting colour and flavour to food , and in Indian and Chinese traditional medicin e as a remedy for the treatment of inflammation and other diseases (Ammon & Wahl 1991). Its antioxidant, anti -inflammatory, antimutagenic, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties have been reviewed by & Kalman 2017. 6. Many of the pharmacological propert ies of turmeric have been attributed to curcumin , hereafter referred to as diferuloylmethane . al. 2015). is a polyphenol compound naturally present within turmeric rhizomes. Its derivatives demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin are also present within turmeric rhizomes . These co mpounds are collectively called \"curcuminoids \" and their chemical structures are presented in Figure 1. 7. The relative proportions and total concentration of curcuminoids within turmeric rhizomes vary depending on the variety grown and the conditions of cultivation (Li et al. 2011) (Table 1) . Figure 1: Chemical structures of the principal curcuminoids present in turmeric . The principle colouring component is diferuloylmethane (also known as curcumin, R1 = MW = 368.4 g/mol ). Derivatives of diferuloylmethane also present which include de methoxycurcumin (R1 = OCH3, R2 = H g/mol ) and b isdemethoxycurcumin = H ; MW = 308.3 g/mol). 3 Table 1: Percentage composition of curcuminoids in turmeric powd ers and oleoresin extracts ( adapted from Li et al. 2011). Curcuminoid Composition in t urmeric powders (mean) (% dry weight) Composition in t urmeric oleoresin extract s (mean \u00b1 s.d.) be extracted from ground turmeric powder using organic solvents to create a turmeric oleoresin extract (Table 2) . JECFA (1992) lists several solvents permitted for extraction: acetone, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol . The European Commission, however, has a different list of permitted solvents: acetone, carbon dioxide, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, n -butanol, methano l, ethanol, and hexane (EC 2008 ). According to JECFA specifications, residual solvent concentrations in turmeric oleoresin intended for use in food are limited to 25 mg/kg for hexane, 30 mg/kg for acetone, dichloromethane, and 1,2 and 50 mg/kg for ethanol, methanol, and isopropanol (JECFA 1992). The extraction methodology used affects the curcuminoid content (37-55 %) (Li et al. 2011 ), and the essential oil content (< 25%) (Braga et al. 2003) of the turmeric oleoresin (Table 2). Table 2: Preparation and composition of turmeric products that are commercially available as dietary supplements (adapted from Li et al. 2011). Commercial p roduct name Preparation Composition Turmeric powder Prepared from dried rhizomes of C. longa 0.58-3.14 diferuloylmethane (dry other curcuminoids oleoresin extract turmeric powder with organic solvents 37-55 % curcuminoids , < 25 % essential oil Turmeric oil extract Treat turmeric powder with steam distillation or supercritical CO 2 extraction Essential oil from leaves usually dominated by monoterpenes whil st oil from rhizomes > 90 % curcuminoids , and minor amounts of essential oil 9. Whilst curcuminoids are responsible for the yellow -orange colour of turmeric, it is the volatile sesquiterpenes present in the rhizome's essential oil that are responsible for its aroma and taste (Li et al. 2011). The major sesquiterpenes in turmeric oil extract are -, -, and Ar-turmerone (Li et al. 2011) , which can together account for > 40 % of the essential oil present in turmeric rhizomes (Stanojevi et al. 4 2015). Turmerone possesses diverse activities that includ e antioxidant and antimutagenic activities (Jayaprakasha et al. 2002). Turmeric oil extract can be prepared in various ways, for example through the treatment of turmeric powder with steam distillation , supercritical CO 2 extraction (Li et al. 2011), or by evaporating t he organic solvent of a crude turmeric oleoresin extract (Funk et al. 2010) (Table 2). 10. Diferuloylmethane powder can be obtained through the purification of turmeric oleoresin by crystallisation (Li et al. 2011). However, t here can be limited commercial availability of authentic samples of pure diferuloylmethane, since its separation from demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin can be difficult and time consuming. Thus, commercial \"pure\" diferuloylmethane is, in many cases, a mixtur e of at least these three curcuminoids (Li et al. 2011). F or example , a sample of commercial \"pure\" diferuloylmethane (labelled as 94 % purity ) was, after HPLC analysis, found to be of about 70 % purity (Li et al. 2011) . In addition, t he composition of a s ample of commercial \"curcumin\" was found to be approximately 71.5 % diferuloylmethane, 19.4 % demethoxycurcumin, and 9.1 % bisdemethoxycurcumin (Pfeiffer et al. 2003). 11. \"Curcumin\" powder is authorised for use as a colouring agent in food (E 100), where its purity is specified as \"not less than 90 % total colouring matters\" (i.e. ) stated that \"purified extracts of turmeric containing more than 90 % total colourin g matter are subject to specifications for 'Curcumin'\"(JECFA 1992 ). EFSA (2010) noted that the specification should be updated to define the composition of the remaining 10 %, which may be accounted for by minor amounts of turmeric essential oil. Directive 94/36/EC states the maximum permitted levels (MPLs) for E100 in foodstuffs (which range from 20 to 500 mg/kg depending on the food item) and beverages ( which range from 100-200 mg/L) (EC 1994). 12. The FSA's Novel Foods Team consider turmeric food supplements comprising of turmeric oleoresin extract or pure curcumin powder to be novel. These products were not significantly used as a food or food ingredient before 15th of May 1997. Therefore, before t hese products may be placed on the market in the EU as a food supplement, a safety assessment under the Novel Food Regulation is required. Unauthorised foods may be removed from the market for example if adverse health effects are indicated. Health -based guidance values 13. In 1975, the SCF evaluated curcumin. No ADI was set by SCF as they considered that curcumin (from natural foods) could be classified as colour for which an ADI could not be established but which is nevertheless acceptable for use in food. 14. In 1995, JECFA evaluated the results of toxicology and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice administered turmeric oleoresin containing 79 -85 % curcuminoids (NTP 1993). After 15 months of treatment, absolute and relative liver weights were increased in both male and female mice in the mid - and highest -dose groups relative to controls. The NOEL for liver enlargement was 2000 mg/kg in the diet, equal to 220 mg/kg bw/ day. On the basis of the NOEL of 220 mg/kg bw/day in the carcinogenicity study of mice an d a safety factor of 200, JECFA increased the 5 temporary ADI to 0 -1 mg/ kg bw and extended it, pending the submission of the results of a reproductive toxicity study with curcumin (JECFA 1995). 15. In 2004, JECFA noted that the turmeric oleoresin used in the NTP (1993) study did not comply with the current specification for curcumin . JECFA withdrew the temporary ADI and established an ADI for curcumin of 0 -3 mg/kg bw based on significant decreases in the average bodyweights of Wistar rat F2 generation pups (paragraph 37) (JECFA 2004). 16. In 2010, EFSA concluded that the present database supports an ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day, also based on significant decreases in the average bodyweights of Wistar rat F2 generation pups (EFSA 2010). ADME 17. Following an oral administration of 1 g/kg bw \"curcumin\" to rats, up to about 75 % of the curcumin was excreted in the faeces, whil st negligible amounts of curcumin appeared in the urine (Wahlstrom & Blennow 1978). The study authors concluded that measurem ents of blood plasma levels and biliary excretion showed that curcumin itself was poorly absorbed from the gut. Oral bioavailability is similarly low in humans (paragraphs 38-40), due to poor absorption and extensive first -pass metabolism in the intestine and liver (Ireson et al. 2001, 2002). For example, i n 12 cancer patients receiving 450 -3600 mg of diferuloylmethane daily for 1 week prior to surgery, low levels (near the detection limit of 3 nM) of diferuloylmethane and its glucuronide and sulphate conju gates were found in samples of peripheral or portal blood taken intraoperatively ; these compounds were not found in the bile or liver tissue in any of the patients (Garcea et al. 2004) . 18. The enzymatic hydrolysis of plasma samples taken from rats orally administered curcuminoids showed that the predominant metabolites in plasma were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of & Miyazawa 2000). Ravindranath & Chandrasekhara (1981 ) evaluated the tissue distribution of \"curcumin\" using tritium -labelled drug in male Wistar rats. They found that radioactivity was detectable in blood, liver, and kidney following doses of 10, 80, or 400 mg of [3H]curcumin. With 400 mg, considerabl e amounts of radiolabelled products were present in tissues 12 days after dosing. The percentage of curcumin absorbed (60 -66 % of the given dose) remained constant regardless of the dose indicating that administration of more curcumin does not result in hi gher absorption. Shoba et al. (1998) orally administered 2 g/kg bw \"curcumin\" to rats and reported the absorption and elimination half -lives to be 0.31 \u00b1 0.07 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.5 hours, respectively. In humans, however, the same dose of curcumin did not allow the calculation of these half -life values because the serum curcumin levels were below the detection limit at most of the time points in most of the experimental subjects. Exposure assessment Human e xposure throug h the diet 19. EFSA estimated dietary e xposure to diferuloylmethane in children and adults using national consumption data with maximum permitted levels (MPLs) specified in 6 Directive 94/36/EC (EC 1994) (tier 2 approach) , and maximum reported use levels (tier 3 approach) . Estimates of dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane obtained from these approaches are presented in Table 3 . 20. For adults (> 18 years old) , the EFSA Panel estimated the exposure based on the UK consumption survey as the UK population is conside red to be one of the highest consumers of soft drinks in Europe and individual food consumption data (UK NDNS, 2000 -2001) are available (Tennant 2006 , 2007). For children (1 -10 years old), the Panel estimated e xposure based on dietary exposure assessments for children in Europe (EXPOCHI) project . The EXPOCHI project details individual food consumption data from eleven European countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Greece and Germany) . As the UK i s not included in the EXPOCHI consortium, estimates for UK children (1.5 - 4.5 years old) were made by the Panel with the use of individual food consumption data (UK NDNS, 1992 -1993) (Tennant 2006 , 2007). Table 3: Estimates of dietary exposure to curcumin in the UK adult population and in children from the EXPOCHI study and UK. UK a dult exposure (> 18 years old) to curcumin (mg/kg bw/day) Children (UK & to curcumin (mg/kg bw/day) Maximum permitted level (tier 2): Mean exposure 0.9 0.5-3.8 Exposure 97.5th %ile 3.3 1.2-7.2 Maximum reported use levels (tier 3) : Mean exposure 0.8 (1.0 *) 0.5-3.4 (0.7 -3.6 *) Exposure 97.5th %ile 2.0 (2.6 *) 1.1-7.1 (1.6 -7.6 *) * Includes dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane from turmeric powder added to food as a spice and curry powder (see Table 4 ). 21. In tier 2, the main contributor to curcumin exposure from the UK adult diet was non-alcoholic flavoured drinks (46 %). The main contributors to the estimates of mean curcumin exposure for UK children (and children considered by the EXPOCHI consortium) were non -alcoholic beverages (13 -55 %), fine bakery wares (e.g. biscuits, cakes, wafer) (12 -43 %), desserts, including flavoured mil k products (12 -45 %), and sauces, seasonings, pickles, relishes, chutney and piccalilli (11 -42 %). 22. In tier 3, the main contributor to curcumin exposure from the UK adult diet was non-alcoholic flavoured drinks (50 %). The main contributors to the estimate s of mean curcumin exposure for UK children (and children considered by the EXPOCHI consortium) were fine bakery wares (e.g. biscuits, cakes, wafer) (13 -47 %), desserts (including flavoured milk products) (13 -52 %), non -alcoholic beverages (15 -57 %) and sa uces and seasonings (11 -45 %). 23. The exposure assessment in tier 3 does not take into account the use of turmeric as a spice in cooking . The addition of turmeric spice in cooking was 7 estimated to contribute to the dietary exposure of diferuloylmethane by the EFSA panel (Table 4) . Table 4: Estimates of dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane from ingestion of spice added to food and curry powder in adults in children. Adult (18 -64 years old) diferuloylmethane exposure (mg/kg bw/day) Children (5 -12 years old) diferuloylmethane exposure (mg/kg bw/day) Exposure from spice added to food * Mean 0.1 (n = 66) 0.1 (n = 7) 97.5th %ile 0.3 (n = 66) 0.2 (n = 7) Exposure from curry powder added to food * Mean 0.1 (n = 91) 0.1 (n = 21) 97.5th %ile 0.3 (n = 91) 0.3 (n = 21) * The use of turmeric as a spice added to foods and used in home -made recipes was assessed using data from Irish adults (1379 adults , aged 18 -64 years) and children (594 children , aged 5 -12 years) (Harrington et al. 2001, IUNA 2005). The dietary intake of curry powder was also considered, as turmeric powder is a widespread ingredient in it (approximately 30 % depending on the blend). Human e xposure through turmeric supplements 24. In addition to exposure to diferuloylmethane through a normal diet, turmeric supplements ca n also be taken . Ground turmeric powder, turmeric oleoresin extract and diferuloylmethane powder are the compositions of turmeric that contain diferuloylmethane and which can be taken as suppl ements . A selection of these supplements (which can be readily purchased on the internet ) are presented in Table 5, where the contribution of daily supplemental intake of diferuloylmethane to the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/ day is calculated, with and without dieta ry diferuloylmethane. Of th e supplements presented in Table 5 , those containing ground turmeric powder do not exceed the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day for diferuloylmethane, either alone or with dietary intake of diferuloylmethane. Conversely, supplements comprisi ng of turmeric oleoresin extract generally do lead to an exceedance of the ADI . 25. Different approaches have been taken to increase the in vivo bioavailability of diferuloylmethane when taken as a dietary supplement. These approaches include modified formulations (e.g. NovaSOL\u00ae and Longvida\u00ae) and the use of additives (e.g. BioPerine\u00ae): NovaSOL\u00ae curcumin consists of micellar curcumin, which has be en shown to increase bioavailability of curcumin in humans by 185 % (Schiborr et al. 2014). Longvida\u00ae Optimised Curcumin consists of solid lipid curcumin particles (SLCP). In healthy human subjects, the mean peak concentration of diferuloylmethane achieve d from dosing 650 mg of SLCP was 22 ng/mL, whereas plasma curcumin from dosing an equal quantity of unformulated 95 % curcuminoid extract was not detected (limit of detection 1 ng/mL) (Gota et al. 2010). 8 BioPerine\u00ae consists of piperine (an alkaloid derived from black pepper which is a known inhibitor of hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation). Concomitant oral administration of piperine has been shown to enhance the bioavailability of diferuloylmethane in humans by 2000 % (Shoba et al. 1998).

Review of hepatotoxicity of diferuloylmethane Acute oral toxicity 26. In mice, oral LD50 values of 2 g/kg bw (unspecified % purity diferuloylmethane in extract) (Srimal 1973) and > 10 g/kg bw ( turmeric extract estimated to contain about 79 % diferuloylmethane ) were reported (Lilja et al. 1983) . 27. In rats, oral LD 50 values of 5 g/kg bw (\"curcumin\" suspended in arachis oil, purity not reported Blennow 1978) and > 10 g/kg bw ( turmeric extract estimated to contain about 79 % diferuloylmethane ) were reported (Lilja et al. 1983) . 28. Liju et al. (2013) investigated the acute and subchronic toxicity of turmeric essential oil (TEO) from Curcuma longa L. Acute administration of TEO was done as a single oral dose of up to 5 g /kg bw, and a 13-week subchronic toxicity study was done at doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg bw /day in Wistar rats. There were no mortalit ies, adverse clinical signs or changes in body weight , water and food extract, BioPerine\u00ae 1 tablet containing 475 mg curcuminoids 3.9 129.6 163.3 High Potency Turmeric (Ancient Wisdom Modern Medicine ) Turmeric 7.8 259.2 293.3 10,000 extract, BioPerine\u00ae extract, 475 mg curcuminoids 7.8 259.2 293.3 Curcumin (Turmeric) with Black Pepper - Powder Capsules (Supplement Place ) Turmeric extract, black pepper extract 2 capsules, each containing 750 mg curcuminoids 12.3 409.3 443.3 Turmeric + extract, BioPerine\u00ae 13.6 452.4 486.7 Turmeric Curcumin Advanced Complex (Piping Rock Health Products ) Turmeric extract, black pepper extract 2-4 capsules, each serving of 2 capsules containing 1425 mg curcuminoids 23.5 783.1 816.7 10 consumption during the acute and subchronic studies. Indicators of hepatic function such as aspartate alanine amino transferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were unchanged in treated animals compared to untreated animals. Oral administration of TEO for 13 weeks did not alter total cholesterol, triglycerides, markers of renal function, serum electrolyte parameters and histopathology of tissue s. Subacute toxicity 29. Dietary turmeric powder (0.2 %, 1.0 %, 5.0 %, equivalent to 400, 2000, 10000 mg/kg bw/day) or ethanolic turmeric extract (ETE, 0.05 %, 0.25 %, equivalent to 1 00, 500 mg/kg bw/day ) for 14 days, at doses reported to be cancer preventive in model systems, were found to be hepatotoxic in mice. The diferuloylmethane content s of the turmeric powder and ETE w ere not reported. Exposure of mice to dietary turmeric or ETE did not have any significant effect on body weight/ liver weight or liver to body weight ratios. Animals exposed to 0.2 % turmeric showed coagulative necrosis in liver. Liver s from mice receiving 1.0 % and 5.0 % turmeric showed extreme degenerative changes with necrosis. Coagulative necrotic foci surrounded by a zone o f regenerations were also evident. Similar changes were also seen in animals treated with 0.05 % and 0.25 % ETE. Necrotic changes in liver, the principal effect, was seen in 6/6 animals from 5.0 % turmeric, 3/6 from 1.0 % turmeric and 3/6 animals from 0.2 % turmeric. Similarly 3/6 animals from 0.05 % as well as 0.25 % ETE also showed these alterations. Liver from mice receiving control diet showed normal ultrastructure. In liver of the animals receiving 5.0 % or 1.0 % turmeric diet or 0.25 % or 0.05 % ETE, some of the parenchymal cells had round nuclei consisting of clumped or densely marginated chromatin. The cytoplasm consisted of numerous pleomorphic vacuolated mitochondria filled with dense bodies, surrounded by rough or smooth endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes, and an increased number of glycogen particles and Golgi complexes with vesicles. (Kandarkar et al. 1998). Subchronic toxicity Mice 30. Subchronic oral toxicity of turmeric and ethanolic turmeric extract (ETE) was studied in female Swiss mice and Wistar rats fed turmeric powder (0, 1 and 5 %) and ethanolic turmeric extract (0, 0.05 and 0.25 %) through the diet for 14 and/or 90 days. The curcuminoid content of the ETE was approximately 98%. The administration of a high dose of turmeric (5 % ) for longer duration (90 days) showed a significant reduction in body weight gain, alterations in absolute and/ or relative liver weights, and hepatotoxicity i.e. focal necrosis or focal necrosis with regeneration both in mice and rats. In mice, lower dos es of turmeric (i.e. 0.2 or 1 % for 14 days ) also showed hepatotoxicity and they were found to be more vulnerable to turmeric -induced hepatotoxicity than rats. (Deshpande et al. 1998). 31. In a 13 week study, groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F 1 mice were f ed diets containing 0, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin , which were estimated to deliver average daily doses of 150, 750, 1700, 3850, or 7700 mg /kg bw to males and 200, 1000 , 1800, 4700 or 9300 mg /kg bw to females (NTP 1993) . The major component of the oleoresin was identified as 11 diferuloylmethane (79 to 85 %). The percent composition was monitored periodically at the study laboratory with free -acid titration and high -performance liquid chromatography methods, and no change in com position was observed. There were no deaths attributed to turmeric oleoresin and the final mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of all exposed groups of male and female mice were similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed m ale and female mice was similar to that by the controls. Absolute and relative liver weights of male mice that received 5000 ppm and male and female mice that received 10000, 25000 and 50000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls. Clinic al findings in mice included stained fur, and discoloured faeces and urine. According to NTP, t here were no biologically significant differences in hematologic, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters, and there were no chemical related histopathologi c lesions . EFSA (2010) concluded that the no -effect level with respect to gross and microscopic pathological changes was 7700 and 9280 mg/kg bw/day in males and females, respectively, which were the highest doses tested. Rats 32. In a 28 day study, diferuloylmethane (purity > 98 %) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats through the diet at dose levels of 26.1, 84.8, 224,8, 459.7 and 1117.8 mg/kg bw/day. Clinical chemistry did not reveal major signs of liver damage associated with administration of diferuloylmethane . cDNA microarray experiments were performed on hepatic RNA. Diferuloylmethane altered the expression of 12 genes. Three of these were related to peroxisomes was observed. The authors concluded that these data suggest that diferuloylmethane is a weak peroxisome proliferator in rats. (Stierum et al. 2008). 33. In a 13 week study, groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 0, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin (79 to 85 % diferuloylmethane ), estimated to deliver average daily doses of 50, 250, 480, 1300, or 2600 mg/kg bw to males and 60, 300, 550, 1450, or 2800 mg/kg bw to females. All rats survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weight of males receiving 50000 ppm was 5 % lower than that of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed male and female rats was s imilar to that of controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of female rats and the relative liver weights of male rats receiving 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls. According to NTP, t hese increa ses may have been due to mild hepatocellular swelling or hypertrophy . In the clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and other hematologic parameters, no differences were observed that were considered by the NTP to be biologically significant. Clinical findings in cluded stained fur, and discoloured faeces and urine of exposed animals . Mild to moderate h yperplasia of the mucosal epithelium was observed in the cecum and colon of male and female rats that received 50000 ppm. (NTP 1993) . 34. A six month toxicity study of curcuminoids extracted from the powdered dried rhizome of Curcuma longa was performed in six groups of 15 Wistar rats of each sex. The extract was reported to contain 58 -67 % curcuminoids. The water control group received 5 ml of water/k g bw/day, while the tragacanth control group received 5 ml of 0.5 % tragacanth suspension/ kg bw/day orally. Three treatment groups were 12 given the suspension of curcuminoids powder at doses of 10, 50 and 250 mg/kg bw/day. The fourth treatment group, or the recovery group, also received 250 mg/kg bw/day of curcuminoids for six months, but two weeks of no curcuminoids treatment elapsed before the time of sacrifice. It was found that the growth rate of male rats receiving curcuminoids at 50 mg/kg bw/day was si gnificantly higher than that of the tragacanth control group. Curcuminoids did not produce any significant dose -related changes of haematological parameters. In the group of male animals receiving 250 mg/kg bw/day of curcuminoids, actual and relative liver weights and the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher than those of the two controls, but the ALP level was still within a normal range. There appeared to be a higher incidence of mild degree of liver fatty degeneration and adrenoc ortical fatty degeneration in this group of animals, however the incidence was not significantly different from that of the two controls. The authors concluded that at higher doses, curcumin may affect the function and morphology of the liver in a reversib le manner. The EFSA Panel concluded that due to the lack of knowledge on the diferuloylmethane content and nature of the extract tested, the study could not be used to assess the safety of diferuloylmethane . (Chavalittumrong et al. 2002). Chronic toxicity 2-year study in rats 35. Groups of 60 male and 60 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 2000, 10000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin (79 to 85 % diferuloylmethane ) for 104 (males) or 103 (females) weeks, which were estimated to deliver average daily doses of 80, 460, or 2000 mg/kg bw to males and 90, 440,or 2400 mg/kg bw to females. Nine or 10 rats from each exposure group were evaluated after 15 months. Survival of exposed male and female rats was similar to that of the controls (male: 0 mean body weights of all exposed male rats and female rats receiving 2000 and 10000 ppm were similar to those of the controls. The final mean body weights o f male and female rats that received 50000 ppm were slightly lower ( up to 10 %) than those of the controls throughout much of the study. Feed consumption by exposed male and female rats was similar to that by controls throughout the study. The absolute and relative liver weights of female rats receiving 10000 or 50000 ppm were significantly greater than those of controls at the 15 - month interim evaluation. There were no clinical findings related to toxicity. In male and female rats receiving 50000 ppm the haematocrit values, haemoglobin concentrations and erythrocyte counts at the 15 -month interim evaluation were significantly lower than those in the controls. In addition, platelet counts in male and female rats that received 50000 ppm and reticulocyte counts in male rats that received 50000 ppm were significantly higher than those in the controls. No biologically significant differe nces were observed in clinical chemistry parameters. (NTP 1993). 2-year study in mice 36. Groups of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F 1 mice were fed diets containing 2000, 10000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin (79 to 85 % diferuloylmethane ) for 103 weeks, which w ere estimated to deliver average daily doses of 220, 520, or 13 6000 mg/kg bw to males and 320, 1620, or 8400 mg/kg bw to females (NTP 1993) . Nine or 10 mice from each exposure group were evaluated after 15 months. Survival of exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls (male: 0 of female mice receiving 50000 ppm was slightly lower (up to 12 %) than that of the controls from about week 25. The final mean body weights of males that received 50000 ppm and females that received 10000 and 50000 ppm were significantly lower than those of controls. The final mean body weights of other exposed groups of male and female mice wer e similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed male and female mice was similar to that by the controls throughout the study. The absolute and relative liver weights of male and female mice receiving 10000 and 50000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls at the 15 -month interim evaluation. There were no clinical findings related to toxicity . No biologically significant differences were observed in hematologic parameters. The alkaline phosphatase values of male and female mice that received 10000 and 50000 ppm were significantly higher than those of controls at the 15 -month interim evaluation . The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in male and female mice receiving 10000 ppm, but not those in mice receiving 2000 or 50000 female mice in the 10000 and 50000 ppm groups with multiple hepatocellular neoplasms compared with controls was of statistical significa nce. However, JECFA concluded that th is effect w as not dose -related and that curcumin is not a carcinogen (JECFA 1995 ). In addition, the EFSA Panel noted that all statistically significant effects noted by the NTP refer to benign neoplastic lesions (adenomas) (EFSA 2010) . The EFSA Panel noted that the effects observed were not dose -dependent, were in line with historical control values and were not consistent across sexes and/or species. The Panel noted moreover that hepatocellular tumours occurring in untreated and treated B6C3F 1 mice are not relevant for humans. Therefore the Panel agree d with JECFA that curcumin is not carcinogenic. Reproductive toxicity 37. In a multigeneration study of reproductive toxicity, Wistar rats were fed diets containing diferuloylmethane (> 90 % purity ) at doses equal to 0, 130 -140, 250 -290 and 850 -960 mg/kg bw/day in males, 0, 160, 310 -320 and 1000 -1100 mg/kg bw/day in females (Ganiger et al. 2007). The total period of treatment was 21 weeks for the parental generation and 24 weeks for the F1 generation. No treatment -related clinical signs of toxicity during the study were reported. Significant decreases in the average weights of the F2 generation pups were observed at days 1 and 7 at the intermediate dose, and days 7, 14 and 21 at the high dose. These de creases represented < 10 % of the average weight of the concurrent controls and were reported to be within the range of the historical control data . There were no other effects on general health, body weight, pup survival or fertility indices in either generation. JECFA considered the effect on pup weight seen at the intermediate dose (equal to 250 -320 mg/kg bw/day) to be incidental and therefore a NOEL. JECFA allocated an ADI for curcumin of 0-3 mg/kg bw /day based on the application of an uncertainty factor of 100 to this NOEL (JECFA 2004). 14 Human studies 38. Twenty -five patients with conditions indicating a high risk of malignancy were administered diferuloylmethane (purity 99.3 %) in tablet form for 3 months. The starting dose was 500 mg/day, which was increased stepwise to 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and finally 12000 mg/day (equivalent to 7, 14, 29, 57, 114, and 171 mg/kg bw/day). The patients received regular follow -up, including physical examination, weekly haemogram, and \"biweekly\" blood electrolytes and biochemistry study (though blood results not presented) . No adverse effects were reported at doses up to 8000 mg/day. The highest dose of 12000 mg/day was not acceptable to the patients because of the bulky volume of the tablets. The serum concentration of curcumin usually peaked at 1 to 2 hours after oral int ake of diferuloylmethane and gradually declined within 12 hours. The average peak serum concentrations after taking 4000 mg, 6000 mg and 8000 mg of diferu loylmethane was undetectable. The study authors noted that these results suggest that diferuloylmethane is not adequately absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. (Cheng et al. 2001). 39. Fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer received an extract of Curcuma (18 mg of diferuloylmethane and 2 mg of demethoxycurcumin suspended in 200 mg of essential oils derived from Curcuma spp.) daily for up to 4 months. The doses were equivalent to 36, 72, 108, 144 and 180 mg diferuloylmethane /day (equivalent to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.6 mg/kg bw/day) , with three patients receiving each dose. or its metabolites (glucuronide or sulphate conjugates, or or hexahydrocurcuminol) were detected in plasma or urine . However, diferuloylmethane was detected in the faeces of all patients. Diferuloylmethane sulphate was also detected in the faeces of one of the patients receiving diferuloylmethane at a dose of 180 mg diferuloylmethane /day, which may have been a result of biotransformation in the gut . Thus, the study authors concluded that diferuloylmethane has low oral bioavailability in humans and may undergo intestinal metabolism. Oral Curcuma extract was well toler ated however , in the course of the study, one patient (receiving 108 mg diferuloylmethane/day) experienced nausea and two patients (receiving 72 and 180 mg diferuloylmethane /day) experienced diarrhoea. D ose-limiting toxicity was not observed (full blood c ell count and urea, electrolytes, liver, and bone function were measured in venous samples). (Sharma et al. 2001). 40. In a subsequent phase I study, Sharma et al. (2004) evaluated another formulation, which was a 500 mg curcuminoid capsule containing 450 mg diferuloylmethane , 40 mg demethoxycurcumin, and 10 mg bisdemethoxycurcumin. The dose levels of diferuloylmethane were 450, 900, 1800, or 3600 mg /day for up to 4 months (equivalent to 6, 13, 26, and 51 mg/kg bw/day) . A total of 15 patients with refractory c olorectal cancer were enrolled. Full blood cell count and urea, electrolytes, liver, and bone function were measured in venous samples, and physical examination was performed, before treatment and on treatment days 1, 2, 8, 29, and monthly thereafter. The drug was well tolerated, however one patient consuming 450 mg diferuloylmethane daily and one patient consuming 3600 mg diferuloylmethane daily developed diarrhoea 1 month and 4 months into treatment, respectively. One patient consuming 900 mg diferuloylme thane daily experienced 15 nausea, which resolved spontaneously despite continuation of treatment. In addition, a rise in serum alkaline phosphatase level was observed in 4 patients, and serum lactate dehydrogenase rose to > 150 % of pre -treatment values in 3 patients. Diferuloylmethane was detected in plasma and urine samples from patients consuming 3600 mg of diferuloylmethane daily, but not from patients on the lower doses. Diferuloylmethane was detected in plasma samples taken 1 hour post -dose from 3 patie nts consuming 3600 mg of diferuloylmethane daily at a concentration of 11.1 \u00b1 0.6 nmol/L. Analysis of urine suggested the presence of diferuloylmethane (0.1 - 1.3 \u00b5mol/L) and its sulfate (19 - 45 nmol/L) and glucuronide (210 - 510 nmol/L) conjugates in all of the samples from patients consuming 3600 mg of diferuloylmethane daily. Diferuloylmethane was not detected in plasma or urine from patients who received lower doses of diferuloylmethane . Abundant amounts of diferuloylmethane were recov ered from the faeces at all of the dose levels. Diferuloylmethane levels in day 8 faecal samples from patients consuming 3600 mg of diferuloylmethane daily were between 25 and 116 nmol/g dried faeces . 41. A dose escalation study was performed with 24 healthy human volunteers using single doses of between 500 -12000 mg of a turmeric extract (containing a minimum of 95 % of diferuloylmethane (75 %) , bisdemethoxycurcumin (2 %) , and to 7 -171 mg/kg bw ). Seven volunteers experienced minimal toxicity at doses > 1 4 mg/kg bw (diarrhoea, headache, rash and/or yellow stool) that did not appear to be dose -related . The remaining volunteers did not experience adverse effects (Lao et al. 2006). 42. Nine healthy volunteers b etween 20 and 33 years of age were tested for haemoglobin, blood counts, liver and kidney functions, bleeding and clotting time and serum electrolytes initially and at 1 and 3 months of treatment. They were administered 0.6 ml of turmeric oil extract (TO; 59 % turmerone and Ar-turmerone ) three times a day for 1 month and 1 ml in 3 divided doses for 2 months. One volunteer discontinued on day three for allergic skin rashes which, on discontinuation of TO, gradually disappeared by two weeks. Another discontin ued on the day seven for intercurrent fever requiring antibiotic treatment. Seven volunteers completed the study. There was no effect of TO intake on weight, blood pressure, symptoms and signs up to 12 weeks. There was no clinical, haematological, renal or hepat otoxicity of TO at 1 month and 3 months. Serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, albumin, direct and indirect bilirubin were normal initially and remained within normal limits during treatment. One volunteer showed normal serum triglycerides and low -density lipoprotein (LDL) initially and at 4 weeks but elevated levels at 12 weeks. This volunteer was followed up for 1 month after discontinuation of TO and serum lipids return ed to normal. (Joshi et al. 2003). 43. Kanai et al. (2011 ) evaluated the safety and feas ibility of combination therapy using \"curcumin \" with gemcitabine -based chemotherapy. The \"curcumin\" used was a mixture of diferuloylmethane (73 %), demethoxycurcumin (22 %), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (4 %), provided in microbead form. Gemcitabine -resistant patients with pancreatic cancer received 8 g oral curcumin daily (equivalent to 114 mg/kg bw) in combination with gemcitabine -based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was safety for phase I and feasibility of oral curcumin for phase II study. Twenty -one pa tients were enrolled. No dose -limiting toxicities were observed in the phase I study and oral curcumin 8 g/day was selected as the recommended dose for 16 the phase II study. No patients were withdrawn from this study because of the intolerability of curcumin , which met the primary endpoint of the phase II study, and the median compliance rate of oral curcumin was 100 % (range 79 -100 %). Plasma curcumin levels ranged from 29 to 412 ng/ml in five patients tested. Adverse effects were reported ( neutropenia , fatigue, drowsiness , anorexia, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, and oedema) all of which were also attributed to disease progression or gemcitabine -based chemotherapy, and considered to be irrelevant to curcumin. Kanai et al. (2011) concluded that co mbination therapy using 8 g oral curcumin daily with gemcitabine -based chemotherapy was safe and feasible in patients with pancreatic cancer and warrants further investigation into its efficacy. Clinical trials using turmeric preparations - EMA Summary 44. In September 2018, the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered several clinical studies with turmeric preparations involving patients with digestive disorders. Although a possible effect in improving symptoms was seen, firm conclusions could not be drawn due to limitations in the study design, for example only one study compared turmeric with a control group. However, the HMPC considered the effectiveness of these preparations for relief of mild digest ive problems to be plausible and there is evidence that they have been used safely in this way for at least 30 years (including at least 15 years within the European Union). Thus, the HMPC concluded that turmeric preparations (which cover turmeric ground p owders and extracts) can be used (only by adults) for relief of mild problems with digestion, such as feelings of fullness, slow digestion and flatulence. The EMA considered that side effects of dry mouth, flatulence and stomach irritation may occur. If sy mptoms continue for longer than two weeks or worsen while taking the medicine, a qualified healthcare practitioner should be consulted. Human case s of hepatotoxicity Case 1 (Melbourne, Australia ; Luber et al. 2019) 45. A 52 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a one -week history of nausea, pruritus, and painless jaundice with associated pale stools and dark urine. This occurred approximately one month following commencement of one tablet per day of Ancient Wisdom Moder n Medicine High Potency Turmeric (375 mg curcuminoids and 4 mg black pepper per tablet), along with a flaxseed oil supplement and occasional diclofenac use for arthritic pain. (N.b. this supplement leads to an intake of 204.6 % of the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day , see Table 5). She had no prior history of liver disease and had normal liver function tests (LFTs) three months before. Her medical history was notable only for oligoarticular osteoarthritis . 46. Upon admission, all oral medications and supplements were cea sed. She was found to have a bilirubin of 162 mol/L with a hepatocellular profile on liver function tests (ALT U/L, U/L, U/L). With progressive jaundice over the subsequent days she was referred to the emergency department, at which point her bilirubin peaked at 536 mol/L. 17 47. Due to lack of significant improvement by day four of admission , a liver biopsy was performed. Histology showed nonspecific inflammatory changes with generally preserved hepatic architecture and no fibrosis. She was discharged day 12 of admission (bilirubin 260 mol/L, ALT 1232 U/L) with the presumptive diagnosis of diclofenac induced liver injury . By two months after admission her liver function tests had normali sed (bilirubin 21 mol/L, ALT 3 3 U/L) and she was discharged from the clinic. 48. At this point she recommenced the turmeric supplement (1125 mg curcuminoids per day) as sole therapy for her arthritis. Three weeks later her nausea recurred and repeat liver function tests showed an acute h epatitis (ALT 2093 U/L, AST 1030 U/L, and bilirubin 60 mol/L). She was advised to cease the turmeric supplement, and two months later her liver function tests had again normali sed. 49. The turmeric supplements were sent for analysis by a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Results were compared to a toxicology library containing approximately 1400 compounds, including medications, illicit drugs, and over -the-counter medicines. A further sample was analy sed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the presence of trace elements. The turmeric supplement tested negative for drugs, adulterants, or toxic heavy metals. Case 2 (Melbourne, Australia; Luber et al. 2019) 50. A 55 year old man a t routine check -up was found to have an asymptomatic transaminitis. His background history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hypertension, gout, and osteoarthritis, with regular medications including long -term telmisartan, atenolol, and lercanidipine. He had no k nown liver history with normal liver function tests one year prior. His only new medication was commencement of a turmeric supplement five months prior to testing. 51. He was referred to a hepatologist and underwent a screen for causes of acute hepatitis. Abd ominal ultrasonography showed diffuse steatosis. A drug reaction was suspected, and the turmeric supplement was ceased. 52. Follow -ups occurred over the subsequent four months. Near normali sation of liver function tests occurred by one month (ALT 96 U/L, bili rubin 10 mol/L) with further improvement by four months after cessation (ALT 46 U/L, bilirubin 11 mol/L). The turmeric supplement was the presumed cause of the hepatitis. The turmeric supplement was not known, thus further analysis on it could not be p erformed. Case 3 ( New York, USA; Suhail et al. 2019) 53. A 61 year old female with polycystic liver disease presented with fatigue, dark urine and polyarthralgias for one week. She denied alcohol use. Physical examination demonstrated right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings were notable a direct component of 1 mg/dL. Hepatic synthetic functi on was intact. Medications included naproxen and ergocholecalciferol with no changes four years 18 prior to the onset of transaminitis. Viral infections were ruled out. Autoimmune work - up yielded positive antinuclear antibody (1:250) with normal anti -smooth m uscle antibody and serum IgG levels. Abdominal Doppler was negative for portal or hepatic vein thrombosis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not show any biliary ductal pathology. It was discovered that the patient was taking turmeric supplem ents for 6 months. A liver biopsy demonstrated panlobular hepatitis with early parenchymal collapse suggestive of a morphologic counterpart of acute hepatitis and hepatocellular pattern of injury. The p atient was thought to have drug- induced liver injury from turmeric pills that were discontinued and she was discharged with prednisone. Her LFTs normalized after 3 weeks, after which, her prednisone was tapered off. 54. Suhail et al. (2019) noted that the temporal association of liver injury in the patient, norm alisation of LFTs upon withdrawal and improvement with steroids implicate the turmeric supplement as the likely causative agent of liver injury. The Roussel -Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) scale, which attempts to codify causality of drug toxicit y into objective criteria, was eight in our patient indicating a probable adverse drug reaction. A negative serological workup and normali sation of LFTs following the discontinuation of steroids further solidify this conclusion. Case 4 (Arizona, USA ; Lukefahr et al. 2018) 55. A 71 year old woman at routine check -up was found to have an asymptomatic transaminitis. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, Raynaud's syndrome, osteoarthritis, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulosis, with regular medications metoprolol, and atenolol . A 'low cost' turmeric supplement (of unknown product identification) was taken according to label recommendations for a period of 8 months prior to transaminitis testing. 56. She was referred to a gastroenterologist . Laboratory and biopsy findings led to a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. Treatment was limited to withdrawing use of turmeric supplements. AST and ALT decreased significantly within 30 days of discontinuation, a nd normalised by 13 months. In this case, the patient (not the clinicians) hypothesised that the turmeric may have been the cause of the elevated liver transaminases and elected to cease its use. 57. Subsequent reassessment of the liver biopsy by the authors revealed autofluorescent inclusions in the pigment -laden histiocytes, with an with curcumin, or possibly lipofuscin . Histiocyte fluorescence, which was not noted in liver biopsy specimens from patients with unrelated disorders, was quenchable by treatment with Sudan Black B (SBB) , as has been reported for lipofuscin. However, because the authors also documented complete SBB quenching of curcumin autofluorescence in fixed cultured cells specifically load ed with curcuminoids, the authors could not ascertain with certainty whether the histiocyte inclusions here were composed of lipofuscin, a lysosomal degradation product and/or curcuminoids derived from the turmeric supplement that the patient was still con suming at the time of the biopsy . 19 Summary 58. The literature review of human studies suggests oral diferuloylmethane in humans is well tolerated up to doses of 114 mg/kg bw/day, though minor symptoms of nausea or diarrhoea may occur. Long -term studies are la cking, however . The UK exposure assessment for dietary turmeric supplements indicates substantial exceedances of the ADI can occur for diferuloylmethane , which are generally for the supplements containing turmeric extracts. Questions on which the views of the Committee are sought 59. Members are invited to consider the following questions: i) Do Members have any comments on the animal toxicity data for turmeric or diferuloylmethane ? ii) Do Members have any comments on the recent case reports of human hepatotoxicity ? iii) In light of the above, does the Committee wish to reconsider the ADI that is currently based on reproductive toxicity ? iv) Given that the composition or formulation of turmeric supplements may substantially enhance the in vivo bioavailability of diferuloylmethane, does the Committee wish to advise on the extent of exceedance against the current ADI for supplemental diferuloylmethane that would be considered to represent a health risk ? v) Given past reported contamination issue s with turmeric supplements, would there be value in undertaking chemical analysis of turmeric supplements available on the UK market? vi) Do Members have any other comments on this paper ?
