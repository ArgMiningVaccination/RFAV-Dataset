Oversight Committee, which consists of 17 members appointed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board), to annually review the expenditures for the prior year and report to the Board on the conformity of the expenditures to the ordinance. The Committee develops, publishes, and presents a final report, based on individual reports submitted by fund recipients, at the end of each year to the Board. Each nominating agency is responsible for appointing a new member to any current vacancy.

The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the Board of Supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" With ongoing support from the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA), the Oversight Committee spent several months reviewing allocation reports, highlighting accomplishments while deliberating and communicating concerns to providers, and reviewing and editing the Measure A annual report. Report forms that are based on the Results- Based Accountability methodology, along with in-person presentations from several providers, were used to review all funding allocations. History of the Measure Passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004 Extended through 2034 (as Measure AA) by 76% of voters in June 2014 Raises County sales tax by one-half cent for health care services : Emergency medical, hospital inpatient/outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse Target populations : Indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County \u00bd % Overall Conclusion The Oversight Committee found that Alameda Health System (AHS) and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in compliance with the provisions of Measure A. The Oversight Committee did have concerns for a small number of allocations. These concerns are noted in this Executive Summary and in the individual report summaries for the relevant providers. Measure A generated $154,786,579 * in FY 17/18. Of the $154,786,579 that Measure A generated in FY 17/18, AHS received 75%, and the remainder of the funds was distributed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) to many health care providers who provide essential health care services.

Despite these achievements in increasing the number of individuals who have health insurance, an estimated 80,391 individuals or 4.9% of County residents remain uninsured, according to the American Community Survey estimates for 2017. However, the current federal administration has taken serious efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which may erode public health coverage. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to essential health services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting process compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee and HCSA to improve the accountability of Measure A recipients by providing ongoing technical assistance training to providers. Our Measure A Tax Dollars at Work One metric for the effectiveness of a tax measure is how broadly it enhances the community that voted it into effect. As in years past, in FY 17/18, Measure A has proven to provide Countywide benefits in a variety of ways: By the numbers: Measure A providers serve a large number of Alameda County's 1.5 million residents. AHS and the Alameda County Public Health Department Health Prevention Initiative providers alone served over 155,000 and 60,000 residents, respectively. By location: From the City of Berkeley School Linked Health Services Program to the north; to Abode Services in Fremont to the south; to the Youth and Family Initiatives Tri-Valley Health Initiative, serving Dublin, Pleasanton, and Livermore to the east; Measure A service providers are located in every geographic section of the County. By target groups: While most Measure A providers serve all segments of the population, several target certain demographic groups, ensuring that all segments of the County receive benefits. Programs exist that are specific to seniors (Spectrum Community Services, Inc., Service Opportunities for Seniors Meals on Wheels) and youth (UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, Alameda Boys & Girls Club), as well as underserved nationalities such as the County's Afghan (Fremont Aging and Family Services) and Pacific Islander/Tongan (Public Health Services for Pacific Islander) communities.AHS served over 155,000 County residents through Measure A in FY 17/18, while the Alameda County Public Health Department Public Health Prevention Initiative served over 60,000 . Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative)2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 6 By language: By offering services in multiple languages, Measure A recipient providers address the reality that much of the County does not speak English as a first language, if at all. Many providers offer services in Spanish, while others extend into languages such as Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Lao, Mam, Tagalog, Urdu, Vietnamese, and others. Generating Additional Funds Measure A continues to serve as leverage for its recipient providers to use to obtain matching funds. Thus, every tax dollar raised generates additional funding for needed health care services. Some notable examples in FY 17/18 include St. Rose Hospital, who raised $4,500,000 in matching funds on a $4,500,000 allocation\u2014a one-to-one match\u2014and Asthma Start, who raised $200,000 in matching funds on a $100,000 allocation\u2014a two-to-one match. Increasing Access to Services In addition to geographic reach, many Measure A providers used their funding to conduct outreach and offer services in nontraditional, nonclinical settings. This helped remove barriers to access that exist when services are offered only in traditional environments. For example, the Countywide Plan for Seniors: Injury Prevention, Meals, Nutrition delivered services in senior centers, community centers, and senior housing communities, while the Maternal, Paternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Unit offered telephone-based interpreter services. Multiple providers also offered street-level outreach and service delivery, as well as home-based service provision. Achieving More, Offering Greater Satisfaction Measure A funding recipients typically met, and often exceeded, their targets for service delivery. For example, Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments provided 759 free, outpatient, community mental health service sessions to 101 participants, compared to a target of 95 sessions to 28 participants, while the Senior Injury Prevention Program offered 1,428 Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance classes, compared to a target of 476. In addition, client surveys commonly indicated high satisfaction with services. Overall satisfaction scores of 100% were received by the Center for Early Intervention on Deafness, City of Alameda: Community Paramedicine Services, and ACCMA Community Health Foundation/East Bay Conversation Project, among others. Health Services for Day Laborers: Street Level Health Project $45.2 million$32 million Measure A Funds Approved by the Board of SupervisorsMatching Funds*2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 7Responding to Emerging Health Crises In FY 17/18, several Measure A recipients used their funding to address some of the most prevalent and growing health concerns of our time. For example, the HIV Education and Prevention Project of Alameda County OPEND Program provided treatment and education for the epidemic of opiod abuse, Preventive Care Pathways and Primary Care Community-Based Organizations screened for and treated Hepatitis C, and Abode Services worked to help remediate the County's homelessness crisis. General Concerns and Recommendations In developing this report, the Oversight Committee identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2017) and in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, many families, especially those living in disadvantaged communities, have not benefited from the economic recovery in recent years and face rising housing and living costs, which significantly impact the health of County residents. According to EveryOne Counts! 2017 Homeless Count and Survey data submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an estimated 5,629 County residents experiencing homelessness were counted. As the housing and homelessness crisis continues to grow in Alameda County, Measure A continues to play a vital role in providing essential health services to many vulnerable residents, including low income families and seniors. The Committee urges Alameda County to pay close attention to public health policy changes that relate to homelessness and housing affordability that may have significant impacts on health care access or the County's safety net. In addition, Alameda County should continue to closely monitor the efforts by the federal administration to cut entitlement programs, change the definition of Public Charge, and dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, Medi-Cal rate reductions and other funding cuts over the past several years have continued to decrease the ability of health care providers to offer services to the expanded Medi-Cal and uninsured populations in the County. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low reimbursement rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventive care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream in developing creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, LIFE ElderCare2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 8lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care service delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. CONCERN: The Committee recognizes that many organizations apply for Measure A funding to supplement their funds to provide services to the residents of Alameda County. The Committee's concern is that, because some organizations have more familiarity with the funding cycle and the process for applying for Measure A funds, this may have the unintended effect where the selection process appears to favor organizations that are more familiar with the process, to the possible exclusion of newer, more innovative organizations that may be addressing emerging health care needs of the Measure A target populations. RECOMMENDATION: The Committee suggests that, to improve public awareness about Measure A and access to the funding process, the Board should make public announcements about the availability of Measure A funds at least nine months before the application process for the next funding cycle. The announcements should include information about Measure A, the person or persons to contact regarding applications, and a brief statement about the purpose of Measure A funds. RECOMMENDATION: Recruitment of Oversight Committee membership should place an ongoing focus on representing the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns. Note: The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern might arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. CONCERN : The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinance limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The Oversight Committee believes that the interpretation of the statute must be revised to expand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to all grantees\u2014 via audit or other method. As part of its role in providing fiscal oversight, the Committee recognizes a need for providers and HCSA to work together to evaluate the long- term impact of Measure A investments in Alameda County. Emergency Medical Services Corps2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 9RECOMMENDATION: The Board should authorize and fund HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve oversight and outcomes in selected programs. RECOMMENDATION: Up to 10% of Measure A recipients should undergo a formal audit each year to track whether money is being spent in accordance with the wording and intent of the measure. CONCERN : Although reporting continues to improve, the Committee expresses the ongoing concern that its review is impacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether funding is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example: Multiple provider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. For some reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" In other reports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. RECOMMENDATION: HCSA should receive funding to provide training to Measure A recipients to increase their capacity to effectively collect and report demographic data on the clients that they serve and their results- based effort, quality, and impact measures. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. RECOMMENDATION: Organizations that do not provide adequate information may not be considered for future funding. CONCERN: While the U.S. economy has had more than eight years of growth following the Great Recession, some indicators forecast a potential economic slowdown in the next few years, which would have a negative impact on many of the providers and programs that receive Measure A funding. RECOMMENDATION: To sustain base funding, adequate Measure A reserves should be maintained to address projected decreases in revenue. CONCERN: In reviewing Measure A fund recipients, committee members noted that several awardees have consistently not used their full allocated funds. This is a concern as these unused funds could have been awarded to other organizations rather than sitting as rollover funds. Public Health Services for Pacific Islanders2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 10RECOMMENDATION: Ascertain awardees who consistently do not use their full allocated funds, and reduce their allocated funding as appropriate. Specific Concerns Alameda Health System From the time the Committee voiced its initial concern in the FY 06/07 Annual Report, AHS's accounting decision has continued to integrate Measure A dollars (FY 17/18: $111,416,142) into their overall revenue (FY 17/18: $1,027,011,000). Therefore, the Committee is unable to: Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to personnel, subcontracted services, non-personnel program and/or operating expenses, or administrative overhead, separate from their overall agency budget for these categories. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of staff supported, separate from their entire agency staff of 4,409. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to an actual number of individuals served, separate from those served (156,790) by their entire agency. In light of the above collective concerns that have been repeated in annual Oversight Committee reports since the FY 06/07 Annual Report, it is recommended that AHS undergo a full and comprehensive audit to track Measure A fund allocations during the FY 17/18 period to ensure public accountability for how the tax funds were utilized. NOTE: This recommendation will be changed if AHS provides a response that addresses the above concerns. LifeLong Medical Care Heart 2 Heart2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 11HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT Measure A tax revenue is used to provide emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. Each year, the Alameda Health System (AHS) receives 75% of Measure A funds, which is allocated by their Board of Trustees to provide primary and specialty care, preventative, and mental health services to patients served at AHS's multiple facilities, including Highland Hospital, John George Psychiatric Hospital, Fairmont Hospital, San Leandro Hospital, and Alameda Hospital. The remaining 25% of the Measure A funds received is allocated by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) to provide critical medical services offered by community-based health care providers, emergency care, and public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to address the many health needs of communities throughout the County. In FY 17/18, Measure A generated $154,786,579 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows: Alameda Health System (75%): the Alameda County approved budget totaled $3.173 billion. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency approved budget totaled $836 million, or 26.3% of the total County budget. Measure A revenues not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 1% . The following sections in the report provide more detail on how AHS and the Board spent Measure A funds in FY 17/18, which includes revenue generated in the reporting year as well as unspent funds earned in previous years.Alameda County Board of Supervisors Alameda Health System Board of Trustees25% 75%25%DISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A ALLOCATIONSFY 17/18 individuals served: 156,790) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: Countywide, Homeless or transient Background Alameda Health System (AHS) works for the caring, healing, teaching, and serving of all.

AHS leadership continues its third year of transition towards becoming a Population Health organization characterized by its commitment to meeting the needs of the communities that it serves. AHS is enhancing its key competencies in specific areas of care delivery\u2014ambulatory clinics, acute care, behavioral health, and post-acute care\u2014and supplementing the continuum of care through contractual relationships with other providers. The system will be supported with a state-of-the- art integrated technology platform, consolidated financial systems, and human resource systems characterized by a culture of accountability, providing AHS with the nimbleness to respond rapidly to opportunities and a changing environment. The framework for these activities is built on the following pillars: Access. Be a leader in access to quality affordable care. Quality. Promote and maintain patient health and wellness while doing no harm. Experience. Be the best place to stay well, heal, and receive care. Sustainability. Be an organization that operates profitably and generates funding to support its mission. Network. Ensure integrated health care delivery across the continuum to optimize directly provided or contracted services. Workforce Development. Be the best place to learn and work. AHS integrates access to non-clinical services to complement health care delivery and support healthy outcomes for those it serves. A key FY 17/18: 75% of Measure A Funds Allocated to Alameda Health System alamedahealthsystem.org Matching Funds $32.9 M AHS leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $32,894,622 in matching funds through an Intergovernmental Transfer with Alameda County and the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services . 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 12component of this program is AHS's Health Advocates program, which is a volunteer-powered, client-centered program under AHS's Care Management department. Volunteers and staff work together to assist AHS consumers with basic resource information and navigation. The goal of Health Advocates is to address the social determinants of health and to empower consumers towards improved health and quality of life. AHS serves an extremely diverse patient population when stratified by race and ethnicity: African American/Black: 27%. 16%. Other: 7%. Measure A Funding Summary AHS does not have programs specifically or separately supported by Measure A funds. Measure A is a supplemental funding source that supports all AHS services, with the exception of a small share of services for which AHS receives full reimbursement. Measure A funds are critical to helping AHS reduce the gap between reimbursement for services from a variety of sources and the actual cost of providing those services to underinsured and uninsured patients. Because of this, the results listed below are for AHS's overall programs. Its goals and strategies are aligned to ensure its ability to meet the purpose of the voter-approved Essential Health Care Services Initiative, providing additional support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. In FY 17/18, Measure A helped AHS achieve the following across its strategic pillars. Access Improve access by increasing the number of non-traditional ambulatory encounters. Non-traditional encounters are exchanges between primary care providers and their patients via telephone and e-consults (electronic communications) between primary care and specialty care providers. 4,050 phone visits (target: 1,478). 958 e-consults (target: 660). Success Story Mr. M, 20, is on the autism spectrum. His unpredictable behavioral issues make it difficult for him to receive any type of medical exam, including dental. Most dentists will not examine a patient who can't sit still, can't communicate what's wrong, or is prone to sudden outbursts. The Alameda Health System-Highland Hospital Dental Clinic is one of the only locations in Northern California that offers dentistry to patients who require special assistance. They do an initial exam with every patient. For those who cannot sit still, anesthesiologists are brought in to sedate them. As Mr. M's grandmother recalls, \"The care my grandson received from the Highland Dental Clinic was incredible. \" 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 13Quality Reduce patient falls in acute medical/surgical inpatient unit, skilled nursing facilities, and behavioral health locations. Quality managers, nurse managers, and executive leaders help decrease the percentage of falls by rounding at sites to reinforce and support best practices, including timely falls reconciliation, fall risk assessment, fall prevention risk identification, staff awareness, medication management, and use of bed alarms. Falls per 1,000 patient days: Inpatient acute medical/surgical: 3.10 (target: 3.14) Experience Improve Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Consumer & Group Survey (CG-CAHPS) scores. These surveys reflect the voice of patients and provide information about their experience. HCAHPS: 72.1% rate of less than 15% during the first 30 days in the Home Health pilot group. AHS's goal was to reduce readmissions within 30 days for patients with chronic conditions through effective case management, increased communications, and monitoring of rehabilitation services. Rehospitalization rate: 13.64% (target: <15%). Workforce Development Reduce time to hire by reducing the number of recruitment days from job posting to start date. Recruitment days: 66 (target: 70). Concerns From the time the Committee voiced its initial concern in the FY 06/07 Annual Report, AHS's accounting decision has continued to integrate Measure A dollars (FY 17/18: $111,416,142) into their overall revenue (FY 17/18: $1,027,011,000). Therefore, the Committee is unable to: Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to personnel, subcontracted services, non-personnel program and/or AHS exceeded its targets in the areas of Access, Network, and Workforce Development, and exceed two of three targets in the area of Quality. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 14operating expenses, or administrative overhead, separate from their overall agency budget for these categories. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to the actual number of staff supported, separate from their entire agency staff of 4,409. Determine what portion of Measure A funds were allocated to an actual number of individuals served, separate from those served (156,790) by their entire agency. In light of the above collective concerns that have been repeated in annual Oversight Committee reports since the FY 06/07 Annual Report, it is recommended that AHS undergo a full and comprehensive audit to track Measure A fund allocations during the FY 17/18 period to ensure public accountability for how the tax funds were utilized. NOTE: This recommendation will be changed if AHS provides a response that addresses the above concerns. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 15FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GROUP 1: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Behavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community-Based Providers ............................ 17 Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative) ........................................................................................................ 20 Cherry Hill Detox and Sobering Station ................................................................................................................. 22 Criminal Justice Screening and In-Custody Services .......................................................................................... 24 Health Services for Unaccompanied Immigrant Youth: La Familia Counseling Services ..................... 28 La Familia Counseling Services ................................................................................................................................. 29 Mental Health Services for Juvenile Justice Center ............................................................................................ 30 Mental Health Services for Newcomers and Immigrants (CERI) ................................................................... 31 Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE) ............................................................................................. 32 Senior Support Program of Tri-Valley ...................................................................................................................... 33 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 16Background Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. Community-based organizations (CBOs) provide mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) services under contract with BHCS to meet the diverse cultural and language needs of County resident populations. For mental health services, each program receiving Measure A funds has experience in serving the unique needs of their clients: persons at imminent risk for suicide, persons with mental health conditions who are also homeless, older adults including those who may be home- bound, family members of a loved one with a mental health condition, and those with limited English proficiency. Measure A funds help ensure continued operation of these programs as well as program efforts to better serve the community. For SUD, two primary types of services are offered: Residential treatment facilities. Residential services are often the first step that many clients take to help become and remain sober. Residential services are accessed by clients throughout the County. Primary prevention activities. These activities serve youth and their families as well as older adults in school, community-based, senior housing, and senior center environments. SUD services are tailored to these two systems of care and also feature culturally congruent, evidence-based programming and services for encounters (Total individuals served: 37,931) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: Countywide, Outside of Alameda CountyBehavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community-Based Providers www.acbhcs.org Matching Funds $35,693 from Medi- Cal.

Success Story Juan, 25, was in outpatient treatment but unable to abstain from his substance use, so his counselor recommended La Familia El Chante residential treatment. At El Chante, Juan learned to communicate and accept the impact of his addiction. El Chante provided a structured environment where Juan was encouraged to take time to himself, think about his life, and be responsible to himself and others. Doing basic house chores led him to become the residential kitchen coordinator and eventually the house coordinator. He finished treatment after four months and started outpatient treatment. He has reunified with his family and understands how his addiction has impacted those around him. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 19FY 17/18 Allocation: $1,352,086 | Expended/Encumbered: individuals served: 13,879) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: Countywide, Homeless or transient Background The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (CHSC) works to foster the academic success, health, and well-being of Alameda County youth by building universal access to high quality supports and opportunities in schools and neighborhoods. Co-coordinated by CHSC and the Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) Agency, the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative strengthens the use of evidence-based practices along a continuum of behavioral health supports that includes prevention, early intervention, and treatment strategies.

Services provided to youth in Juvenile Hall include individual therapy, case management, court-ordered evaluations, crisis intervention, and consultation with Juvenile Hall staff, probation officers, school staff, and the juvenile courts. Mental health staff work with youth to monitor their behavior and intervene when it impacts their ability to function in the institution. As a result of these services, youth can better cope with their anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress symptoms while in detention. These services greatly reduce self-harm, harm to others, and hospitalization. Measure A Funding Summary BHCS used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Have 74% of youth booked into the Juvenile Justice Center seen by a mental health clinician (target: 80%).

During the client's most recent detention, which came after termination from a group home placement, the clinician explored the client's history of trauma, which included his father's incarceration and mother's substance abuse. The clinician worked with the client on setting short- and longer-term goals and on taking meds for his mood dysregulation. With these interventions, the client was able to have more positive interactions with staff and peers in Juvenile Hall. The clinician located a suitable group home for the client, where the client could engage in family therapy more readily with his mother. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 30FY 17/18 Allocation: $83,184 | Expended/Encumbered: $83,184 Individuals served A: 28 (Total individuals served: 250) Populations served: Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Mental Health Service area: Alameda, Berkeley, Fremont, Hayward, Oakland, Pleasanton, San Leandro Background The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI) is a grassroots, nonprofit organization dedicated to providing culturally competent mental health and other social services to refugee and immigrant families with multiple layers of complex needs, exposure to violence and trauma both in their current environment and in their native countries, and weakening intergenerational relationships.

Being able to provide therapeutic services at no cost to the consumer is critical because the individuals served by SAVE, who have experienced the complex trauma often associated with domestic violence, also face significant financial burdens. Additionally, domestic violence has a community impact with a wide reach, from intergenerational experiences of domestic violence to emergency room costs to loss of wages for businesses. Thus, helping individuals who have experienced domestic violence in their healing improves community safety and well- being.

SRH works in partnership with physicians and employees to heal and comfort all those it serves. SRH is a safety-net, independent, nonprofit hospital that provides critical access to emergency medical, hospital inpatient, and outpatient services for indigent, low income, underinsured populations in Central and Southern Alameda County. These services include the following: Critical access. SRH serves as a critical access point for Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, SRH serves as a safety-net hospital and provides health care access to many low income residents that do not have adequate transportation to the Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists programs. The Hospitalists assume care of indigent and uninsured patients who are admitted to SRH. This alleviates the financial impact of private physicians who request compensation for lack of reimbursement. Tele-Psychiatry. SRH started a Tele-Psychiatry program for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mental health issues. Prior to this program, SRH physicians were not able to write or release 5150s and had to call the Hayward Police Department (HPD) to write the hold or release. Because of HPD's workload and call priority, there were times SRH physicians and staff would wait several hours before HPD would arrive. Since SRH physicians are now able to write or release 5150s as part of this program, they no longer need to take HPD away from their primary duties. SRH serves approximately 11% of Alameda County's indigent population.

At CHO, Measure A funding supported three programs/activities: The pediatric Emergency Department (ED), specifically to provide adequate staffing for the large volume of children seen at the ED. The Center for Child Protection (CCP), which treats children who experience abuse and other types of trauma. Two school-based clinics in Oakland. Emergency Department CHO provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHO's ED sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury from the basic to the most complex. CHO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHO for emergency services, since the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. Trauma services are a subset of the ED, requiring highly specialized equipment and facilities and highly trained staff. CHO's ED is one of two designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in Northern California and the only one in the Bay Area. CHO's Trauma Center has 24-hour in-house staff, including pediatric specialists in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anesthesiology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, diagnostic imaging, and critical care. CHO maintains an extensive in-house and outpatient rehabilitation department for pediatric trauma patients. The Trauma Center also supports an injury prevention program for the hospital and the community.

Approximately 70% of patients seen in the CHO ED receive Medi-Cal. This number is higher than almost any other hospital\u2014child or adult\u2014in California. Without the CHO ED, children would need to travel further and/or receive care that is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHO ED. Center for Child Protection CCP is a comprehensive child abuse program within CHO. CCP is the only provider in Alameda County that has the capacity to offer many of its services. CCP maintains staffing 24 hours per day to respond to acute forensic examinations for children under 14 years old when the alleged sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours. Clinical case management is provided to children and adolescents who present to the ED and/or child abuse management clinic following diagnosis or disclosure of abuse. Clinical case management assists families with navigating the criminal justice system, arranging necessary medical follow-up, and assisting with community resource referrals. Comprehensive evidenced-based mental health services are provided to children, adolescents, and their families. For most of these families, there are no alternatives in Alameda County for many of the services provided by CCP. Because many CCP services are funded by external sources such as Measure A, there is no charge for eligible clients. This feature is very important because if CCP needed to charge insurance for these services, there would be a record of services provided, and many families would not step forward to divulge such sensitive information. School-Based Clinics CHO runs two school-based health centers: one at Castlemont High School and one at McClymonds High School. The specially trained teams at the two school-based clinics look at all aspects of an adolescent's life to help address the many medical and mental health issues they could be facing. Both sites are integrated into full-service youth and/or family centers that promote youth development and serve as national models for adolescent health care. The Castlemont Clinic\u2014which operates a full-time comprehensive team of six therapists and a psychiatrist, as well as comprehensive medical services\u2014is the hub for teachers, parents, and students to coordinate therapy, care, support, and help.

The Alameda County Office of Dental Health provides an accessible early entry point for oral health assessment and preventive dental services for high risk families and children ages 0-5 years at Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) centers, as well as continuity and referral for regular follow-up dental care in the community. The services provided at WIC include dental history interviews to identify risk factors and oral home care practices, brushing the child's teeth and applying fluoride, assessing the child's mouth, defining and gaining acceptance for home care behaviors, and promoting the oral health of prenatal women and their newborns. For children who need follow-up care beyond the services provided at the WIC site, the outreach worker collaborates with the family to assess insurance coverage, obtain a dental appointment with a provider, and assist with making the initial dental appointment. For families lacking insurance coverage, the outreach worker arranges insurance assistance through the Healthy Smiles Dental Treatment program. The focus of the service is families of children (ages 9 to 15 months) who participate in Dental Days at WIC at the Eastmont, Telegraph, Hayward, and Fremont sites. Since siblings often accompany the caregiver to the Dental Days, all services are offered to them as well.

The student worked with the SBHC licensed social worker to create a safety plan and learn strategies to manage her PTSD. The therapist involved the parents in her care and safety planning. For the summer break, the therapist and student put together a \"safety box\" filled with items to help her manage, such as a stress ball, picture of her family, coloring book, and mindfulness prompt. The student, now in seventh grade, is no longer experiencing PTSD symptoms. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT 47FY 17/18 Allocation: $209,613 | Expended/Encumbered: individuals served: 3,400) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Public Health Service area: Hayward, Oakland, San LeandroConnecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) Initiative Background Since 2013, the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (CHSC) has administered Alameda County's Connecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) Schools Initiative. Implemented in the Oakland, Hayward, and San Leandro school districts, the initiative aims to eliminate common barriers to health insurance enrollment and retention by leveraging school districts as channels for reaching uninsured families. The primary services provided by CKC are health insurance and public benefits enrollment support for uninsured and underinsured families in Alameda County. The CKC initiative serves several populations that face multiple barriers to enrolling in coverage, including individuals with limited English proficiency, the long-term uninsured, and recent immigrants. Some of the barriers preventing these families from accessing coverage include complex eligibility requirements, enrollment procedures, and renewal processes for public programs such as Medi-Cal; limited language support for non-English speakers; and mistrust of public systems. The CKC \"one-stop shop\" model is particularly important for the working poor, whose work schedules and difficulty accessing reliable or efficient transportation can prevent them from making or attending appointments at different public agency locations for each family member. In addition, the CKC staff's linguistic diversity and cultural humility make affordable coverage more accessible for families in need. CKC's engagement efforts have proven highly effective for Spanish- speaking families, who comprised 80% of clients served in FY 17/18. It is also worth noting that 92% of clients served in FY 17/18 speak a primary language other than English. Matching Funds $75,000 from school district funds . 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 48Measure A Funding Summary The CKC Initiative used its Measure A funding to achieve the following. Make 1,509 phone calls to parents advertising the initiative. Conduct 30 trainings or presentations for school site staff, community-based partners, or other school-based resources to increase the number of people on school sites who are referring families to the CKC Family Resource Centers (FRCs) for health benefit enrollment assistance (target: 24). Host 105 outreach events at school sites to educate parents and students about health insurance eligibility guidelines and enrollment assistance resources at the FRCs (target: 75). Have 2,651 families schedule an appointment at an FRC (target: 2,500). Of the health insurance applications submitted, ensure that 1,567 (61%) were intake/new applications (target: 1,400). Of the CalFresh applications submitted, ensure that 835 (65%) were intake/new applications (target: 1,462). Of the CalWORKs applications submitted, ensure that 94 (91%) were intake/new applications (target: 165). Of the health insurance applications submitted, ensure that 1,002 (39%) were renewal applications (target: 900). Of the CalFresh applications submitted, ensure that 449 (35%) were renewal applications (target: 424). Ensure that 3,452 families attended scheduled appointments (target: 3,200). Ensure that 1,253 (80%) of the health insurance applications submitted were approved (target: 2,000). Additionally, Measure A funds were used for capacity-building and evaluation of the CKC Initiative. The hired evaluator worked to further improve data strategy, including collection, management, and analysis. In addition, all stakeholders came together to identify future areas of growth for service delivery. Success Story A client, Mr. Vera, applied for Medi- Cal health insurance for his son. Six months later, he had not heard whether the application was denied or approved. When Mr. Vera came to the Hayward FRC to get support, the CKC coordinator called Medi- Cal. Mr. Vera did not speak English, and having a bilingual coordinator advocate for him made a huge difference. The coordinator secured a paper verifying Mr. Vera's son's coverage, and then connected Mr. Vera to a Community Dental Care Coordinator to schedule his son for a dental appointment. The coordinator also assisted Mr. Vera in applying for his own health insurance through the Health Program of Alameda County (HealthPAC). 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 49Background The City of Fremont's Human Services Department (HSD) supports a vibrant community through services that empower individuals, strengthen families, encourage self-sufficiency, enhance neighborhoods, and foster a high quality of life for all residents.

BHCS oversees certain programs that provide medical services at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center (JJC). Many of the youth have gone years without seeing a primary care provider and have untreated sexually transmitted infections or undiagnosed chronic conditions, or are missing important vaccinations. Other times, the medical services can help youth address issues that are impacting their self-esteem. The medical services also include access to critical dental procedures, and the medical clinic fills psychotropic medications for youth, which are prescribed by BHCS psychiatrists. These services are provided under the coordination of the JJC Health Services Director. Measure A Funding Summary BHCS used its Measure A allocation to cover the costs associated with coordination of medical services while youth are detained in the JJC. The allocation does not cover the costs of the services themselves. Instead, it is used to fund the JJC Health Services Director position, who has oversight of the contract for the medical services provider. Director responsibilities include the following: Ensure that the medical provider is meeting contract deliverables, achieving identified objectives, and working in coordination with the partners in the Probation Department and BHCS. Work with the medical provider to implement new programs or services.FY 17/18 Allocation: $261,000 | Expended/Encumbered: (Total individuals served: 851) Populations served: Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Outpatient Service area: Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward, OaklandMedical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Direct Service Planning and Administration Success Story A youth in detention was transferred to Willow Rock adolescent psychiatric hospital due to being a danger to himself and others. He made significant progress and was able to return to the JJC. The Health Services Director used information obtained from the medical clinic, Willow Rock, and Probation to create a comprehensive support plan for the youth. When the youth was discharged from the JJC, his Medi-Cal coverage had lapsed. The Director arranged a meeting with an HCSA health insurance technician to reactivate the youth's Medi-Cal. The Director also worked with Probation to ensure the youth was referred to a community mental health provider and a primary care medical home. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 57 Help coordinate care for individual youth when challenges arise among different systems.

The Alameda Health Consortium is guided by the following principles: All people have the right to accessible and affordable high quality health care that prevents illness, promotes wellness, and is sensitive to the unique needs of particular communities and cultures. The barriers that prevent people from seeking care must be eliminated. Individuals and families must be empowered to participate in their own health care. Low income and underserved people play an important role in the formation of health policy at the local, state, and national level. Building consensus and coalitions around important health issues leads to innovative solutions. Providing quality health care improves the well-being of our communities. Racial and ethnic health disparities must be eliminated in order to have healthy communities. The Consortium's outpatient services are provided at community health center locations throughout Alameda County and are not hospital-based. The health centers see patients regardless of income, insurance, or immigration status and provide culturally and linguistically competent medical, dental, and behavioral health care.

Older Adults, Healthy Results (OA/HR) is an ACPHN program that provides public health nurse case management to low income Alameda County adults 60 years of age or older with the aim of promoting wellness, maximizing function, and supporting clients to live safely in their homes and communities. OA/HR clients struggle with an array of functional limitations, inadequate caregiving resources, and psychosocial challenges that interfere with their ability to manage complex medical conditions and put them at high risk for institutionalization. Nurse case managers provide psychosocial and medical care coordination for clients who lack the support, functional capacity, and resources to be able to perform these activities themselves. Case managers also implement sustainable support structures that allow client/caregiver units to function more independently, safely, and healthfully. Anecdotally, the program has observed a decrease in emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in approximately 50% of clients starting at about one to two months after enrollment.

Health outcomes are determined 10% by access to care, 10% by quality of care, and 80% by other social and environmental factors that are not typically addressed, including basic needs and adverse events. Research shows that severe, chronic stress can become toxic to developing brains and biological systems when a person suffers significant adverse childhood experiences, such as poverty, abuse, neglect, neighborhood violence, or the substance abuse or mental illness of a caregiver. The cumulative effect of this stress response increases the likelihood of developmental delays, learning disabilities, and behavior problems, in addition to diabetes, heart disease, depression, drug abuse, alcoholism, and other major health problems later in life. To address this, Measure A funding supported two closely connected BHCO programs: The Family Information and Navigation Desk, or FIND, helps identify and resolve social determinants of health for its patients. About 95% of the patients have Medi-Cal, and many of them have basic social, economic, and environmental needs that are impacting their health. Examples include lack of food or shelter, exposure to drugs or violence, lack of a safe place to spend outdoors, landlord and housing issues, and more. These social determinants of health have a major influence on one's health but are not traditionally addressed in clinical care due to lack of time, training, reimbursement, and resources. FIND is a tool that makes it feasible to address these social determinants by automating screening for basic needs and adverse events, identifying the top three priorities for families, automatically pulling up relevant resources from a comprehensive database of services in their area, and automating the creation of an action plan. FY 17/18 Allocation: $180,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $180,000 Individuals served 266 (Total individuals served: 532) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health Service area: Berkeley, OaklandUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland Brilliant Baby Program www.findconnect.org Matching Funds $54,000 from the Oakland Ed Fund. Highlights 100% of families in FIND received one or more referrals to specific resources to address their needs (target: 90%).100% 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 121Of all families, 44% screened positive for needing outdoor activities, 19% for food insecurity, 14% in need of diapers, 13% with housing instability, 9% for child development concerns, 5% for utility support, and 1% for legal services. One of the top referral destinations of FIND is to the Brilliant Baby program, which works to improve the healthy development and educational trajectory of babies born into economically distressed families. The program establishes college savings accounts for babies born in Oakland into families living in poverty and offers financial coaching to parents and guardians. The financial services help parents improve their family's material financial well-being, reduce toxic financial stressors, and increase bandwidth for parenting. By focusing parents of new babies on their child's future academic success, college savings accounts from infancy change expectations about college and help break the generational poverty cycle. Measure A Funding Summary The FIND and Brilliant Baby programs used their Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Refer 58 families per month to FIND (target: 50). Enroll 44 families per month families in FIND (target: 40). Assess/screen 44 families per month (target: 40). Provide one or more referrals to 43 families per month (target: 36). Refer seven families per month from FIND to Brilliant Baby (target: 15). Have seven referred families per month enroll in Brilliant Baby (target: 15). Provide financial coaching to two families per month who enrolled in Brilliant Baby (target: three). Success Story Yabnely Lara and her husband have a daughter in elementary school and a toddler son. When her son was an infant, the family was screened for basic needs at BHCO and referred to FIND. The health navigator helped the family identify their top needs and appropriate resources, which included a medical-legal partnership and Brilliant Baby. Yabnely attended Brilliant Baby workshops in financial literacy and parent leadership. She also completed six one-on- one financial coaching sessions. She has saved money and feels assured about her son's education. Knowing that he has $500 to begin his college experience motivates her to save additional funds for his education. 2017 -2018 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT | 122Background The West Oakland Health Council (WOHC) works to improve the health and socio-economic status of the community by providing the highest quality preventive care and treatment for diverse neighbors throughout the East Bay. Services provided include primary care; medical and dental; behavioral health; Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); substance abuse services; and community outreach and case management. Many of the low income residents in the WOHC service area have diabetes and no way to get the retinopathy screenings that they need. Additionally, many of the homeless persons living in the encampments around Oakland have had their eyeglasses broken or stolen. For them, having medical eye exams available along with access to low cost glasses is a giant step forward that allows them to read and see as they strive to put their lives back together and move toward getting a job. Measure A Funding Summary WOHC used its Measure A funds to create an entirely new Optometry department with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment. The new Optometry department includes three exam rooms and the ability to screen diabetics with medical eye exams for retinopathy.

The goal of the countywide Youth and Family Opportunity (YFO) initiative is to provide coordination of care, referrals, mental health services, and other types of health supports to underserved youth and families across the County. The YFO organizations provide services focusing on mental health, public health, alcohol and drugs, and youth and community. Additional areas of emphasis for YFO organizations in FY 17/18 included the following: Staff wellness. Staff wellness and secondary trauma are significant issues for the YFOs. CHSC provided a workshop on building cultures of healing and care that looked at both individual self-care and how organizations can build staff wellness practices into their policies and practices. Expanding father-friendly and father-specific services. The Fatherhood Initiative and Fathers Corps led a presentation and dialogue that led to more father-friendly spaces and materials, and to partnerships that brought Caf\u00e9 Dad and other father-specific workshops to South County. It also led to three of the YFOs joining the Fatherhood Partnership expansion cohort. Exploring data collection and usage to improve services. CHSC introduced the YFOs to a resource for choosing and designing databases and provided a demonstration of a data visualization tool that can be used for case management and improving access to resources.
