Materials and Methods: Out of 167 vaccinated patients, 136 agreed to a follow-up visit three to six weeks after vaccination. Results: Only 39 patients (29%) developed antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 (35.2 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL) after full vaccination. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that predictive factors for good antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine were better kidney function, higher hemoglobin level, and no use of mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression. For seropositive kidney transplant patients there was a significant negative correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and CD4/CD8 ratio (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.4, p = 0.02), percentage of CD19+ cells (r = 0.37, p = 0.02), and a positive correlation with percentage of CD8+ cells (r = 0.4, p = 0.01). There was an increase of total leucocyte count after vaccination in the total studied population, and in the group of responders. Conclusions: Only one third of kidney transplant patients develop sufficient antibody responses after full COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Better kidney function, higher hemoglobin level, and no use of mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression increases the adequacy of response. The antibody titers correlated positively with relative number of CD8+ cells and negatively with CD4/CD8 ratio in responders.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-12-03", "cleaned_text": "Immune Response after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Kidney with CKD have higher prevalence of other chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these comorbidities increase the risk of severity of COVID-19 infection [ [5](#B5-medicina-57-01327), [6](#B6-medicina-57-01327)]. The mortality rate related to COVID-19 infection was unusually high among kidney transplant patients and reached 20-28% as compared with 1-5% in the general population [ [7](#B7-medicina-57-01327), [8](#B8-medicina-57-01327), [9](#B9-medicina-57-01327), [10](#B10-medicina-57-01327)]. Vaccination is the most important way to prevent infection. Nephrology societies around the world have recommended prompt, urgent vaccination of CKD patients [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-01327), [12](#B12-medicina-57-01327)]. Immunocompromised patients such as CKD, dialyzed and kidney transplant recipients are one of the most vulnerable groups in the population, are a priority in terms of receiving the COVID-19 vaccination [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-01327), [14](#B14-medicina-57-01327)]. Different vaccines received emergency use authorization by agencies around the globe. The reported efficacy ranged from 50.4% for an inactivated vaccine candidate to 91.6%, 94.1% and 95% for Gam-COVID-Vac, mRNA-1273 and BN162b2. Exclusion criteria in these vaccine studies included the chronic use of immunosuppressive therapy and thus no data on efficacy in kidney transplant patients were available before vaccination [ [15](#B15-medicina-57-01327)]. From the earlier studies we know that CKD patients may have a reduced response to vaccines. Seroconversion induced by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine in patients with CKD is significantly lower than those in the general population [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-01327), [17](#B17-medicina-57-01327), [18](#B18-medicina-57-01327)]. Studies in transplant patients with immunosuppression also demonstrates an attenuated response to vaccination [ [19](#B19-medicina-57-01327), [20](#B20-medicina-57-01327), [21](#B21-medicina-57-01327)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibodies 2.2. Evaluation of Lymphocyte Subpopulations 2.3. Results [Table ( [Table 3](#medicina-57-01327-t003)). [Table 4](#medicina-57-01327-t004). There were no statistically between the studied groups. [Table 5](#medicina-57-01327-t005)). [Table 6](#medicina-57-01327-t006)). Analysis showed that predictive factors for good response to COVID-19 vaccine are better kidney function, higher hemoglobin level, and no use of mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression. [Table 7](#medicina-57-01327-t007)). 4. Discussion [22](#B22-medicina-57-01327)], the authors did not observe strong differences in the formation of polyfunctional and memory SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses between transplanted and non-transplanted patients. Transplanted patients showed similar titers of neutralizing antibodies as compared to non-transplanted-patients. The authors presented the ability to generate SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in immunosuppressed patients, raising hope for effective vaccination in this cohort [ [22](#B22-medicina-57-01327)]. These data were confirmed in another study performed by Fav\u00e0 and co-authors [ [23](#B23-medicina-57-01327)]: although in 28 SOT patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 there was a certain delay achieving immune responses, lower IgG seroconversion rates and cytokine-producing T-cell frequencies, but a similarly robust serological and functional T-cell immune response comparable to that of immunocompetent patients was detected during early convalescence [ [23](#B23-medicina-57-01327)]. [24](#B24-medicina-57-01327)]. In the study with 436 SOT patients, antibodies were detectable in 31 (41%), undetectable in 188 (53%) of kidney transplant patients after the first dose of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Transplant recipients receiving anti-metabolite maintenance immunosuppression therapy were less likely to develop an antibody response than those not receiving such therapy (37% vs. 63%, respectively). Older transplant recipients were less likely to develop an antibody response. Those who received mRNA-1273 were more likely to develop an antibody response than those receiving BNT162b2 (69% vs. 31%, respectively, p = 0.003). These results contrast with the robust early immunogenicity observed in mRNA vaccine trials, including 100% anti-spike seroconversion by day 15 following vaccination with mRNA-12735 and by day 21 following vaccination with BNT162b2 [ [25](#B25-medicina-57-01327)]. [26](#B26-medicina-57-01327)]. In another study, twenty-three renal transplant recipients of the Nierenzentrum Kronach, Germany were evaluated 2 weeks after standard protocol-based vaccination of two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Only 5 of the 23 (22%) renal transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies after vaccination in contrast to 23 (100%) healthy controls (22% vs. 100%, p = 0.0001). In addition, the mean SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer of renal transplant recipients [27](#B27-medicina-57-01327)]. [28](#B28-medicina-57-01327)]. We did not confirm the association of antibody response with the duration of kidney transplantation and cyclosporine use. Of note, cyclosporine is used in our \"older days\" transplants, most of current kidney transplant patients receive tacrolimus, so cyclosporine use may correlate with longer duration of kidney transplantation also in other transplant centers. We confirmed no association between anti-spike SARSCoV-2 antibodies and T cell counts in our study. [29](#B29-medicina-57-01327)]. Association of diabetes with non-responsiveness to vaccination against COVID-19 was not confirmed in other studies nor in our patients. We did not collect data about ATG use in the year before vaccination. [30](#B30-medicina-57-01327)]. Our data confirm a similar response to the vaccination rate. We did not find an association with age, but we could confirm lower GFR and lower hemoglobin as important factors for non-responsiveness in multifactorial analysis. As for immunosuppression, only MMF use was associated with non-responsiveness in multifactorial analysis. A worse response after vaccination when using MMF was confirmed with other vaccines in kidney transplant patients. In one of the studies, the response rate after influenza vaccination decreased in a dose-dependent manner in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), while seroprotection was comparable to non-MMF users. This implies that response to vaccines may be appropriate, but the quality of immune response may be impaired and likely depends on the dose of MMF used [ [15](#B15-medicina-57-01327)]. We did not find a correlation of MMF dose with antibody titers in BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) responders. [31](#B31-medicina-57-01327)]. [32](#B32-medicina-57-01327)]. [33](#B33-medicina-57-01327)]. Severe peripheral lymphopenia, especially a decrease of T cells observed during COVID-19, was also confirmed in other studies convalescence [ [23](#B23-medicina-57-01327), [34](#B34-medicina-57-01327), [35](#B35-medicina-57-01327), [36](#B36-medicina-57-01327)]. However, in the study analyzing patients with a positive response by antibody production after COVID-19 vaccination, significant increase of lymphocyte count was observed [ [30](#B30-medicina-57-01327)]; other studies (including our study) did not have similar findings [ [24](#B24-medicina-57-01327)]. In kidney transplant patients, T cell counts were not associated with the magnitude of the antibody, but were associated with T cell response to the vaccine in univariate analysis (p = 0.01 for CD3, p = 0.05 for CD4, p = 0.03 for CD8) [ [28](#B28-medicina-57-01327)]. [39](#B39-medicina-57-01327)] during analysis of phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells elicited by infection or vaccination. They showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are not exhausted, but functional. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines induce SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses by forming activated and memory CD8+ T cells as described by Teijaro, J.R. and others [ [40](#B40-medicina-57-01327), [41](#B41-medicina-57-01327)]. In our study, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers did not correlate to CD19+ absolute cell count, but there was a significant negative correlation with percentage of CD19+ cells (r = 0.37, p = 0.02). Changes in the proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations after vaccination could be explained by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells formation and might be related to B cell activity or their phenotypes. It can be hypothesized that due to enhanced chemotaxis, part of B cells migrate to the site of vaccination and other lymphoid tissues, where they are activated and transformed to plasma cells producing specific immunoglobulins; in such a way the proportion of B lymphocytes among other lymphocytes in peripheral blood may be reduced, but changes in absolute numbers of CD19+ cells are not significant enough to be detected [ [40](#B40-medicina-57-01327), [42](#B42-medicina-57-01327)]. [43](#B43-medicina-57-01327)]. Therefore, better understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activation and mediation is required. [44](#B44-medicina-57-01327)]. 5.
