VE for 5 -11y/o significantly lower, though most encounters during Omicron surge, suggesting low VE due to Omicron. Effectiveness of 2 -Dose Pfizer Vaccine in Preventing SARS -CoV-2 Infection Among Children Aged 5 -11 Yrsand 12 -15 Yrs, July 2021 -February 2022 | MMWR PROTECT -children 5 -15 years tested for SARS -CoV-2 weekly, irrespective of symptoms Half of infections with Omicron were asymptomatic vs 1/3 with Delta 2 doses reduced the risk of Omicron infection by 31% in 5 -11y/o and by 59% in 12 -15y/o, though CI were overlapping 20Summary: COVID -19 Vaccine Effectiveness in Children and Adults COVID -19 vaccines remain highly protective at all ages against severe COVID -19 caused by Omicron. Immunization is less protective against milder Omicron infection, and protection against infection may be briefer for children 5 -to-11. Vaccine effectiveness calculations are multifactorial (mitigation methods, local community rates, etc.). More data on vaccine effectiveness in pediatric populations is expected to follow over the coming weeks to months. No changes to recommendations or operations at this time . 21Storage and Handling Kate McHugh, CDPH 22Janssen Shelf -Life Extension Shelf life extended from 6 months to 9 months Decision is based on data from ongoing stability assessment studies, which have demonstrated that the vaccine is stable at 9 months when refrigerated at temperatures of 2o-8oCelsius. Applies to inventory dated to expire on March 7, 2022, or later Vaccine providers should visit the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine Expiry Checker webpage to confirm the expiration dates. Expiration Extension Communication from Call Center 23AmerisourceBergen (Third Party Redistributor) Shipment Incidents What do you do if you receive a shipment that has a temperature excursion? Report as a shipping incident in myCAvax Contact AmerisourceBergen (AB) at: c19vaccineops@amerisourcebergen.com oInclude the downloaded temperature log, your order number, and your shipment incident number in your email AmerisourceBergen will contact Pfizer and determine if the vaccine is viable. The provider does not need to contact Pfizer! If you have any issues receiving a reply from AmerisourceBergen, reach out to the COVID Call Center: covidcallcenter@cdph.ca.gov to let us know.
