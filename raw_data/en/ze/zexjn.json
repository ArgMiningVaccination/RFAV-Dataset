The effects of crystal meth include a rush of euphoria, heightened alertness, and a feeling of being invincible. When left untreated, crystal meth abuse and addiction can lead to significant mental and physical health issues. The first step to recovery from crystal meth addiction is crystal meth detox in Nashville, TN. What is Crystal Meth Detox? Crystal meth detox is the process of returning the body and mind to a drug-free state. Drugs like crystal meth create a physical dependency over long-term use. When use is stopped, the body and mind might struggle to function without meth in the system. Methamphetamines, like crystal meth, flood the brain's chemical reward system with the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and dopamine. These brain chemicals impact the brain in various ways: - Noradrenaline activates the body's fight-or-flight response system, causing someone to feel alert, focused, and energized. - Dopamine causes feelings of pleasure when engaging in activities like eating, exercising, and having sex. Crystal meth hijacks these chemicals to release in ways that a person cannot experience pleasure without the drug. These chemicals become depleted when using meth, leading to a \"crash\" after the initial high goes away. During this time, users may feel a lack of energy, become irritable, and may struggle to focus and feel \"normal\" without using crystal meth. As a result, users might use crystal meth more frequently to avoid these unpleasant experiences. Individuals may feel they need more crystal meth to deal with the after-effects of the drug. Thus, the cycle of addiction begins. After long-term crystal meth abuse, users struggle to experience pleasure or feel any excitement without the drug. [Detox](https://brentwoodspringsdetox.com/programs/) helps people regain these feelings without using crystal meth. They may experience crystal meth withdrawal that feels like an emotional or mental downward spiral. However, these unpleasant crystal meth withdrawal symptoms are temporary, as the brain begins to heal during the detox process. What Are Crystal Meth Withdrawal Symptoms? As individuals begin purging their system of crystal meth, their bodies and minds will go through withdrawal from the drug. They might have intense cravings throughout the detox process. Symptoms of crystal meth withdrawal include: - Anxiety and depression - Extreme tiredness - Low energy levels - Lack of motivation - Increased appetite - Agitation and irritability - Difficulty sleeping - Trouble thinking clearly - Paranoid thinking - Hallucinations - Suicidal thoughts Since crystal meth is a stimulant, they might sleep for long periods of time or even a full day or more during detox. Also, since methamphetamine suppresses the appetite, they will need healthy, nourishing meals with plenty of water to replenish their system. Due to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, there is a high risk of relapse during detox. Most of these withdrawal symptoms will lessen in intensity within a few days. Eventually, tapering off after one to two weeks after crystal meth detox. Physical withdrawal symptoms tend to go away first, while psychological symptoms might linger for months afterward. Psychological symptoms of withdrawal might linger due to an underlying mental health disorder that was masked by crystal meth use. Individuals might have been self-medicating to cope with depression or anxiety, and without meth in their system, these psychological symptoms will return.
