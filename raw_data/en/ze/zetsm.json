Fasting is a great way to give a break to your digestion and help lower inflammation in the body. Plus, when we fast for extended periods of time, our body turns on the process of autophagy, eating up aging and senescent cells as a way of \"cleaning\" up and repairing. After just 7 days with this program, our cleansers report improved digestion, an increase in energy and mental focus, better skin appearance, and more. Jumpstart your healing journey and try out practices that promote longevity with our 7-day cleanse program Clean 7 for fast and deep results.
