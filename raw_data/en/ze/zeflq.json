Choi President, University of Missouri System Chancellor, University of Missouri-ColumbiaThe University of Missouri System was formed in 1963 and consists of system administration and four universities: the University of Missouri-Columbia, the University of Missouri-Kansas City , the Missouri University of Science and Technology, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, and all of their component parts, including MU Health, MU Extension and UM Engagement. Our collective vision is to advance the opportunities for success and well-being for Missouri, our nation and the world through transformative teaching, research, innovation, engagement and inclusion. While the four universities continue to progress on their five-year strategic plans, our financial realities were drastically disrupted at the end of Fiscal Year 2020 due to the global pandemic. Our leadership team promptly reacted by taking appropriate steps to ensure proper safety protocols were set in place and by evaluating the economic impacts and adjusting spending patterns accordingly . Despite challenges, we remain focused on directing resources towards our priorities of: Ensuring our students receive a high-quality education, Supporting retention and recruitment of our students, Continuing research and scholarship, especially related to the public health crisis and precision health, Supporting the University's response to the public health crisis and other engagement activities, and Supporting activities that sustain and/or grow revenues for the University . Through crises, the University has maintained a strong and stable fiscal position. Y ou will see in the following pages that we will continue to make the decisions to best serve our stakeholders, including the citizens of Missouri, to help ensure our financial stability well into the future. W e pride ourselves in being good fiscal stewards focused on providing a great place to learn and work, as well as improving the quality of life in Missouri. As always, we invite you to learn more about the entire UM System and the meaningful impact we have statewide. You can find this information by visiting www.umsystem.edu.

The financial statements, presented on pages 32 to 88, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, as such, in clude amounts based on judgments and estimates by management. The financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm BKD LLP, which was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Board of Curators. The University believes that all representatio n s made to the independent auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. BKD's audit opinion is presented on pages 30 31. The University maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the University's management and Board of Curators regarding the preparatio n of reliable published financial statements. Such controls are maintained by the establishment and communication of accounting and financial policies and procedures, by the selection and training of qualified personnel, and by an internal audit program designed to identify internal control weaknesses in order to permit management to take appropriate corre ctive action on a timely basis. There are, however, inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of controls. The Board of Curators, through its Audit Committee, is responsible for engaging the independent auditors and meeting regularly with management, internal auditors, and th e independent auditors to ensure that each is carrying out their responsibilities and to discuss auditing, internal control, and financial reporting matters. Both internal auditors and the independent auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Based on the above, I certify that the inform ation contained in the accompanying financial statements fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition, changes in net position and cash flows of the University.

The University is a component unit of the St ate of Missouri and an integral part of the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. This report includes five financial statements. The three financial statements for the University of Missouri and its Blended Component Units include the Statement of Net Position, the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position, and the Statement of Ca sh Flows. The two financial statements for the University's fiduciary funds are the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position and the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. These statements include two fiduciary component units: the Trust Funds for Retirement and Other Postemployment Benefits; as well as custodial funds. The University's fi nancial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which establishes financial reporting standards for public colleges and universities. The University's significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the financial statements of this re port, including further information on the financial reporting entity. In addition, a more detailed unaudited financial report that includes campuslevel financial statements is available at the University of Missouri, 118 University Hall Columbia, Mo 65211, and at www.umsystem.edu. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS At June 30, 2020, the University's financial position remained solid, with Total Assets and Deferred Outflows of Resources of $9.9 billion. Net Position, which represents the residual value of the University's assets and deferred outflows of resources after deducting liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, totaled $5.0 billion. When operating and nonoperating cha nges are included, Net Position decreased by approximately $73.7 million as compared to fiscal year (FY) 2019, driven primarily by the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, which disrupted the University's operations by switching to online courses mid semester, delayed routine medical care, and increased investment losses during the latter part of the fiscal ye ar. As a result, investment and endowment income decreased by $167.0 million, patient medical services revenues declined by $4.6 million and other auxiliary enterprises, which includes student housing and dining, declined $30.1 million. Net Position increased $186.8 million between FY 2018 and FY 2019 and wa s primarily driven by investment and endowment income, increased patient medical services revenues, and capital gifts. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities. The implementation of this statement increased beginning Net Position by $25.2 million for fiscal year 2019. There was no e ffect on the beginning net position as of July 1, 2018. The FY 2018 information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis has not been restated for the adoption of this GASB statement.

Total Net Position is an indicator of financial condition and cha nges in Total Net Position indicate if the overall financial condition has improved or worsened. Assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources are generally measured using current values with certain exceptions, such as capital assets which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and longterm de bt which is stated at cost. The following table summarizes the University's assets and deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources and net position at June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018: As of June 30, 20202019 (Restated) 2018 Assets Current Assets 1,498,746 $ 1,396,670$ 1,327,095$ Assets Endowment and 486,517 335,808 339,146 Total Assets and Deferred Outflows of Resources 9,891,519 $ 9,243,929$ 8,657,451$ Liabilities Current Liabilities Commercial Paper and of LongTerm Debt 16,882 133,851 83,480 83,289 Liabilities & Deferred Inflows of Resources 4,884,776 4,163,463 3,789,057 Net Position Net Investment and Net Position 9,891,519 $ 9,243,929$ 8,657,451$ CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF NET POSITION (in thousands of dollars) UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS June 30, 2020 and 2019 (unaudited) 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 17 ASSETS AND DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES Total Assets and Deferred Outflows of Resources increased by $647.6 million, or 7.0%, to $9.9 billion as of June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase during FY 2020 was driven by increases in Investment Settlements Receivable of $121.0 million, endowment and LongTerm Investments of $262.4 million, and Capital Asset s, net of $157.1 million. The increase during FY 2019 was driven by an increase in Investment Settlements Receivable of $211.7 million and an increase in endowment and LongTerm Investments of $504.9 million At June 30, 2020, the University's working capital, which is current assets less current liabilities, was $ 205.9 million, an increase of $222.6 million from the previous year. The increase is primarily driven by a decrease in the current portion of longterm debt due as a result of refunding commercial paper during the fiscal year. At June 30, 2019, the University's working capital was a negative $1 6.6 million, a decrease of $342.4 million from the previous year. The decrease was primarily driven by a $202.7 million decrease in ShortTerm Investments as well as a $171.0 million increase in the current portion of longterm debt, which was largely driven by a $105.2 million bullet refunding due in fiscal year 20 20. As a measurement of actual liquidity, working capital is adversely impacted by the inclusion, per accounting guidelines, of LongTerm Debt Subject to Remarketing. If LongTerm Debt Subject to Remarketing were excluded from Current Liabilities, working capital would be $284.7 million and $65.9 million at June 30 , 2020 and 2019, respectively, also expressed as Current Assets of 1.23 and 1.05 times Current Liabilities. The following table illustrates actual working capital, as well as working capital adjusted for Long Term Debt Subject to Remarketing: As of June 30, 20202019 (Restated) 2018 Current Assets 1,498,746 $ 1,396,670$ 1,327,095$ 205,942 $ (16,630) $ 325,754$ Ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities 1.16 0.99 1.33 Current Assets As Adjusted Working Capital, As Adjusted 284,697$ 65,910 $ 411,939$ Ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities (As Adjusted) 1.23 1.05 1.45 (in thousands of dollars)SUMMARY OF WORKING CAPITAL UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS June 30, 2020 and 2019 (unaudited) 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 18 At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the University held $571.3 million and $568.3 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents in both University Funds and Custodial Funds combined. University funds consisted of Cash and Cash Equivalents of $563.0 million, $559.6 million and $548.6 million for fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 20 18, respectively. Increases in cash during FY 2020 was largely due to the receipt of debt proceeds. The increase in cash at June 30, 2019 is largely due to timing differences as more working capital was invested at June 30, 2019 as compared to June 30, 2018. ShortTerm and Lon g Term Investments for University and Custodial Funds totaled $4.3 billion and $4.0 billion as of June 30, 2020 and 2019. Investment performance remained steady during FY 2019 and declined in FY 2020 due to unpredictable market conditions as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses decrease d by $166.9 million, going from a net gain of $199.2 million in FY 2019 to a net gain of $32.3 million in FY 2020. The Endowment Pool and General Pool experienced a net gain of 1.2% and 0.2% in FY 2020. For comparison, the Endowment Pool and Gener al Pool experienced a net gain of 5.7% and 3.3% in FY 2019, respectively.

An increase in Net Pe nsion Liability of $295.4 million was another contributing factor in the increase, which was are result of a larger number of retirees than expected. Current Liabilities include longterm variable rate demand bonds subject to remarketing agreements totaling $78.8 million, $82.5 million and $86.2 million at June 30, 20 20, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The variable rate demand bond has a final contractual maturity in fiscal year 2032. Despite contractual maturities beyond one year, this variable rate demand bond is classified as a current liability because the University is ultimately the sole source of liquidity should the option to tender be exercised by the bond holder. The University's Commercial Paper Program can issue up to an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $375 million. The University issued $105.2 million and $65.0 million of commercial paper in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, to finance bond payments and new building projects. There were no issues of commercial paper during FY 20 18. During FY 2020, all outstanding commercial paper, totaling $361.8 million, was refinanced through the issuance of System Facilities Revenue Bonds Series 2020A and 2020B.

Net Investment in Capital Assets, represents the University's investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and outstanding debt related to acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. This category increased by $80.2 million in FY 2020 and increased by $ 55.0 million in FY 2019. The increase in FY 2019 and FY 2020 was largely driven by an increase in capital assets acquired. Restricted Nonexpendable Net Position includes endowment assets that are subject to externally imposed stipulations for the principal to be maintained in perpetuity by the University. An increase in unrealized endowment investment income led to an increase in Restricte d Nonexpendable Net Position, resulting in an increase of $13.1 million or 1.0% during FY 2020 and an increase of $57.1 million or 4.8% during FY 2019, excluding the impacts of restatements from implementing GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities. Restricted Exp endable Net Position represents resources that are subject to externally imposed stipulations regarding their use, but are not required to be maintained in perpetuity. This category increased during FY 2019 by $39.3 million, or 7.3%, and decreased $19.4 million, or 3.3%, during FY 2020. As of June 30, 2020, this category includes : $442.2 million of net position restricted for operations and giving purposes compared to $433.3 million at June 30, 2019; $79.0 million for student loan programs compared to $82.2 million at June 30, 2019; and $41.2 million for facilities compared to $66.4 million at June 30, 20 19. Unrestricted Net Position is not subject to externally imposed stipulations, although these resources may be designated for specific purposes by the University's management or Board of Curators.

Total Operating Revenues decreased $46.1 million, or 1.5% in FY 2020 primarily due to a decrease in other auxiliary enterprises of $30.1 million and decreased Patient Medical Services of $4.6 million. Patient Medical Services ha d a decline of 0.3% from FY19, which had been the greatest area of growth in previous fiscal years. Grants and Contracts grew $12.3 million during fiscal year 2020 while other auxiliary enterprises and Other Operating Revenues declined $30.1 million and $20.1 million, respectively. The following is a graphic illustration of operati ng revenues by source for FY 2020: Net Other Auxiliary Enterprises 14% Patient Medical Services, Net 51%Other 3%Grants and Contracts 12%Net Tuition and Fees 20%Chart Title TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES $3.0 BILLION Tuition and Fees , net of Scholarship Allowances, decreased by $3.1 million, or 0.5%, and decreased $44.4 million, or 7.0% in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively, over a total of $635.5 million in FY 2018. The decrease in FY 2019 was driven by a decrease in student enrollment as well as an increase in aid as a result of i mplementing GASB Statement No. 84, while the decrease in FY 2020 was caused by an increase in aid. As a research institution, the University receives a substantial amount of funding through Federal, State and Private Grants and Contracts . Overall, sponsored funding increased by $ 12.3 million, or 3.6%, in FY 2020 compared to an increase of $48.1 million, or 16.4%, in FY 2019 over a total of $292.3 million in FY 2018. The University's auxiliary enterprises include University Health Care, Housing and Dining Services, campus Bookstores, and other such supplemental activities. Total operating re venues generated by these auxiliary enterprises decreased by $34.7 million, or 1.8% in FY 2020 and increased $120.0 million, or 6.5% in FY 2019 over a total of $1.8 billion in FY 2018. Patient Medical Services , which includes fees for services provided by University Health Care and the Medical Alliance, ha d a decline for the first time in several fiscal years. The decline of $4.6 million was the result of delay in elective procedures during COVID19 shut downs in the spring of 2020. All other auxiliary enterprises experienced declines as well; including housing and dining services, which issued refunds to students when all four cam puses shut down in person classes due to COVID19. This resulted in $12.7 million of reduced revenues in FY 2020 as compared to FY 2019 . NONOPERATING REVENUES (EXPENSES) Nonoperating Revenues are those not generated by the University's core missions and include such funding sources as State and Federal Appropriations, Pell Grants, Private Gifts and Investment and Endowment Income. Total State Appropriations received for University operations, University Health Care operations, and other special programs decreased by $44.4 million, or 10.9% in FY 20 20 and increased $7.1 million, or 1.8%, in FY 2019 over a total of $401.7 million in FY 2018. After a few years of decreasing State Appropriations , state support had begun to level out in FY 2019. However, economic pressures within the State caused withholdings late in fiscal year 20 20. As one of the more volatile sources of nonoperating revenues, Investment and Endowment Income includes interest and dividend income as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses. Realized and unrealized market value gains, losses and other activity affecting Investment and Endowment Income resulted in a net gain of $3 2.3 million in FY 2020 as compared to a net gain of $199.2 million in FY 2019. As of June 30, 2018, Investment and Endowment Income was $199.0 million. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS June 30, 2020 and 2019 (unaudited) 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 26 Gift income is reflected in three categories: Private Gifts, Capital Gifts and Grants (which are restricted for adding or improving capital assets) and Private Gifts for Endowments (which are restricted for establishing endowments). Private Gifts and Grants can fluctuate significantly from year to year due to the voluntary nature of donors' gifts . In FY 2020, the University received gifts totaling $157.7 million, as compared to $192.3 million and $145.8 million for FY 2019 and FY 2018, respectively. In FY 2020, Other Nonoperating Revenues, Net of $142.6 million increased $58.8 million over FY 2019. The University received $47.3 million in governmental subsidies during FY 20 20 as a result of the CARES Act that provided relief to hospitals and higher education institutions in response to the negative economic impacts resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic. During FY 2019, Other Nonoperating Revenues, Net increased by $2.0 million. In FY 2020 and FY 2019, Federal Appropriations included cash subsidy pa yments from the United States Treasury totaling $9.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively, for designated Build America Bonds outstanding. Pell Grants decreased by $2.1 million in FY 2020 due to less students qualifying for the program. Nonoperating Expenses mainly consists of interest expense. Total interest incurred for the ye ars ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $68.0 million, $70.4 million, and $71.8 million, respectively. Interest expense associated with financing projects during construction, net of any investment income earned on bond proceeds during construction, is capitalized. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, capitalization of inter est earned on unspent bond proceeds totaled $3.3 million, $3.8 million, $779,000, respectively, resulting in net interest expense of $64.7 million, $66.7 million, and $71.0 million, respectively.

UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS June 30, 2020 and 2019 (unaudited) 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 28 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The Statement of Cash Flows provides information about the University's sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents during the fiscal year. The following summarizes sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the three years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 20202019 (Restated) 2018 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities (398,777) $ (310,249)$ (256,148)$ Net Cash Provided from Noncapital Financing Activities 614,301 613,270 614,896 Net Cash Used in Capital and Related Financing Activities (177,669) (251,539) (274,308) Net Cash Provided by (Used) in Investing Activities (34,373) (40,553) 70,407 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents 3,482 10,929 154,847 Cash and Cash Equivalents, Beginning of Year 559,556 548,627 399,791 Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Year $ 559,556$ 554,638$ (in thousands of dollars)CONDENSED STATEMEN TS OF CASH FLOWS Net Cash Used in Operating Activities reflects the continued need for funding from the state of Missouri, as funding received from tuition and fees and related sales and services of auxiliary and educational activities are not sufficient to cover operational needs. In FY 2020, cash used in operating activities increased by $ 88.5 million. The increase in the amount used as primarily due to an increase in payments to suppliers related to voluntary separation arrangements in early FY 2020 as well as increased payments to employees. In FY 2019, cash used in operating activities increased by $54.1 million primarily due to increased pay ments to suppliers, employees and benefits of which the increased payments were partially offset by increased patient care revenues. The University's most significant source of cash, Net Cash Provided from Noncapital Financing Activities , includes funding from State and Federal appropriations, Pell grants and noncapital private gifts. Cash from these sources totaling $ 614.3 million, $613.3 million, and $614.9 million in FY 2020, FY 2019, and FY 2018, respectively, directly offset the additional cash needs resulting from operations. Net Cash Used In Capital and Related Financing Activities decreased by $73.9 million in FY 2020 due to the issuance of capital debt. In FY 20 19, Net Cash Used in Capital and Related Financing Activities decreased by $22.8 million compared to FY 2018 due to the issuance of capital debt. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities reflects a net outflow of $34.4 million in FY 2020 as compared to $40.6 million in FY 2019 and a net in flow of $70.4 million in FY 2018. Differences are largely driven by the net of proceeds and purchases of investments. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK The University of Missouri is the State's premier public research university contributing to the economic development and vitality of the state through ground breaking research, educating more than 68,000 students, delivering quality healthcare to the citizens of Missouri, and providing extension services throughout the state. The COVID19 pandemic, which began in fiscal year 20 20, caused revenue losses and decreased expenditures related to reducing oncampus activity and converting to remote learning as well as cancelation of elective medical procedures in the last few months of the fiscal year. The loss in revenues were partially offset with government aid. The longterm financial impl ications of the pandemic are unknown and the University is continually monitoring enrollment and developing strategies to manage the long term financial impacts from the pandemic. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS June 30, 2020 and 2019 (unaudited) 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 29 The University remains a longstanding and stable enterprise. Enrollment has declined by 2% in FY 2020 and 3% FY 2019 across the four campuses. However, the University's freshman enrollment rebounded over the in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 with growth of 7.0% and 5.4% among the four campuses, respectively, then drop ping by 4% in fiscal year 2020. University leaders have made cuts and reallocations of resources in response to the enrollment challenges. Leadership's strategic plans will invest in student success, research and creative works, engagement and outreach, inclusivity, and stewardship of the University's financial resources via the Missouri Compacts Program. The Uni versity remains committed to balancing its budget and maintaining financial performance to support its mission. The University took significant action in late fiscal year 2020 and continues to take action into fiscal year 2021 to manage personnel and nonpersonnel costs within available revenues. State appropriations for operations stabilized in fiscal ye ars 2018 and 2019. However, appropriations declined in FY 2020 as a result of statewide budget cuts as another downfall from the pandemic. Funding from the State operating budget remains uncertain with the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic. The University is aware of its fiduciary responsibility to control costs in order to provide an affor dable education for Missourians. Despite the challenges generated by uncertain state funding and economic pressures from the pandemic, the University has been able to maintain its strong financial position due to diversified revenue sources and systemwide cost containment measures, which included a freeze on discretionary no nlabor spending as well as furloughs and other personnel cost containment measures. University of Missouri Health Care (MU Health Care) remains dedicated to its mission of saving and improving lives. MU Health Care's focus for the future is to achieve the scale needed, clinically and financially, to support the academi c and research missions to become Missouri's premier academic health system. Health care reimbursement is a continually changing landscape. Considering such, MU Health Care regularly monitors state and federal health care programs and analyzes the impact of ongoing legislation on reimbursement and the delivery of health care. MU Health Care conti nues to improve patient outcomes and access to care, share best practices, create efficiencies and manage health care costs. COVID19 caused a disruption in daytoday operations during the latter part of the fiscal year. MU Health Care continues to navigate supply chain disruptions to secure personal protective equipment an d monitor the impact of the pandemic on a daily basis to provide the best care to patients and to keep staff safe. The University's financial position remains strong with diversified revenue streams that include higher education, research, gifts and health care, which provide flexibility in responding to financial challenges. The p andemic, state economy, limited increases in tuition revenue, and uncertain state support will continue to pose budgetary challenges for the University in the future. The University is actively managing these budgetary challenges by prioritizing strategic goals that will advance the University in its operations and build a strong foundation in the fa ce of uncertainties in the future of the higher education industry. 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 30 Independent Auditor's Report The Board of Curators University of Missouri System Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and the fiduciary activities of the University of Missouri System, collec tively a component unit of the State of Missouri, as of and for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, an d the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the University of Missouri System's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

Fiduciary Financial Statements The University operates the University of Missouri Retirement, Disability, and Death Benefit Plan (the \"Retirement Plan\") and the University of Missouri Other Postemployment Benefits Plan (the \"OPEB Plan\"), which collectively with the Retiremen t Plan represent the \"Pension (and Other Employee Benefit) Trust Funds\", which are single employer, defined benefit plans. The assets of the Retirement Plan and OPEB Plan are held in the Retirement Trust and OPEB Trust, respectively. The Retirement Plan and OPEB Plan considered Fiduciary Component Units of the University in a ccordance with GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities , as the plans are administered through a trust and the University serves as the governing board for the plans. The University reports Custodial Funds on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position and Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Activities that are reporte d as custodial consist of assets held by the University for organizations that are outside of the University's reporting entity, are not derived from University revenues, and are held for the benefit of the outside organization. Financial Statement Presentation - University follows all applicable GASB pronouncements. Pursuant to GASB Statement No. 35 , Basic Financial Statement and Management's Discussion and Analysisfor Public Colleges and Universities , the University's activities are considered to be a single businesstype activity and accordingly, are reported in a single column in the financial statements. Businesstype activities are those that are financed in wh ole or part by funds received by external parties for goods or services. Basis of Accounting - The University's financial statements have been prepared using the economic resource measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recorded when an obligation has been incurred, regardless of the timing of cash flows. On the Statem ent of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, the University defines operating activities as those generally resulting from an exchange transaction. Nearly all of the University's expenses are from exchange transactions, which involve the exchange of equivalent values such as payments for goods or services. Non operating revenues or expenses are tho se in which the University receives or gives value without directly giving or receiving equal value, such as State and Federal appropriations, Federal Pell grants, private gifts, and investment income. The financial statements for the Pension Trust Funds have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Benefits and re funds are recognized when due and payable. Investments are reported at fair value. Combining financial statements for these funds are presented in Note 17. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments - Cash and cash equivalents consist of the University's bank deposits, repurchase agreements, money market funds, and other investments with original m aturities of three months or less. Investment assets are carried at fair value based primarily on market quotations. Purchases and sales of UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 43 investments are accounted for on the trade date basis. Investment settlements receivable and investment settlements payable represent investment transactions occurring on or before June 30, which settle after that date. Investment income is recorded on the accrual basis. Net unrealized gains (losses) are included in investment and endowment income in the Stateme nt of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position. Nonmarketable alternative investments and certain commingled funds are recorded based on valuations provided by the general partners of the respective partnerships. The University believes that the carrying value of these investments is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Because alternative investments are not readily marketable, the estimated va lue is subject to uncertainty and therefore may differ materially from the value that would have been used had a ready market for investments existed. Derivative instruments such as forward foreign currency contracts are recorded at fair value. The University enters into forward foreign currency con tracts to reduce the foreign exchange rate exposure of its international investments. These contracts are marked to market, with the changes in market value being reported in investment and endowment income on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position. Pledges Receivable - The University receives unconditional promises to gi ve through private donations (pledges) from corporations, alumni and various other supporters of the University. Revenue is recognized when a pledge is received and all eligibility requirements, including time requirements, are met. These pledges have been recorded as pledges receivable on the Statement of Net Position and as private or capital gift re venues on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position, at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The rate used to discount the present value is based on the seven year treasury bill rate as of June 30 of each fiscal ye ar. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the University used a discount rate of 0.49% and 1.87%, respectively. An allowance of $20,310,000 and $20,474,000 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, has been made for uncollectible pledges based upon management's expectations regarding the collection of the pledges an d the University's historical collection experience. Inventories - These assets are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on an average cost basis except for MU Health Care's inventories, for which cost is determined using the firstin, firstout method. Capital Assets - If pur chased, these assets are carried at cost or, if donated, at fair value at the date of gift. The University capitalizes assets with useful lives greater than one year and acquisition cost greater than or equal to $5,000. Depreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the assets' estima ted useful lives - generally ten to forty years for buildings and improvements, eight to twentyfive years for infrastructure, three to fifteen years for equipment and twenty years for library materials. American Hospital Association useful life guidelines are followed for capital assets that are medical in nature. Equipment under capital lease obligations is amortized on th e straightline basis over the shorter period of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the equipment. Net interest expense incurred during the construction of debtfinanced facilities is included when capitalizing resulting assets. The University capitalizes works of art, as these collections gener ally consist of historical artifacts and artworks, they are considered inexhaustible and not subject to depreciation. The University does not capitalize collections of historical treasures held for public exhibition, education, research, and public service. These collections are not disposed of for financial gain and, accordingly, are not capitalized for financial state ment purposes. Proceeds from the sale, exchange, or other disposal of such items must be used to acquire additional items for the same collection. Land is considered inexhaustible and is not subject to depreciation. Deferred Outflows of Resources - The University reports the consumption of net position that relates to fut ure reporting periods as deferred outflows of resources in a separate section of the Statements of Net Position. Unearned Revenue - Unearned revenues are recognized for amounts received prior to the end of the fiscal year but related to the subsequent period, including certain tuition, fees, and auxiliary revenues. Unearned revenues also include grant and co ntract amounts that have been received but not yet earned. Noncurrent unearned revenue relates to amounts received for capital projects or for the portion of multiyear grant funding related to future years. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 44 Compensated Absences - Compensated absences include accumulated unpaid vacation and compensatory time accrued as well as related employer payroll taxes. An expense and related liability are recognized as vacation and compensatory benefits are earned. Sick leave benefits expected to be realized as paid time off are recognized as expense when the time of f occurs and no liability is accrued for such benefits employees have earned but not yet realized. Deferred Inflows of Resources - The University reports the acquisition of net position that relates to future reporting periods as deferred inflows of resources in a separate section of the Statements of Net Position. Pensio n and Other Postemployment Benefits - Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) related items, including: net pension liability and net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, net pension expense and net OPEB expense, fiduciary net assets, additions to and deductions from fiduciary net assets have been determined on th e same basis as they are reported by the respective pension and OPEB plans. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. Net Position - The University's ne t position is classified as follows: Net Investment in Capital Assets represents capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and outstanding principal debt balances related to the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. Restricted Nonexpendable net position is subject to externally imposed stipulations that the principal be maintained in per petuity, such as the University's permanent endowment funds. The University's policy permits any realized and unrealized appreciation to remain with these endowments after the spending distribution discussed in Note 3. Restricted Expendable net position is subject to externally imposed stipulations on the University's use of the resources. Unrestricted net position is not s ubject to externally imposed stipulations, but may be designated for specific purposes by the University's management or the Board of Curators. Unrestricted net position is derived from tuition and fees, sales and services, unrestricted gifts, investment income, and other such sources, and are used for academics and the gen eral operation of the University. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for expenditure, the University's policy is to first apply restricted resources, and then the unrestricted resources. Medical Alliance, CSS, and CFMS, as notforprofit organizations, record net position in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Stan dards Codification 958205, NotforProfit Entities Presentation of Financial Statements . For presentation within the University's accompanying basic financial statements, the net position is redistributed amongst the net position components defined by GASB Statement No. 63. Tuition and Fees, Net of Scholarship Allowances - Student tuition and fees, housing, di ning, and other similar auxiliary revenues are reported net of any related scholarships and fellowships applied to student accounts. However, scholarships and fellowships paid directly to students are separately reported as scholarship and fellowship expenses. Patient Medical Services, Net - Patient medical services are primarily provided through University of Missouri Hospital s and Clinics, Ellis Fischel Cancer Research Center, Women's and Children's Hospital, University Physicians, and the Medical Alliance. The University has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discount charges, and per diem payme nts. Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, thirdparty payors, and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with thirdparty payors. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adj usted in future periods as estimates are refined and final settlements are determined. Net patient service revenue is also shown net of estimated uncollectible accounts. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 45 Amounts receivable under Medicare and Tricare/Champus reimbursement agreements are subject to examination and certain retroactive adjustments by the related programs. These adjustments increased net patient services revenues by $14,507,000 and $980,000 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Medicaid program reimburses inpatient services on a prospective established pe r diem rate. The Medicaid program reimburses outpatient services under a combination of prospective and fee schedule amounts. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the MU Health Care's percentage of gross patient accounts receivable classified by major payor is as follows: 2020 2019 100% 100%Table 1.1 - Percentage of Gross Patient Accounts Receivable (by Major Payor) Patient services revenue includes the State of Missouri Federal Reimbursement Allowance Program (FRA Program) for uncompensated care. MU Health Care recognizes FRA Program revenue in the period earned. The Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position reflect the gross to net patient medical services revenue as follows: 2020 2019 Patient Medical Services Revenue, Gross 4,190,212 $ 4,066,988$ Deductions for Contractuals (2,591,405) (2,482,756) Deductions for Bad Debt (93,383) (74,208) Patient Medical Services Revenue, Net 1,505,424 $ 1,510,024$ Table 1.2 - Gross to Net Patient Medical Services Revenue (in thousands) Uncompensated Care The University provides some services to patients without regard to their ability to pay for those services. For some of its patient services, the University receives no payment or payment that is less than the full cost of providing the services. The estimated costs of providing these services are as follows: 2020 2019 Cost of Charity Care 34,619 $ 38,171$ Unreimbursed cost under state and local government assistance programs, net of Medicaid disproportionate share funding, less Medicaid provider taxes 17,542 (1,288) Cost of uncollectible accounts 35,739 35,598 Total Uncompensated Care 87,900 $ 72,481$ Table 1.3 - Uncompensated Care Revenue (in thousands) New Accounting Pronouncements - The University adopted GASB Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities , for fiscal year 2020. GASB No. 84 intends to enhance consistency and comparability on how fiduciary activities are reported by providing additional guidance on what qualifies as a fiduciary activity. The adoption of this statement resulted in a shift of various f unds previously classified as agency, which were reported as an asset and liability on the University's Statement of Net Position, to a classification of University operating funds. The funds that were not recategorized are reported as Custodial Funds in the fiduciary fund statements. Starting in fiscal year 20 19, as restated, these recategorized funds are reported as assets and liabilities on the Statement of Net Position. Additionally, amounts previously reported as Funds Held for Others are reported in Net Position on the Statement of Net Position. The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position reports the curre nt year activity for revenues and expenses; resulting in an increase in beginning Net Position of $25,237,000 and an increase in the Change in Net Position of $7,843,000 for fiscal year 2019. The funds that are classified as Custodial as a result of implementing GASB No. 84 are reported on th e University's Statement of Fiduciary Net Position in addition to the Retirement and OPEB funds. The impact on implementing this statement increased Fiduciary Net Position by $71,557,000 for fiscal year 2019. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 46 Effective for fiscal year 2020, the University adopted paragraphs 11 and 13 of GASB Statement No. 92, Omnibus, which had effective dates that were due immediately upon issuance. Paragraph 11 allows for insurance recoveries for risk financing and insurance related activities of public entity risk pools that are recoverable from reinsurers or excess insurer s to be reported as a reduction of expense. The adoption of the statement had no effect on the University's financials as these amounts are already reported as a reduction of expenses. Paragraph 13, changes the term \"derivative\" to \"derivative instruments\" throughout GASB pronouncements. The University has made the sa me change in terminology within its statements. Effective for fiscal year 2019, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations , which establishes criteria for determining recognition of a liability and corresponding deferred outflows of resources for legally enforceable liabilities associated with the retirement of certain tangible capital assets. The adoption of this statem ent increased liabilities by $62.4 million and deferred outflows of resources by $59.9 million, after amortization of $2.5 million, as of fiscal year 2018. There was no effect on beginning net position as of July 1, 2017 and the fiscal year 2018 increase in net position was reduce d by $2.5 million as a result of adopting GASB 83. Effective for fiscal year 2019, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, including Direct Borrowings and Direct Placements, which requires additional disclosures regarding certain types of debt. The adoption of this statement ha d no effect on the University's financial statements. In June 2017, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 87, Leases , which requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities that were previously classified as operating leases. The University will adopt this statement in fiscal year 2022 and has not fully determined the effe ct of implementing GASB Statement No. 87 will have on its financial statements. In June 2018, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Construction Period , which requires interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period to be recognized as an expe nse in the period in which the cost is incurred and thereby not capitalized as part of the historical cost of a capital asset. The University will adopt this statement in fiscal year 2021 and has not fully determined the effect of implementing GASB Statement No. 89 will have on its financial st atements. In August 2018, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 90, Majority Equity Interests , which modifies guidance for reporting a legally separate organization in which the government has a majority equity interest to be reported as either an investment or component unit. The University will adopt this statement in fiscal year 20 21 and has not fully determined the effect of implementing GASB Statement No. 90 will have on its financial statements. In May 2019, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 91, Conduit Debt Obligations , which provides a single method of reporting conduit debt obligations by issuers. The University will adopt th is statement in fiscal year 2023 and has not fully determined the impact of implementing GASB Statement No. 91 will have on its financial statements. In January 2020, GASB issued GASB No. 92, Omnibus 2020, which provides clarifying guidance for specific issues related to leases, intraentity transfers of assets, postemployme nt benefits, government acquisitions, risk financing and insurance related activities of public entity risk pools, fair value measurements, and derivative instruments. The University adopted paragraphs 11 and 13 in fiscal year 2020 and will adopt the rest of the statement in fiscal year 2022. The University has not fu lly determined the impact of implementing GASB Statement No. 92 will have on its financial statements. In March 2020, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 93, Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates , which removes LIBOR as a benchmark for interest rates. This statement is in response to the global reference rate reform that is expecte d to cause LIBOR to cease to exist. The University will adopt this statement in fiscal year 2024 and has not fully determined the impact of implementing GASB Statement No. 93 will have on its financial statements. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 47 In March 2020, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 94, Public Private and PublicPublic Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements , which addresses issues with publicprivate and publicpublic (PPP) arrangements. The University will adopt this statement in fiscal year 2023 and has not fully determined the impact of implementing GASB Statement No. 93 will have on its financial statements. In Ma y 2020, GASB issued GASB Statement No. 96, Subscription Based Information Technology Arrangements , which provides accounting and financial reporting guidance for subscription based information technology arrangements. These arrangements would require the recognition of a right touse asset and correspon ding subscription liability, which would be amortized as interest expense over the term of the arrangement.

The University will adopt this statement in fiscal year 2022 and has not fully determined the impact of implementing GASB Sta tement No. 97 will have on its financial statements. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, deferred outflows of resour ces, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Custodial Credit Risk - The custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the University's deposits may not be recovered. State law requires collateralization of all deposits with federal depository insurance, bonds and other obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agencies and instrumentalities of the St ate of Missouri; bonds of any city, county, school district or special road district of the State of Missouri; bonds of any state; or a surety bond having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount of the deposits. All cash deposits were fully insured or collateralized as of J une 30, 2020. As of June 2019, approximately $726,000 of the University's cash deposits were uninsured or collateralized. 3. INVESTMENTS Investment policies are established by the Board of Curators (\"the Board\"). The policies ensure that funds are managed in accordance with Section 105.688 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri and prudent investment practices. Additionally, investment policies established by the Board with respect to the Retirement Trust and Other Postemployment Benefit (\"OPEB\") Trus t (collectively referred to as \"Pension Trust Funds\") and the Endowment Funds specifically recognize the fiduciary duties set forth in Section 105.688 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri. The use of external investment managers has been authorized by the Board. Substantially all University cash and investments are managed centrally, generally in the following investment pools: General Pool - General Pool c ontains shortterm University funds, including but not limited to cash and reserves, operating funds, bond funds, and plant funds. Subject to various limitations contained within the corresponding investment policy, the University's internally managed component of the General Pool may be invested in the following instruments: U. S. Government securities; U.S. Government Agency securities; U.S. Government guaranteed securities; money market funds; certificates of deposit; repurchase agreements; commercial paper; and other similar shortterm investment instruments of like or better quality. The externally managed component of the General Pool is allowed to invest in th e following asset sectors: fixed income, private debt, absolute return and risk balanced strategies. The General Pool's total return, including unrealized gains and losses, was 0.2% and 3.3% for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. General Pool assets that are held in Custodial Funds are reported as Cash and Ca sh Equivalents and Pooled Investments on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. The assets held in Custodial funds are for the benefit of outside organizations and are not separately reported in the notes to the financial statements. Custodial funds earn a set rate on the cash balance held in th e General Pool and are not subjected to the pool's investment market volatility. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 48 Endowment Funds - When appropriate and permissible, endowment and similar funds are pooled for investment purposes, with the objective of achieving longterm returns sufficient to preserve principal by protecting against inflation and to meet endowment spending targets. The Endowment Pool, which is externally managed, is the primary investment vehicle for endowment funds. S ubject to various limitations contained within the corresponding investment policy, the Endowment Pool is allowed to invest in the following asset sectors: global equity, absolute return strategies, private equity, real estate, sovereign bonds, private debt, commodities, global inflationlinked bonds, and risk balanced strategies. The Endowment Pool's total return, in cluding unrealized gains and losses, was 1.2% and 5.7% for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If a donor has not provided specific restrictions, state law permits the Board to appropriate an amount of the Endowment Funds' net appreciation, realized and unrealized, as the Board considers to be prud ent. In establishing this amount, the Board is required to consider the University's long and shortterm needs, present and anticipated financial requirements, expected total return on investments, price level trends, and general economic conditions. Further, any expenditure of net appreciation is required to be for the purposes for whi ch the endowment was established. Inclusive of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, donorrestricted endowments experienced net appreciation of approximately $35,533,000 and $68,675,000 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Board has adopted the total return concept (yield plus change in market value) in determining the spe ndable return for endowments and similar funds. The spending formula was revised in fiscal year 2018 to distribute 4.0% of a trailing 28quarter average of the endowment's total market value as of December 31st of the prior fiscal year, with the understanding that this spending rate over the long term should not exceed the total real return (net of inflation). The transition from 4.5% to 4.0% is being phased in over a period of no longer than seven years ending June 30, 2024 to avoid a ye ar over year decrease in distributions. In addition, the University distributes 1.25% of the trailing 28 quarter average of the endowment's total market value to support internal endowment and development administration. Endowment Pool assets that are held in Custodial Funds are reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents and Pooled Investments on the St atement of Fiduciary Net Position. The assets held in Custodial funds are for the benefit of outside organizations and are not separately reported in the notes to the financial statements. Custodial funds earn a set rate on the cash balance held in the Endowment Pool and are not subje cted to the pool's investment market volatility. PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST FUNDS The Retirement Trust and the OPEB Trust hold the assets of the Retirement Plan and OPEB Plan, respectively. Subject to various limitations contained within the corresponding investment policy, the externally managed Retirement Trust is allowed to invest in the following asset sector s: global equity, absolute return strategies, private equity, real estate, sovereign bonds, private debt, commodities, global inflationlinked bonds, and risk balanced strategies. The Retirement Trust's total return, including unrealized gains and losses, was 0.6% and 5.2% for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2 019, respectively. The Retirement Trust held $3,654,744,000 and $3,757,413,000 of net position at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The OPEB Trust held $39,366,000 and $38,426,000 of net position at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Subject to various limitations contained within the corresponding investment policy, the externally managed OP EB Trust is allowed to invest in the following asset sectors: global fixed income, global equity, and absolute return strategies.

In accordance with its policy, the University minimizes custodial credi t risk by establishing limitations on the types of instruments held with qualifying institutions. Repurchase agreements must be collateralized by U.S. Government issues and/or U.S. Government Agency issues. All University and Pension Trust Fund investments are insured or registered and are held by the University, the Pension Trust Funds or an age nt in its name. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 50 Concentration of Credit Risk - Concentration of credit risk is the risk associated with a lack of diversification, such as having substantial investments in a few individual issuers, thereby exposing the organization to greater risks resulting from adverse economic, political, regulatory, geographic or credit developments. The investment policies for the General Pool, End owment Funds, and Retirement Trust all specify diversification requirements across asset sectors. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, of the University's total investments and cash and cash equivalents were 16.8% and 16.7%, respectively, in issues of U.S. Treasury Notes. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Pension Trust Fu nd's total investments and cash and cash equivalents were 7.6% and 7.0%, respectively, in issues U.S. Treasury Notes. Investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, as well as investments in mutual funds and other pooled investments are excluded from consideration when evaluating concentration risk. Credit Risk - Debt securities are subje ct to credit risk, which is the chance that an issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make these payments will cause security prices to decline. These circumstances may arise due to a variety of fa ctors such as financial weakness, bankruptcy, litigation and/or adverse political developments. Certain debt securities, primarily obligations of the U.S. government or those explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are not considered to have credit risk. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) assign credit ratings to security issues and issuers th at indicate a measure of potential credit risk to investors. Debt securities considered investment grade are those rated at least Baa by Moody's and BBB by S&P. For General Pool investments, the following minimum credit ratings have been established to manage credit risk with minimum rating of A1/P1 for comm ercial paper and other short term securities. For Endowment Funds and Retirement Trust investments, guidelines for respective investment managers allow for a blend of different credit ratings, subject to certain restrictions by asset sector. In all cases, disposition of securities whose ratings have been downgra ded after purchase is generally left to the discretion of the respective investment manager after consideration of individual facts and circumstances . All holdings of money market funds were rated AAA at June 30, 2020 and 2019. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 51 Based on investment ratings provided by Moody's or S&P, the University's and Pension Trust Funds' credit risk exposure as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, is as follows: Table 3.2 - Debt Securities by Type and Credit Rating (in thousands) As of June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 U.S. Treasury Obligations 817,564 $ 771,356$ 291,125 $ 273,661 $ U.S. Agency Obligations 7,523 3,176 Asset Backed Securities Mortgage Backed Securities Guaranteed University of MissouriUniversity of Missouri Pension and OP EB Trust Funds UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 52 Interest Rate Risk - Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates over time will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Debt securities with longer maturities are likely to be subject to more variability in their fair values as a result of future changes in interest rate s. Neither the University nor the Pension Trust Funds have a formal policy that addresses interest rate risk; rather, such risk is managed by each individual investment manager, as applicable. The University and Pension Trust Funds have investments in assetbacked securities, which consist primarily of mortgage backed securities guaranteed by U. S. agencies and corporate collateralized mortgage obligations. These securities are based on cash flows from principal and interest payments on the underlying securities. An asset backed security may have repayments that vary significantly with changes in market interest rates. Table 3.3 presents the modified durations of the University's and Pension Trust Fun ds' debt securities as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively: As of June 30, U.S. Treasury Obligations 817,564 $ 6.7 771,356 $ 6.5 U.S. Agency Obligations 7,523 6.0 3,176 4.6 AssetBacked Securities 766,654 2.2 637,214 2.9 Government Foreign 39,352 9.3 34,885 5.3 Corporate Domestic 166,081 4.9 140,315 3.3 Corporate Foreign 129,357 3.6 128,614 3.4 Total Debt Securities 1,926,531$ 4.6 1,715,560 $ 4.6 As of June 30, U.S. Treasury Obligations 291,125 $ 8.6 273,661 $ 13.9 AssetBacked Securities 91,506 2.5 72,582 2.9 Government Foreign 9,525 5.1 8,364 5.8 Corporate Domestic 18,856 1.6 16,977 3.5 Corporate Foreign 23,193 0.5 24,032 3.1 Total Debt Securities 434,205 $ 6.5 395,616 $ 10.6 University of Missouri Duration (in years) 2020 20192020 2019Table 3.3 - Debt Securities by Type and Modified Duration (in thousands) University of Missouri Pension and OPEB Trust Duration (in years) Foreign Exchange Risk - Foreign exchange risk is the risk that investments denominated in foreign currencies may lose value due to adverse fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. University and Retirement Trust investment policies allow for exposure to nonU.S. dollar denominated equities and fixed income securities, whi ch may be fully or partially hedged using forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Forward foreign currency contracts are typically used to manage the risks related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the time of purchase or sale and the actual settlement of foreign securities. Various investment ma nagers acting on behalf of the University may use forward foreign exchange contracts in riskbased transactions to carry out their portfolio strategies, subject to investment management agreement guidelines. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, 7.3% and 10.9%, respectively, of the University's total investments and cash and cash equivalents were denomina ted in foreign currencies. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, 12.6% and 17.3%, respectively, of the Pension Trust Funds' total investments and cash equivalents were denominated in foreign currencies.

Certain commingled funds may use derivative instruments, short positions and leverage as part of their investment strategy. These investments are structured to limit risk exposure to th e amount of invested capital. Commingled funds have liquidity (redemption) provisions, which enable the University and Pension Trust Funds to make full or partial withdrawals with notice, subject to restrictions on the timing and amount. Nonmarketable Alternative Investments Consists of limited partnerships involving an advance commitment of capital called by th e general partner as needed and distributions of capital and return on invested capital as underlying strategies are concluded during the life of the partnership. The committed but unpaid obligation to these limited partnerships is disclosed in Note 4. Portable Alpha Program Included in the University's investment policy is a Portable Al pha Program in which synthetic market exposures across asset classes including equities, sovereign bonds, inflationlinked bonds and commodities may be obtained through derivative instruments commonly accepted by other institutional investors, such as futures, swaps, options, forward contracts and reverse repurchase agreements. These derivative instruments are managed by external investment firms with appropriate exper tise, experience and depth of resources. When synthetic market exposures are obtained through derivative instruments, a portion of the resulting cash and cash equivalent balances may be invested by active alpha managers seeking to add returns over the benchmark. These alpha managers will possess broadly diverse strategies/styles and, in the aggre gate, are expected to produce returns that show little or no relationship to the economic environment being experienced at any given time. Furthermore, this portfolio of managers will be constructed with a goal of low correlation to the synthetic market exposures obtained through the derivative instruments. The allowable range of the po rtable alpha portfolio for both the Endowment Pool and Pension Trust Funds shall be 0 25% of the total investment of the respective pools. As of June 30, 2020, the portable alpha portfolio was 17.5% and 18.5% for the Endowment Pool and Pension Trust Funds, respectively. Mana gement of liquidity risk is a critical component of the portable alpha program. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk that synthetic market exposures may need to be unwound at undesirable points in time in order to meet margin calls during volatile markets. To help mitigate this risk, prudent balan ces of cash and cash equivalents shall be maintained as part of the program and monitored daily. The cash margin target set by the Endowment Pool and Pension Trust Funds are 30%. In the case the margin drops below 30%, management has implemented guidelines to replenish the cash margin back to th e target. As of June 30, 2020, the cash margin for the Endowment Pool and Pension Trust Funds were above the targeted margin of 30%. Securities Lending Transactions - The University and Pension Trust Funds each participate in an external investment pool securities lending program to augment income. The pr ogram is administered by the custodial agent bank, which lends equity, government and corporate securities for a predetermined period of time to an independent broker/dealer (borrower) in exchange for collateral. Collateral may be cash, U.S. Government securities, defined letters of credit or other collateral approved by the University or Pension Trust Fun ds. Loaned domestic securities are initially collateralized at 102% of their fair value, while loaned international securities are collateralized at 105% of fair value. Exposure to credit risk from borrower default has been minimized by having the custodial agent bank determine daily that required collateral meets a minimum of 102% of th e fair value of loaned domestic securities and 105% for loaned international securities. For the University, at June 30, 2020 and 2019, there were a total of $32,164,000 and $20,580,000, respectively, of securities out on loan to borrowers. The value of collateral received from the borrower for these securities consisted of $1 ,261,000 and $3,616,000 in cash and $32,228,000 and $17,627,000 noncash collateral at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 55 For the Pension Trust Funds, at June 30, 2020 and 2019, there was a total of $180,994,000 and $158,266,000 of securities out on loan to borrowers. The value of collateral received from the borrower for these securities consisted of $146,540,000 and $106,182,000 in cash and $38,410,000 and $56,397,000 noncash collateral at June 30, 20 20 and 2019, respectively. Cash collateral received from the borrower is invested by the custodial agent bank in commingled collateral investment pools in the name of the University and Pension Trust Funds, with guidelines approved by each. The cash collateral received is shown as Investment of Cash Collateral in the Statement of Ne t Position and Statement of Fiduciary Net Position and reported at fair value, with changes in market value recorded in Investment and Endowment Income on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position and Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Noncash collateral received for securities lending activities is not re corded as an asset because the University and Pension Trust Funds do not have the ability to pledge or sell such collateral unless the borrower defaults. The University and Pension Trust Funds continue to receive interest and dividends during the loan period. The maturities of th e investments made with the cash collateral generally match the maturities of the securities lent. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, neither the University nor the Pension Trust Funds have any credit risk exposure arising from the actual securities lending transactions since the collateral received from the borrower exceeds the value of the securities lent. Fur ther, the University and Pension Trust Funds are fully indemnified by the custodial bank against any losses incurred as a result of borrower default.

FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The University categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurements and Application . The threetiered hierarchy for fair value is as follows: Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets th at are available at the measurement date. Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; Inputs other than quoted prices that ar e observable for the asset or liability; Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the University's own assumptions about th e inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumption about risk). Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances and may include the University's own data. When available, quoted prices are used to determine fair value. When quoted prices in active markets are available, investments are classified wi thin Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The University's Level 1 investments primarily consist of investments in U.S. Treasury obligations, equity securities, and mutual funds. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are based on evaluated prices received from the University's custodian of investments in con junction with a third party service provider and are reported within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs for Level 2 include, but are not limited to, pricing models such as benchmarking yields, reported trades, brokerdealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmarking securities, amo ng others. The University's Level 2 investments primarily consist of investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, assetbacked securities, and corporate debt securities that did not trade on the University's fiscal year end date. The University's Level 3 investments primarily consist of land held as investments. Certain investments are valued using the net asset value (N AV) per share (or its equivalent) and are considered \"alternative investments\" and, unlike more traditional investments, generally do not have readily obtainable market values and take the form of limited partnerships. The University values these investments based on the partnerships' audited financial statements. If June 30 statements are available, those va lues are used preferentially. However, some partnerships have fiscal years ending at other than June 30. If June 30 valuations are not available, the value is progressed from the most recently available valuation taking into account subsequent calls and distributions.

The remaining costs are expected to be funded from $119,573,000 of gifts and $75,841,000 of debt proceeds and state appropriations. Capital assets include equipment and a building facility under a cap ital lease of $4,723,000 and $10,364,000 and related accumulated depreciation of $98,000 and 10,195,000 at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Asset Retirement Obligation The University has an asset retirement obligation based on its ownership of two nuclear research reactors, which are regulated by the U.S. Nu clear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC requires the University to submit decommissioning funding plans every three years to retain the right to operate the reactors. The decommissioning funding plans update and adjust changes in costs to remediate and the extent of the estimated future contamination. The cost to decommission the reactors is based on a for mula as set forth by the NRC as part of the licensing of the facilities. The asset retirement obligation as of the end of fiscal year 2020 and 2019 was $62,433,000. A deferred outflow of resources is being amortized over 25 years, which approximates the estimated usefu l lives of the reactors. An asset retirement expense was recognized in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 for $2,497,000 each year and is reflected in depreciation expense on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position. The deferred outflows of resources at June 30, 2020 will be amortized ove r a remaining 22 years. 8.

Health Facilities Revenue Bonds Taxexempt revenue bonds have provided financing of capital facilities and refinancing of previously issued debt. The bonds were issued by the Health and Education Facilities Authority of the Sta te of Missouri (the Authority) on behalf of the Medical Alliance. Premium and the deferred financing costs are amortized on the effective interest method over the life of the respective bonds. The bonds are secured by the unrestricted receivables of the Medical Alliance. Under the terms of the Master Indenture, th e Medical Alliance is required to make payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds. In addition, the Master Indenture contains certain restrictions on the operations and activities of the Medical Alliance, including, among other things, covenants restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the creation of liens on propert y, except as permitted by the Master Indenture. The Master Indenture has mandatory sinking fund redemption requirements in which funds are required to be set aside beginning in 2021 for the Series 2011 bonds and monthly for the Series 2017 bonds.

Under each of the swap agreements, the University pays the swap counterpar ty a fixed interest rate payment and receives a variable rate interest rate payment that effectively changes a component of the University's variable interest rate debt to fixed rate debt. Table 10.3 presents the terms of the outstanding swaps and their fair values at June 30, 2020. Table 10.3 - Interest Rate Swaps (in thousands) Notional Effective Maturity Counterparty Type Amount Date Date Terms Fair Value Credit Rating Pay fixed; 40,000$ 7/18/2002 11/1/2032 Pay 3.950%; receive (16,477) 8/1/2026 variable of 1Month LIBOR Total 167,940$ (45,988)$ The 2002 and 2006 swaps do not specifically hedge any currently outstanding debt; rather, they serve to reduce the overall exposure to interest rate risk on the University's variable rate debt not otherwise specifically hedged. The notional amount of the 2002 swap is fixed over the life of the agreement. The notio nal amount of the 2006 swap decreases annually over the life of the swap. The 2007 swap specifically hedges System Facilities Revenue Bond Series 2007B, the effectiveness of which has been determined using the synthetic instrument method. The notional amount of the 2007 swap is equal to the outstanding balance of the Series 20 07B bonds. The University recognizes the fair value and corresponding changes in fair value of the outstanding swaps in the University's financial statements. Changes in fair value of the outstanding swaps, with respective financial statement presentation, are presented in Table 10.4: Table 10.4 - Interest Rate Swaps - Change in Fair Value (in thousands) Type 2020 2019 2002 Swap Investment Derivative (16,477) $ (11,906)$ N/A (4,571) $ Inv estment and Endowment Income, Net 2006 Swap Investment De va ti ve (9,318) (7,703) N/A (1,615) Inv estment and Endowment Income, Net Ca s h Flow Hedge (20,193) (15,933) N/A (4,260) Deferred Outflows of Resources Total (45,988)$ (10,446)$ Fair Value at June 30,Fair Value on AcquisitionChange in Fair Value Presentation of Cha nge in Fair Value Fair Value. There is a risk that the fair value of a swap could be adversely affected by changing market conditions. The fair values, developed using the zero coupon method with proprietary models, were prepared by the counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Bank of America, N.A., major U.S. financial institutions. The zero c oupon method calculates the future net settlement payments required by the swap, assuming that the current forward rates implied by the yield curve correctly anticipate future spot interest rates. These payments are then discounted using the spot rates implied by the current yield curve for hypothetical zero coupon b onds due on the date of each net settlement of the swap. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount the University would have either (paid) or received if the swap agreements were terminated on June 30, 2020. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 68 Credit Risk. Although the University has entered into the interest rate swaps with creditworthy financial institutions, there is credit risk for losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties. Subject to applicable netting arrangements, swap contracts with positive fair values are exposed to credit risk. The University faces a maximum pos sible loss equivalent to the amount of the derivative instrument's fair value. Subject to applicable netting arrangements, swaps with negative fair values are not exposed to credit risk. Collateral requirements apply to both parties for the 2002 and 2007 swaps and for the 2006 swap collateral requirements only apply to th e counterparty. The collateral requirements are determined by a combination of credit ratings and the aggregate fair value of swaps outstanding with each counterparty as presented in Table 10.5: Fair Value Credit Rating Threshold (S&P / Moody's) (in thousands) AAA/Aaa 50,000 $ AA+/Aa1 30,000 AA/Aa2 20,000 A+/A1 20,000 A/A2 10,000 A/A3 10,000 BBB+/Baa1 5,000 Table 10.5 - Swap Collateral Requirements If the aggregate fair value of swaps outstanding with each counterparty is positive and exceeds the fair value threshold for the applicable credit rating, the counterparties are required to post collateral. If the aggregate fair value of the 2002 and 2007 swaps is negative and exceeds the fair value threshold for the applicable credit rating, th e University is required to post collateral. Permitted collateral for either party includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agencies, cash, and commercial paper rated A1/P1 by S&P or Moody's, respectively. The negative aggregate fair value of the 2002 and 2007 swaps exceeded $30,000,000 on June 30, 2020, which is the current fa ir value threshold for the University given its Moody's rating of Aa1. As a result, the University posted collateral of $6,110,000 with the counterparty at June 30, 2020. Basis Risk. The variablerate payments received by the University on the 2007 swap are determined by 68% of one month LIBOR, whereas the interest rate s paid by the University on its variablerate bonds correspond to the SIFMA Index. The University is exposed to basis risk only to the extent that the historical relationship between these variable market rates changes going forward, resulting in a variablerate payment re ceived on the 2007 swap that is significantly less than the variablerate interest payment on the bonds. Termination Risk. The University is exposed to termination risk for the 2002 and 2007 interest rate swaps as the counterparty has the right to terminate the agreements in certain circumstances. For the 20 02 swap, the counterparty has a contractual right to terminate the agreement if the daily weighted average of the SIFMA Index for the preceding 30 calendar day period is greater than 7.00%. With regard to the 2007 swap, the counterparty has a contractual right to terminate the agreement if the daily weighted aver age of the SIFMA Index for the preceding 180 days is greater than 6.00%. The 2006 interest rate swap is not exposed to termination risk. The SIFMA Index was 0.13% at June 30, 2020. DebtRelated Items Presented as Deferred Outflows of Resources As required by GASB, th e University recognizes certain debtrelated items as deferred outflows of resources. The detail of the debt related items recognized as deferred outflows resources is presented in Table 10.6. 2020 2019 Swaps Cash Flow Hedge 20,193 $ 15,933$ Loss on Bond Defeasance 7,252 14,750 Deferred Outflows of Resources 27,445 $ 30,683$ Table 10.6 - Debt-Related Deferred Outflows of Resources (in thousands) For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 the amortization of the Loss on Bond Defeasance totaled $919,000 and $2,134,000, respectively, which increases interest expense.

All outstanding commercial paper was refinanced with the issuance of the University's System Facilities Revenues Bonds, Series 2020A and 2020B. On October 21 , 2011, the Board adopted a flexible financing program for the University referred to as the University's Commercial Paper Program (\"CP Program\"). The CP Program authorizes the periodic issuance of up to an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $375 million in Commercial Paper Notes. The initial term of the authorization is approximatel y fifteen years. The Commercial Paper Notes are limited obligations of the University secured by a pledge of the University's unrestricted revenues. \"Unrestricted revenues\" includes state appropriations for general operations, student fee revenues, and all other operating revenues of the University other than System Facilities Revenues. The primary objective of the CP Program is to provi de flexibility in managing the University's overall debt program to meet its various financial needs including: (a) financing capital projects, (b) allowing for the refunding/refinancing of outstanding debt, and (c) providing a readily accessible source of funds for various working capital purposes. Notes Payable Notes payable consist of unsecured loans from the Stat e Department of Natural Resources Energy Efficiency Leveraged Loan Program.

RISK MANAGEMENT The University is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; injuries to employees; natural disasters; medical malpractice; and various medically related benefit programs for employees. The University funds these losses through a combination of selfinsured retentions and commercially purchased insurance. Th e amount of selfinsurance funds and commercial insurance maintained are based upon analysis of historical information and actuarial estimates. Settled claims have not exceeded commercial coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. The liability for selfinsurance claims at June 30, 2020 and 2019 of $89,328,000 and $8 5,270,000, respectively, represents the present value of amounts estimated to have been incurred by those dates, using discount rates ranging from 1.00% to 3.50%, based on expected future investment yield assumptions. Changes in the selfinsurance liability during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows and are included in a ccrued liabilities (current) and other noncurrent liabilities (see note 9): Table 11.1 - Self-Insurance Claims Liability (in thousands) Fiscal YearBeginning of YearNew Claims and Changes in EstimatesClaim PaymentsEnd of 2020 $ 85,846 $ 222,659 $ (223,235)$ 85,270$ UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 72 12.

As of January 2010, MU Health Care began contracting for software usage and maintenance fees, as well as labor costs for approximately 100 fulltime equivalent employees, with the Cerner Corporation. This agreeme nt, called IT Works, represents the labor and software component of a cooperative relationship between MU Health Care and Cerner Corporation referred to as the Tiger Institute for Health Innovation (the Tiger Institute). The Tiger Institute is not a legally separate entity and is included within the financial statements of th e University. The Tiger Institute provides continued development of information technology within the clinical areas, as well as developing new technology initiatives in health information systems. As of June 30, 2020, this contracted commitment totaled $145,519,000 and will be paid in the following amounts: $27,224,000 2021, and $31,046,000 in 2025. In addition to the above commitment with Cerner Corporation, the Capital Region Medical Center (CRMC), as reported in the Medical Alliance, has entered into a strategic information technology agreement with Cerner Corporation. Cerner has assumed operational and administrative responsibilities for CR MC's technology environment and services. The agreement is effective through June 30, 2025 and will renew in five year increments at the end of the initial term. As of June 30, 2020, this contracted commitment totaled $33,514,000 and will be paid in the following amounts: $7,010,000 in 2021, $7,421,000 in 20 22, $7,210,000 and $6,173,000 in 2024, and $5,700,000 in 2025. The University entered into a Healthcare Delivery Agreement with Siemens Healthineers to commit to acquiring a comprehensive portfolio of equipment and applications as well as specialized consulting services, training and maintenance of equipment over a tenyear period. The pu rpose of the agreement is to develop and embrace innovative new technologies and to build new medical centers that are equipped with stateoftheart equipment. The University's total outlays for the equipment, applications and services are $133,735,000. The equipment is recorded as a capital asset and the outlays related to th e equipment is recorded as a capital lease and amortized over ten years. In addition, Siemens Healthineers and the University have each committed to provide a contribution with a fair market value up to $20 million towards joint research projects of the strategic alliance. Claims and Litigation The University is cur rently involved in various claims and pending legal actions related to matters arising from ordinary conduct of business. The University Administration believes that the ultimate disposition of the actions will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the University. Pollution Remediation The University has been working with the Voluntar y Cleanup Program of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) to characterize subsurface contamination on a University owned property. The University has received the results of the twoyear sampling process in fiscal year 2016. The University is awaiting a determination from MDNR. The site is now on the National Reg ulatory Commission (NRC) license and must be decommissioned. Upon further review of the documents, the University determined that it does not believe that the documents support the decision to add the site to the NRC license due to an overestimated quantity of isotopes managed at the site. The University made a formal UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 73 request to remove the site from the NRC license. NRC responded with a request for more information including a dose assessment, which is estimated to cost $15,000. If the NRC finds the dose assessment to be unacceptable, then the University will be required to fully decommission the site, including a sampling pla n. The cost of a sampling plan to characterize the chemical contamination is estimated at $1,000,000. The University has not commenced any actions requiring the recognition of a liability for this property. 13. RETIREMENT, DISABILITY, AND DEATH BENEFIT PLAN DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN Plan Description - the Retirement Plan is a single employer, defined benefit plan for all qualified employees. As authorized by Section 172.300, Revised Statutes of Missouri, the University's Board of Curators administers the Retirement Plan and establishes its terms. Benefits provided Fulltime employees vest in the Retirement Pl an after five years of credited service and become eligible for benefits based on age and years of service. A vested employee who retires at age 65 or older is eligible for a lifetime annuity calculated at a certain rate times the credited service years times the compensation base (averag e compensation for the five highest consecutive salary years). The rate is 2.2% if the employee was hired before October 1, 2012, or 1.0% if the employee was hired after September 30, 2012. Academic members who provide summer teaching and research service receive additional summer service credit. The Board of Curators may periodi cally approve increases to the benefits paid to existing pensioners. However, vested members who leave the University prior to eligibility for retirement are not eligible for these pension increases. Table 13.1 - Retirement Plan Membership 2020 2019 Active Members 18,352 18,102 Inactive Vested Members Total Members 34,234 33,235 Vested employees who are at least age 55 and have ten years or more of credited service or age 60 with at least five years of service may choose early retirement with a reduced benefit. However, if the employee retires at age 62 and has at least 25 years of credited service, the ben efit is not reduced. Up to 30% of the retirement annuity can be taken in a lump sum payment. In addition, the standard annuity can be exchanged for an actuarially equivalent annuity selected from an array of options with joint and survivor, period certain, and guaranteed annual increase features. Vested emplo yees who terminate prior to retirement eligibility may elect to transfer the actuarial equivalent of their benefit to an Individual Retirement Account or into another employer's qualified plan that accepts such rollovers. The actuarial equivalent may also be taken in the form of a lump sum payment. In a ddition, the Retirement Plan allows vested employees who become disabled to continue accruing service credit until they retire. It also provides a preretirement death benefit for vested employees. The Retirement Plan provides a minimum value feature for vested employees who terminate or retire. The minimum value is calculated as the act uarial equivalent of 5% of the employee's eligible compensation invested at 7.5% per credited service year or the regularly calculated benefit. Plan Change in Fiscal Year 2020 - In April 2019, the University's Board of Curators approved a new retirement plan for newly hired or rehired employees starting Octo ber 1, 2019. Employees starting on or after that date, will be enrolled in a defined contribution plan and the defined benefit plan of the University will be closed to new entrants. Rehires on or after October 1, 2019 will also be enrolled into the new defined contribution plan regardless of their vested status in the defi ned benefit plan. Vested defined benefit employees that are rehired on or after October 1, 2019 will no longer receive creditable service credit within the defined benefit plan. Basis of Accounting - The Retirement Plan's accounting records are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Em ployer contributions to the Retirement Plan are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with terms of the Retirement Plan. The Retirement Plan does not issue a separate financial report. Investment Valuation - In vestments are reported at fair value. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 74 Contributions - The University's contributions to the Retirement Plan are equal to the actuarially determined employer contribution requirement (ADC). The ADC for those employees hired before October 1, 2012 averaged 11.4% and 11.2% of covered payroll for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The ADC for those employees hired af ter September 30, 2012 averaged 7.8% and 7.5% of covered payroll for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Employees are required to contribute 1% of their salary up to $50,000 in a calendar year and 2% of their salary in excess of $50,000. An actuarial valuation of the Plan is performed annually and th e University's contribution rate is updated at the beginning of the University's fiscal year on July 1, to reflect the actuarially determined funding requirement from the most recent valuation, as of the preceding October 1. This actuarial valuation reflects the adoption of any Retirement Plan amendm ents during the previous fiscal year. The University contributed $118,234,000 and $115,980,000 during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net Pension Liability - The University's net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determine d by an actuarial valuation as of October 1, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Rollforward procedures were used to measure the Retirement Plan's total pension liability as of June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Actuarial assumptions for October 1, 2019 and 2018 included: Inflation 2.20% Rate of Investment Return net of administrative expenses (including inflation) 7.20% Projected salary increases (Including inflation) 3.6 4.5% Costofliving adjustments 0% For purposes of determining actuarially required contributions, the actuarial value of assets was determined using techniques that spread effects of shortterm volatility in the market value of investments over a 5year period. The underfunded actuarial accrued liability is being amortized as a level dollar amount on a closed basis over 24 and 25 years fr om the October 1, 2019 and 2018 valuation dates, respectively. Mortality rates were based on the RP 2014 Combined Health Mortality Table projected using Scale MP2017 and RP2000 Combined Health Mortality Table projected to 2023 using Scale BB for October 1, 2019 and 20 18 valuation dates, respectively. The actuarial assumptions used in the October 1, 2019 and 2018 valuation were based on the results of the most recent quinquennial study of the University's own experience covering 2012 to 2016. Discount Rate The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7. 20%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that University contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between actuarially determined contribution rates and the employee rate. Based on those assumptions, the pe nsion plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the longterm expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension li ability. Rate2020 Net Pension Liability2019 Net Pension Liability (in thousands)Table 13.3 Sensitivity of the Net Liability to Changes in the Discount Annual Rate of Return The annual moneyweighted rate of return is calculated as the internal rate of return on pension investments, net of pension plan investment expense. The moneyweighted rate of return expresses investment performance, net of pension plan investment expense, adjusted for the changing amounts actually invested. Th e annual moneyweighted rate of return on pension plan investments for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was 0.6% and 5.2%, respectively.

Annual pension expense consists of service cost and interest on the pension liability less employee contributions and projected earnings on pension plan investments. The difference between actual and expe cted earnings is recorded as deferred outflows/inflows of resources and recognized in pension expense over a five year period.

Differences between expected and actual experience on actuarial assumptions are amortized over the average expected remaining service life of the University's employees. The following table summarizes the fu ture recognition of these items: of Totaldeferred outflows/(inflows) (in thousands) DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN Plan Description Employees hired after September 30, 2012 participate in a single employer, defined contribution plan. Each year the University contributes 2% of each employee's eligible salary to a 401(a) plan. Employees are able to contribute to a 457(b) and 403 (b) plan. The University will match up to 3% of the employee's contrib ution to the 457(b) plan with the University's match funds going into the 401(a) plan. Employees hired or rehired beginning October 1, 2019, will participate in a single employer, defined contribution plan. Employees will be automatically enrolled in the plan to contribute 8% of eligible salary in to a 457(b) plan. Each year the University will match up to 8% of each employee's eligible salary to a 401(a) plan. Employees in the defined contribution plans are immediately 100% vested in their contributions. The University's matching contributions vest following three years of consecutive or nonconsecutive service. The defi ned contribution plan recognized $26,781,000 and $19,212,000 of expense net of forfeitures of $3,720,000 and $3,994,000 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.14. OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Plan Description - In addition to the pension benefits described in Note 13, the University operates a single employer, defined benefit OPEB plan. The University's Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Plan provides postemployment medical, dental, and life insurance benefits to employees who retire from the University after attaining age 55 and before reac hing age 60 with ten or more years of service, or after attaining age 60 with five or more years of service. As of January 1, 2018, employees must be 60 years old and have 20 years of service at the date of retirement to access the same percentage subsidy as retirees prior to January 1, 20 18. Employees with age plus years of service less than 80 but with more than 5 years of service as of January 1, 2018 will receive a subsidy of $100 per year of service up to a maximum of $2,500 annually. Employees with less than 5 years of service as of Januar y 1, 2018 will not receive an insurance subsidy or be eligible to participate in the University's plans. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, 8,309 and 9,208 retirees, respectively, were receiving benefits, and an estimated 8,907 active University employees may become eligible to receive future be nefits under the plan. Postemployment medical, dental and life insurance benefits are also provided to longterm disability claimants who were vested in the University's Retirement Plan at the date the disability began, provided the onset date of the disability was on or after September 1, 1990. As of June 30 , 2020 and 2019, 119 and 123 longterm disability claimants, respectively, met those eligibility requirements. The terms and conditions governing the postemployment benefits to which employees are entitled are at the sole authority and discretion of the University's Board of Curators. Basis of Accounting - The OPEB Plan's financial statements are pre pared using the accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with GASB Statement No. 74. Additionally, the requirements of GASB Statement No. 75 are followed by the University for reporting its OPEB obligations and related footnote and required supplementary information disclosures. The assets of the OPEB Trust Fund ar e irrevocable and legally protected from creditors and dedicated to providing postemployment benefits in accordance with terms of the plan. The OPEB Plan does not issue a separate financial report. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 78 Contributions and Reserves - Contribution requirements of employees and the University are established and may be amended by the University's Board of Curators. For employees retiring prior to September 1, 1990, the University contributes 2/3 of the medical benefits premium and 1/2 of the dental plan premium. For employees who retired on or after Septe mber 1, 1990, the University contributes toward premiums based on the employee's length of service and age at retirement. The University makes available two group term life insurance options. Option A coverage is equal to the retiree's salary at the date of retirement, while Option B is equal to two times that amo unt. For each Option, graded decreases in coverage are made when the retiree attains specific age levels. The University pays the full cost of Option A and approximately 91% of the cost of Option B coverage. Coverage for group term life insurance ends on January 1 following the r etiree's 70th birthday. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, participants contributed $17,763,000 and $17,378,000, or approximately 52.4% and 50.8% respectively, of total premiums through their required contributions, which vary depending on the plan and coverage selection. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the University contributed $ 20,672,000 and $23,363,000 respectively. The University makes available two longterm disability options to its employees. Option A coverage is equal to 60% of the employee's salary on the date the disability began, when integrated with benefits from all other sources. Option B coverage is equal to 662/3% of the em ployee's salary, integrated so that benefits from all sources will not exceed 85% of the employee's salary. Both options have a 149 day waiting period and provide benefits until age 65. The University pays the full cost of the Option A premium, while employees enrolled in Option B pay the additio nal cost over the Optional A premium. Net OPEB Liability - The total and net OPEB liabilities as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 were measured as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using actuarial valuations as of those dates.

The entry age normal, as a level percent of pay, actuarial cost method was used in the J une 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Actuarially determined amounts are subje ct to continual revision of actual results, are compared to past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The Schedule of Funding Progress, presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, will present multiyear trend information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasin g over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. Benefit projections for financial reporting purposes are based on the benefits provided under the terms of the substantive plan in effect at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of cost sharing between the em ployer and plan members to that point. The projection of benefits for financial reporting purposes does not explicitly incorporate the potential effects of legal or contractual funding limitations on the pattern of cost sharing between the University and plan members in the future. Total OPEB liability was determined using the following actuarial assumptions for al l periods presented, unless otherwise specified: Inflation 2.20% Total payroll growthVaries based on age: 0.1% to 6.0% (including inflation) for academic and administrative; 0.1% to 3.0% (including inflation) for clerical and service Discount Rate 2.21% for 2020 and 3.50% for 2019 Pre65 Medical and HSP Plans trend rate 7.00% decreasing by 0.25% per year until an ultimate trend of 4.5% is re ached Pre65 Rx trend rate 7.53% decreasing by 0.25% per year until an ultimate trend of 4.5% is reached Post65 Medical and Rx trend rate 5.00% decreasing by 0.25% per year until an ultimate trend of 4.50% is reached.

The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that the University would not make additional contributions to the OP EB Trust and would continue to fund the plan on a payasyougo basis. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB plan's fiduciary net position was not projected to cover a full year of projected future benefit payments. Therefore, all future benefit payments are discounted at the current index rate for 20 year , tax exempt general obligation municipal bonds with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher.

FINANCIAL IMPACTS FROM COVID-19 AND CARES ACT FUNDING On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated the SARSCoV2 virus and the incidence of COVID19 (COVID19) as a global pandemic. Higher education, patient volumes and the related revenues were significantly affected by COVID19 as various policies were implemented by federal, state, and local governments in response to the pa ndemic that led many people to remain at home and forced the closure of or limitations on certain businesses, as well as suspended elective procedures by health care facilities. Impact to Operations - The University suspended all in person classes and closed residence halls at all fo ur campuses effective March 16, 2020. In addition, all sports activities and travel abroad programs were suspended. As a health care provider, MU Health Care was affected significantly by the COVID19 pandemic. Effects ranged from general concerns from residents about going to hospitals to the limitation of elective surgeries. Elective surgeries were temporarily st opped and the volumes at the hospital dropped significantly. This led to decreased revenues and increased operating costs. As restrictions eased, nonessential medical and surgical procedures and suspended elective procedures resumed during the final quarter of the fiscal year. While some of these policies have been eased, some restrictions re main in place, and some state and local governments are reimposing certain restrictions due to increasing rates of COVID19 cases. COVID19 Planning, Execution and Response The University's pandemic response plan has multiple facets and continues to evolve as the pandemic unfolds. The University has taken pre cautionary steps to enhance its operational and financial flexibility, and react to the risks the COVID19 pandemic presents to its operations while UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 2020 Financial Report | UM System | page 88 maintaining a focus on the following priorities and the resources necessary to achieve them. Ensuring students receive a high quality education Supporting retention and recruitment of students Continuing research and scholarships, especially related to the public health crisis and precision health Supporting the University's response to the public health crisis and other enga gement activities Supporting activities that sustain or grow revenues for the University The University took significant actions to manage both personnel and nonpersonnel costs, including: A hiring and promotion freeze A freeze on raises, including merit raises A freeze on no nessential capital spending and real estate purchases Limits on travel, food, and discretionary purchases, unless related to the priorities listed above The University's health care leaders, staff, and faculty worked to develop and execute comprehensive plans to answer the challenges created by Covid19, which included the following: Incident Command System - Created to meet the challenges of the pandemic in the state and community. Testing - Created a drive up sample acquisition location to provide local testing of acquired samples within 24 hours. Communications - Collaborated with government officials to provide timely and accurate information to commu nicate with the public on a myriad of aspects of Covid19. In addition, the University was granted CARES Act funding of $34 million for higher education and $20 million for healthcare operations. For the higher education funding, $17 million must be provided as aid directly to students in need. As of June 30 , 2020, $47.3 million was recognized as government subsidies revenue. Ongoing Impact The extent of the COVID19 pandemic's adverse effect on the University's operating results and financial condition has been and will continue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond th e University's control and ability to forecast. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the scope and duration of social distancing measures, business closures and restrictions, and government imposed or recommended suspensions of elective procedures; as well as economic fallout from higher rates of unemployment. Because of these and other uncertainties, the University can not estimate the length or severity of the effect of the pandemic on its operations. Decreases in cash flows and results of operations may have an effect on debt covenant compliance and on the inputs and assumptions used in significant accounting estimates, including estimated bad debts an d contractual adjustments related to uninsured and other patient accounts. The ongoing pandemic may also impact the drivers of operating results, including but not limited to, tuition, health care revenue, research funding, investment returns and state funding on a forward basis. Like many higher education institutions around the country, the University is involved in litigation relate d to its decision to suspend inperson operations and transition to remote learning in response to COVID19. The plaintiffs in this litigation seek refunds of tuition and fees for the spring and summer 2020 semesters on behalf of all University students, along with other alleged dam ages and attorney's fees. The University has denied liability and moved to dismiss the claims. This litigation is at an early stage, and the University is unable to estimate the possibility or scope of future losses at this time. 19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In August 2020, the University signed an agreement to participate in federal subsidy programs as part of the CARES Act, which are flowing through the State for the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) and Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) funds. These funds are to be used to cover expenses necessary for the public health eme rgency with respect to COVID19. The total allocated to the University was $49 million. On October 11, 2020, the University announced the start of a new foundation, the Kummer Institute Foundation, that will benefit the University's science and technology campus. A donation of $300 million from an external do nor was given to the foundation, which will support a new school for innovation, entrepreneurship and economic development; provide scholarships and fellowships; as well as supporting research.

A positive ratio greater than 1.00 generally denotes strength. Composite Financial Index (CFI) provides a methodology for a single overall financial measurement of the institution's health based on th e four core ratios. The CFI uses a reasonable weighting plan and allows for a weakness or strength in a specific ratio to be offset by another ratio result, which provides a more balanced measure. The CFI provides a more holistic approach to understanding the financial health of the in stitution. The CFI scores are not intended to be precise measures; they are indicators of ranges of financial health that can be indicators of overall institutional wellbeing when combined with non financial indicators. Primary Reserve Ratio measures the financial strength of the institution by indicating how long the institution could f unction using its expendable reserves to cover operations should additional net position not be available. A positive ratio and an increasing amount over time denotes strength. Return on Net Position Ratio measures total economic return. While an increasing trend reflects strength, a decline may be appropriate and even warranted if it rep resents a strategy on the part of the institution to fulfill its mission. Net Operating Revenues Ratio measures whether the institution is living within available resources. A positive ratio and an increasing amount over time generally reflects strength. 2020 Financial Report | UM System | 98 CFI Ratio Calculations Statistical Section Supplementary Information Unaudited See Accompanying Independent Auditors' Report Primary Reserve Ratio (Expen dable Financ ial Resources to Operations) Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Net Position Unrestricted 1,291,499 $ 1,439,038 $ 1,378,360 $ 1,254,980$ 1,303,708$ 1,129,355$ Net Position Restricted Other 442,225 433,282 394,577 367,009 3,295,086$ Primary Reserve Ratio 0.50 0.54 0.55 0.52 0.54 0.54 Return on Net Position Ratio Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Change in Net Position (73,723) $ 186,835 $ 265,057 $ 404,002 $ 108,554 $ $ 4,987,049 $ 4,735,866 $ 4,401,336$ 2.4% 2.6% Net Operating Revenues Ratio (Annua l Operating Margin) Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Operating Inc (Loss) After State Appropriations (341,646) $ (221,955) $ (102,372) $ (76,683) $ 172,227 $ 179,613 $ 179,414 $ $ $ 3,474,699$ 3,400,818$ 3,083,373$ (a) Normalized investment income is equal to 5% of the rolling average balance of total cash and investments ov er the previous three fiscal years.
