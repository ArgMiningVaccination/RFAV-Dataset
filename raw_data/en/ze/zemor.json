Grants garnered by MCB faculty demonstrate the vigor of our research programs. Several are highlighted in this issue of Expression . Four MCB faculty have been awarded NIH R35 \"Maximizing Investigators' Research Award\" (MIRA) awards (Broderick, Core, Mellone) and another received a K02 \"Independent Scientist\" Career award (Campellone). Others have received R01s, R21s, and STTR awards, and those from other federal agencies, non-profit agencies and corporate sponsors. A number of faculty members have been awarded intramural PITCH funds/service and PATH funds for the development of new intellectual property arising from their work, and several patent applications for some of these discoveries have been submitted. Notably, we have also received a significant donation from Biohaven Pharmaceutical Company that was used in the summer of 2019 for a summer fellowship awarded to one of our doctoral students. MCB space allocations are also changing. We are adding a fifth location, in Gant Science Center, which will house the large-scale laboratory course teaching that is done by MCB faculty. Beach Hall currently houses modular, high- end skill-based courses in the PSM program, summer workshops for non-UConn undergraduates, and the experiential learning courses \"Tiny Earth Networking\" and \"SEA PHAGES/Virus Hunters.\" We are advocating for space in Torrey Life Sciences Building to enable us to add \"team science\" experiential research opportunities for the growing numbers of MCB Honors and University Scholars. Changes have also occurred in the MCB administrative office to meet the expanding needs of the department. With the dissolution of Biology Central Services, several new staff members have been hired since the department assumed additional administrative responsibilities including graduate student program management, human resource management, travel, and procurement work. Inside you can read about a number of exciting studies being conducted in MCB, including an analysis of the genome of horseshoe crabs and studies of a fish that beats the odds by rapidly adapting to new conditions. Fruit fly centromeres have been successfully sequenced in Dr. Barbara Mellone's lab, opening doors to new discoveries. A new feature, \"MCB in Review,\" summarizes review articles recently written by MCB professors. Among these is an article co-authored by Dr. Broderick about apparent sex bias in the choice of first authors on research articles. Finally, we invite MCB alumni to let us know of any new developments in your life that you would like to share here. We look forward to another year of outstanding achievements of our faculty, students, and alumni. From the Department Head Michael Lynes Professor and Head The Story Collider convened in October 2018 in Hartford to present stories about intellectual humility in science told by UConn scientists, including Prof. Sarah Hird. Story Collider travels the country presenting true, personal stories by about science told by professional scientists, engineers, doctors, and science students. The Hartford event was presented in partnership with the University of Connecticut's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Public Discourse Project. Hird holds a Master's degree from the University of Idaho and a PhD from Louisiana State University. After receiving her degree, she and her husband took postdoc positions at the University of California, Davis. Her story was about the time that she and her husband moved to California to start their positions. The time was filled with anticipation at the starts of their new scientific careers and at the prospect of starting a new family. At the time she was five months pregnant. As one does, she got a new doctor and went in for a baby check up. Her doctor told her there were some apparent abnormalities in her baby and this was the start of months of additional tests and profound anxiety for both parents-to-be. Hird told an emotional story of their journey and its impact on both their professional and personal lives. The story had a happy ending. Their son was fine and he is now a bright, healthy 5 year old with the sharp sense of humor of many 5 year olds, telling jokes that usually include poop. Her reflections on her experience at the end of her story are heartfelt and left the audience with a powerful example of resilience, hope, and joy.

Now, for the first time, researchers from the University of Connecticut and University of Rochester have sequenced all the centromeres in a multicellular organism. Published in the journal PLOS Biology , the study on fruit flies sheds light on a fundamental aspect of biology, and shows that genetic elements may play a larger role in centromere function than researchers previously thought. \"Centromeres continue to be widely considered the 'black hole' of genomics, \" says Barbara Mellone, associate professor of molecular and cell biology at UConn and lead author on the study. \"We break through these barriers and leverage the power of single molecule long-read sequencing and chromatin fiber imaging to discover the detailed organization of the centromeres. \" The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is one of the most revered examples in biology of a model organism, or species that has been extensively studied for a long time in the lab in order to better understand its biology and to apply those lessons to human health. In the context of centromere biology, Drosophila is especially powerful because it only has four pairs of chromosomes as opposed to the 23 in humans, and the centromeres are smaller than those of humans and thus relatively easier to sequence and assemble. If centromeres, vital for cell division, don't function properly, cells may divide with too few or too many chromosomes, which can result in aneuploidy disorders like Down syndrome or tumor progression. In many species, including humans, centromeres are often found near the center of the chromosome, embedded in large blocks of repetitive DNA known as satellite DNA. Satellite DNA, and, in turn, centromeres, are challenging to sequence because of their repetitive nature: when mapping a genome, traditional sequencing methods chop up strands of DNA and read them, then try to infer the order of those sequences and assemble them back together. But the pieces of repetitive DNA all look the same, so assembling them is like trying to put together a puzzle with very similar pieces. To solve this long-standing puzzle, researchers joined their expertise in chromatin and repetitive DNA biology. Contrary to previous thought, the fruit fly centromeres are in fact made up of \"islands\" of complex DNA enriched in retroelements. These complex islands are embedded deep in satellite arrays, which hampered their discovery for more than two decades, say the researchers. Sequencing the most repetitive parts of genomes is one of the \"last frontiers of genome assembly, \" says Amanda Larracuente, an assistant professor of biology at Rochester, and co-lead author. Researchers recently presented their findings at the Centromere Biology Gordon Conference and the GSA Early Career Scientist Symposium \"Cracking the Repetitive DNA Code. \" \"The approaches we describe will be foundational for the discovery of centromeres in other animals, \" says Mellone. Other authors Chavan, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions; and Brian Beliveau, University of Washington. The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; and a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Howard Hughes Medical Institute Fellowship. by Combined Reports - UConn Communications David Quammen, in his latest book \" The Tangled Tree ,\" describes how recent discoveries have questioned the usual depiction of evolution as a tree. One of the important contributors to this new view of evolution, as indicated by Quammen, is Professor J. Peter Gogarten of MCB. Along with Gogarten, Professors W . Ford Doolittle of Dalhousie University, Jeffrey Lawrence of the University of Pittsburgh, and William Martin of the Univeristy of D\u00fcsseldorf found evidence to show that genes had been widely shared among microorganisms through evolutionary time. Quammen points out the importance of Gogarten's contributions and how his work, and that of these three other investigators, advanced the field. Doolittle, the most senior scientist of this group, called these investigators \"the four horsemen. \" To illustrate the principle of sharing genes across evolutionary lineages, Quammen describes a real instance of the intermingling of branches of trees. In 1915, Wisconsin farmer/banker John Krubsack displayed his chair, made by intertwining and grafting box elder trees, at the World's Fair in San Francisco. Quammen uses Krubsack's fused branches to illustrate how tree branches can fuse if they rub against one another allowing their inner cells to grow together. This intermingling of branches is also found in modern depictions of the \"Tree of Life, \" an illustration of the evolutionary progression of all life through time. Charles Darwin was the first to suggest that species can split into different lineages and evolve separately, creating a branching pattern through time, like the branches of a tree. Evidence provided MCB hosts one of the Four Horsemen of Molecular Evolution by \"the four horsemen\" indicates that the Tree of Life is more like Krubsack's trees. In 1989, shortly after his arrival at UConn, Gogarten published a paper that established the relationship between the three major evolutionary lineages of life: the bacteria, archaea (a group of bacteria-like organisms), and eukaryotes (organisms, including humans, with cells arranged unlike those of bacteria and archaea). Prior to this study, the relationship between these three groups was unknown. Gogarten's paper showed that the bacteria evolved away from the lineage that was the ancestor of the other two groups that subsequently diverged from one another. Life was thought to evolve in this vertical manner, with groups diverging from one another over time, as Darwin envisioned. In follow-up studies, published in 1993, Gogarten found that genes have been shared between the bacteria and archaea. Gogarten's work along with that of Doolittle, Townsend, Martin and others proved that horizontal gene transfer, that is inheritance of new genes from other, sometimes distantly related, lineages, has occurred since life emerged on Earth. The discovery of this phenomenon and the difficulties of its acceptance is the subject of Quammen's book. More recently Gogarten has characterized the evolution of life as like a \"coral\" rather than a tree. An image even Darwin suggested, indicating the complex interactions among the evolving lineages. Gogarten has continued to work on questions about how molecular evolution operates and what impact horizontal gene transfer has had on the evolution of life. His work is highly respected in his field and he has received numerous awards for his contributions. His place is secure as one of the four horsemen of this new view of intermingled branches on the Tree of Life. by Kenneth Noll The four horsemen. L to R, Townsend, Gogarten, Doolittle and Martin.

The topic she discussed with him was the tradition of first authorship on published articles. Typically the first author on a paper is the lead author and the person who made the most significant intellectual contribution to the study, conducted the bulk of the research and analysis of the results that are reported in the paper. In some cases, two people made equal contributions, so an asterisk may be put by their names with a footnote explaining this. One of them, however, still appears first. What are the consequences of this? How is the decision made as to who goes first? Does it make a difference if they are different sexes? These were some of the topics that Prof. Broderick discussed with Smith. Broderick noted that the first author \"becomes part of our conversation and how we talk about the work. \" Consequently, the choice of first author has consequences for that person's reputation and career. Broderick was interviewed because she published a study in the journal eLife with Arturo Casdevall of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in which they examined nearly 3,000 articles from primarily biomedical journals published between 1995 and 2017 that had two or more authors that shared first author position. For mixed- gender combinations of two-author combinations, males were more frequently the first author, though this disparity decreased over the time of the study. For studies with more than two \"first author\" listings, there were more males in the first position and more all-male than all-female combinations. Patterns of apparent male bias were similar for authors in North America, Europe, and Asia. Their analyses of the data indicated that these patterns were not consistent with their being the result of random or alphabetical ordering of authors. So did the authors find out what was behind these patterns? Broderick was asked in the podcast and she said, \"The one thing that we found was interesting was we only found about one or two papers that actually said, 'this order was decided by alphabetical order' . \" They noted in their paper that journals generally do not require authors to state how author order was decided. \"If you talk to scientists, anecdotally, I think they would tell you that sometimes that flipping of a coin and stuff happens less frequently than you might expect, \" Broderick said. There is hope that the situation is changing. As their data show, it appears that the male-female authorship disparity is declining. Another study of this subject, cited in their paper, found no disparity when journals from a wider spectrum of scientific disciplines were examined. However, that study noted, as Broderick found, biomedical journals showed the largest disparity. Broderick has heard anecdotal evidence that journals are getting the word. \"...people have told us that ... editor in chiefs of journals ...[are]... moving towards ... having a very clear statement about how these decisions are made, \" she said. Ironically, Broderick and Casdeval are listed as authors who contributed equally to the work. They take their own advice and indicate that \"author order was determined both alphabetically and in order of increasing seniority. \" Broderick sees this sort of open expression as necessary and sees the situation improving. \"It was very reassuring to see that there was a correction, \" Broderick said. \"Who knows exactly why but it's wonderful to see and it's great to think that we're approaching equilibrium .... \" by Kenneth NollWhat's in a Name?

MCB in Review humans. Nonnative species can wreak environmental havoc on native species and habitats. But in this case, their arrival in the 1970s - right at a moment when Gulf killifish were likely beginning to decline - amounted to an \"evolutionary rescue\" from pollution for the Gulf killifish. \"While the vast majority of research on invasive species rightly focuses on the environmental damage they can cause, this research shows that under rare circumstances they can also contribute valuable genetic variation to a closely related native species, thus acting as a mechanism of evolutionary rescue, \" says co-author Cole Matson, an associate professor at Baylor University. A cautionary tale Gulf killifish began with many advantages other species do not have. Species with large populations can harbor high levels of genetic diversity that can help them adapt to rapid change. Gulf killifish already had among the highest levels of genetic diversity of any species with a backbone. Then, at the moment its population was beginning to decline, a long-distant relative - the Atlantic Coast killifish - came to visit, was able to successfully mate, and injected the Gulf species with genetic resources that helped it develop resilience and resistance to toxins. Whitehead is quick to note that not all species are so lucky. \"The adaptation of these killifish is a cautionary tale, \" says Andrew Whitehead, a UC Davis professor of environmental toxicology, and co-author. \"It tells us what we need to do better for the vast majority of species that don't have access to the kind of genetic resources killifish have. If we care about preserving biodiversity, we can't expect evolution to be the solution. We need to reduce how much and how quickly we're changing the environment so that species can keep up. \" Natural connections Humans are not only radically changing the environment, we are also fragmenting it, making it harder for animals to move throughout their range. Whitehead says a key lesson from killifish is the importance of keeping the doors to genetic diversity open. This includes connecting and preserving landscapes to allow for genetic variation to move more freely and naturally. That could help set the stage for more evolutionary \"rescues\" in the rapidly changing future. From UConn Today; by Kat Kerlin, UC Davis The combination of a big population, good genes, and luck helps explain how a species of fish in Texas' Houston Ship Channel was able to adapt to what would normally be lethal levels of toxins for most other species, according to a study published in the journal Science . The exceptional survivor story of the Gulf killifish was one that intrigued scientists at the University of Connecticut, University of California-Davis, Baylor University, and Indiana University. The minnow-like Gulf killifish are an important part of the food web for a number of larger fish species in coastal marsh habitats and they wanted to learn more about what other species may need to adapt to drastically changed environments. \"We know that rapid adaptive evolution can happen in response to human-caused environmental change but we don't have a great understanding of what factors facilitate it, \" says Noah Reid , UConn research assistant professor in molecular and cell biology and a co-author. \"Learning the underlying genetic basis of adaptation in cases like this can help us make better predictions about how and when it will occur, and better plans to conserve species and mitigate the damage we are causing to the natural environment. \" Surprise guest The researchers sequenced the genomes of hundreds of Gulf killifish living across a spectrum of toxicity - including clean water, moderately polluted water, and very polluted water. They were searching for the footprints of natural selection that allowed the species to rapidly transition from a fish that is highly sensitive to pollution to one extremely resistant to it. They were surprised to find that the adaptive DNA that rescued this Gulf Coast species came from an Atlantic Coast species of killifish, which has also been known to rapidly evolve high levels of pollution resistance. But Atlantic Coast killifish live at least 1,500 miles from their Houston brethren, leaving researchers to think their transport to the Gulf was likely an accident initiated by An Evolutionary Rescue in Polluted Waters Doctoral student travel awardees Bryce Santinello (Genetics & Genomics, Mellone lab) was awarded the Spring 2019 MCB graduate travel award in recognition of his outstanding graduate seminar.

In an effort to understand just how animals co-evolved with bacteria over time, researchers have turned to the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes . In a new study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an international team of researchers, led by UConn associate professor of molecular and cell biology Spencer Nyholm, sequenced the genome of this little squid to identify unique evolutionary footprints in symbiotic organs, yielding clues about how organs that house bacteria are especially suited for this partnership. The first squid genome was sequenced by Nyholm, along with Jamie Foster of the University of Florida, Oleg Simakov of the University of Vienna, and Mahdi Belcaid of the University of Hawaii. The team found several surprises, for instance, that the Hawaiian bobtail squid's genome is 1.5 times the size of the human genome. By comparing the genome of E. scolopes to its cousin, the octopus, the researchers show that the common ancestor of both the octopus and the Hawaiian bobtail squid went through a major genetic makeover, reorganizing and increasing the genome size. This \"upgrade\" likely gave the cephalopods opportunities for increased complexity, including new organs like the ones that house bacteria. \"The Hawaiian bobtail squid has served as a model organism for studying symbiosis for over 30 years, \" notes Nyholm. \"Having the genome will help researchers who study these interactions, as well as those studying diverse areas of biology, such as animal development and comparative evolution. \" Many animals have organs that house bacteria. The human gut houses trillions of bacteria that play important roles in digestion, immune function, and overall health. Understanding how these relationships are maintained by identifying genes that help animals cooperate with bacteria lays the groundwork for furthering knowledge of the human body. The Hawaiian bobtail squid is an excellent model for identifying these genes because of its symbiotic relationships with beneficial microbes, and its use by a number of scientists to study communication between bacteria and animals. The Hawaiian bobtail squid has two different symbiotic organs, and researchers were able to show that each of these took different paths in their evolution. This particular species of squid has a light organ that harbors a light-producing, or bioluminescent, bacterium that enables the squid to cloak itself from predators. At some point in the past, a major \"duplication event\" occurred that led to repeat copies of genes that normally exist in the eye. These genes allowed the squid to manipulate the light generated by the bacteria. Another finding was that in the accessory nidamental gland, a female reproductive organ, there was an enrichment of genes that are \"orphan genes\" or genes that have only been found in the bobtail squid and not in other organisms. \"Squid and octopus showed very unique genome structure, unlike in any other animals, \" says Simakov, \"corroborating previous reports of their unusual nature and complexity. \" Foster notes that teasing out these unusual and complex details is directly applicable to the study of other bacteria/ animal relationships. Scientists led by UConn biologist Spencer Nyholm have found clues to the origin and evolution of symbiotic organs in animals from the genome of the Hawaiian bobtail squid. (Sarah McAnulty/UConn Photo)\"Microbes are major drivers of the evolution of animals and their tissues, \" she says. \"The results of our study have helped identify the 'origin story' of those tissues that house an animal's microbes, and will help tease apart the genetic processes by which these different types of innovation can happen in animals. \" This work was supported by a National Science Foundation IOS grant and the UConn Office of the Vice President for Research.

Microbial Systems Analysis degree in fall 2018. They were so impressed with her skills they did not want to lose her and employed her as a Manufacturing and Quality Control Associate. She played a key role in moving the microbiome kits from product development to production. Dominique credits this to the training in the MCB Professional Science Master's (PSM) program. \"The PSM program was great!\" Dominique says. \"One of the founders of the startup where I did my internship was happy that I did not need extensive training to do what they hired me for--that they could just hand me a lab coat, show me the lab, and that I'd just be ready to work. It equipped me with the knowledge and skills that the job market in my field requires.\" The MCB PSM program offers a myriad of professional development courses and practical laboratory modules. What Dominique found particularly useful were the communication skills courses, the weekly professional development seminars with industry leaders, and the advanced short intensive laboratory modules, such as the characterization of microbial communities by 16S rRNA sequencing. \"The modules offered by the program are relevant to current industry laboratory practice. Not only has the program helped to develop my practical lab skills, but because of its holistic design, I've also learned how to communicate effectively.\" Dominique continues,\" The program gives students the door to a network of startup founders, academic thought leaders, big pharma executives, and PSM alumni.

The success of this treatment has led researchers to wonder other ways that microbiome therapies could be applied to treat various ailments \u2014 a question that remains largely unanswered. Broderick will address this challenge and look to develop strategies to manipulate the microbiome in order to restore normal animal (including human) physiology. Broderick received her PhD from the University of Wisconsin and completed postdoctoral training at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in Switzerland. Her research focuses on understanding the mechanisms that underlie animal's interactions with their microbiomes to illuminate how beneficial as well as pathogenic bacteria impact host development, physiology, and health. by Anna Zarra Aldrich '20 (CLAS), Office of the Vice President for Research Inside our bodies, there is a microscopic world teeming with life known as the microbiome. From the moment we are born, we begin accumulating a collection of helpful bacteria, viruses and fungi that support our immune system and digestive health. Nichole Broderick, an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Connecticut has received a five-year, $1.92 million grant from the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences to build up the knowledge base of how exactly the microbiome performs these functions. \"I'm thrilled to have the support of NIH to carry out this work. The support of the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) program for early-stage investigators like myself is a critical boost to my lab as we tackle important questions about the role of the microbiome in animal health. \" Broderick will use fruit flies, which have remarkably similar internal pathways and diseases as humans, to study which mechanisms in the host contribute to the establishment of a normal microbiome. She will look at how signals from microbes cause physiological changes in the host and how the host regulates the microbiome in turn. Understanding how a healthy microbiome is maintained is an essential step in developing therapies for microbiomes that have been disrupted or not established properly. For example, when a person goes on antibiotics for an infection like strep throat or a urinary tract infection, the medication that kills the disease-causing bacteria can also disrupt the \"good\" bacteria in our microbiome. One disease that has been treated with microbiome therapy is Clostridium difficile infection, an antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

A half dozen University of Connecticut researchers are now working to identify potential new drugs to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions through a unique partnership that offers access to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology and screening compounds. Through its Artificial Intelligence Molecular Screen (AIMS) Awards program, Atomwise, a biotech company, provides access to advanced screening technologies that will help expedite the research at no cost. MCB Assistant Professor Simon White was one of these UConn researchers participating in this partnership. White studies hand-foot-and-mouth disease and the virus that causes it. The disease typically infects children and infants, a small number of whom require hospitalization. With large recurrent outbreaks in Asia and no specific treatments for the disease, White looked to Atomwise to help accelerate his efforts to develop drug candidates that specifically target the virus. \"We're very hopeful these results will help get us closer to the first ever treatment for this condition, \" says White. \"We are thrilled that our faculty members have been able to take advantage of this program, which leverages cutting-edge technology from industry with innovative research from one of the nation's top universities, \" says Radenka Maric, vice president for research at UConn and UConn Health. by Combined Reports - UConn CommunicationsDrug Discovery Partnership with AI Biotech Company Reaps Promising Early ResultsLong bones normally grow longer at plates near their ends by first forming cartilage that then forms a matrix that then accumulates calcium to harden the bone. The whole bone is alive, so new bone can form elsewhere in the bone for repair of damage. Traumatic injury, or in some cases inherited disease, can cause abnormal bone growth called heterotopic ossification (HO) so that bone forms in places that it should not. One form of the condition, called endochondral HO, causes ossification, or calcium-based hardening, of muscle tissue or other soft tissues. Professor David Goldhamer studies this condition and a related debilitating, inherited, progressive disorder called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). He recently wrote a review article describing research of these conditions and pointing out gaps that remain in our understanding, particularly knowledge of the mechanisms that direct the cells that initiate aberrant cartilage and bone formation. Soft tissue injury or inflammation typically triggers HO, though how they do so is a mystery. HO is especially a problem in cases of limb amputation and traumatic combat injuries. It can lead to significant pain and swelling, affect joint mobility, and impede functional recovery. FOP is a very rare condition that seems to arise from spontaneous appearance of HO of the muscular system at an early age and that progressively immobilizes the afflicted individual. Mild injuries can trigger HO in these individuals, necessitating extreme precautions to avoid even the mildest trauma. Treatments for HO are very limited, so the research of investigators like Golhamer are essential to find how this phenomenon starts so that its progression can be prevented or limited. His research involves the use of mouse models to study the cellular mechanisms involved in HO and FOP . His lab has produced mutant mice, using gene-targeting technologies, that exhibit FOP so that its underlying causes can be studied in the laboratory. A critical gene involved in this is the same in mice and humans, giving hope that results in the lab can be translated for use in treating the human condition. Goldhamer has also been able to use methods to selectively tag different kinds of cells that exist between muscle cells. A new kind of progenitor cell, one that gives rise to other kinds of cells, was found that plays a key role in injury-induced HO. Following injury, these cells proliferate and can cause the appearance of cartilage and bone. These cells also seem to play a similar role in FOP . His findings were published in a recent Nature Communications article . Evidence is accumulating that other kinds of stem and progenitor cells are to be involved in the various manifestations of HO. Goldhamer's work along with that of other investigators has also revealed the role of a protein in initiation of FOP , so work on this is showing more promise for future advances. By contrast, determining the underlying activation of HO as the result of muscular and even some neurological damage is more difficult. Though these may share common factors in the activation of aberrant bone growth, each might also have unique factors that will require more difficult methods to discover. Molecular tools to investigate each of these situations are currently lacking in some cases, so efforts in that direction are needed. Goldhamer points out in his article that advances are proceeding in our understanding of the offending cell populations both in terms of their normal functions and the signals that subvert these normal functions. Consequently, information is accumulating that might lead to cell-specific therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat HO caused by injury or disease. Goldhamer has published one such study that examined the effect of therapeutic agents on pathogenic progenitor cells. by Kenneth NollMCB in Review Signals that Trigger Crippling Bone Disease Coming into View Skeleton of Harry Eastlack, an FOP vicitim, on display at the M\u00fctter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. 9 Expression 2018-2019 Expression 2018-2019 10Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN) announced today that it signed an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement with the University of Connecticut for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein (MT). Extracellular MT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Under this agreement, Biohaven has the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications. The antibody was discovered in the laboratory of Michael Lynes, PhD, head of the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology at the University of Connecticut Storrs. Lynes is a world leader in the study of metallothioneins and their role in disease. Biohaven and the University of Connecticut also signed a Sponsored Research Collaboration Agreement to support the ongoing UConn, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals Ink Licensing Deal for Investigational Agent for Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases exploration of the role of MT in human disease. The new antibody, co- invented by the UConn researchers together with a team from Ghent University in Belgium, is designed to prevent the patient's immune system from attacking its own body and potentially causing irreversible damage. \"We are very excited about this opportunity to potentially expand our portfolio with the addition of this novel antibody and assess its activity in a range of diseases, including neuro- inflammatory disorders, \" says Dr. Vlad Coric, CEO of Biohaven. \"The pre-clinical discovery work by Lynes at the University of Connecticut, and his collaborators at the Ghent University and Joslin Diabetes Center, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, suggests that metallothionein can have dramatic influences on the modulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. We look forward to further evaluating this antibody and potentially advancing it into the clinic. \" \"This agreement represents a critical next step for my research group, as it helps define the path for taking our basic research discoveries into the clinic. The expertise that Biohaven Pharmaceuticals brings to my research team has been invaluable in advancing this goal, \" says Lynes. I believe we have an exciting opportunity to develop this new approach to the management of important inflammatory and autoimmune diseases where metallothionein plays a significant role. \" MTs are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that have a wide range of functions in cellular homeostasis and immunity. MT has traditionally been considered to be an intracellular protein that can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus; however, MT also can be found in extracellular spaces, particularly in disease states involving chronic cellular stress where intracellular MT production is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular MT acts as a danger signal, attracting leukocytes and modulating the immune response. In pre-clinical studies, UC1MT has been observed to block this extracellular pool of MT and the resulting MT-mediated inflammation and immunomodulation. \"We are looking forward to this partnership as we see great potential for this novel mechanism in inflammation. We intend to capitalize on our strong development experience and the Molecular and cell biologist Michael Lynes and an international team of researchers have developed a novel antibody designed to prevent the patient's immune system from attacking its own body. Lynes is shown here with lab manager Clare Melchiorre. (Taylor Hudak '18 (CLAS, ED)/UConn Photo). The pre-clinical discovery work by Lynes at the University of Connecticut, and his collaborators [...] suggests that metallothionein can have dramatic influences on the modulation of both innate and adaptive immunity.\u2014 Vlad CoricMore than a decade ago, Lynes, professor and head of the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at UConn, and his research team discovered a novel and important role that a protein called metallothionein (MT) plays in influencing the body's immune function. The body produces MT when cells are under stress, and extended periods of stress cause MT to be released from the cells that produced it, Lynes says. MT is an unusual protein that holds onto chemicals in the body - both those that are beneficial, such as zinc and copper, and those that are harmful - such as cadmium and mercury. While studying MT, Lynes and his research team noticed that MT released from cells could mimic some of the signals that the immune system uses as cues to tell cells to go to one place or another in the body. Under normal circumstances, immune cells use these signals to guide them to local infections or other tissue damage. When cells are stressed over prolonged periods, this can mean that there is persistent inflammation accompanied by damage to nearby healthy tissue. About 50 million people, or 20 percent of the U.S. population, suffer from some form of autoimmune disease or chronic inflammation, according to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association. More than 80 autoimmune diseases have been identified, and autoimmune diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent, for reasons unknown, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. While causes of autoimmune diseases also remain largely unknown, scientific consensus is that autoimmune diseases are probably triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A team of Belgium doctors and scientists studying Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) had published a paper saying that their sickest patients were those whose bodies produced the most MT. The MT protein, which serves as a normal part of the cell's internal machinery inside the cell, was getting outside the cell and causing damage. That paper by Dr. Martine DeVos, Debby Laukens, and Lindsey Devisscher led to a collaboration with Lynes. Since the protein serves an essential purpose, researchers can't shut it off all together; so they had to find a way to stop MT from prolonging inflammation and damaging healthy cells. Lynes and his team produced an antibody protein that basically attaches itself to MT when it is outside the cell and inactivates it - preventing the body from attacking its intestinal system. This approach dramatically reduced inflammation in mouse models of the human disease. \"We've recently extended that work with our colleagues Y ou-Hua Tseng and Matthew D. Lynes at Joslin Diabetes Center of Harvard Medical School to show that UC1MT also shows therapeutic promise in a mouse model of Type 1 diabetes, \" Lynes says. \"deep scientific expertise of Dr. Lynes' team to rapidly advance innovative therapies to patients, \" says Clifford Bechtold, chief operating officer and head of biologic development at Biohaven. Bechtold has previous pharmaceutical industry experience in optimizing biologics development and manufacturing capabilities. This option builds upon Biohaven's portfolio of innovative, clinical-stage product candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative, neurologic and neuropsychiatric disease indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Biohaven paid an upfront option fee and, if Biohaven exercises its option to in- license the program, the University of Connecticut will receive additional license fees and will be entitled to low single-digit percentage royalties based on net sales of any commercialized products as well as milestone payments based on the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. by Jessica McBride - Office of the Vice President for Research The Road to a New Antibody 11 Expression 2018-2019 Expression 2018-2019 12The American Society for Microbiology launched its second annual issue of mSystems highlighting early-career scientitsts. The 2019 May/ June issue \"Early-Career Scientists Shaping the World\" featured an article by MCB Professor Sarah Hird . Hird's article, \"Microbiomes, Community Ecology, and the Comparative Method\" described how her work on avian microbiomes uses two complimentary views, the microbiome as a community and the microbiome as a trait of the host. These special issues highlight and promote the diversity of scientific ideas and approaches within microbial systems biology and also the diversity of the authors themselves. The journal editors consider this an important part of their mission to counter implicit and explicit biases that affect authorship in STEM fields (see article on page 5). HIrd points out that avian microbiomes, like all microbiomes, exhibit considerable variation in species composition and function. These populations evolve in response to Natural Selection directed at these features. Additionally, avian microbiomes can promote or deter the health, fitness, and proper development of their host, and so serve as a selective force of their own. They are, in effect, a trait of their host like other traits that are subject to Natural Selection. Hird applies classical ecological and evolutionary theory to her research questions and utilizes sophisticated statistical models to examine her data. It is not clear how individual kinds of microbes come together to form a community in a given environment. They may come together rather haphazardly so that any kind of community, that of the avian gut, for example, could have a collection of species rather different between two birds or two species of bird. Alternatively, a given environment might require the services of a given spectrum of functions so that the community that would form there will have the same kinds of species regardless of which bird or species is examined. Hird is exploring these different theories by sequencing DNA extracted from different microbiomes, called metagenomics, to identify the members of the community and reveal the genetic potential in that community. Her lab will also sequence all the messenger RNA transcripts present in these microbiome samples to show which genes are being expressed and so reflect the functions that are being employed in these environments. Each of these will give evidence of the extent and nature of the microbial diversity in the environments examined. Hird also examines the function of microbiomes as traits of their host bird. Using methods to determine the evolutionary relationship among bird species or variants, she can then relate the pattern of these relationships to the kinds of microbial communities each species or variant hosts. She will look for any relationships between the functions contained in a community or the kinds of species in a community with the evolutionary trajectory of its host. Any selective pressures the host's evolutionary lineage has experienced may be able to be related to the kind or function of its resident microbiome. Thus the microbiome would act as another of the host's traits. Hird is focusing her efforts on the Saltmarsh Sparrow, an endangered saltmarsh specialist species. Her lab is collecting data from 35 breeding populations across its breeding range. Given that the sparrow faces extinction by 2050, there is some urgency to gather and analyze these data to see if their microbiomes may hold clues to the survivability or perhaps the rescue of this species. In such questions, life is interconnected with both its environment and its microbiomes, so the more we know about each, the better stewards we can be for such fragile life. by Kenneth NollMCB in Review Sparrows and their Microbes Evolve Together Saltmarsh sparrow Photo credit Audubon Society . Figure from DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00112-19With over 500 students comprising 139 teams, the annual New Y ork University Policy Case Competition (NYUPCC) came to a close on April 28, 2019. After reaching the final round, UConn students impressed the judges to become the 2019 champions. The team was awarded trophies, a $1000 prize, and a celebratory dinner with esteemed judges in New Y ork City. Teams from top schools around the world, including Canada, China, Pakistan, India, France, Spain, and across the US competed to produce the most innovative and effective policy proposals. In round one in early April, teams submitted a memo on an assigned topic in domestic, international, tech, or science policy. In round two on April 27, twenty qualifying teams presented their proposals before a panel of expert judges at NYU. The top five teams, with students from NYU, MIT, UPenn, Emory, the University of Washington and UConn, presented again in the final round on April 28. Assigned farm MCB Grad Students Win International Policy Competition subsidies, UConn's winning presentation included proposals to cut federal crop insurance subsidies and create a targeted tax credit for small farmers. Jacqueline Klopp, a Professor at Columbia University's Earth Institute and one of NYUPCC's final round judges stated that one of the reasons the UConn team won was its \"holistic consideration of the interconnected effects of farm policies on human health, community, the environment, and the economy. \" Another judge, Lawrence White, the Robert Kavesh Professor of Economics at NYU Stern School of Business, complimented UConn students' \"effective use of slides and clear communication skills. \" While the competition was close, judges said that the UConn team came out on top because of its nuanced considerations of political feasibility, effective and smooth teamwork, and careful quantification of costs and benefits. \"Basically we used the skills like memo writing, cost-benefit analysis, and public speaking we learned in our classes to win, \" Schreier said, \"I'm so proud of what we accomplished together as a t e a m .\" The team focused its attention on full-time farmers with annual gross sales of less than $150,000 because this group has a median income less than that for US households overall and faces high farm land prices and other challenges. At the same time, small farmers provide many positive externalities not compensated by the market. \"This proposal would decrease inequity in a system where government subsidies are currently highly skewed toward the largest and wealthiest farms. By providing support for small farmers who really need it, it makes our food system stronger, \" Patelunas explained. An MBA student, Kumar joined the UConn team because of his interest in public policy and sustainability: \"When you design public policies, all stakeholders need to be taken into account and that includes the well-being of the earth and everyone who depends on it. \" The team donated the $1000 prize money to the Department of Public Policy's fund for students to participate in future professional development activities, conferences, and competitions like NYUPCC. by Joshua Schreier '19 (MPP) The the final round judges (l) Prof. Jacqueline Klopp, Director of the Columbia University Earth Institute, and (r) Prof. Larry White, of the NYU Leonard N.

Applied Genomics Professional Science Master's (PSM) program in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) at the University of Connecticut with the intent of enhancing her hands-on experiences in the laboratory. Exposure to different career opportunities in the program led her to an internship and a career in regulatory affairs. Even with the change in direction, Samantha knew that the technical skills and knowledge acquired through the program would prepare her, and set her apart, from other candidates in the job market. Prior to entering the MCB PSM program, Samantha had an internship at Alnylam, where she was part of the RNAi research discovery team. This was followed by an internship at Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, where she created and evaluated mouse models for various cancer cell lines. After graduating with a M.S. in Applied Genomics in the summer of 2018, Samantha went to work at Blueprint Medicines as a Regulatory Affairs Associate. As Samantha notes, it was the MCB PSM professional development seminars and courses that prepared her for her current job. \"The program prepared me well for the job market. The networking from the professional development seminars was very useful as that is how I became familiar with Regulatory Affairs and their role in a pharmaceutical company. The coursework also gave me more advanced knowledge that is applicable to oncology and rare disease- based companies.\" At Blueprint Medicines in Cambridge, MA, Samantha works in different parts of the regulatory arena, preparing and submitting new drug applications, working on global regulatory submissions, submitting FDA amendments, rolling out new protocols, and organizing ongoing clinical trials. Based on her experiences in the MCB PSM program, Samantha says, \"I recommend the program to other students as it is a lab driven and industry focused program. The program not only offers labs and coursework, but also professional development seminars, interview/resume practice, and strategies for managing people, which are all just as important.\" by Elain MirkinHuman evolution is based on the premise of \"survival of the fittest\" where the organisms with the genetically encoded characteristics best suited to their environment survive to pass those genes on to their offspring who keep passing that trait on until all members of the population have it. But how do organisms that don't reproduce sexually evolve? Archaea are a type of single-celled organism that can be found all over the globe, often in extreme environments. They help make up sea plankton which are the basis of all marine food chains, some live in hot springs and salt lakes, some even reside in the human gut and play an important role in digestion. But how this class of organisms, which may be the oldest on the planet, has evolved over billions of years largely remains a mystery. The work of University of Connecticut Associate Professor R. Thane Papke may help illuminate part of this mystery. Papke has received a $989,000 grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to study the role of horizontal gene transfer in archaeal evolution. MCB Assisstant Professor Simon White is a co-investigator and Uri Gophna from Tel-Aviv University in Israel is an international co-investigator for this grant. Archaea and bacteria reproduce asexually. These organisms copy their DNA and make a perfect replica of themselves. This is why horizontal gene transfer is essential for the evolution of these organisms which otherwise would have no way to diversify their allele pool and ensure the survival of the species. If all members of a species have the same genetic profile, a single disease can wipe all members of that species out in one fell swoop. Studies have shown archaea engage in a tremendous amount of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and that they have acquired thousands of genes from bacterial sources. This has resulted in non-sexually reproducing organisms having the same amount of genetic diversity as sexually producing organisms, leaving evolutionary researchers scratching their heads. \"Sexual reproduction is thought to have arisen out of asexuality precisely because of the advantages of shuffling gene pools, \" Papke says. \"However, it is clear that archaea and bacteria had solved that problem without sexual reproduction. \" Previous studies have shown evidence of a cell-contact- dependent method of gene transfer in a type of archaea called H. volcanii , which is commonly found in the Dead Sea and other very salty environments. Haloarchaea engage in a kind of horizontal gene transfer known as \"mating\" wherein two archaea swap genes through cell- to-cell contact without a clear donor/recipient dynamic which is seen in most other forms of HGT. This archaeon's ability to survive in such environments makes it attractive to space researchers as these organisms could potentially live on Mars and offer insight into the evolution of extraterrestrial life there. \"I think NASA funds our work because we address fundamental questions that attempt to resolve where sexual reproduction UConn Researcher Wins NASA Grant to Study Gene Transfer in Archaea comes from, \" Papke says. \"NASA is interested in transitional states of biology, and sexual reproduction is a big one. \" In this project, Papke hopes to identify and characterize the genes responsible for horizontal gene transfer in this particular archaeon. Papke and his team also hope to determine the rate of horizontal gene transfer between haloarchaeal species, the class to which H. volcanii belongs. Papke will also study the role of the receiving organism's system for cutting non-self DNA in this process, which is how cells can be immune from virus or plasmid infection. Whenever organisms encounter foreign material, their immune systems naturally react and attempt to remove or destroy the invader. For a cell to take up a foreign gene successfully, its immune system must be overridden and signaled to stand down. One of the features that makes H. volcanii an ideal model organism for this research because their method of horizontal gene transfer requires the membranes and cell walls of two or more cells to fuse, in a way that interestingly resembles the fusion of gametes to produce a zygote through sexual reproduction. \"This resembles what I would imagine as a primitive intermediate step towards sexual reproduction that demonstrates an expected cell contact mechanism for wholesale genetic flow, without having connected reproduction to the process yet, a kind of asexual reproduction sex, \" Papke says. Papke received his Ph.D. in microbiology from Montana State University. He completed his postdoctoral training in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His research interests include classifying and understanding the evolution of non-pathogenic prokaryotes. by Anna Zarra Aldrich '20 (CLAS), Office of the Vice President for ResearchFrom Lab Bench to Regulatory Affairs Knecht receives research excellence award David Knecht was awarded a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Research Excellence Award in the Life and Behavioral Sciences division.

Our bodies respond, on a cellular level, to environmental changes through a complicated process - turning on or off parts of our vast genome, expressing specific genes at specific levels to respond to specific situations. However, experts are learning that this process may be even more complex than previously thought. When our bodies need to produce proteins, necessary codes are found in our DNA. The process of transcription creates a messenger RNA that is an RNA copy of the DNA sequence. During translation, transport RNA then brings over the amino acids that correspond to the RNA code. These amino acids are joined together to create the protein. These proteins are responsible for everything that happens in our bodies from development, to immune responses, and healing. But there are some segments of our DNA that make RNAs that don't code for any protein - so why do we have them? This is the question Core hopes to answer. Even though it is not translated into protein itself, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) plays a critical role in regulating transcription of protein-coding genes. ncRNA can recruit gene activators or suppressors to control where, when, and to what degree protein-coding RNAs are transcribed. \"These observations suggest that regulation of ncRNA biogenesis adds an intricate layer of control to overall gene expression levels, \" Core Non-Coding Doesn't Mean Non-Functioning: Exploring the Role of Non-Coding RNA in Gene Expression and Evolution says. Currently, a significant obstacle to studying and understanding the roles of ncRNAs is being able to identify and correctly classify them. Core's project will develop new experimental and computational methods that can identify the transcripts of ncRNA that will also allow him to predict the function of these segments. He will then look to identify the mechanisms that regulate the production and destruction of ncRNA and determine the effect of ncRNA on the protein- coding gene transcription process of genes located near them on our genome. \"ncRNAs are involved in regulating every phase of gene expression from transcription factor recruitment to RNA transcription, processing, stability, and translation, \" Core says. \"Intense efforts are still required to identify all species of ncRNAs and their diverse functions in regulating gene expression. These studies will generate important resources and represent foundational framework for studying ncRNA function. \" Core is also investigating the capacity of ncRNA in the evolution of new genes. He will use an evolutionary genetic model to identify the nucleotide changes in our DNA associated with altered ncRNA transcripts. This aspect of the project will shed light on the mechanisms underlying acquisition of new phenotypes and inform future studies of evolution. Core received his PhD in molecular biology and genetics from Cornell University where he also completed his postdoctoral training. Core's current research focuses on how changes in RNA transcription and processing drive changes or maintenance of cellular states during cellular responses such as development or disease progression. by Anna Zarra Aldrich '20 (CLAS), Office of the Vice President for Research Assistant Professor Leighton Core in the Engineering & Science Building.

(Illustration by Geno Villafano) Horseshoe Crabs: How Did They Get an Exception? Every life form changes through the ages, and evolution is the only constant. Except for horseshoe crabs - which have stayed the same for 450 million years, keeping everything from the eyes on their tail to the antibacterial cells in their blood. How they've managed to stay the same is a great mystery. Now, researchers at UConn's Institute for Systems Genomics are assembling a detailed map of the horseshoe crab's DNA. They hope the map will lead them to answers to the crabs' two great secrets: how their blood reacts to bacteria, and why the crabs seem frozen in time. MCB Professor Rachel O'Neill, director of the Institute, is intrigued by horseshoe crabs (the native Connecticut species is Limulus polyphemus ) because they're just so weird. They're members of Arthropoda, that vast phylum of life that includes insects, crustaceans, and spiders. But most of their relatives went extinct long, long ago, and horseshoe crabs' closest living relatives are ticks, spiders, and scorpions. Horseshoe crabs are living fossils that look the same as they did 450 million years ago. How they have managed to sta y the same is a great mystery. Now, Prof. Rachel O'Neill is heading a UConn team to create a detailed map of the horseshoe crab's DNA to learn why these \"living Fossils\" seem frozen in time. were no friends to Limulus polyphemus . The crabs' blood contains roaming cells called amoebocytes that attack bacteria and coagulate like glue around them, instantly sealing off holes in the circulatory system. That violent reaction to bacteria has made the horseshoe crab's blood extraordinarily valuable to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, which use an extract from the blood to test for contaminants in every batch of vaccine, saline, or other injected drug, as well as every pacemaker, artificial hip, or other implanted device. Horseshoe crabs have to be captured and bled to provide the substance, and their declining numbers suggest the harvest is slowly killing them off. Although there is a synthetic replacement available, it has been slow to catch on. O'Neill and her students think there is potential to expand its use, and perhaps design other, related proteins that detect other types of contaminants, not just bacteria. \" At this point it's science fiction. But this is a novel way of thinking about any contaminant detection, \" O'Neill says. Graduate student Kate Castellano has raised the baby horseshoe crabs to watch how they grew from embryos to the inch-long three-year-olds shown in the video available at the UConn Today website. Part of it was to understand their basic biology - no one had even published a guide to the care and feeding of horseshoe crab embryos before - and part of it is public education. The little Limulus babies live in a 30-gallon tank in the common area of the There aren't many detailed DNA maps of spiders or ticks to compare horseshoe crabs to. And even if there were, horseshoe crabs aren't exactly normal spiders. A map of their DNA is a window into the DNA of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic, a time long before the dinosaurs, when mollusks and trilobites dominated the seas and the most complex lifeforms on land were plants similar to liverworts. But even that long ago, bacteria were everywhere. And they Institute for Systems Genomics, and anyone can sit at the nearby table and watch them. \"The dinosaurs came and went, but the crabs stayed the same, \" O'Neill says. \"We're exploring this fossil genome to understand the adaptations that let horseshoe crabs succeed for so long. \" by Kim Krieger - UConn Communications, and Angelina Reyes - UConn Communications 17 Expression 2018-2019 Expression 2018-2019 18Engaging Future Scientists As part of Homecoming Weekend, on October 23 children ages 5 to 12 joined UConn faculty, staff, and students for an afternoon of STEM experiments.

From gila monsters to the Pacific yew, new classes of drugs have been discovered in the most unexpected places. Whether we will be able to continue such discoveries very much depends upon whether humans can more seriously assume the role of protectors of the environments in which potentially medically useful organisms live. Harvesting chemicals useful as drugs from wild organisms can be very expensive and endanger the very creatures we come to depend on. A case in point is that of the Pacific yew, source of paclitaxel, the compound used to treat cancers that generates sales of about $80-100 million per year, as reported in Malone's article. After its discovery in 1971, paclitaxel had to be extracted from the bark of yew trees, resulting in killing of these rare, slow- growing trees. Tree destruction continued until 1994 when chemists successfully synthesized the chemical. As new drug chemicals are discovered, more advanced chemical synthesis methods can be applied to perhaps obviate the need to harvest them from natural sources. Of more concern to the survival of potential sources of new drugs is habitat destruction. Malone's article cites an estimate that one important drug is lost every two years from environment disruptions. Inexpensive and high-throughput DNA sequencing allows investigators to explore the biomedical potential of organisms without capturing or killing them. Small tissue samples can be taken to sequence the genomes of organisms or, in the case of microorganisms, to simply sample the waters or soils in which they live to sequence the DNA of billions of cells at once. As noted in Malone's publication, advanced chemical analysis tools, too, can detect and identify potential drug targets using very small environmental samples. The subject of Malone's research, the African clawed frog, produces an anti-microbial protein in its skin secretions, the first such protein discovered. Researches noticed that surgical wounds on these frogs rarely became infected, despite the use of non- sterile procedures. The protein, called magainin, discovered in 1987, has yet to come to use in medicine. Unfortunately well-intentioned international efforts to protect less-developed countries from being exploited for their natural sources of useful drugs has resulted in making international collaborations more difficult for academic researchers looking for potentially useful natural compounds. Malone and his co-authors recommend that governments team up to support international collaborative research efforts among different scientific disciplines to explore the natural potential for new discoveries. These collaborations would assure mutual sharing of any resulting benefits while taking steps to conserve natural resources. Such efforts would allow improved access to Nature's library of chemical books of beneficial information that is now restricted to those with the most resources to check out its books. by Kenneth NollNature is a Rich Source of Medicine - If We can Protect ItMCB in Review African clawed frog Photo from Australian ABC News.
