Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. March 2012. Effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm. ii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts the Effective Health Care Program as part of its mission to organize knowledge and make it available to inform decisions about health care. As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Congress directed A HRQ to conduct and support research on the comparative outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of pharmaceuticals, devices, and health care services to meet the needs of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). AHRQ has an established network of Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs) that produce Evidence Reports/Technology Assessments to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care. The EPCs now lend thei r expertise to the Effective Health Care Program by conducting comparative effectiveness reviews (CERs) of medications, devices, and other relevant interventions, including strategies for how these items and services can best be organized, managed, and del ivered. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence -based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of develo ping recommendations for practice, systematic reviews are useful because they define the strengths and limits of the evidences, clarifying whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more i nformation about systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that CERs will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, gove rnment programs, and the health care system as a whole. In addition, AHRQ is committed to presenting information in different formats so that consumers who make decisions about their own and their family's health can benefit from the evidence. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

To assess the test performance of antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and cyclic -citrullinated peptide (CCP) tests in children and adolescents with undiagnosed musculoskeletal (MSK) pain or joint swelling , compared with clinical diagnoses of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). To explore difference s in test performance for accuracy modifiers including age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, and recent infections. To evaluate the impact of test results on clinical decisionmaking and clinically important outcomes such as referrals, ordering of additional tests, clinical management, and anxiety experienced by children and parents. Data Sources . We conducted c omprehensive search es in nine e lectronic databases. We also hand search ed reference lists and conference proceedings. There were no restrictions on language, year of publication, and study design. Review Methods . Study selection, quality assessment, data extraction, and grading the evi dence were conducted independently by two reviewers. A combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches was used to synthesize the data. We calculated s ensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) . Results . The search identified 11,695 citations; 28 were i ncluded in the review. Only one c ohort study examined the test performance of RF to diagnose JIA among children with undiagnosed MSK pain. It demonstrated an Sn of 5 percent and an Sp of 98 percent. Fifteen case -control studies did not specifically address the test performance of RF among children with MSK pain. The strength of evidence is low for both Sn and Sp. The 12 case -control studies that examined other test -disease combinations did not specifically address the prevalence of positive tests for ANA or CCP among children presenting with undiagnosed MSK pain. The strength of evidence is insufficient to determine the test performance of ANA or CCP to diagnose JIA or pSLE in children with undiagnosed MSK pain. No studies addressed children with joint swell ing. There was no evidence addressing the prespecified accuracy modifiers or clinically important outcomes. Conclusions . Most of the evidence from the 28 studies included in the review was not applicable to the population of interest as most studies examined children with known disease rather than with undiagnosed MSK pain. No studies provided a complete investigation on accuracy modifiers . No studies examined clinically important outcomes such as the imp act of the test results on referrals, ordering of additional tests, patient management, and patient and parent anxiety levels . Because the Sn and Sp of these tests have yet to be verified, current evidence does not support their use as diagnostic tests for children with undiagnosed MSK pain . They have a potential application as an adjunct to a clinical assessment that suggests th e presence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease .vi Content s Executive Summary ....................................................................................

Subgroup Analyses by Onset Type of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ES-1 Executive Summary Background Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is common in children and adolescents, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 2 to 50 percent.1 MSK pain can affect physical, psychological, and social function and often prompts consultation with a physician.2 However, MSK pa in is often nonspecific, which can make it difficult to arrive at an accurate diagnosis .3,4 MSK pain may be due to rheumatic or nonrheumatic causes . Nonrheumatic causes are more common, generally benign , and most often attributable to trauma, overuse, and normal bone growth.5 Rheumatic causes , such as inflammatory arthritis, are infrequent, generally chronic, and require accurate , timely diagnosis and effective intervention to prevent progression and long - term damage .6 Common rheumatic causes of childhood M SK pain include pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). A complete history and physical examination is generally considered to be the best way to make a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis .3,5 Physicians may request s erological tests such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and cyclic -citrullinated peptide (CCP) when children and adolescents are suspected of having inflammatory arthritis, despite the fact that the diagnostic performance, use fulness, and proper interpretation of these tests are uncertain in pediatric populations. This comparative effectiveness review summarizes the evidence on the test performance of ANA, RF, or CCP tests for pSLE and JIA in children with undiagnosed MSK pain. The report is intended for a broad audience including primary care physicians who may consider ordering these tests in a child with MSK pain, health payers who provide coverage for these tests, and parents or caregivers who want to know whether these tests can determine if their child does or does not have a particular disease. Key Questions In order to better understand how the ANA, RF, and CCP tests perform in the clinical setting of a child w ith undiagnosed MSK pain, it is important to know the prevalence of MSK complaints (including MSK pain and joint swelling) in children who do not have JIA and pSLE. It is also important to be aware of the rate of false positives for these tests (i.e., the proportion of otherwise healthy children who have a positive ANA, RF, or CCP test). Appropriate interpretation of test performance also requires an understanding of the disease progression and changes in signs and symptoms in children with MSK pain who may or may not also have JIA or pSLE. In addition to providing this background information, t he objectives of this report were to assess the test performance of ANA, RF, and CCP tests in children and adolescents with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swellin g compared with clinical diagnoses of pSLE and JIA; to explore the difference in test performance for accuracy modifiers including age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, and recent infections ; and t o evaluate the impact of test results on clinical dec isionmaking and clinically important outcomes such as referrals, ordering of additional tests, clinical management, and anxiety experienced by children and parents. We addressed the following Key Questions ( KQs): ES-2 KQ 1. Prevalence and Incidence KQ 1.1. In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less, what is the incidence and prevalence of undiagnosed MSK complaints? KQ 1.2. In healthy children and adolescents aged 18 years or less, what is the incidence of positive test results in ANA, RF, and CCP? KQ 2. Natural History KQ 2.1.What proportion of children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain is due to noninflammatory causes?

KQ 2.3.What proportion of children and adolescents aged 18 years or less experiences symptom resolution or recurrence? KQ 3. Diagnostic Performance KQ 3.1. In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, what is the test performance (sensitivity [Sn], specificity [Sp], and positive and negative predictive values [PPV, NPV] ) of ANA for pSLE compared with a cl inical diagnosis? KQ 3.2. In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, what is the test performance ( Sn, Sp, PPV, NPV ) of ANA for JIA compared with a clinical diagnosis? KQ 3.3. In children and adoles cents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, what is the test performance ( Sn, Sp, PPV, NPV ) with a clinical diagnosis? KQ 3.4.

Accuracy Modifiers KQ 4.1. In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, do age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and recent infections modify the diagnostic performance of ANA, RF, and CCP for pSLE compared with a clinical diagnosis? KQ 4.2. In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, do age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and recent infections modi fy the diagnostic performance of ANA, RF, and CCP for JIA compared with a clinical diagnosis? KQ 5. Clinical Impacts of Test Results In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, do ANA, RF, and CCP tes t results affect referral decisions, additional test s ordered, clinical management, and patient and parent anxiety due to the clinical uncertainty and additional tests? Methods KQs 1 and 2, serving as background information, were addressed in a narrative approach by locating and summarizing the related prevalence, incidence, and natural history information from the main search (described below) and additional searches using MEDLINE\u00ae and Google Scholar. For KQs 3 to 5, we followed standard methods for condu cting comparative effectiveness reviews; these methods were outlined in a prospectively developed protocol. We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE\u00ae, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) , Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL\u00ae), Science Citation Index Expanded\u00ae and Social Sciences Citation Index\u00ae (both via Web of Science\u00ae), Academic Search Complete, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, and OCLC PapersFirst. In addition, we searched conference proceedings from key scientific meetings, grey literature, and reference lists of included studies. We applied a diagnostic search filter and a child filter , when applicable. We conducted the original searches from 1960 to January 2010, and updated them in December 2010 and September 2011. Two reviewers independently screened the search results (titles and abstracts) to determine if an article met broad inclusion criteria. The full text of potentially relevant articles was assessed independently by two reviewers using detailed standard ized criteria . Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of individual studies using the QUADAS tool.7 Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by another using a standardized data extraction form. For each of these steps, d isagreement s were resolved through discussion or third -party adjudication , as needed . We examined t he diagnostic test characteristics , including Sn, Sp, PPV, and NPV , for each study and present ed forest plots to summarize the results for each test-disease pairing. Accuracy modifiers including age, sex, race or ethnicity, recent infection, and comorbidity were analyzed if studies provided sufficient data to calculate Sn and Sp . We examined a ny qualitative or ES-4 quantitative information on clinically important outcomes including referral, additional tests ordered , change in clinical management, and patient or parent anxiety due to the test results. Two reviewers independently assessed the strength of evidence for KQs 3 to 5 using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) system for grading evidence (AHRQ Guidance for the Evaluation of Medical Tests [draft ]).8 We assessed the strength of evidence for Sn and Sp. Assessments were b ased on the quantity and quality of individual studies, the directness of evidence, and the consistency and precision of the results. For each outcome , the strength of evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or insufficient . Results KQ 1.1. The Preval ence of Undiagnosed MSK Complaints in Children and Adolescents The prevalence of MSK pain ranged between 2 and 52 percent9-11 and increased steadily with age throughout childhood and adolescence.12,13 No studies reported the prevalence of joint swelling in children. KQ 1.2. The Prevalence of Test Positivity in Healthy Children and Adolescents The prevalence of positive ANA in healthy children ranged from 0 to 18 percent.14-22 The prevalence of positive RF in healthy children was estimated at 3 percent.23 The prevalence of CCP positivity in healthy children was reported in two studies and ranged from 0 to 0.6 percent .24,25 KQ 2. The Etiology and Resolution of Pediatric MSK Pain Noninflammatory etiologies accounted for the MSK pain in almost all (97 percent) children seen in a primary care setting .12 Physical trauma was the most common noninflammatory cause and accounted for 44 percent of children with MSK pain. In contrast, only 3.3 percent of children had their MSK pain attributed to inflammatory causes inc luding toxic synovitis (2.5 percent) and inflammatory arthritides (0.8 percent). The recurrence rates of pediatric MSK pain were generally high and varied considerably by site of the pain . KQ 3 . Test Performance of ANA, RF, and CCP One cohort study and 2 7 case -control studies addressed KQ 3 (diagnostic performance). In studies using the case -control design, children with known disease (i.e., JIA or pSLE) were compared with children who were healthy (i.e., the control group). This does not represent the target population of children with undiagnosed MSK pain, and therefore, these studies are at high risk of spectrum bias. None of the case -control studies provided information about the presence of MSK pain in either the cases or controls. None of the studies specifically addressed children with joint swelling. ES-5 KQ 3.1. ANA Test for pSLE in Children With MSK Pain Two case-control studies26,27 including 201 children (67 pSLE, 134 controls) examined the prevalence of a positive ANA test in children with pSLE and control groups including healthy children and children scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery. The Sn's were 91 and 100 percent , and Sp 's were 84 and 85 percent (Table A) . KQ 3.2. ANA Test for JIA in Children With MSK Pain Eight case-control studies26,28-34 including 1,382 children (1,067 JIA , 315 controls) examined the prevalence of a positive ANA test in children with JIA and controls including healthy children, children with nonrheumatic conditions , and children with other rheumatic diseases. . The Sn ranged from 1 to 62 percent , and Sp ranged from 73 to 100 percent (Table A) . KQ 3.3. RF Test for pSLE in Children With MSK Pain One case-control study35 with 46 children (14pSLE, 32 controls) examined the prevalence of a positive IgM-RF test for pSLE. The control group comprised healthy children and children with other rheumatic conditions or ulcerative colitis. The Sn was 29 percent , and Sp was 88 percent (Table A) . KQ 3.4. RF Test for JIA in Children With MSK Pain One retrospective cohort study36 examined the record s of pediatric patients who had an RF test and were seen at a children's hospital. Among the 437 patient records, 105 had a diagnosis of JIA. The remaining 332 patients had a mix of MSK complaints (n = 201) or symptoms suggestive of an und erlying autoimmune disease (n = 131). The Sn was 5 percent, and Sp was 98 percent (Table A). Fifteen case -control studies28,30,33,35 -47 including 1,647 children ( 986 JIA, 661 controls ) examined the prevalence of a positive IgM-RF test in children with JIA and controls. The control groups included healthy children, children with nonrheumatic conditions , and children with other rheumatic conditions. The Sn ranged from 0 to 35 percent, and Sp ranged from 94 to 100 pe rcent (Table A). KQ 3.5. CCP Test for pSLE in Children With MSK Pain No studies provided information to address this question. KQ 3.6. CCP Test for JIA in Children With MSK Pain Seven case -control studies24,25,30,48 -51 including 1,643 participants (729 JIA, 914 controls) examined the prevalence of a positive CCP test in children with JIA and controls including healthy children, children with nonrheumatic conditions, and children with other autoimmune diseases. Sn ranged from 2 to 42 percent, and Sp ranged from 93 to 100 p ercent (Table A). ES-6 KQ 4. Accuracy Modifiers of ANA, RF, and CCP Tests No studies provided data on accuracy modifiers (age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, recent infections) for any of the tests. KQ 5. Clinical Impacts of ANA, RF, and CCP Tests No studies provided information to address this question. Summary Studies that have investigated the prevalence of MSK pain in children report a wide range of prevalence from 2 to 52 percent. Noninflammatory causes of MSK pain account for the majority of diagnoses (97 percent). Among the healthy children, the median ANA positivity is 3 percent, median RF positivity is 0 percent, and CCP positivity is less than 1 percent. Only one retrospective c ohort study examined the diagnostic test characteristics of RF to diagnose JIA among children with undiagnosed MSK pain compared with a clinical diagnosis. It demonstrated a Sn of 5 percent and a Sp of 98 percent. Fifteen case -control studies did not specifically address the test performance of RF among children with undiagnosed MSK pain. The strength of evidence is low for both Sn and Sp (Table A). Further evidence is likely to change our confidence in the estimates of performance and is likely to change the estimates. The 12 case -control studies looking at other te st-disease combinations did not specifically address the prevalence of positive tests for ANA or CCP among children presenting with undiagnosed MSK pain. The strength of evidence is insufficient to determine the test performance of ANA or CCP to diagnose J IA or pSLE in children with undiagnosed MSK pain. No studies specifically addressed children with joint swelling. A general pattern of high Sp and low Sn was observed for almost all the test -disease combinations ; however, the design of case -control studies may lead to bias.52-54 The selective inclusion of cases with established disease (i.e., JIA or pSLE) is likely to lead to an overestimation of Sn. The inclusion of healthy controls is expected to decrease the likelihood of false positive test results and lead to an overestimation of Sp. Implications There is insufficient evidence to determine the test performance of ANA or CCP in children with undiagnosed MSK pain . The strength of evidence is low for the utility of RF in the diagnosis of JIA in children wi th undiagnosed MSK pain. A result of high Sp and low Sn was observed for almost all the test-disease combinations . The generally low Sn suggests that it is inappropriate to use these tests in isolation (i.e., without clinical assessment) to make a diagnosis of JIA and pSLE . In spite of the high Sp, the low prevalence of JIA and pSLE in the target population (i.e., children with undiagnosed MSK pain) makes the tests of limited diagnostic value. The presence of other clinical characteristics (e.g., mo rning stiffness, joint swelling, malar rash, cytopenia) may increase the pretest probability of the disease in question. While both the Sn and Sp for ANA for pSLE were high, this test in isolation has limited diagnostic value for children with undiagnosed MSK given the very low prevalence of pSLE , and up to 18 percent prevalence of a false positive ANA in the general population. ES-7 Limitations The generally insufficient strength of evidence is primarily attributable to the high risk of spectrum bias of the cas e-control studies, a result of the distinct disease and control groups not being representative of the target population of children with undiagnosed MSK pain. F or studies examining ANA for pSLE, incorporation bias is a concern because ANA is considered on e of the classification criteria f or SLE .55 There is no evidence with which to assess the impact of potential accuracy modifiers , and there is no evidence with which to assess the clinical utility of the tests including the impact of the test results on re ferrals, ordering of additional tests, patient management, and patient and parent anxiety levels. In addition to the issues identified above , there are general limitations for systematic reviews such as publication bias. We addressed this issue by conduct ing a comprehensive search of the published literature for potentially relevant studies. Search strategies included combinations of subject headings and free text words. Even though we applied a diagnostic search filter to the search strategies of the elect ronic databases, our searches identified over 11,000 records. Furthermore, t hese searches were supplemented by hand searching for grey literature (i.e., unpublished or difficult to find studies). There is also a possibility of study selection bias. However , we employed at least two independent reviewers to identify potentially relevant studies, and feel confident that the studies that were excluded from this report were done so for consistent and appropriate reasons. Conclusion Most of the evidence from the 28 studies included in this review was not applicable to the population of interest as studies examined children with known disease rather than with undiagnosed MSK pain. No studies specifically addressed children with joint swelling. No study provided a complete investigation on accuracy modifiers . No studies examined clinically important outcomes such as the impact of the test results on referrals, ordering of additional tests, patient management, and patient and parent anxiety levels . Because the Sn and Sp of these tests have yet to be verified, current evidence does not support their use as diagnostic tests for children with undiagnosed MSK pain . They have a potential application as an adjunct to a clinical assessment that suggests the presence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease . Future Research The following general recommendations for future research are based on the preceding discussion o f the evidence. In order to better understand the natural history of undiagnosed MSK pain in children and the probability of a diagnosis of JIA or pSLE in this population, prospective cohort studies of children and adolescents with MSK pain are needed. Given the low prevalence of JIA or pSLE, a sufficiently large number of participants is requi red. For the research to be generalizable, researchers need to use consistent test methodology and cutoffs as well as consistent and well -accepted clinical criteria for the diagnoses of JIA and pSLE . ES-8 Potential accuracy modifiers of test performance need to be examined, including age, sex, race, history of recent infections, presence of clinical characteristics other than MSK pain (e.g., morning stiffness, joint swelling, uveitis, malar rash, cytopenias) . The clinical impact of these tests (e.g., referral de cisions, additional tests ordered, clinical management, quality of life, psychological distress of child and/or parents) should be assessed in cohort studies. Efforts are needed to improve the overall quality of reporting of primary studies of diagnostic t est accuracy. The STARD checklist includes 25 items that address the level of detail that should be specified within such studies including descriptions of participants, tests methods, statistical methods, and results.56 This could be considered as a guide for authors reporting studies that evaluate diagnostic tests.

ANA = antinuclear antibody; CCP = cyclic -citrullinated peptide; = not NPV = predictive value; PPV = 1 Introduction Musculoskeletal Symptoms Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is pain that affects muscles, bones, ligaments, tendons, and nerves.57 Childhood MSK pain is common, with estimated prevalence ranging from 2 to 50 percent.1,10,12 Young children especially may have difficulty characterizing their symptoms, which makes accurate assessment based on the patient history difficult. In addition, the presence of MSK pain can cause anxiety among children and their parents. Concerns about the presence of a serious condition such as arthritis or lupus, which could lead to permanent damage, may prompt consultation with a physician .58 MSK pain can be di vided into rheumatic and nonrheumatic causes . Nonrheumatic causes account for the majority of childhood MSK pain and are generally attributable to benign conditions including minor physical trauma (i.e. , sprains and strains), overuse, and normal body growt h.3,5 In contrast, rheumatic causes , such as an inflammatory arthritis, are much less prevalent and a re generally chronic and require early diagnosis and treatment to prevent progression and disability. Common rheumatic causes of childhood MSK pain include pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE), Henoch -Schonlein purpura. However, MSK pain is not universally present in children with JIA ( 16 percent of children with JIA do not report pain59) and pSLE. A complete history and physical examination is generally considered to be the best way to make a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis .3,5 How ever, the complaint of MSK pain is often nonspecific and when combined with a lack of confidence in the MSK physical examination, can make it difficult to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.3,4 Hence, physicians may request additional laboratory tests . Serolo gical tests such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and cyclic -citrullinated peptide (CCP) may be ordered by physicians when children and adolescents are suspected of having a rheumatic cause for their MSK pain , despite the fact that the diagnostic performance and usefulness of these tests and the proper interpretation of the results for pediatric populations are largely uncertain. This comparative effectiveness review provides a synthesis of the evidence on the test performance of ANA , RF, and CCP tests in children and adolescents with undiagnosed MSK pain and on the impact of test results on clinical decisionmaking and clinically important outcome s. The report is intended for a broad audience including: primary care physicians who may c onsider ordering ANA, RF, or CCP tests in a child with MSK pain; health payers who provide coverage for these tests; and parents or caregivers who would like to know whether these tests can determine if their child does or does not have a particular diseas e. Pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an episodic, multisystem, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread inflammation of blood vessels and connective tissues.60 It is estima ted that the incidence of pSLE is 0.3 to 0.9 per 100,000 children per year61 and the prevalence is 3.3 to 8.8 per 100,000 .62 The onset of pSLE is rare before 5 years of age and 2 uncommon before adolescence, after which the rates of occurrence stabilize.60 The diagnosis of pSLE is generally based on the classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)55,63 which include specific signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests , including a positive ANA (see Appendix A). Left untreated, SLE is often progressive and can be fatal.64 As awareness of the occurrence of pSLE has increased, early diagnosis has become more common60 and rapid introduction of effective immunosuppressive treatment has lead to improved outcome s.64 JIA is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of children affecting approximately 1 in 1,000 children.65,66 Classification criteria developed by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR)67are used worldwide to provide consistency a cross clinical research studies. The ILAR criteria have supplanted earlier criteria of t he ACR68 for the classification of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)69 for the classification of juvenile chronic a rthritis (JCA). To maintain consistency , the acronym JIA will be used to represent JIA , JRA, and JCA throughout this report. It is important to note that in all three of the published criteria patients are classified based on characteristic symptoms and s igns, including the presence of objective arthritis for a minimum of 6 to 12 weeks. In spite of significant overlap, the classification criteria vary in terms of how the presence of RF is addressed. In the ILAR criteria, the presence of a positive RF on tw o occasions excludes five of the seven subtypes of JIA. In the EULAR criteria, a positive RF changes the classification from JCA to JRA. In the ACR criteria, RF is not considered at all in the classification. Therefore, depending on the criteria being used , the reported prevalence of RF will be different. In adults with suspected rheumatoid arthritis, tests for RF70 and, more recently, CCP antibodies are frequently requested as part of the diagnostic work -up.70,71 Although there is less evidence supportin g the usefulness of these tests in children, they are often ordered as part of the diagnostic evaluation of a child suspected to have JIA. Without effective treatment, JIA can progress and cause damage to cartilage, bone , and soft tissues, and may lead to severe disability, functional loss, and, in rare cases, organ failure and death.66,71 Although early diagnosis and treatment may reduce the progression of the disease and induce remission, only a minority of patients experience complete resolution of JIA p rior to adulthood.66 Antinuclear Antibody, Rheumatoid Factor, and Cyclic -Citrullinated Peptide Tests The immune system is a defense system that fends off foreign invaders including bacteria and viruses. However, the immune system may malfunction and mislab el one's own body cells as foreign particles , and this may elicit an attack response. When the immune system attacks one's own body cell s, it produces autoantibod ies that target specific antigens naturally found in the body. ANA, RF, and CCP are examples o f the autoantibodies specifically targeting the nuclear particles , the fragment crystallizable ( Fc) portion of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G , and CCPs , respectively. An ANA test is often used to screen for autoimmune conditions ,74 especially when a diagnosis of SLE is suspected. The gold standard for ANA testing is t he indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) ANA test, which involves incubation of serial dilutions of the patient's sera with substrate cells , usually human 3 epithelial tumor line (HEp -2).72 If antibody to nuclear elements is present, binding to the substrate will be detected by fluorescein -conjugated anti -human Ig, which attaches to the antibody and is visual ly inspected using a fluorescence microscope. The assessment of fluorescence is based on the interpretation of this inspection and, as a result, may be somewhat subjective and vary from one laboratory to another. Each laboratory determines the cutoff used for a positive test, and as a result, titers from one laboratory cannot be compared w ith another. Research has shown that using a high titer ANA does not increase the positive predictive value for connective tissue disease.73 The detection of antibodies may also be assessed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In EIA, an antigen is affixed to a surface, and then the patient serum sample is applied over the surface so ANA, if present, can bind to the antigen. EIA methods and expected results vary among manufacturers because there is no agreed standard for the antigen preparations that should be included or for the concentration(s) of the relevant antigen preparations.74 Results of studies that compare IIF and EIA for ANA have been inconsistent, with some showing poor correlation,26 and others demonstrating consistency.74 RFs are Ig that react specifically with the Fc fragment of the IgG molecule. RFs are found in all Ig isotypes ( i.e., IgA, IgG, IgD, IgM, and IgE), but the 19S IgM -RF is the most frequently used isotype for rheumatic disease testing , including arthritis .75 The presen ce of RFs is typically determined by agglutination assays, nephelometry, or E IA. The a gglutination assay method mainly employs latex beads as a substrate to which human or rabbit IgG is bound. Nephelometry is a photometric test in which complexes formed be tween the IgG and RF are detected by light scattering, which is dependent upon the concentration of those immune complexes. Latex agglutination and nephelometry only measure 19S IgM -RF, whereas EIAs have been designed to measure the various RF isotypes.75 The CCP test detects the presence of autoantibodies to citrullinated peptides in serum.76 Abnormal citrullination of various peptides is present in a variety of human diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis. However, the formation of antibodies to citrullinated peptides seems to be specific for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis .71 Anti- CCP2 (a second -generation assay) is currently the most widely used anti -CCP assay.71Anti-CCP antibodies and anti -citrullinated filaggrin antibodies are locally produced in inflamed joints, and citrullinated fibrin is found in the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis .77 In adults, a CCP test is usually ordered along with a RF test when evaluating a patient with inflammatory arthritis and when rheumatoid arthritis is considered on the differential diagnosis. The utility of the CCP test in pediatric rheumatic conditions is not clear. Objectives of This Evidence Report In order to better understand how the ANA, RF, and CCP tests p erform in the clinical setting in which a child with MSK pain will be seen , it is important to know the prevalence of MSK complaints (including MSK pain and joint swelling) in children who do not have JIA and pSLE. It is also important to be aware of the r ate of false positives for these tests (i.e., the proportion of otherwise healthy children who have a positive ANA, RF, or CCP). The appropriate interpret ation of test performance also requires an understanding of the disease progression and changes in sig ns and symptoms in children with MSK pain who may or may not also have JIA or pSLE. In addition to providing this background information, t he objectives of this report were to assess the test performance of ANA, RF, and CCP tests in children and adolescen ts with 4 undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling compared with clinical diagnoses of pSLE and JIA; to explore the difference in test performance for accuracy modifiers including age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities, and recent infections ; and, t o evaluate the impact of test results on clinical decisionmaking and clinically important outcomes such as referrals, ordering of additional tests, clinical management, and anxiety experienced by children and parents. We addressed the following Key Questio ns (KQs): Key Questions KQ 1. Prevalence and Incidence KQ 1.1.

KQ 5. Clinical Impacts of Test Results KQ 5. In children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with undiagnosed MSK pain and/or joint swelling, do ANA, RF, and CCP test results affect referral decisions, additional test s ordered, clinical management, and patient and parent anxiety due to the clinica l uncertainty and additional tests? Analytic Framework The analytic framework (Figure 1) depicts the five KQs within the context of the pediatric population ( 18 years) with MSK complaints . In general, the figure illustrates how diagnostic accuracy may be modified by demographic and clinical factors. It also indicates how test results may influence four important areas including referral to specialists, additional tests, decisions regarding clinical management, and parents' and patients' level of anxiety . The epidemiology and natural history of the targeted rheumatic conditions are described independently of the test results. 6 Figure 1. Analytic framework for antibody testing for MSK complai nts in pediatric populations (18 years) ANA = antinuclear antibody; CCP = cyclic -citrullinated peptide; JIA = systemic lupus erythematosus; RF = rheumatoid factor 7 Methods Topic Development and Refinement In this chapter we document a prospectively developed protocol that was used to conduct this comparative effectiveness review . A core research team was assembled by the University of Alberta Evidence -based Practice Center. In consultation with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ), a panel of key informants was created to provide input in the development of the Key Question s (KQs) and scope of the evidence report. The public was invite d to comment on these KQs over a period of 1 month. After reviewing the public comment s, the KQs were finalized and submitted to AHRQ for approval. A technical expert panel was subsequently created to provide content and methodological expertise throughout the development of the comparative effectiveness review. Search Strategy The research librarian, in collaboration with the investigative team, developed and implemented search strategies designed to identify evidence relevant to questions of diagnostic performance and clinical impact of the tests (Appendix B) . KQs 1 and 2, the answers to which serve as background information, were addressed using a narrative approach by locating and summarizing information on the related disease prevalence, incidence, and natural history from the main search (described below) and additional searches using MEDLINE\u00ae and Google Scholar. As the primary of focuses of this report, KQs 3, 4, and 5 were addressed by a rigorous systematic review process including a comprehensive search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE\u00ae, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, CINAHL\u00ae, Science Citation Index Expanded\u00ae and Social Sciences Citation Index\u00ae (both vi a Web of Science\u00ae), Academic Search Complete, Proquest Dissertations & Theses, and OCLC PapersFirst. We applied a diagnostic search filter and a child filter , when applicable. We conducted the original searches from 1960 to January 2010, and updated them i n December 2010 and September 2011. Search terms were identified by reviewing search strategies of systematic reviews on similar topics and by examining how potentially relevant studies were indexed in various databases (Appendix B). A combination of subj ect headings and text words was adapted for each electronic resource : (arthritis OR lupus erythematosus OR pain OR fibromyalgia OR benign joint hypermobility OR joint instability OR patellofemoral pain syndrome OR arthralgia OR limb pain OR sy novitis OR JIA OR JRA OR JSLE OR joint swelling) AND (child* OR infant* kid* toddler* OR pubescen* OR puberty* OR p?ediatric) AND (screening OR natural history OR incidence OR prevalence OR referral OR diagnosis O R predictive value of tests OR reproducibility of results OR sex factors OR age factors OR anxiety OR comorbidity) AND (ANA test OR FANA test OR antinuclear In addition to the searches of electronic databases, we searched the following conference proceedings and scientific meetings: American College of Rheumatology , Joint meeting of the British Society for Rheumatology, Canadia n Rheumatology Association, European League Against Rheumatism , International League of Associations for Rheumatology , and American 8 Academy of Pediatrics f rom 2005 to 2010. Additionally, we searched the bibliographies of the included studies and reviews fo r relevant studies. We set up s earch alerts for PubMed and Web of Science to identify any new and potentially relevant studies during the course of the review. Results from the literature searches were entered into a Thomson Reuters Reference Manager 11.0.1\u00ae bibliographic database. Study Selection A two -stage selection was carried out. For the initial broad screening stage , each article was screened by two independent reviewers who assessed the relevance of the study based on its title and abstract usi ng prespecified broad screening criteria. We excluded articles if they were judged clearly as (1) not primary studies reporting on prevalence of conditions, diagnostic test accuracy, or clinical impact, (2) not ANA, RF, or CCP tests, or (3) did not include a pediatric population. Articles were rated as include , exclude , or unsure . The full text of studies rated as include or unsure by both reviewers were retrieved. Discrepancies in decision s between reviewers were resolved through discussion or third party adjudication , if needed . For the second level of screening the full-text of each article was further examined by two independent reviewers using a standard inclusion/exclusion form (Appendix C) . This form was based on a specific and comprehen sive set of criteria ( Table 1). Each reviewer rated the article as include , exclude , or unsure . There was no restriction on study design, language, or publication year. The minimal requirement for inclusion was that studies must have recruited a popu lation comprised of children and adolescents aged 18 years or less, examined the appropriate tests and reference standards, and provided information on (1) sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) or (2) clinically important outcome s. Discrepancies between th e reviewers were resolved through discussion or third party adjudication , if needed. The corresponding author of the article was contacted when additional information was needed for making the inclusion/exclusion decisions. Table 1. Inclusion and exclusio n criteria Article Type - Studies reporting original research - Any language - No restriction on publication year , except s tudies of ANA published before 1980 (excluded because detection methods using animal substrates are no longer considered valid) Participants - Studies providing separate data for a population comprising children (18 years) with undiagnosed MSK pain or joint swelling, a diagnosis of pSLE or JIA, or index test results (i.e., ANA, RF, CCP) Study Design - Studies of any design that included a t least 2 participants Index Tests - ANA, RF, CCP - The assay method of ANA using animal substrate was excluded (pre-1980 methodology) - The test of hidden RF was excluded (proposed as an alternate to RF in JIA in 1970s but does not relate to conventional RF tests) Reference Standard - Diagnosis of pSLE or JIA based on clinical criteria Outcomes - For KQ 3 and 4: Studies providing sufficient data to calculate Sn and Sp - For KQ 5: Studies providing numerical data or a narrative description regarding referral decisions, additional tests ordered, clinical management, and patient and parent anxiety due to the clinical uncertaint y or additional tests ANA = antinuclear antib ody; CCP = cyclic -citrullinated Sn = sensitivity; Sp = specificity 9 Data Extraction Data were extracted by a single reviewer using a standard data extraction form and verified by a second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or third party adjudication , if needed. We e xtracted data for the following categories: study characteri stics, participant characteristics, index test, reference standard, and outcomes. Quality Assessment We assessed the methodological quality of each study using the QUADAS checklist.7 The tool assess es important common biases in diagnostic studies including spectrum, incorporation, and verification biases (Appendix C) . Spectrum bias occurs when included patients do not represent the intended spectrum of severity for the target condition (i.e., JIA or pS LE).78 Incorporation bias occurs when the index test (i.e., ANA, RF, or CCP) is incorporated in the reference standard (e.g., ILAR or ACR criteria).78 Partial verification bias occurs when a nonrandom set of patients does not undergo the reference standard .78 Differential verification bias occurs when a set of patients is verified with a second reference standard, especially when this selection depends on the index test result.78 Disease progression bias occurs when the patient's condition changes between a dministering the index test and the reference standard. Information bias occurs when the results of the index test are interpreted knowing the results of the reference standard, and vice versa.78 Two reviewers performed quality assessment independently. De cision rules regarding application of QUADAS were developed a priori. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or third party adjudication , as needed. Data Analysis and Synthesis We summarized t he general characteristics of studies using descriptive statistics. For the diagnostic performance , we constructed 2x2 tables and calculated Sn , Sp, and positive and negative predictive values. For visual interpretation we presented the r esults in forest plots. An a priori decision was made to not conduct meta -analysis due to the expected large degree of heterogeneity in participant characteristics and test positive thresholds across studies. When data were available, subgroup analyses were conducted by accuracy modifiers, as well as by assay methods used and JI A onset -types . Rating the Body of Evidence The strength of evidence was graded for KQs 3 to 5 using the AHRQ system for grading the strength of evidence (AHRQ Guidance for the Evaluation of Medical Tests (draft)).8 We assessed four domains including risk o f bias, consistency, directness, and precision, and developed a summary of overall strength of evidence. The grading was done by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by discussion or third party adjudication , as needed. The risk of bias domain was scored as low, medium, or high risk of bias corresponding to the results of QUADAS; the consistency domain was scored as consistent, inconsistent, or unknown based on the visual interpretation of the forest plots; directness was scored as direct or indirect based on the relevance of the evidence to the corresponding KQ; precision was scored as precise or imprecise based on the width of 95 percent confidence intervals . The overall summary rating was evaluated as high, moderate, low, or insufficient . 10 Applicability Applicability refer s to how generalizable the findings of this report are to a wider range of populations that vary by age, sex, clinical presentation, disease severity, and clinical setting. It was assessed according to the AHRQ Guidance for the Evaluation of Medical Test s (draft).8 Peer Review and Public Commentary Six experts in pediatric medicine, pediatric rheumatology, rheumatology, pathology, and diagnostic testing review ed the draft report and provide d feedback. Reviewer comments were considered by the University of Alberta Evidence -based Practice Center in preparation of the final report. All peer reviewer comments and the disposition of comments were submitted to AHRQ for assessment and approval. 11 Results: Part One The aim of Key Questions ( KQs) 1 and 2 was to provide background information for the interpretation of the results of KQs 3, 4, and 5. Studies were selected based on the availability of the evidence and their representativeness to the pediatric population of North America. Key Question 1.1. Incidence and Prevalence of Undiagnosed Musculoskeletal Complaints in Children In studies of the epidemiology of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain in children, 60 -85 percent of school -aged children reported at least one episode of MSK pain within a 3 month period .6,79 More girls reported pain (65 percent) than boys (55 percent).79 Up to 30 percent of children and adolescents reported having experienced chronic pain (including MSK pain) which lasted for more than 6 months.2,80-83 No studies reported the prevalence of joint swelling in children. The prevalence of MSK pain ranges from 2 percent in 12 -year-olds to 52 percent in 18 -year- olds.9-11 The prevalence of MSK pain increases steadily with age throughout childhood and adolescence.12,13 Haraldstad , et al.,79 examined 1,238 Norwegian schoolchildren aged 8 to 18 years and found that the prevalence of back pain increased with age for both sexes.79 A 4-year prospective study report ed that the incidence of new -onset low back pain doubled with age from 13 percent in 12 -year olds to 24 percent in 15 -year-olds.80 While s ome studies reported that low back, neck, shoulder, leg, and chronic pain were more prevalent in girls than boys,79,80 ,84 two studies found no such difference ,85,86 and one found male predominance.13 Key Question 1.2: The Positivity of Antinuclear Antibody, Rheumatoid Factor, and Cyclic-Citrullinated Peptide Tests in Healthy Children Nine studies examined the prevalence of a positive ANA in a total of 1,413 healthy children and found a range of 0 to 18 percent14-22 All of these studies examined children and adolescents 18 years old or less except Baig and Shere ,18 which included 1 - to 19 -year old s and Youngchiyud , et al.,21 which included 12 - to 20 -year old s. The definition of a positive cutoff of ANA titer range d from 1:5 to 1:40. Studies on the positivity of the RF and CCP tests in healthy children were scarce. A commentary87 indicated that most children with a positive RF test did not have JIA ,36,88 and most children with JIA did not have a positive RF.89 Kasapcopur , et al.,23 investigated 118 healthy Turkish children, using a cutoff of >25 IU/ml , and found a rate of 3 percent RF positivity.23 The prevalence of CCP positivity in healthy children was 0 and 0.6 percent as reported in two studies .24,25 Key Question 2.1. Noninflammatory Causes of Pediatric Musculoskeletal Pain De Inocencio12 conducted a retrospective chart review on 317 children between 3 and 15 years of age in a primary care setting in Madrid.12 Noninflammatory etiologies accounted for the overwhelming majority (96.7 percent) of the MSK pain for children seen in primary care. He found that physical trauma (43.6 percent) was the most common cause of pediatric MSK pain, 12 and bone and muscle contusion s were the most common trauma subgroup. Other noninflammatory etiologies included overuse (2 4.0 percent), osteochondroses (10.3 percent), hypermobility (3.3 percent), non -specific pain (7.6 percent), grow ing pain (3.5 percent), and viral infection (4.5 percent). Non -specific pain, growing pains, and hypermobility were much more common in preschool children (3 to 5 years) than in both school -aged children (6 to 9 years) and adolescents (10 to 14 years). Key Question 2.2. Inflammatory Causes of Pediatric Musculoskeletal Pain De Inocencio12 reported that inflammatory etiologies accounted for a small fraction (3.3 percent) of primary care visits from children with MSK pain , and included toxic synovitis (2.5 percent) and inflammatory arthritis (0.8 percent). This was consistent with an earli er study by McGhee, et al.,59 who conducted a retrospective chart review of 226 children with MSK pain who were referred for an initial rheumatology co nsultation . Among a group of 111 patients whose only presenting complaint was MSK pain, one child ( 1 percent) had a rheumatic disease (ankylosing spondylitis ), and none had pSLE or JIA. The majority (81 percent) had mechanical MSK or overuse syndromes as e xplanation s of their pain. In addition, the same study observed that among the 76 children diagnosed with JIA, only 12 (16 percent) included pain as part of their main complaints . Earlier observations by Sherry, et al.,90 stated that 14 percent of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of JIA reported no pain. Although the numbers differ, both studies confirm that the absence of MSK pain does not rule out a diagnosis of JIA. Key Question 2.3. The Resolution or Recurrence of Pediatric Musculoskeletal Pain The r ecurrence of MSK pain was common in children. Thirty -five percent of 14 -year old s who previously complained of low back pain reported recurrent episodes at age 18 and into early adulthood.91 Mikkelsson , et al.,92 examined 1,628 school -aged children with we ekly pain at baseline and found that 52 percent reported MSK pain at 1 -year followup. 13 Results: Part Two Literature Search The search strateg ies identified 11,994 citations from electronic databases and hand searching (Figure 2). Initial broad screening identified 496 potentially relevant citations . Of these, we included one retrospective cohort study and 27 case -control studies ; all 28 studies addressed KQ 3 (diagnostic performance ). No study provided subgroup data to address KQ 4 (diagnostic modifiers). No study addressed KQ 5 (test impacts). See Appendix D for a list of excluded studies. Characteristics of Included Studies The 2 8 included studies were published between 1966 and 2009 (Appendix F) . The mean age (where reported) of children ranged from 6.4 to 15 years of age. The studies were all published as full manuscripts in peer -reviewed journals. Thirteen studies24,30,31,33,37 -39,41,43,44,46,48,49 were conducted in Europe, nine 26,28,29,32,35,36,45,47,50 in North America, tw o40,42 in South America, three27,34,51 in Asia, and one25 in Africa. Nine studies26,28,32,37,39,45,46,48,50 received funding from government, four24,30,34,51 from academic institutions, and four27,31,41,47 from noncommercial institutions. The remaining 1 1 studies25,29,33,35,36,38,40,42 -44,49 did not report the source of funding. One study36 used a retrospective cohort design and included the spectrum of children with diagnosed and undiagnosed MSK pain. The remaining 2 7 studies used a case -control type desig n. The ANA test was examined in nine studies (two26,27 for pSLE and eight26,28 -34 for JIA). The RF test was examined in 17 studies (one35 for pSLE and 1628,30,33,35 -47 for JIA). The CCP test was examined in seven studies24,25,30,48 -51 for JIA. There were no studies that examined the CCP test for pSLE. All of the studies included patients with MSK pain; none specifically addressed children with joint swelling. 14 Figure 2.

Overall, there is substantial concern regarding spectrum bias. Most studies (97 percent) were rated no regarding the representativeness of the study population due to the case-control study design. The selection criteria of the population were not described adequately in most studies (83 percent). For studies examin ing ANA for pSLE, incorporation bias is a concern because ANA is considered one of the classification criteria f or SLE.55 Figure 3.

Antinuclear Antibody Test for Pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Study Characteristics Two case -control studies26,27 including 201 children (67 pSLE, 134 controls) examined the prevalence of a positive ANA test in children with pSLE and control groups including healthy children and children scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery ( Table 2). No information was provided in either study about the presence or absence of MSK pain or joint swelling in either the patient or the control groups. The assay method of the index test in both st udies was indirect im munofluorescence (IIF). Both studies used a positive cutoff titer of 1:40. Quantitative Results The sensitivities (Sn) were 91 and 100 percent, the specificities (Sp) were 84 and 85 percent, the positive predictive values (PPV) were 7 1 and 84 percent, and negative predictive values (NPV) were 96 and 100 percent (Figure 4 ). Among control groups, the proportions of children who tested positive on the ANA test were 16 percent (healthy children ) and 15 percent among patients scheduled for elective orthopedic surgeries .

Antinuclear Antibody Test for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Study Characteristics Eight case -control studies26,28 -34 including 1,382 children (1,067 JIA, 315 control s) examined the prevalence of a positive ANA test in children with JIA and control groups (Table 3). In four studies all participants were under 18 years of age; two studies28,34 included a small number of young adults. Two studies26,31 did not report age. For the c ontrol group s, three studies32-34 included healthy children, five26,28 -31 included children with nonrheumatic conditions , and one32 included children with other rheumatic diseases. Three studies29,31,34 recruited JIA patients from general hospitals or clin ics, and the source was unreported by the remaining studies. For the classification of JIA, four studies26,28,32,34 used the ACR criteria, two30,31 used the ILAR criteria, one33 used the EULAR criteria, and the classification criteria were unreported in on e study.29 Only one study ( Nordal , et al.,31) looked at children with MSK pain who either had a diagnosis of JIA or acute lymphoblastic leukemia; none of the other studies commented on the presence or absence of MSK pain or joint swelling in either the pat ient or control groups. The frequency of uveitis or iridocyclitis was reported by three studies: 18 percent of JIA patients in Nordal , et al. ,31 6 percent of JIA patients in Osborn , et al.,32 and 3 percent in Wakhlu , et al.34 IIF was used in all studies ex cept Jones , et al. ,29 who did not report the method used. In studies that reported the positive cutoff titers, the titers ranged from >1:20 to >1:320. Fawcett26 and Nordal , et al. ,31 examined multiple assay methods of ANA for JIA (Appendix F). Quantitative Results The Sn ranged from 1 to 62 percent (median = 54 percent); the Sp ranged from 73 to 100 percent (median = 95 percent); PPV ranged from 88 to 100 percent (median = 96 percent); and NPV ranged from 15 to 70 percent (median = 30 percent) (Figure 5). Analyses by subtypes of JIA are presented in Appendix G. Among the healthy controls, the proportion of children (three groups32-34) who tested positive for ANA ranged from 0 to 27 percent (median = 3). Among controls with nonrheumatic conditions ,26,28 -31 the proportion of children with positive tests ranged from 0 to 18 percent (median = 6). There were two studies that reported very low Sn. Both had zero percent prevalence of a positive ANA among controls. In one,30 this could be explained by the ir use of a high cutoff titer of >1:320. In the other study34 the reason for the disparity is unclear. Figure 5.

Rheumatoid Factor Test for Pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Study Characteristics One case -control study by Hanson, et al.,35 examined the prevalence of a positive IgM-RF test in 14 children with pSLE and 32 controls . The study was published in 1966. The assay method for the RF test was latex fixation. As the study was conducted prior to the development of the ACR criteria for the classification of SLE, patients were diagnosed base d on criteria developed by Cook , et al. ,93 and Urbach.94 The control groups comprised a mix of healthy children and children with other rheumatic conditions and ulcerative colitis. The study did not comment on the presence or absence of MSK pain or joint swelling in either the patients or controls. Quantitative Results The Sn was 29 percent and Sp was 88 percent.35 The proportion of children who tested positive for RF was 13 percent. Key Question 3.4. Rheumatoid Factor Test for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Study Characteristics One retrospective cohort study by Eichenfield, et al.,36 examined the record s of pediatric patients who had a RF test and were seen in the walk in clinic, inpatient service, emergency department, or Pediatric Rheumatology Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Table 4). Among the 437 patient records that were evaluated, 105 had a diagnosis of JIA according to ACR criteria. The remaining 332 patients (combined into one control group) had a mix of MSK complaints (n = 201) or symptoms suggestive of an underlying autoimmune disease (n = 131). Fifteen case -control studies examined the prevalence o f a positive RF in children with JIA and controls ( Table 4). The diagnosis was based on the ACR criteria in nine studies ,28,36,39 -42,45 -47 the EULAR criteria in four,33,37,38,44 and the ILAR criteria in one.33 Two35,43 did not state which classification criteria were used. In one study, 62 percent of patients had chroni c bilateral iridocyclitis .46 For the control group s, nine studies33,37 -41,44,46,47 used healthy children, three28,30,45 used children with nonrheumatic conditions , one42 used children with other rheumatic conditions , and two studies35,43 used a mixed group that included healthy children and children with nonrheumatic and other rheumatic conditions. None of the case -control studies commented on the presence or absence of MSK pain or joint swe lling in the patient or control groups. Studies reporting data on non -IgM RF tests are presented in Appendix F. Quantitative Results Results from the cohort study by Eichenfield, et al.,36 show an Sn of 5 percent and a Sp of 98 percent ( Figure 6). This is consistent with the RF results from the same center's total JIA population (6.9 percent) as reported in their paper. The authors also analyze d the post-test probability of JIA based on the reported Sn and Sp. The analyses take into account the pretest probability or prevalence of JIA, which in this cohort was 24 percent. The results showed that 21 probability of JIA increased to 45 percent with a positive test. They also showed that in a typical primary care practice, the probability of JIA went from 0.3 percent to 0.7 percent with a positive test. Fifteen case -control studies, including 1,647 children ( 986 JIA, 661 controls ) examined the prevalence of a positive IgM-RF test ( Figure 6). Sn ranged from 0 to 35 percent (median = 11 percent), Sp ranged from 94 to 100 pe rcent (median = 100 percent), PPV ranged from 0 to 100 percent (medi an = 100 percent), and NPV ranged from 20 to 7 1 percent (median = 4 8 percent). The proportion of healthy children who tested positive ranged from 0 to 3 percent (median = 0). For the controls with nonrheumatic conditions, the proportion ranged from 0 to 6 percent (median = 5). For the controls (two groups) that included a mix of healthy children and children with other conditions, the proportion that tested positive ranged fro m 2 to 5 percent. There does not appear to be a relationship between the cutoff titer used (if reported) and Sn. Analyses by subtypes of JIA are presented in Appendix G. Figure 6.

Cyclic -Citrullinated Peptide Test for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Study Characteristics case -control studies24,25,30,48 -51 including 1, 643 participants ( 729 JIA, 9 14 control ) examined the prevalence of a positive CCP test in children with JIA and controls (Table 5). None of the studies reported on the presence or absence of MSK pain or joint swelling in either the patient or control groups. The control group in four studies24,25,48,50 consisted of healthy children ; two studies used a nonrheumatic patient control group (cardiovascular dysfunction,30 allergies and idiopathic thrombocytopenia51). One study49 used a mixed group of healthy children and children with other autoimmun e diseases as their comparator . Four studies24,25,30,51 used the ILAR criteria for classification of JIA ; one study50 used ACR criteria. All seven studies used the EIA method; however, different cutoff points were used. It is not clear from the reported methods which anti - CCP assays were used in the studies. Quantitative Results The Sn ranged from 2 to 42 percent and Sp ranged from 93 to 100 percent (Figure 7). The PPV rang ed from 20 to 100 percent and NPV ranged from 11 to 7 1 percent. The proportion of healthy controls (four groups) that tested positive for CCP ranged from 0 to 0.6 percent (median = 0). The proportion of controls with nonrheumatic conditions (two groups) th at tested positive ranged from 0 to 4 percent (median = 2). Among the mixed controls (one group), 7 percent tested positive.

All cas e-control studies were assessed as high risk of bias primarily due to spectrum bias and lack of adequate reporting of selection criteria. Therefore, strength of evidence derived from case -control studies was initially assessed as low. This assessment w as downgraded to insufficient when other limitations were noted in any of the other domains. All studies were considered to provide indirect evidence due to the use of surrogate outcomes (i.e., test performance) instead of health outcomes . Table 6.

The study populations were relatively he terogeneous in terms of the ethnicity, a nd a wide range of conditions were included. T he age of the participants was similarly broad, as was the age of disease onset ( generally between age 1 and 15 years when it was reported). The settings in which the tests were conducted also varied . Disease a ctivity and severity were rarely described, but when reported more than half of the study participants had active disease. The diagnostic performance of the tests did not appear to differ significantly across the spectrum of patients and institutional sour ces, which would normally imply that the results are generalizable to a broader population. Only one36 of the 28 studies examined the performance of these tests in children with undiagnosed MSK pain \u2014the primary population of interest for this review . In the study by Eichenfield, et al.,36 even with a highly selected population of children who had undergone an RF test, only 4.8 percent of children with JIA had a positive RF, and 6 of 332 ( 1.8 percent) of the 28 remaining children \u2014including 115 with only MSK pa in\u2014were RF positive. The authors conducted further analyses which demonstrated that in the primary care setting, the pretest probability of 0.3 percent only increased to 0.7 percent with a positive test. None of the remaining studies reported on the presen ce or absence of MSK pain in either the patients or controls, and in all of these studies, the patients had known diagnoses of either JIA or pSLE. For this reason , the applicability of the tests to childre n with undiagnosed MSK pain is unclear. In the clinical setting of MSK pain, physicians are primarily interested in the degree to which the test results might change the probability that a patient with a positive or negative test may or may not have the disease (the positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value [NPV], respectively). The PPV and NPV of these tests will change dramatically depending on the baseline prevalence (or pretest probability ) of disease . Therefore, case -control studies that compare children with disease to a health y population in a 1:1 ratio (a 50 percent disease prevalence) may overestimate test performance and utility . In contrast, i n children with undiagnosed MSK pain seen in a primary care setting where prevalence of JIA or pSLE is less than one percent.12 the same test will identify more false positives than true positives. We developed a series of hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate this (Table 7). Table 7. Hypothetical scenarios for PPV at different baseline disease prevalence PPV NPV ANA - pSLE (Sn 50% 85% ANA - 36%, Sp = 1% 6% Baseline 50% 86% CCP - 9%, Sp = prevalence 1% 8% Baseline prevalence 50% 90% antibody; CCP = c peptide ; JIA idiopathic arthritis; predictive value; PPV Sn = sensitivity; Sp = specificity 29 Summary and Discussion Summary Incidence and Prevalence of Musculoskeletal Pain in Children and Adolescents Studies that have investigated the prevalence of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain in children report a wide range of prevalence from 2 to 52 percent. Noninflammatory causes of MSK pain account for the majority of diagnoses (97 percent). No studies reported the prevalence of joint swelling in children. Prevalence of Test Positivity in Health y Children and Adolescents From the studies included in our review, among the healthy control group s, the median antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity is three percent, median RF positivity is zero percent, and CCP positivity is less than one percent. Test Performance of ANA, RF, and CCP in Children and Adolescents With Undiagnosed MSK Pain Only one re trospective c ohort study examined the test performance of rheumatoid factor (RF) to diagnose juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) among children with MSK pain. It demonstrated a sensitivity (Sn) of 5 percent and a specificity (Sp) of 98 percent. Fifteen cas e-control studies did not specifically address the test performance of RF among children with MSK pain. The strength of evidence is low for both Sn and Sp ( Table 8). Further evidence is likely to change our confidence in the estimates of performance, and i s likely to change the estimates. The 12 case -control studies looking at other test -disease combinations did not specifically address the prevalence of positive tests for ANA or cyclic -citrullinated peptide (CCP) among children presenting with MSK pain. T he strength of evidence is insufficient to determine the test performance of ANA or CCP to diagnose JIA or p ediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) in children with undiagnosed MSK pain ( Table 9). A general pattern of high Sp and low Sn was observed for almost all the test -disease combinations ; however, the design of case -control studies may lead to bias.52-54 The selective inclusion of cases with established disease (i.e., JIA or pSLE) is likely to lead to an overestimation of Sn. The inclusion of he althy controls is expected to decrease the likelihood of false positive test results and lead to an overestimation of Sp. Implications There is insufficient evidence to determine the test performance of ANA or CCP in children with undiagnosed MSK pain . The strength of evidence is low for the utility of RF in the diagnosis of JIA in children with undiagnosed MSK pain. A result of high Sp and low Sn was observed for almost all the test-disease combinations . The generally low Sn suggests that it is inappropriate to use these tests in isolation (i.e., without clinical assessment) to make a diagnosis of JIA and pSLE . In spite of the high Sp, the low prevalence of JIA and pSLE in the target 30 population (i.e., children with undiagnosed MSK pain) makes the tests of limited diagnostic value. The presence of other clinical characteristics (e.g., morning stiffness, joint swelling, malar rash, cytopenia) may increase the pretest probability of the disease in question. While both the Sn and Sp for ANA for pSLE w ere high, this test in isolation has limited diagnostic value for children with undiagnosed MSK given the very low prevalence of pSLE , and up to 18 percent prevalence of false positive ANA in the general population. Limitations The generally insufficient s trength of evidence is primarily attributable to the high risk of spectrum bias in the case -control studies, a result of the distinct disease and control groups not being representative of the target population of children with undiagnosed MSK pain. For studies examining ANA for pSLE, incorporation bias is a concern because ANA is considered one of the classification criteria f or SLE .55 There is no evidence with which to assess the impact of potential accuracy modifiers , and there is no evidence with which to assess the clinical utility of the tests including the impact of the test results on referrals, ordering of additional tests, patient management, and patient and parent anxiety levels. In addition to the issues identified above , there are general limita tions for systematic reviews such as publication bias. We addressed this issue by conduct ing a comprehensive search of the published literature for potentially relevant studies. Search strategies included combinations of subject headings and free text word s. Even though we applied a diagnostic search filter to the search strategies of the electronic databases, our searches identified over 11,000 records. Furthermore, t hese searches were supplemented by hand searching for grey literature (i.e., unpublished or difficult to find studies). There is also a possibility of study selection bias. However, w e employed at least two independent reviewers to identify potentially relevant studies, and feel confident that the studies that we re excluded from this report were done so for consistent and appropriate reasons. Conclusion Most of the evidence from the 28 studies included in this review was not applicable to the population of interest as studies examined children with known disease r ather than with undiagnosed MSK pain. No studies addressed children with joint swelling. No study provided a complete investigation on accuracy modifiers . No studies examined clinically important outcomes such as the impact of the test results on referrals , ordering of additional tests, patient management, and patient and parent anxiety levels . Because the Sn and Sp of these tests have yet to be verified, current evidence does not support their use as diagnostic tests for children with undiagnosed MSK pain . They have a potential application as an adjunct to a clinical assessment that suggests the presence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease . Future Research The following general recommendations for future research are based on the prec eding discussion of the evidence. 31 In order to better understand the natural history of MSK pain in children and the probability of a diagnosis of JIA or pSLE in this population, prospective cohort studies of children and adolescents with MSK pain are need ed. Given the low prevalence of JIA and pSLE, a sufficiently large number of participants is required. For the research to be generalizable, researchers need to use consistent test methodology and cutoffs as well as consistent and well -accepted clinical cr iteria for the diagnoses of JIA and pSLE . Potential accuracy modifiers of test performance need to be examined, including age, sex, race, history of recent infections, presence of clinical characteristics other than MSK pain (e.g., morning stiffness, joint swelling, uveitis, malar rash, cytopenias) . The clinical impact of these tests (e.g., referral decisions, additional tests ordered, clinical management, quality of life, psychological distress of child and/or parents) should be assessed in cohort studies. Efforts are needed to improve the overall quality of reporting of primary studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The STARD checklist includes 25 items that address the level of detail that should be specified within such studies including descriptions of pa rticipants, test methods, statistical methods, and results.56 This could be considered as a guide for authors reporting studies that evaluate diagnostic tests. 32 Table 8.Summary of evidence of the diagnostic characteristics of ANA , RF, and CCP tests for pSLE and JIA in children with undiagnosed MSK pain Key Questions N Studies, Sample Size Sensitivity Range (median)* Specificity Range (median) PPV Range (median) NPV Range (median) Strength of Evidence KQ 3: Test performance 3.1 ANA - pSLE 2 case -control , 201 91-100% 84-85% 71-84% 1-62% (54 case , 46 29% 88% 50% 74% Insufficient 3.4 RF (IgM) - JIA 1 cohort study, 437 15 case -control , Low Insufficient 3.5 CCP - pSLE No studies Insufficient 3.6 CCP - JIA 7 case -control , 1,643 2-42% Insufficient KQ 4: Accuracy modifiers No studies NA NA NA NA Insufficient KQ 5: Clinical impacts No studies NA NA NA NA Insufficient *Median not presented if 4 studies.

Spctrum composition This item examines the degree of similarity between the study's recruited sample and our population of interest (children with MSK symptoms) for the ANA review. Yes The spectrum of patients included in the study was representative of those in whom the test will be used in practice. For cohort design, the recruited population should reflect a general children population (<18 years) with undiagnosed MSK pain.* No If the characteristics of participants were too specific. For example, in cohort design, the undiagnosed MSK pain children all have \"stunted\" growth. In the case arm for case - control design, all the JIA patients have uveitis. For case -control design, one study arm being the known disease (SJE/JIA) and the other arm being the healthy children with or without MSK pain. Unclear Not reported or in sufficient evidence by the study. * Cohort and case -control study designs are illustrated in the following file: ' Ab testing_study designs.jpg ' located in directory ' Z:\\common \\Arthritis Testing for children (AHRQ) \\05_Data Extraction \\_Forms '. Note that if the participants' characteristics are drastically different from our desired population, it should be excluded altogether. If it is the case, describe in the comment section. 2. Selection criteria This item refers to whether the study provides clear inclusion/exclusion criteria for participant selection. Yes Detailed information on the source and inclusion/exclusion criteria was reported No Information on the source and inclusion/exclusion criteria was poorly or not reported. Unclear Information was partly reported but not sufficient to score a \"Yes\". 3. Reference standard This item refers to whether the reference standard used can truly classify the disease status in participants. Yes The study used widely accepted clinical standard, including but not limited to the ACR, ILAR, and Vancouver standards, for SLE or JIA. No The reported standard was unlikely to correctly classify the disease status. Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 4. Test result definition This item examines whether or not the serological cutoff of positive index test is clearly stated. Yes Serological cutoff was clearly stated (ie: titer, IU/mL, etc) . C-3 No Serological cutoff was not stated . Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 5. Disease progression bias Over a long period of time, disease status might change due to spontaneous recovery or disease progression. This item specifies a reasonable time frame in which the underlying disease status is expected not to change drastically. Yes The time between the index test and reference standard was 6 months or less. No The time between the index test and reference standard was longer than 6 months. Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 6. Partial verification bias This item refers to whether the selection of participants to receive confirmation using the reference standard might be biased. Yes All participants , or a random selection of participants , who received the index test went on to receive verification by a reference standard. For cohort design, generally all participants will go through the same reference standard, whereas in case -control design, each study arm could be examined b ased on different reference standards (for example, the known JIA might use ILAR by rheumatologist, whereas, the healthy controls are based on general physician assessment). No 20% of the participants received the index test did not receive verificati on by the reference standard. Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 7. Differential verification bias This item examines whether or not all participants are receiving the same reference standard to verify the disease status. Yes Same reference standard was used in all participants . Case -control design by default are likely to fall into this category since the patients were generally classified using the same reference standard. No Different reference standards were used in 20% of participants. Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 8. Incorporation bias This item examines whether the index test forms part of the reference standard. If it is the case, overestimated agreement is likely to result. If no explicit statement indicating ANA is not part of the ACR standard, a \"no\" should be scored. On the contrary, if RF/CCP is compared against the JIA's ILAR standard, assume a score of \"yes\" unless an explicit statement indicates that RF/CCP was, indeed , part of the reference standard. C-4 Yes Using RF/CCP for SLE/JIA, assumes a \"yes\" unless an explicit statement indicated otherwise. Using ANA for SLE, assume a \"no\" unless an explicit statement indicated otherwise. No Using RF/CCP for SLE/JIA, assumes a \"yes\" unless an explicit statement indicated otherwise. Using ANA for SLE, assume a \"no\" unless an explicit statement indicated otherwise. Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 9. Index test execution Sufficient detail on carrying out the index test is important in tracking down the reasons for abnormal diagnostic results and in replicating the test in a different setting. Yes The index test was sufficiently described including information on both the assay method and substrate used. No Either or both the assay method and substrate used was not described . Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 10. Test review bias This item examines whether the index test results are analyzed without the knowledge of the reference standard. Yes Index test results were interpreted without the knowledge of reference standard. If the index test was done and analyzed prior the execution of reference standard, it will automatically score a \"yes\". No Index test results were certainly or likely to be interpreted with the knowledge of reference standard . Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 11. Reference standard review bias This item examines whether the reference standard results are analyzed without the knowledge of the index test. Yes Reference standard results were interpreted without the knowledge of index test. No Reference standard results were interpreted with knowledge of index test . ANA for SLE will automatically score a \"no\" unless an explicit statement indicated otherwise. Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study. 12. Uninterpretable results This item examines the reporting of the uninterpretable results from either index test or reference standard. Yes The study has no uninterpretable/indeterminate/intermediate results (ie: suspected, instead of definite, diagnosis of SLE/JIA). Or, if existed, these results were adequately C-5 reported. No It was clear that the uninterpretable/indeterminate/intermediate results occur but was not reported . Unclear No insufficient evidence by the study. 13. Withdrawals This item examines the reporting of withdrawals. Yes It was clear what happened to all patients who entered the study, for example if a flow diagram of study participants was reported explaining any withdrawals or exclusions, or the numbers recruited match those in the analysis. The drop out was not greater than 12% from the original sample size, and was appropriately accounted for. No It appears that >12% patients recruited did not complete the study Unclear Not reported or insufficient evidence by the study.
