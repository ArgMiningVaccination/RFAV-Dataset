According to [this writeup], the whole process, including a few weeks for a clinical trial, could be done in about 100 days. TL;DR: Billions have been vaccinated, but some special snowflakes think it proves nothing. \"Minuscule amount of complications\" If you're young, healthy, and have already had covid, why take the risk of having any vaccine complications? Genuinely asking, not trying to troll. If you have any data that suggests that someone in their mid 20s, healthy, and has natural immunity is obviously better off taking the vaccine please share it with me. I'd hate to be one of the very few in that demographic that got myocarditis from the shot while trying to avoid being one of the very few in that demographic who dies from covid. Not to mention the fact that fully vaccinated people still get covid! I am fully vaccinated for polio, measles, and everything else that kids normally get vaccinated for and I would do the same for my children, but the covid vaccine doesn't seem like a statistically sound option for me or a healthy child, especially considering the rate at which fully vaccinated people are still catching it (unlike those diseases I am vaccinated for). I imagine cmonman and millions of others are in the same boat, why does this make us anti-vax? Un-vaccination is a dick move.

I imagine cmonman and millions of others are in the same boat, why does this make us anti-vax? Vaccinated people are getting COVID because there are too many people like you who haven't gotten the vaccine spreading it around. No vaccine is 100% effective, but as long as enough people are vaccinated then the R0 is low enough it doesn't spread. If 30% of the population started refusing measles vaccinations then rest assured there would be plenty of breakthrough infections from that. So stop being selfish and take a few minutes out of your day to protect not only yourself but your family and neighbors. Rhode Island has one of the highest vaccination rates in the US (ages 12 and up, 84% fully vaccinated). It currently has the highest rate of COVID cases per capita (103 cases per 100k population). Got my third moderna a few weeks ago. Mask and socially distance. I've done about all I can at this point. I live in the rural Midwest so it is constantly swirling around my area with people not caring at all. I read an article on the Atlantic that almost made me scream at my desk. Serves me right for doomscrolling, but still. [These people just don't care, and nothing we say or do is going to make them.]And we're all going to pay the price for it. I don't \"live in fear\" of getting run over by a bus, but I still look before I cross the street.Got my third moderna a few weeks ago. Mask and socially distance.

[These people just don't care, and nothing we say or do is going to make them.]And we're all going to pay the price for it. You wanted to literally scream at your desk at that article? Sorry, but you need to calm the frack down. C19 is fully endemic at this point, so I'm not sure what you're upset over. Public health failed us, and the hospitals failed us. This virus has broken every quarantine that it has faced. It has defeated every vaccine. It's here to stay. Can you show me some science that we can beat it? Nope, you can't. You can keep living in fear, or you can accept that it's part of the one of many things that can kill you every day and learn to live with that. We lost, so accept that we lost, and stop blaming your 80 year old grandpa for not getting a vaccine that's barely more effective than praying to whichever God you give money to every week. If I had a dollar for every time someone used the notion of risk as a binary-valued function--you are definitionally either \"at risk\" or \"not I would now be a wealthy man.OK downvoters, explain to me why he's at risk from Omicron if he's got two shots. You obviously think you know something I don't. I actually think the public health communications about the latest mutation has been just as consistently poor as all of the public health communication during the pandemic, and I'm disappointed but unsurprised by that, and furthermore if I'd only had two shots (and no serious underlying health conditions) then I wouldn't be jolting up in bed with night terrors at Greek letters I'd never heard, but I'm at least able to articulate that within a framework that recognizes that we are all at varying degrees of risk. Not zero. Not one. Real-valued. Okay, I'm a big fan of risk benefits analysis. Do you have any actual data that shows that people with only two shots are at a significantly higher risk of being hospitalized from omicron, than people that got a booster? Okay . . . in a risk analysis, what's the relative risk of getting a second booster/third shot? Is it going to increase your risk of something negative in a statistically significant fashion? I also read the article in the Atlantic. It became clear as I was reading that the \"nobody cares\" was a smokescreen for \"I don't think it's a big deal anymore, and you shouldn't, either. \" I expected something better-reasoned from the Atlantic. Have they fallen far? As a kid it was highly respected as a source of quality journalism. \"Today was great!\" my 7-year-old exclaimed recently when I came home from work. By cosmic standards, her day wasn't that special. She went to the playground, where she finally mastered the monkey bars. She visited the history museum\u2014or at least its gift shop. She got \"really big\" nachos. She went to the kids' art studio. Two years ago, visiting a museum and a nacho joint was so common, it wouldn't even have registered. What did you do today? Oh, nothing. But our standards are no longer cosmic. \"Today was great,\" she said, and my wife's eyes welled up at her enthusiasm. So much had been missed already\u2014a quarter of our daughter's life lived in shadow. She learned to read and ride a bike. She ceased to be a little kid and became just a kid\u2014in appearance, ability, and aspiration. And as of the end of November, she's \"fully\" vaccinated. It happened just in time for another version of the virus, the one with more mutations: Omicron. ... The holidays only deepen the lows. This is a time of joy and warmth and cold and excess. Even if few will (or should) change their holiday plans this month, we have all been forced to ponder the matter. Two weeks' worth of news took us from It's finally safe to have Grandma in the house with the kids to Is it even safe for Grandma to leave her house? No matter what you do, it comes topped with a thick head of new emotional terror. People hoped that visits would be free of stress this year, compared with last. But underneath that hope was another, equally important one: that this relief would feel more permanent. That we would feel as if we had made some progress. ... \"Now is the time to overreact,\" I wrote in The Atlantic in March 2020, a few days after the global pandemic received its formal declaration. I hoped that a feeling of dread might spur excessive action\u2014lockdowns or rent cancellation or border closings\u2014whatever might have brought the virus to heel. But we have overreacted less and less with each cycle of outbreak, and watched new setbacks follow every victory. That gloomy slog has begotten new generations of dread. In November, my wife asked me whether I had seen an article with the remarkable headline \"Is It Safe to Go to Thanksgiving Dinner?\" \"Is that from last year?\" I asked. \"No, it's a few days old,\" she said, her voice sinking to a growling murmur. \"These people.\" I am old enough to remember the good old days when holiday-advice pieces were all variations on \"How to Talk to Your Tea Party Uncle About Obamacare.\" As Christmas approaches, we can look forward to more of this sort of thing, with the meta-ethical speculation advanced to an impossibly baroque stage of development. Is it okay for our 2-year-old son to hug Grandma at a Christmas party if she received her booster only a few days ago? Should the toddler wear a mask except when he is slopping mashed potatoes all over his booster seat? Our oldest finally attended her first (masked) sleepover with other fully vaccinated 10-year-olds, but one of them had a sibling test positive at day care. Should she stay home or wear a face shield? What about Omicron? I don't know how to put this in a way that will not make me sound flippant: No one cares. Literally speaking, I know that isn't true, because if it were, the articles wouldn't be commissioned. But outside the world inhabited by the professional and managerial classes in a handful of major metropolitan areas, many, if not most, Americans are leading their lives as if COVID is over, and they have been for a long while. Indeed, in my case, when I say for a long while, I mean for nearly two years, from almost the very beginning. In 2020, I took part in two weddings, traveled extensively, took family vacations with my children, spent hundreds of hours in bars and restaurants, all without wearing a mask. This year my wife and I welcomed our fourth child. Over the course of her pregnancy, from the first phone call to the midwife a few months after getting a positive pregnancy test until after delivery, the subject of the virus was never raised by any health-care professional, including her doula, a dear friend from New York. Meanwhile, our children, who have continued to attend their weekly homeschooling co-op since April 2020, have never donned masks, and they are distinctly uncomfortable on the rare occasions when they see them, for reasons that, until recently, child psychologists and other medical experts would have freely acknowledged. They have continued seeing friends and family, including their great-grandparents, on a weekly basis. Got my third moderna a few weeks ago. Mask and socially distance.

[These people just don't care, and nothing we say or do is going to make them.]And we're all going to pay the price for it. Saw that one. I found it to be a particularly abhorrent as I have better expectations of the atlantic and also it masqueraded as a story about how other people don't care when it was actually about how the author doesn't care and thinks you shouldn't either. At this point, I sincerely doubt that even a shining Jesus descending from the Heavens, surrounded by little yellow-haired obese cherubs donning N95 masks, chorusing \"Get a vaccine now or you shall burn in Hell forever!\" would change their mind...To borrow a lyric from Cracker, I kind of believe that \"What The World Needs Now\" is some \"Big Ticket People\" making public service announcements. And even better if they are adversaries. Like for example, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson. Or maybe Bill Gates, his ex-wife, and his girlfriend. Because conservatives just might listen to a gathering of pro-mask, pro-vaccination capitalist billionaires who don't usually get along. And I don't mean making the typical \"You should get vaccinated to be a good citizen\" moral argument either. I mean making the \"Ordinary people needing medical treatment are dying because COVID patients are overloading our hospitals\" pragmatic argument. Maybe that could work. Anyway, I rarely share an opinion on the Internet these days because there's already enough noise out here as is. But if anybody on Ars Technica can think up a way to get adversaries like these people together... who knows, maybe it might make a difference. if wsox chooses to sober up from his meth bender, he won't be \"seeing\" what he claimed to anymore.User name checks out.Troll lies deleted Yup, obesity #1 contributor to death with Covid and America is fat as shit. Logistic regression showed that patients with a BMI 29 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.64, 95% CI 1.38-9.60) and those with a BMI > 39 kg/m2 (OR 10.04, 95% CI 2.45-41.09) had a higher risk of mortality than those with a BMI from 29 to 39 kg/m2. The number of comorbidities (2), SAPS II score, and P/F < 100 mmHg were also independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. Johnson & Johnson boosted with Moderna? Any data? Data is still not conclusive but it looks like those under 20 in South Africa are being hit harder than previous waves.Got my third moderna a few weeks ago. Mask and socially distance.

I found it to be a particularly abhorrent as I have better expectations of the atlantic and also it masqueraded as a story about how other people don't care when it was actually about how the author doesn't care and thinks you shouldn't either. I particularly took umbrage with the assertion that wearing a mask is a political statement. Yes, you can probably discern political affiliation from wearing a mask, but it's worn as a health measure not a god damn political statement. In other news: I'm still unclear on if omicron is worse for kids or if there's some overrepresentation due to increased concern, but who's to say the next one won't hit kids harder? Those of us with kids under 5 are begging for data to be submitted for review. If you're young, healthy, and have already had covid, why take the risk of having any vaccine complications? I have two co-workers that are young an healthy that both got covid, one now has it a second time. They both have been off their feet far longer than my other co-works would had a single down day because of their booster shot working well. It is far far better to get vaccinated than rolling the dice with covid or being part of the problem by having a higher chance of spreading it... full stop. Additionally the best protection you can have against covid is getting fully vaccinated and boosted, data shows that is better and longer last than having had covid before and if you have had covid getting fully vaccinated is even better. Note the risk of the vaccine is very close to zero... the risk of complications from a prior or repeat infection of covid is much higher. I am fully vaccinated for polio, measles, and everything else that kids normally get vaccinated for and I would do the same for my children, but the covid vaccine doesn't seem like a statistically sound option for me or a healthy child, especially considering the rate at which fully vaccinated people are still catching it (unlike those diseases I am vaccinated for).

Here isThis may already have been asked, but what is the timeline of those percentages? How many weeks after the second dose does the effeciency against omicron start to drop off? Swedish guidelines currently say one should get the booster six months after the second dose (I have an appointment march 1), but since our neighbours are saying three months I assume that will change, depending on how bad the coming weeks will get.. The most distressing thing about that article was the overwhelming attitude of \"since I haven't personally experienced an issue, it must not be serious\". It's a very juvenile attitude. The world is bigger than you. Unfortunately, this attitude is far too common ... both of my siblings had that attitude and didn't grow out of it until the consequences of this attitude were right in front of them, and sometimes not even then (thankfully, it was financial issues and not medical issues).
