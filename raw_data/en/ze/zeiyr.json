He could neither control them nor predict exactly when they'd go into effect. All he knew was that he'd woken up one morning and found that his voice had turned against him, imposing a set of bizarre restrictions. Take the rule about crowds. If Adams was at a party with friends, he'd open his mouth to talk, only to find the words tumbling out in a raspy, imperceptible staccato, chopping off sentences before they had a chance to form. If he tried to say, \"Tomorrow is my birthday,\" for example, it would morph into a weak \"Ma robf sss ma birfday.\" But if he was on the lecture circuit, delivering a prepared speech to a crowd of thousands, he could stand behind the podium and\u2014\"Hello!\"\u2014his voice would whir back to life, if only for the hour he was onstage. There was also the rule about being alone. Adams might be sitting at the desk in his Bay Area office, working on a new Dilbert strip, when suddenly he'd be able to form words. He'd call out to others in the house\u2014\"I can talk!\"\u2014but the moment somebody stepped into the room, his voice evaporated. Then there was the rule about the rules themselves. For some reason, if Adams were to explain his condition to you, his speech would suddenly become clear and strong. Change the topic, however, and his voice would jumble again. But if you were to place a video camera in front of him and have him talk into it\u2014well, in that case, he could be relatively lucid about anything. That one still baffles him. The rules took effect in April 2005, while the 48-year-old Adams was on vacation in San Diego with then-girlfriend (now wife) Shelly Miles and her two kids. One day, he woke up with what felt like severe laryngitis. He'd suffered from allergies for years, and he had similar throat issues almost every spring. \"Not a big deal,\" he thought, shrugging it off. He returned home to [Dublin](http://www.ci.dublin.ca.us/), California, a well-behaved suburb 35 miles east of San Francisco. Days passed, then weeks, but Adams still couldn't summon his voice. His doctors examined him for bronchitis and polyps\u2014and any other condition they could think of\u2014but they were unable to find the cause. A psychologist checked him for signs of a breakdown, because what else could it be? She offered him a regimen of antianxiety medications; Adams declined. Meanwhile, his speech was getting worse. What began as a hoarse whisper devolved into a string of garbled, phonetic shards that sounded like he was talking through a dying cell phone. During the day, it wasn't much of a problem\u2014Adams was used to spending long hours alone, drawing in his home office. When he stepped outside, though, he had to live by the rules. Whatever jokes or quips popped into his head were stuck there. And without knowing where his voice had gone\u2014and with no way of knowing how to get it back\u2014Adams felt as though he were floating around the edges of the room, watching conversations pass right by him. \"I'm a ghost,\" he'd think. Adams wasn't going to live like this. He was a cartoonist, but he was also an engineer, and both fields have a tendency to attract stubborn people who are immune to rejection and who disregard obstacles. To Adams, his voice was just a problem in need of fixing. Years ago, when his career was first getting started, he came to rely on daily affirmations. He decided that in order to manifest his goals, he simply needed to keep repeating them. In 1983, while readying himself for business school, his credo was \"I, Scott Adams, will score in the 94th percentile on my GMATs.\" He scored in the 94th percentile. Five years later, just before selling Dilbert, it was \"I, Scott, will become a syndicated cartoonist.\" Now he constructed a new affirmation, one that played in his head all day, every day: \"I, Scott, will speak perfectly.\" Back in 2004, Adams asked his fans to submit ideas for a project called [Dilbert's Ultimate House](http://www.designboom.com/eng/interview/adams.html) (or DUH). The goal was to design a home that combined eco-minded practicality with anything-goes whimsy\u2014a tree house with a multimillion-dollar budget. Now, on a late afternoon in January, Adams and I drive to a construction site to survey the results. The future home of the Adams family sits on the corner of a hilly suburban enclave, and though not every crowdsourced idea made it into the final blueprints, many are included: a Christmas-tree closet, a cat bathroom, and a tower in the back shaped like Dilbert's head with a pair of windows resembling the character's round eyewear. Adams looks exactly the way you'd expect a middle-aged cartoonist to look: laid-back but dignified, dressed in jeans, a black Quiksilver button-down, sneakers, and glasses, all topped by a tidy arrangement of gray hair. He waves to the construction workers, who are unaware that the man wandering around the site is the person who hired them. Adams enjoys an anonymous sort of celebrity: He's sold millions of books, yet he's rarely recognized in public. Even when he is spotted, people usually don't get too worked up over a mild-mannered guy who makes jokes about fax machines. Adams wanted to be a cartoonist since he was 6 years old, reading old Peanuts collections at his uncle's farm in upstate New York. His father was a postal worker who painted houses on the side; his mother worked in real estate and later labored in a factory to put the kids through college. Even as a child, Adams found himself negotiating between earthbound practicality and starry-eyed fantasy. Figuring that a cartooning career was a long shot, Adams the realist shunned art school in favor of an economics degree at [Hartwick College](http://www.hartwick.edu/x10295.xml) in Oneonta, New York. But Adams the dreamer never stopped drawing, even while crunching numbers. And though devout pragmatism made him eschew religion, astrology, and anything else that wasn't grounded in fact (\"He's got a little bit of Mr. Spock in him,\" as one colleague puts it), he held firm to his wish-fulfillment affirmations, even turning to them to improve his love life. The competing impulses never went away. After graduating in 1979, Adams went on to pursue an MBA, which ultimately helped him land a job at Pacific Bell. Once there, he found himself immersed in the futility of bureaucracy\u2014the aimless meetings and senseless doublespeak. He often doodled his observations, turning his cubicle (#4S700R) into an art studio. Over time, two recurring characters emerged: a put-upon, sweet-natured doofus with an upturned tie (Dilbert) and a malevolent, bespectacled pooch (Dogbert). Adams worked up enough strips to send to the syndicates, and United Media, the company that represents such titles as Peanuts and Marmaduke, [picked him up](http://news.cnet.com/Why-Dilbert-ilovesi-the-Internet/2008-1082_3-923069.html) in 1988. Dilbert came out during the last true blockbuster era of the American comic strip\u2014a time when Calvin and Hobbes resided just a few smudgy inches from Peanuts and* The Far Side*. \"I can never be as good as those guys,\" Adams thought while scanning the upper tiers of the funny pages. \"But these others? I can play in that field.\" Initially the strip was picked up by around 150 newspapers\u2014a respectable figure, though Adams still had to keep his position at Pac Bell. He worked in the finance department, but during a hiring freeze in the early '90s, he was reassigned. \"From now on,\" Adams' boss told him, \"you're an engineer.\" Next thing he knew, he was a project manager in the ISDN lab. It wasn't what he had signed up for, but engineering meshed well with his fastidiousness and love of logic. Around 1994, after several years of spending all his free time cartooning, Adams began to develop a problem with his right hand. Every time he tried to draw, his pinky went into spasms. A doctor diagnosed him with [focal dystonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_dystonia), a rare neurological disorder triggered by overuse. Adams' brain was forcing his finger to flap around. \"Well,\" Adams asked, \"what's the fix?\" \"The fix,\" the doctor said, \"is that you change jobs.\" Adams had to believe the doctor was wrong. His career was just taking off\u2014there must be a fix, he thought. Being [Scott Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams), he decided to see if he could solve the problem himself. Whenever he was stuck in a meeting, he'd grip his pen and hold it down on a piece of paper, waiting for the spasm to kick in. Just before it did, he'd pull the pen away, then start again. Each time, his finger grew a little bit steadier, as if he were slowly retraining his brain not to notice he was drawing. The twinges began to quiet, and after a year they stopped. Soon, the '90s economic boom meant that millions of Americans were herded into teeming, nondescript industrial parks. Dilbert chronicled the rising intraoffice class struggle, in which lower-rung employees toiled under the thumb of nincompoop managers. Readers may have seen Charlie Brown as their pal, but they saw Dilbert as an ally. Circulation skyrocketed: By 1995, the strip was inching toward the 1,000-paper mark, finally allowing Adams to quit his day job. Speaking tours followed, as did a few best-selling office-advice tomes. Dilbert was no longer just a comic strip; it was a white-collar protest statement. Having a Garfield doll on your desk didn't imply much in the way of subtext (though it did hint at a possible aversion to Mondays). But tacking a few Dilbert strips to the outside of your cube was a way of acknowledging your own powerlessness, albeit in a self-empowering way: This job may suck, but at least I know it sucks. At the height of Dilbert's popularity, Adams was constantly worried, wondering whether he had enough material for his next installment. In later years, he began easing off a bit, barely thinking about the strip while off the clock. He no longer wanted to sit by himself for long stretches, staring at a drawing board, working in complete silence. And then, silence was suddenly forced upon him. Adams was never one to talk just to hear his own voice. At parties, he tended to listen and observe, interjecting only when he felt he had something to say. When he finally did chime in, there was always ballast to both his voice and his sentiment: He'd analyze a situation aloud, examining each angle in measured tones, then sneak in a wry aside. But after he met Miles in 2004 (she worked at the tennis desk of the health club he frequented), friends noticed that Adams was becoming more outgoing, more amenable to small talk; just being around her seemed to amplify his personality. So it was appropriate that when he first started losing his speech, it was Miles who served as his connection to the world. She was the only person who could untangle his noises and thread them into actual sentences. \"I'd heard him cut off the words so many times, I knew what he was saying,\" she explains. \"You just learn.\" There were few places Adams could go where people knew what had happened and he wouldn't have to endure what he thinks of as \"the retard look\"\u2014that glance of faux concern he would inevitably have to confront when he went out in public and one of the mercurial rules kicked in. To ease the burden, Miles generally accompanied him whenever he left the house. Nights out were especially hard. \"If it was dinner with a group,\" Miles says, \"we didn't go unless those people knew what was going on with him, so he didn't feel like he had to explain himself.\" Adams found that once-simple public interactions were now reduced to awkward pantomime. Restaurants became especially trying, as background noise agitated his voice even further. In the late '90s, Adams used some of his Dilbert money to invest in [the restaurant business](http://www.eatatstaceys.com/), and he sometimes went to an American bistro he owned near his home. There he could take comfort in a routine, as the waitstaff always knew what he wanted, right down to his drink order (Diet Coke Monday through Thursday, Grey Goose with a twist on Friday); he didn't have to point and nod at the menu like a frazzled tourist. From across the table, his friends became accustomed to the ups and downs of his voice: If Adams was speaking in a low whisper, they leaned in; if he could barely produce any sound at all, they'd do their best to read his lips. With his speech filtered and delayed, Adams was denied the pleasures of conversation\u2014the ability to parry and spar, even if it was just in his own laconic way. \"There's only so much you can do by whispering or using sign language or writing things down,\" says [Shri Nandan](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/shri-nandan/5/4b8/b17), a longtime friend. \"He's a very witty guy. And when you take that voice away, it deflates his spirit.\" One day, six months into his voice's disappearing act, Adams woke up with a thought: What if there was a connection between his voice and the focal dystonia in his pinky finger? He typed the words \"voice\" and \"dystonia\" into Google and [found a video clip](http://www.dysphonia.org/spasmodic/) of somebody struggling with a weak, clipped voice. \"Oh my God,\" Adams thought. \"That's me.\" After a few more searches, Adams arrived at his own diagnosis: [spasmodic dysphonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasmodic_dysphonia). It was another neurological disorder, one that causes the throat muscles to clamp down erratically on the vocal cords, strangling speech. In all of Adams' meetings with physicians, no one had even mentioned SD; the disorder is so rare that few doctors have heard of it. Adams tracked down a throat specialist, who confirmed Adams' findings and told him that SD had no known cure. He'd never regain his normal speaking voice. Adams ignored this prognosis. He had heard the same thing about his finger. Again, he thought there had to be a fix. \"I'm gonna cure it,\" he thought. \"And when I do, I'm gonna cure it for everybody. I'm gonna wipe it off the face of the earth.\" According to the National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association, there are [an estimated 50,000](http://www.dysphonia.org/faq.asp?nav=sup#q5) SD sufferers in North America. Their ranks include [Robert F. Kennedy](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25bobby.html) Jr., NPR host [Diane Rehm](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/rehm0823.htm), and Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels of Run-DMC, who developed the condition a decade ago and [whose acceptance speech](http://www.me-dmc.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/5737/pid/4814) at this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony was noticeably strained. Not all SD sufferers sound the same: Voices can get whispery or fluttery or halted. The only constant trait appears to be its unpredictability, which means SD victims often find themselves in a social quandary: having to explain to people that they're not crazy or anxious and that they can't just calm down and speak up. It's a disorder that constantly puts you on the defensive yet robs you of your best defense. \"When you have spasmodic dysphonia, you're in voice jail,\" says [Robert Bastian](http://www.bastianvoice.com/bastian.htm), a otolaryngologist who's been working with SD patients for more than 20 years. The problem is widely believed to begin in the [basal ganglia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia), the part of the brain that controls motor function. For reasons still unknown, the conversation between the brain and the vocal folds becomes garbled, causing the folds to either involuntarily clamp down (adductor spasmodic dysphonia, which Adams has) or open up (abductor spasmodic dysphonia, which is even more rare). It's now thought that some people are genetically disposed to the disorder, though nobody knows how or why it's initially triggered. For decades, doctors considered SD a psychological problem and referred patients to psychiatrists. It's not hard to understand why: Like Adams, most SD sufferers have their own inexplicable set of rules, or sensory tricks. Some people can get out their words by singing, others by talking in a British accent or even screaming. Bastian once had a patient who was able to speak only when he had a sore throat. In these instances, the dysphonia is somehow distracted, though once again, no one is sure why. All that doctors know is that sensory tricks vary from person to person and there's no guarantee they'll work from one day to the next, no matter how hard the patient tries to make their rules permanent. The most common treatment for SD is Botox shots. The neurotoxins are jabbed straight through the front of the neck and into the voice box, causing selected muscles to relax and stop spasming. For many SD sufferers, the procedure permits the voice to stage a temporary, imperfect comeback. Most patients schedule three to four Botox injections a year. For Adams, the results of Botox were unpredictable. Doctors could never gauge the right amount for him, and as soon as the toxin kicked in, his voice would begin tapering off again. Plus, he came to dread the shots, which he found painful and just plain ghoulish. He went through the procedure for [his wedding to Miles](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1218618,00.html) in July 2006 so he could say his vows. After that, he quit the injections altogether and focused on finding a more permanent solution. To most people, a guy attempting to thwart SD on his own would come off as irrational, maybe even pathetic. But for Adams, the past two decades had been defined by a series of unlikely occurrences: He had never intended to become an engineer, and he certainly never expected to become a famous cartoonist, yet he had accomplished both. Rescuing his voice wasn't so different, he reasoned. As far-fetched as it may have seemed, to Adams it made perfect sense. Adams began by scrutinizing his own behavior, searching for patterns. If his voice was having a good day\u2014and he'd occasionally have good days\u2014he'd take note of his surroundings. Where was he standing? Were people nearby? If so, how many? What did he eat today? He'd try to duplicate the circumstances exactly. \"If I just do this one thing a little bit differently,\" he'd think, \"then I'll be able to talk perfectly forever.\" At one point, he discovered he was able to speak by \"singing\" his sentences, trying to fool his voice by linking his words together in a continuous lilt. But what Adams saw as patterns usually turned out to be coincidences. He would retest his theories and find the rules had changed yet again. He never knew how his voice would sound from one day to the next or whether the cheat that had worked in the morning would still apply at night. Meanwhile, his day-to-day life went on: He knocked out more strips, dropped in on his restaurants, and tweaked the plans for his new home. In October 2006, a year and a half after his voice troubles first surfaced, Adams was helping his stepson with a homework assignment about nursery rhymes. When Adams read \"Jack Be Nimble\" aloud\u2014Jack be nimble / Jack be quick / Jack jump over the candlestick\u2014the words didn't squelch or drop; they flowed. He repeated the lines again, sustaining his voice with each recital. And it wasn't just \"Jack Be Nimble\"\u2014he could say anything. The nursery rhyme had somehow unlocked his voice, and whenever it started to wane again, all he had to do was repeat those lines and his normal speech would return. A few days later, he [wrote on his blog](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/5763) that his speech had almost completely returned, claiming he'd successfully \"remapped\" his brain: That's the best description I have. During the worst of my voice problems, I would know in advance that I couldn't get a word out. It was as if I could feel the lack of connection between my brain and my vocal cords. But suddenly, yesterday, I felt the connection again. It wasn't just being able to speak, it was knowing how. The knowing returned. I still don't know if this is permanent. But I do know that for one day I got to speak normally. And this is one of the happiest days of my life. The story got lots of pickup on other blogs: Genius cartoonist hacks into his own brain! was the general take. But just a few days after posting the announcement, Adams came down with a cold. When it cleared, he found that much of his progress had been erased. His voice was once again faint and mangled. The rhyming no longer helped. Adams was getting desperate. He couldn't go back to the Botox shots. When he got a call from a doctor in LA\u2014a guy who'd read Adams' blog and claimed he could cure him without drugs or needles, all for $5,000 a week\u2014Adams the realist thought it was too good to be true. But Adams the dreamer booked a ticket. He did some research before leaving. [Morton Cooper](http://www.voice-doctor.com/about.htm) was a speech pathologist and amateur cartoonist who claimed to have [worked with everyone](http://www.voice-doctor.com/spkgfexp.htm) from OJ Simpson to Henry Fonda. Within the SD community, Cooper is spoken of as either a liberator or a loon: He rejects the generally held belief that SD is a neurological disorder, instead claiming it's caused by poor voice use. According to Cooper, when patients speak from the lower part of their throat, they [strain the voice](http://www.voice-doctor.com/sddvr.htm), making it difficult to talk properly. Adams spent a week in LA performing a series of vocal exercises. Cooper taught him not only to listen for the right pitch but also to feel for it, using the vibrations in his face. He would sit in a room for hours, humming to himself, trying to relocate his pitch. Strangely enough, this worked: After five days, Adams' voice sounded better than when he'd landed in LA. Maybe Cooper really had found a cure. Or maybe he'd merely helped Adams discover yet another transitory trick. But there was a problem with Cooper's method: It required hours of practice just to maintain results. When Adams was trying to quell the spasms in his finger, he could fiddle with the pen all day without really thinking about it. But with a family and job, he couldn't commit to sitting still and humming for the majority of the day. He promised to keep up with what he could\u2014a few breathing techniques that Cooper had shown him\u2014and flew back home. It had been almost two years since his voice abandoned him. He hates the word. He doesn't even want to see it in print. But Adams was depressed. __By spring 2008,__Adams the realist was starting to recognize that his voice might never return. But the dreamer part of his brain\u2014the cartoonist part\u2014hadn't given up: He still clung to his affirmations, repeating them in the car when he was alone, no matter how bad his words sounded. He busied himself with [his strip](http://www.dilbert.com/strips/) and [his blog](http://www.dilbert.com/blog/) and set a Google Alert for \"spasmodic dysphonia.\" It picked up mostly random blog posts from other SD sufferers. Then one day, a medical abstract popped up about a Japanese doctor who claimed to be able to cure SD with a surgical procedure on the voice box. Adams was dubious. He'd heard of such operations before, but everything he'd read scared him off: There were horror stories about people losing their voices forever. And he didn't want anyone cutting up his neck. Most of the SD experts he met steered him toward Botox. Still: three years. He was ready to try almost anything. Adams began asking around, carrying the abstract to several specialists. Eventually, he was referred to a Stanford doctor who said he wasn't sure whether the Japanese procedure was worth the risk, but he knew \"this guy who does a different type of operation.\" [Gerald Berke](http://www.surgery.ucla.edu/headandneck/Doctors_Berke.shtml), chief of UCLA Medical Center's Division of Head and Neck Surgery, had developed a procedure called selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation, or [SLAD-R](http://www.dystonia-foundation.org/pages/laryngeal_dystonia___selective_denervation_and_reinervation/138.php). Berke finds the nerve that's being told by the brain to spasm, and severs it. Then he grafts on a nerve from a different part of the neck. After three or four months of healing, the voice is restored\u2014it's very weak at first, but the SD is no longer noticeable. It's like rewiring the larynx. Adams began getting in touch with Berke's former patients. It turned out that most of the information he'd heard about SD operations was out of date, likely due to the rarity of the disease. Berke had been practicing his procedure since the '90s, steadily refining it over the years; he now claimed an 85 percent success rate in men. The patients that Adams contacted were very satisfied. Adams flew to UCLA and met with Berke in June. On July 15, 2008, he underwent surgery. Six months after the operation, Adams and I are sitting in his office. The room is tidy, with few distractions and absolutely no noise\u2014a blank panel. He starts most weekdays around 6 am, knocking out two strips and a blog post by noon. A few years ago, his focal dystonia began to flare up again and Adams took to drawing on a touchscreen with a stylus; the contact is so light, his hand doesn't cramp. But he still keeps the wooden drawing desk from his early Dilbert years nearby, tucked against a wall, unused but clearly sacrosanct. Dilbert is a multimillion-dollar enterprise, and even with his SD, Adams has never taken a sabbatical. He also has no plans to stop cartooning anytime soon. Much like Charles Schulz, who [died in 2000](http://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/021400obit-c-schulz.html), Adams wants to keep drawing until his body gives out. The titles he'd found so daunting when Dilbert began\u2014The Far Side, Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes\u2014are long gone, their creators having retired or moved on to other ventures. Adams never expected to be a comic-strip superstar; now he's one of the few left. He has brought me here to play a series of audio recordings he made after his operation. The first clip was recorded early in the morning on September 8, 2008, two months after surgery, and his voice still sounds shredded and weak: So this is how I sound ... I can talk a little bit. Obviously, you can tell I'm breathing pretty hard to talk. That's because it takes a little extra air to create any sound. At that point, trying to talk was so taxing on his lungs that he would have passed out if he had spoken much longer than a few seconds. He continues playing the clips, each slightly more coherent than the next. On October 6, he was able to sing a froggy rendition of \"Happy Birthday\"; on November 3, he recounted his surgical procedure. On the most recent recording, made just a few weeks earlier, he sounded as though he was merely suffering from a head cold. Hello, my name is Scott Adams, and about five and a half months ago, I had surgery to correct spasmodic dysphonia. This is the end of 2008, and this is how I sound ... I would say my voice is 98 percent effective in terms of being understood. It's not a perfect voice, but it wasn't a perfect voice before. Adams presses Stop. \"If you don't talk much at all for three and a half years,\" he says, \"you actually forget how to do it.\" His tone is steady, if a bit deliberate; in the months after his procedure, Adams had to figure out how to restore his cadence to a more natural rhythm and speed. But every day, his speech improved. He could hear it in his recordings and see it in the reactions of others. After a while, he emailed coworkers and friends and told them they could once again just pick up the phone and call him. It's now been almost a year since Adams went under the knife. He has started accepting interviews\u2014usually a few per week\u2014and plans to return to the lecture circuit sometime next year. Of course, the weird cruelty of spasmodic dysphonia means there's always a chance that his voice could disappear again. Adams the realist knows this, but Adams the dreamer plans to keep talking as much as he can, happily getting reacquainted with the sound of his own voice.
