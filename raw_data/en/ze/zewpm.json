Little is known about justifications for its use and the factors associated with it. This study gains insights into the use of herbal medicines in Northern Cyprus, concentrating on targets for its use, the role played by disease type, reasons for its use, and sources of information. Methods: A questionnaire was utilized to achieve the aim of the study. The questionnaire was distributed to a random sample comprised of people in two different regions in Northern Cyprus over a 12-week period from August to November 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Moreover, qualitative research explored individuals' decision making regarding CAM, which aimed to examine 20 patients as a context for beliefs, decision making, and dialogue about CAM. After audio-taping and verbatim transcription, the data were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results: The findings show that the majority of respondents learned about herbal products (HPs) and CAM from other patients, the Internet, friends, and family. The results indicate that almost half of the respondents were aware of how CAMs, especially herbal preparations, are used to treat common illnesses. Fennel, ginger, and echinacea were the most commonly used HMs, mainly for the treatment of the common cold. Furthermore, nearly 50% of the participants expressed the belief that HMs are safe, have fewer side effects than conventional medicines, and are also effective for treating minor health conditions. The prevalence was strongly associated with education level based on a Pearson Chi-square analysis. Conclusions: Although herbal medicines were mostly used to treat mild to moderate ailments and the participants were aware of their limitations, the combination of self-medication, inexperienced counseling, and lack of awareness of the risks of herbal medicines is potentially harmful. This is particularly important for elderly users, because although they seemed to be more aware of health-related issues, they generally used more medication than younger people. Given our finding that dissatisfaction with modern medicine is the most important reason for the preferred use of herbal medicines, government agencies, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies should be aware of this issue and should aim to create some level of awareness among users.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-29", "cleaned_text": "Complementary and Alternative Medicines in Northern Cyprus: Public Awareness, Patterns of Use, and Attitudes [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11070977](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11070977) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-11-00977), [2](#B2-healthcare-11-00977)]. CAM is referred to as \"traditional medicine\", according to Heinrich et al. [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-00977)]. Traditional medicine is an essential element of healthcare in many regions of the world, such as Thailand, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-00977)]. According to Larsen [ [4](#B4-healthcare-11-00977)], several factors distinguish CAM from modern medicine, such as \"modern medicine is organ-specific\", and \"modern medicine prefers patients to be passive, whereas CAM requires the patient to take a highly active part\". Moreover, CAM can be categorized into five groups [ [5](#B5-healthcare-11-00977)]: (a) whole medical systems, including Ayurveda, homeopathy, naturopathy, and traditional Chinese medicine; (b) mind-body techniques, including biofeedback, hypnotherapy, prayer, and relaxation techniques; (c) biologically based practices, including chelation and diet therapies; (d) manipulative and body-based therapies, including chiropractic, osteopathic manipulation, cupping, massage, moxibustion, reflexology, and gua-sha; and (e) energy therapies, including acupuncture, magnets, reiki, and therapeutic touch. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-00977)]. In addition, these might differ from therapy to therapy as well as from one individual to another. Several interrelated positive and negative factors interplay to determine CAM's present level of popularity [ [7](#B7-healthcare-11-00977), [8](#B8-healthcare-11-00977)]. The positive motivating factors include perceived efficacy, perceived safety, philosophical beliefs, control over treatment, and a good patient-therapist relationship [ [7](#B7-healthcare-11-00977), [8](#B8-healthcare-11-00977)]. On the other hand, negative motivating factors are those associated with perceptions about conventional medicine, including possible serious adverse effects, poor doctor-patient relationships, insufficient time with the doctor, long waiting lists, and rejection of science and technology [ [7](#B7-healthcare-11-00977), [8](#B8-healthcare-11-00977)]. [9](#B9-healthcare-11-00977), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-00977), [11](#B11-healthcare-11-00977), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-00977)], around 75% of the population in France, 42% of the population in the United States, 86% of the population in Egypt, and 88% of the population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were found to utilize CAM and herbal medicine (HM) for primary care. Moreover, traditional healers treat 90% of patients in Bangladesh, 85% in Myanmar, 80% in India, 75% in Nepal, 65% in Sri Lanka, and 60% in Indonesia according to a WHO have also been conducted to investigate the association between CAM use and adverse health effects [ [23](#B23-healthcare-11-00977), [24](#B24-healthcare-11-00977), [25](#B25-healthcare-11-00977), [26](#B26-healthcare-11-00977)]. The results from these studies demonstrated that HMs are generally utilized to treat mild to moderate diseases, and the participants were aware of their limitations. The combination of self-medication with inexperienced counseling and a lack of awareness of the hazards associated with herbal medicines can be harmful. [27](#B27-healthcare-11-00977)] listed the plants that are utilized as traditional medicines for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in Northern Cyprus. The results showed that the use of herbal medicines was common among patients with diabetes and that some herbs may have potential drug interactions with medicines used concurrently. Christopher and Ozturk [ [28](#B28-healthcare-11-00977)] determined the prevalence and determinants of CAM use among Nigerian children living in Northern Cyprus. The results demonstrated that the most widely utilized CAM products were vitamins, minerals, and herbal products. T\u00fclek et al. [ [29](#B29-healthcare-11-00977)] identified the HM products used in pregnancy in community pharmacies in Northern Cyprus. The results indicated that herbal lozenges were the most common form of herbal pharmaceuticals. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Setting 2.2. Questionnaire Design [Section 1](#sec1-healthcare-11-00977)assessed the participant's sociodemographic background, including gender, age, marital status, region, education, occupation, and monthly income. [Section 2](#sec2-healthcare-11-00977)investigated the participants' use of HPs, their thoughts on the safety of HPs, in which situations they prefer to use HPs, in which forms they prefer HPs, the factors affecting their use of HPs, where they obtained HPs, and where they obtained information about the HPs they would use. [Section 3](#sec3-healthcare-11-00977)contained questions about whether the participants had tried CAM treatment methods, including aromatherapy (massage, inhalation, compress, bath), phytotherapy (treatment with HPs), apitherapy (honey, propolis, royal jelly, pollen), Ayurveda, homeopathy, ozone therapy, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, religious and spiritual healing (praying), chiropractic treatment, osteopathy, hypnotherapy (hypnosis), music therapy, hydrotherapy, cupping therapy, and leech therapy, which methods they had tried, where they learned about such treatments, for what purposes they used them, and whether they recommended the methods they used to others. [Section 4](#sec4-healthcare-11-00977)asked participants about their attitudes towards HMs and HPs and whether they would find public seminars useful regarding HMs and HPs to increase their knowledge about them. [Section 5](#sec5-healthcare-11-00977)included five open-ended semi-structured questions to obtain qualitative data. The open-ended questions were: - - Beyond your prescribed treatment, have you tried other practices like herbs, vitamins, plant oil massage CAM, or anything else for your health problems? If yes, which kind of such practice? What is your opinion about CAM? - - What is your attitude toward the concept of CAM? Is it beneficial? From where did you get information about CAM? - - Do you think CAM is effective for your health problems? - - Have you informed your doctor, pharmacist, or any other healthcare professional about the use of CAM? If not, why? - - Are there any issues related to CAM that you would like to add? 2.3. Data Analysis 2.4. Ethical Consideration 3. Results 3.1. Participants' Data [Table 1](#healthcare-11-00977-t001). Moreover, the participants were chosen from different genders and levels of education to understand how these variables impacted the results. As shown in [Table 1](#healthcare-11-00977-t001), 225 (63.4%) of the participants were females and 288 (81.4%) had graduated from a university or higher education program. Additionally, with regard to age, 44.4% were in the 17-35 age group, 24.9% were in the 36-45 age group, and 30.7% were in the 46-84 age group. Most of the participants had a moderate income, as indicated in [Table 1](#healthcare-11-00977-t001). 3.2. Participants' Awareness of CAMs [Table 2](#healthcare-11-00977-t002). of and Public Attitudes towards HPs [Figure 1](#healthcare-11-00977-f001). The most preferred HPs were fennel (n = 208, 57.9%), ginger (n = 181, 50.4%), and echinacea (n = 3](#healthcare-11-00977-t003). [Table 4](#healthcare-11-00977-t004). [Figure 2](#healthcare-11-00977-f002). Moreover, the authors asked the respondents about their reasons for not using herbal products. As shown in [Figure 3](#healthcare-11-00977-f003), 10% of the participants thought that they do not need to use herbal products, 9.2% thought that herbal products are not useful enough, and 5.6% expressed reluctance to take such supplements because they do not know the production conditions of herbal products. Some 4.7% of respondents thought that products are very expensive, and 4.7% of them said they do not use such products because of the possible side effects of herbal products. Finally, it was observed that 3.3% of the participants did not use such products because they thought that the herbal products might interact with the conventional drugs they were currently using. [Table 5](#healthcare-11-00977-t005)). The respondents were asked if they would use HPs in addition to conventional medicine if recommended by their doctor or pharmacist to. While 186 participants (51.8%) said yes, 22 participants (6.1%) stated that they would not use them, as [Figure < 0.05) were found between education level and HP use status. Additionally, there was no significant difference between age and HP use (2 = 2.665, p = 0.264 > 0.05) as patients used HPs regardless of age. As a result of the Chi-square test, no significant difference was found between the gender variable and HP use status (2 = 0.272, p = 0.602 > 0.05) as patients used HPs regardless of gender. There was no significant difference between the income variable and HP use status (2 = 5.515, p = 0.238 > 0.05). In other words, patients used HP regardless of their income level. [Table 8](#healthcare-11-00977-t008)presents responses regarding the average monthly budget for the herbal products used. It was found that women spent more money than men, and the difference was statistically significant (2 = 6.575 a, p = 0.037 > 0.05). As for the effect of education, 44.7% of individuals with graduate and higher education levels spent TL 150 or more on herbal products, while this rate was 30.2% for individuals with university degrees, and only 23.7% for those with a high school education. The difference was found to be statistically significant (2 = 14.125 a, p = 0.007 > 0.05). 3.4. Public Attitude towards Possible Future Seminars 3.5. Qualitative Findings of the Study-Interview Analysis \"I took my treatment as my doctor said, but I prefer to use some herbal and vitamins with it because they make me feel better and they are good... I also tried some dietary supplements to improve my health in general\". \"Yes, sometimes I drink herbs and lemon juice when I feel that my pressure is high. Also, I do use CAM from time to time and I feel better after doing it\". \"No, I've never attempted anything other than the doctor-prescribed therapy... Because they have not been evaluated and I am unsure of the potential consequences of using them, I do not trust products like herbs or CAM therapies. I altered my diet and took the required medications.\" \"My friend advised me to use one of the CAMs to treat hypertension, and when I tried it, I felt good without the need to use medicines\". \"Natural products are not manufactured by a human; they have been found in nature for our benefit since the beginning of life. They are like our food, they are also cheap and not like manufactured drugs which are very expensive and may result in harm to the patients\". \"No, I've never heard of this name before, but I know this therapy is known as herbal medicine. No, I was unaware of this before... But, I have heard about alternative medications on television and believe they are the same as herbal remedies\". \"I have used different things since I found out I have hypertension... I drink lemon; also, I take some food supplements with garlic, ginger, and vitamins...\". \"I got them from the pharmacy... I prefer to ask the pharmacist about them because he knows more about the medicines and herbs\". \"Herbal medicine has been known since ancient times and when I need to use it or need any advice, I ask older people or the pharmacist sometimes\". \"Yes, it is an effective treatment and gives good results, but you have to take it continuously... If you leave it for a long time, maybe you will not get any benefit from it. It needs time to lower the blood pressure\". \"I think they are safe, without any harmful effects... Our religion encourages us to do it. Reflexology is also good and safe as I have tried it before without any bad results\". \"Concerning CAM, I learned about it from TV shows and from reading about it on the Internet. I sometimes contact the elderly since they have experience dealing with it\". 4. Discussion [18](#B18-healthcare-11-00977), [30](#B30-healthcare-11-00977), [31](#B31-healthcare-11-00977), [32](#B32-healthcare-11-00977), [33](#B33-healthcare-11-00977), [34](#B34-healthcare-11-00977)]. Furthermore, based on the results and compared with similar studies, HP use was found to be vary from country to country [ [35](#B35-healthcare-11-00977)]. For example, 66.8% of the population in Nigeria [ [36](#B36-healthcare-11-00977)], 63.5% of the population in Kuwait [ [37](#B37-healthcare-11-00977)], 39.2% of the population in Turkey [ [31](#B31-healthcare-11-00977)], and 33.9% of the population in Malaysia [ [33](#B33-healthcare-11-00977)] have used HPs. These findings may be due to differences in cultural and health systems in countries or the perception of HPs in other studies, but more studies on this topic are needed in the future to clarify this issue. [37](#B37-healthcare-11-00977), [38](#B38-healthcare-11-00977)]. It may also indicate that people only engage in health-oriented behavior (such as using drugs to avoid illness or promote health) when they are seriously threatened by a health condition, not when they are healthy. [35](#B35-healthcare-11-00977), [39](#B39-healthcare-11-00977)]. These findings are important in that they show that the people in NC trust pharmacists and doctors more than those in Germany and the UK do. [40](#B40-healthcare-11-00977)]. Those who participated in the survey mostly preferred to use HPs in cold, flu, cough, and similar situations (77.4%) and to strengthen their immune system (65.2%) In addition, among those who had tried CAM methods, the most frequently cited reason for use was as an immune booster (40.7%), and the most preferred HPs were fennel (57.9%) and ginger (50.4%). In addition, a study was conducted with 508 participants in Vietnam at the same time as this study that examined the use of HPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the findings indicated that 49% of respondents used HPs to treat symptoms of common diseases [ [41](#B41-healthcare-11-00977)]. The most commonly used herbal product was ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) with 79.1%, and HPs were mostly used in the treatment of sore throat (62.2%), cough (60.6%), nasal congestion (41.4%), and fever (35.7%) [ [41](#B41-healthcare-11-00977)]. The most probable reason for these findings is that the survey was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic when the disease was active, no vaccine had been approved, and no conventional drugs were available to provide treatment for COVID-19. The abovementioned factors could explain why people try to use alternative treatments instead of conventional treatments as immune boosters and for cold symptoms. These findings also align with a study that investigated the use of phytotherapy and diet therapy in the Balkan Peninsula during COVID-19 [ [42](#B42-healthcare-11-00977)]. Another important finding is that the majority of study participants (52.1%) thought that HPs were harmless or had very few side effects, while 26.5% thought that risks of side effects, drug interactions, and allergies were very low. While 13.1% of study participants thought the risks of side effects, drug interactions, and allergies are similar to the drugs in modern medicine, only 1.9% thought that the risks are too high. This finding is similar to similar studies in Serbia, where 73.3% of the participants thought that HPs are harmless [ [43](#B43-healthcare-11-00977)], the UK, where 71% thought that HPs were safe [ [42](#B42-healthcare-11-00977)], and Vietnam, where 70% of respondents believed that HPs were safe, had fewer side effects than conventional drugs, and were effective in treating minor health conditions [ [44](#B44-healthcare-11-00977)]. This is worrisome, considering that the risks of HPs interacting with conventional medicines and side effects need to be considered and therapeutic indices of some HPs, are very narrow. According to the results, patients use HP regardless of their gender, age, and income level, findings that agree with previous studies [ [30](#B30-healthcare-11-00977), [45](#B45-healthcare-11-00977)]. [23](#B23-healthcare-11-00977)] found that people believed that using HPs can prevent or even cure COVID-19. Nilashi et al. [ [46](#B46-healthcare-11-00977)] found that using CAMs would be an effective way of boosting the immune response against infections and preventing and/or treating COVID-19. Panyod et al. [ [47](#B47-healthcare-11-00977)] concluded that dietary therapy and herbal medicine can be considered potentially effective ways of preventing and/or treating SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Liu et al. [ [48](#B48-healthcare-11-00977)] concluded that HP (Lianhuaqingwen) combined with traditional therapy appeared to be more effective for patients with mild or normal COVID-19. In contrast, prepandemic studies showed much lower rates of HP use in Northern Cyprus [ [27](#B27-healthcare-11-00977), [28](#B28-healthcare-11-00977), [29](#B29-healthcare-11-00977)]. 5.
