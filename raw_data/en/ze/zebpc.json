The guide also provides information on the purpose of each rule as well as any special instructions necessary for compliance determination. Thus it should also serve as a useful document for child care center licensees to allow for a better understanding of the rules in preparation for licensure and for on-going compliance. The guide's structure and order is the same as the rules. The guide is organized in the following format: The complete text of the rules is first. The symbol is used to indicate the rule or the code. Following the rule is the 'intent' statement. The intent statement summarizes the purpose of the rule - the 'why' of the rule. The symbol is used to indicate the intent. Next is the 'assessment method'; this provides licensing staff guidance on the means for evaluating compliance with the rule. The symbol is used to indicate the assessment method. Last is the 'threshold of compliance\"; this provides licensing staff guidance on determining whether or not a rule should be cited as non- compliant. The symbol is used to indicate the threshold of compliance. Please note that not all rules have an interpretative guide and not all interpretative guides have the three components. Licensees operating child care centers are subject to both Indiana Code (IC) and Indiana Administrative Code (IAC). IC is statue or law created by the Indiana Legislature. IAC is rule developed by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration through the public process required by Indiana statue.

Assessment Method: The facility structure must comply with requirements for an E occupancy (for children age 30 months and older) or an I-4 occupancy (for children less than 30 months of age) under the Indiana Building Code in effect at the time of the plan approval. If the structure is determined to be in compliance with the required occupancy codes, no plans need to be filed with the SBC. The building must have approved on-site inspections by the State Fire Marshal's Office and the Sanitarian prior to opening and approval from the licensing consultant.

The health program is submitted on forms supplied by the Division and must be approved by the Division prior to licensure and when there are changes to the health program. (f) The building shall pass on-site inspections prior to licensure and license renewals. Intent: This rule ensures that the center is in compliance with the licensing rules prior to licensure and at the time of license renewal. Approval is required by the Division sanitarian and the State Fire Marshal for the initial license and the health consultant for license renewal. In reality, the center is expected to be in compliance at all times to ensure the safe, appropriate care of children. (g) The attendance at the child care center shall not at any time exceed the capacity approved by the di vision. Intent: The purpose of setting a maximum capacity is to ensure that the number of children present at any given time does not exceed the center's ability to provide adequate supervision and care to each child in care. If the maximum capacity is exce eded, the health, safety and welfare of the children in care may be jeopardized. Assessment Method: The capacity is determined for each room and then totaled as required in 470 IAC 3 -4.7-110. The maximum capacity of the center is the lesser of the room size capacity or the toilet/sink capacity, as required in 470 IAC 3-4.7-113. Threshold of Compliance: Check the licensing record for licensed capacity by room and the total. Observe and count the number of children in each room and total.

Threshold of Compliance: Observe the program for compliance with the ages for which the Center was approved as specified on the license. (i) The child care center shall not operate in an area where conditions exist that could be injurious to the welfare of children. Intent: To ensure that the Center is located in an area that is free from hazards, such as heavy traffic, deep excavations, radiation hazards, pits, abandoned wells or other risks of entrapment or other unsafe or harmful environmental elements. The determination of hazard is made by the Division. Location near some potential hazards may be permitted if the Division determines that there is no immediate threat of harm to the children, e.g. locat ion next to an interstate or a chemical plant that is in compliance with all codes. (j) The child care center shall meet the zoning requirements of their locale. Intent: To clarify that it is the child care center's responsibility to determine compliance with local zoning requirements . 470 IAC 3 -4.7-3 Child care center license Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 3.

Direct supervision, as defined in the definition section of these rules means that qualified caregivers 1) have all children in sight; 2) are alert to any problems that may occur ; and 3) are taking an active supervisory role with the children. Note: Refer to rule 470 IAC 3-4.7-1 Definitions (f) Centers shall have a written policy that describes the steps caregivers shall take to correct inadequate ratio s. Caregivers shall be aware of this policy. (g) Caregivers shall promptly notify the director when ratios become deficient. (h) The director or person in charge shall correct child/staff ratios immediately. Intent: To ensure that the Center has and implements written policy and procedures to frequently monitor child/staff ratios and to correct deficient ratios. (i) Children of the director and staff members shall be counted in child/staff ratios and assigned to their appropriate age group. Intent: Effective 11-01-2018 Page 62 of 189 To ensure that all children in the Center are counted in child/staff ratios and assigned to their appropriate age group, including children of the Director and staff. (j) The center shall have at least tw o (2) adults present during all hours of operation. (k) The center shall make arrangements so that if only one (1) adult is supervising a group of children, that adult has means available to communicate with other caregivers and summon assistance without l eaving children unattended. Intent: To ensure that at least 2 staff are present at the Center at all times including the beginning and end of the day and to ensure that staff can adequately respond to emergencies when one staff is alone with a group of children. (l) The assignment of administrative, maintenance, and housekeeping duties shall not interfere with the direct supervision of children. Intent: To ensure the understanding that the direct supervision of children is the most important activity in the Center; no other duties can interfere with direct supervision of the children. (m) The center shall make every effort to have substitutes visit the child care center to become generally familiar with the children and program in advance of the time they may be called to substitute. Intent: To ensure that substitutes have some familiarity with the children and the program of care when they actually are called to work with a group of children. The child/staff ratios established in this rule not only ensure that sufficient staff are always present to protect the safety of children but also encourage programs to provide for the developmental needs of children. The number of required caregiving staff can be determined by dividing the total number of children in attendance in each age group by the age appropriate staffing requirement. Components of the rule ensure the appropriate supervision of children at all times. Note: It is important to note that one child over the child/staff ratio requires the presence of an additional staff person (any fraction above the whole number in the computation). Assessment Method: Check children's attendance sheets and staffing schedules to determine compliance with specified child staff ratios and other parts of the rule. Observe child/staff ratios in each group and staffing patterns to determine that staff are directly supervising children at all times and not engaged in other activities. Observe child/staff ratios in mixed age groups to determine compliance. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 63 of 189 Ask Director and staff about chil d/staff practices especially at opening and closing times of the day. Threshold of Compliance: The Center must meet all parts of this rule to be found in compliance. Noncompliance in any requirement of the rule will be included in the POI with enforcement action as appropriate - noncompliance with child/staff ratios is a serious noncompliance. Note: Qualified therapists as identified in a child's IFSP or IEP are exempt from this rule. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-49 Child grouping policies Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 49. (a) Age grouping policies apply at all times except as in subsection (f). Intent: To ensure the understanding that maximum group sizes shall apply at all times inside, out side and for special events. Research has shown that group size and child/staff ratios are among the most important determinants of child safety and quality of care. This rule does allow a program flexibility in mixing age groups as long as there is adequate supervision and attention to the developmental needs of children. Maximum group sizes for special events can be adjusted by keeping each classroom of children together during the presentation; however, the minimum square footage requirements shall still be maintained. During rest time, groups may be in the same room; however, each classroom of children must be k ept together and kept separate from the other groups in the room. Rest time ratios must be maintained for each group and minimum square footage requirements apply. Note: Children transitioning to the next age group or starting the facility may start vis iting or be placed in the next age group of children with a transition period of 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after their b9 irthday. The ratio that is maintained is the ratio of the classroom that the child is moving into. Any other variations that are not included in Interpretive Guide or the rules would be considered on an individual basis and in the best interest of the child. These would have to be approved through a variance. For more information and guidance for children under 30 months of age refer to the Interpretive Guide for 470 IAC 3-4.7-51 Implementation of continuity of care. (b) When mixing age groups, younger children shall be protected from aggressive older children. (c) Caregivers may care for preschool children in the same group or area. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 64 of 189 Intent: The intent is to allow the Center to mix children ages 3 through 5 years together at any time. (d) Centers may group children thirty (30) to thirty -six (36) months of age with children three (3) years of age. Intent: The intent is to al low the older 2 year olds, between 30-36 months of age, to be grouped with the 3 year olds with a ratio of 7:1 and group size of 14. Also, no child in the group may be older than 48 months. (e) When all the children two (2) years old in a group are at le ast thirty (30) months of age, the child/staff ratio is 7:1. Intent: To allow the Center to use the 7:1 ratio for a group of older 2 year olds who are all 30 months and older. (f) Caregivers may group children three (3) years of age through school age together during the first and last hour of the child care center's operation provided the group size does not exceed the maximum group size for the youngest children in the group. Intent: To allow the Center flexibility in groupings of children as they arrive in the morning and leave at the end of the day as long as the group size is that required for the youngest children in the group, in recognition of the developmental needs of the younger children. (g) Caregivers shall care for school age children in a clearly defined separate room/area. When mixing age groups, the group may not be larger than the square foot capacity of the room. (h) The maximum number of children per class is also determined by available space. (i) Centers licensed prior to the effective date of this rule may elect to have a maximum group size for children two (2) years of age of fifteen (15), provided they use the same room. (j) Kindergarten age children may be mixed with either preschool or school age groups. Intent: To ensure the understanding that a child who will be entering kindergarten in the fall may be considered a kindergartner during the summer preceding the beginning of that school year. Assessment Method: Check attendance sheets and staffing schedule to determine compliance with all requirements of the rule. Observ e group sizes and child/staff ratios of mixed age groups to determine compliance. Observe Center at arrival and/or departure times. Ask Director about plans for grouping children during the first and last hours of the day and to ensure compl iance with other parts of the rule. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 65 of 189 The consultant may need to check birthdates of children in mixed age groups to ensure compliance with the rule. Threshold of Compliance: The Center must meet all parts of this rule to be found in compliance. Noncompliance in any requirement of the rule will be included in the POI with enforcement action as appropriate 470 IAC 3 -4.7-50 Grouping of children under 30 months of age Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 50. (a) In any group that has an infant or toddler, the maximum age range between the oldest and youngest child in the group shall be thirteen (13) months. (b) Caregivers of infants and toddlers shall have the date of birth of all children in the room immediately available. Intent: To protect the health and safety of infants and toddlers and to take into consideration their unique needs at each stage of development. Their birthdates must be considered when they are assigned to groups to ensure that only infants or toddler s within a 13 month age span are grouped together. Assessment Method: Check the ages of infants and toddlers in each group to determine compliance with this rule. Observe infant and toddler groupings and check for the listing of birthdates in each group. These birthdates shall be available in the classroom. Threshold of Compliance: The Center is in compliance if infant and toddler groupings meet both requirements of this rule. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-51 Implementation of continuity of care Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 51. Centers shall make a reasonable effort to provide continuity of care for children under thirty (30) months of age. Intent: Research has shown that consistency in care is important to the appropriate growth and development of children, especially for infants and toddlers. Thus, it is essential for infants and toddlers to have a primary caregiver assigned to them and for the Center make every effort possible to keep infants and their primary caregivers together until all children in the group are 30 months old. A center may use various methods to achieve continuity of care, including, but not limited to: Moving the teacher with their children to another classroom as the children mature; Effective 11-01-2018 Page 66 of 189 Modifying the classroom as the chil dren mature; Creating mixed age groupings of children, ages six weeks to 36 months; or Intentional transitions: 1. Transitions from one room and caregiver to another are very important at this age. Children should have opportunity to become familiar with their new caregiver over a period of time before they move into that new room or group and whenever possible, it is also helpful for two or more children to move together to allow for continuity of the relationships between children and new c aregivers to be maintained. 2. Reasonable effort means that the children are familiar with the caregiver in the room they are moving into and move with another child whenever possible. Assessment Method: Ask the Director about plans regarding continuity of care for children under 30 months of age, different strategies they have tried and how they worked. Ask lead caregivers and caregivers about implementation of the policy and procedures to comply with continuity of care. Check staffing and infant/toddler assignments to new rooms/groups to help determine compliance. Ask the Director if staff have received training in continuity of care. Threshold of Compliance: The Center is in compliance if there is documentation and testimony from the Director and staff interviews that when children under 30 months of are moved to another room, they are familiar with their new caregivers and have been moved with one or more children from their group to the new room, when this is possible. The Center may need time to find a method that works but must show evidence that they are working to achiev e full compliance with this rule. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-52 Alt ernative mixed age groupings Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 52. For the purpose of maintaining continuity of care, centers may mix children six (6) weeks of age to thirty -six (36) months of age in one (1) classroom under the following conditions: (1) A child/staff ratio of 4:1 is maintained. (2) The maximum group size is eight (8). (3) Each group shall have no more than three (3) children under twelve (12) months of age. (4) The center's program, furnishings, and equipment shall meet the developmentally appropriate needs of all the children in the room. Intent: Effective 11-01-2018 Page 67 of 189 The intent is to allow children and their peers to be with their same caregiver, not for the convenience of correcting ratios. This rule requires all Centers using this grouping method to have 50 square feet of space per child in the class room. This rule is intended to allow the Center flexibility in groups of children from infancy through 3 years of age; however , the Center must meet specified requirements to ensure continuity of care for this age group. The group shall have 3 or fewer infants under 12 months of age, meet infant ratios and meet group size while also meeting the developmental needs of all the children in the group 470 IAC 3 -4.7-53 Rest periods Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 53. (a) Caregivers shall provide a supervised rest period for children four (4) year of age and under after the noon meal and at any other time if requested by any age chil d. (This does not apply to children in attendance less than four (4) hours per day.) Intent: To ensure that each child 4 years old and under is provided periods of napping or resting, tailored to the age of the child. Children's needs for sleep vary acc ording to age and individual body make-up. Individual needs must be considered in determining rest/sleep schedules for each child. Assessment Method: Examine daily schedules of rest/napping for each age group. (b) Children of all ages shall not rest or sleep on the floor. Staff shall provide cots for all children that rest as follows: (1) Cots shall be firm, portable, easily sanitized, in good repair, and have the underside of the sleeping surface off the floor. (2) Staff shall sanitize cots daily after each use. Staff may sanitize cots weekly if the same child uses the same cot each day. If staff sanitize cots weekly, they shall clearly identify assigned cots. (3) Staff shall space cots at a minimum of two (2) feet apart on all sides, except where they touch a wall or other room divider. (4) Aisles between cots shall be kept clear of all obstructions while the cots are occupied. (5) Cots shall not block exits. Intent: To ensur e that each child who rests or sleeps is provided a cot intended for his/her individual use and kept clean and in good repair to prevent the spread of germs and protect the safety and health of the children. Cots used by different children must be sanitized daily and between each use. Cots clearly assigned to and used by the same children each day may be sanitized weekly. Cots must be properly spaced on all sides to prevent the spread of germs unless they touch a wall or room divider. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 68 of 189 For the children's safety cots must not obstruct aisles or exits while children are using them . Assessment Method: Observe that each child is supplied with a cot appropriate to his/her age. Ask Director and staff about schedule for cleaning and sanitizing cots and procedures for ensuring cleaning between uses for shared cots. Observe that cots assigned to individual children are marked with the child's name. Observe cots for cleanliness, proper spacing between cots and that cots do not obstruct aisles or exits. Observe the storage of cots to be sure they are not being stacked in a way that the sleeping surfaces touch. (c) The center shall assure that a cover is provided as follows for each child: (1) The cover shall be clean, individually marked, and maintain comfort and warmth. (2) The cover shall be washed at least weekly or promptly if s oiled. (3) If different children use the same cover, staff shall wash the cover between uses. (4) Children's faces and heads shall be free from covering. Intent: To ensure that children are provided clean, individually assigned blankets , which are seasonably appropriate to keep the child warm. The Center shall have extra clean blankets available for use as needed. The cover s shall be cleaned weekly or when dirty and between uses by different children to prevent the spread of infection. To prevent smothering and to allow visual supervision, children's faces and heads shall not be covered by the blanket. Assessment Method: Observe that each child is provided with his/her own covers, such as blankets and sheets that are appropriate to the season. Observe the extra supply of blankets and other covers. Ask the Director and staff about this. Observe covers for cleanliness. Ask staff about laundering and cleaning procedures. Observe napping children's faces and heads to be sure they are not covered. (d) The center shall provide individual storage so that one (1) child's cover does not touch the cover of another child. Intent: Children shall be provided with individual space to store their bedding to minimize the spread of illness. This may include cubbies (cubicle with one open side), hooks with built-in separators or hooks at least 18 inches apart, laundry bags, diaper bags, separate bins or other similar cleanable storage units. Coverings may also be folded and stacked on the child's assigned cots. Storage spaces must be cleaned before use by another child. C overs provided by parents/guardians and those provided b y the Center and pillows used by the children must be stored so that they don't touch those of other children. Covers shall not be stored in a manner in which they touch the floor. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 69 of 189 Assessment Method: Observe individual storage spaces to ensure that covers and blankets for each child do not touch another child's. Observe that storage spaces are marked with each child's name. (e) When resting, children shall lie in such a way that direct face-to-face situations are avoided. Intent: To prevent the spread of germs. Assessment Method: Observe resting children to ensure there are no children facing each other. (f) After thirty (30) minutes, caregivers shall provide supervised alternate activities for nonsleeping children. Intent: To clarify that these activities may be on the cot, in another area of the classroom, or in another licensed space within the building. Because the rule states alternate activities (plural ), books may not be the only activity offered to children. (g) Caregivers shall permit sleeping children to awaken naturally at their own pace. Intent: To allow children to awaken gently and of their own accord. If naptime has ended, routine activities in the room may resume. Although children in child care need to rest, a shorter rest time may be appropriate for some children. Children who are not sleeping should be allowed to get up and play quietly after 30 minutes if they appear to be restless and/or wide awake. Children who sleep should be allowed to sleep according to their own body needs and therefore should be allowed to awaken naturally at their own pace unless their parents request that they be awakened after a certain period of time in recognition of provision (l) . Assessment Method: Observe during rest period to see that children who are not sleeping are allowed to get up and play quietly after 30 minutes if they appear to be wide awake. Ask staff about Center practice. Observe resting childr en to determine if they are allowed to awaken naturally and sleep according to their needs. Ask staff about Center practice. (h) During the rest period for children toddler age and older, caregivers may supervise children at fifty percent (50%) of the required child/staff ratio provided that: Intent: Effective 11-01-2018 Page 70 of 189 This rule ensures that each group of children is visually supervised by staff during rest periods. The rule allows 50% of the required child/staff ratio for children toddler age and older during rest times as long as specified conditions in provisions (1) -(3) are met. The rule also is intended to ensure that staff are able to see all children on cots at all times during rest periods. The 50% of the child/staff ration applies to the children in attendance that day. Example: Ten (10) two year ol ds in a room, six (6) children are awake, there would have to be two staff present in the room. Assessment Method: Check staffing assignments during rest period. Ask Director and staff about the practice. Check rest period to ensure that staff can see all of the children on cots. (1) the required child/staff ratio is maintained on the premises; (2) required caregivers are immediately accessible; and Intent: To ensure the protection of children, the staff needed for the required child/staff ratio for the resting children shall remain on the premises and shall be immediately accessible in the event of an emergency or if children awaken and staff are required to maintain appropriate ratio. Assessment Method: Check staff assignments and emergency procedures to ensure conditions specified. Interview staff about emergency procedures. (3) a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the children in the class are asleep. Intent: To ensure the understanding that as soon as more than 50% of the children are awake, the child/staff ratio must be maintained. Assessment Method: Observe rest periods as children are awakening for child/staff ratios. (i) The fifty percent (50%) reduction in child/staff ratios does not apply to infants. Intent: For the protection of infants, the child/staff ratio must be maintained at all times of the day including rest periods. Infants ' rest needs vary and they often sleep at different times of the day requiring the full attention of staff to protect their health and safety. Assessment Method: Observe infant rooms to determine child/staff ratio at various times of the day. (j) Caregivers shall supervise sleeping children and never leave them unattended. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 71 of 189 Intent: To protect their health and safety , children shall always be directly supervised and appropriately cared for even when sleeping. A caregiver may not supervise more than one classroom at a time. Assessment Method: Observe rest periods to determine that children are not left alone. (k) Rest areas shall have a minimum average of five (5) foot-candles of light in all areas. Intent: To provide adequate lighting that caregivers can see all children at all times and that children who awaken can see to use the bathroom or evacuate in an emergency without waiting for their eyes to adjust to the room lighting. Determination of adequate lighting means that caregivers can see all children at all times and when children awaken, they do not need to have a time period for their eyes to adjust. (l) Caregivers shall make rest periods flexible based on discussions with the parent and the child's individual needs. Intent: To ensure that caregivers talk to parents and consider each child's individual needs when they establish rest periods for that child. Assessment Method: Ask Director and staff about the practice of determining rest needs of indivi dual children. Observe the lighting in rest areas for compliance with requirement (k) . Threshold of Compliance: For compliance, the C enter must meet all of the requirements in this rule. Noncompliance will be included in the POI for correction. Non compliance with some parts of the rule may be revealed though a complaint. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-54 Positive discipline Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 54. (a) Caregivers shall use positive discipline. (b) Caregivers shall do the follow ing: (1) Communicate to children using positive statements. (2) Encourage children, with adult support, to use their own words and solutions in order to resolve their own interpersonal conflicts. (3) Communicate with children by getting down to their eye l evel and talking to them in a calm quiet manner about what behavior is expected. Intent: Discipline should be an ongoing process to help children develop inner control so they can manage their own behavior in a socially approved manner and appropriate to their age and developmental level. This rule intends to ensure that Effective 11-01-2018 Page 72 of 189 the Center make s every effort to use positive methods in communicating with children and teaching them how to work through problems themselves. Caregivers shall use positive statements and talk with children in a calm, quiet manner about their behavioral expectations. Assessment Method: Observe the interactions between caregivers and children for positive methods of communicating with children as specified. Interview the Director and staff about methods for encouraging children to work through problems with other children and their implementation of positive discipline techniques. Ask Director and staff about ongoing and periodic training in the use of positive methods of discipline. Threshold of Compliance: The Center is in compliance i f Center policy and all staff provide evidence of using positive methods of discipline. A finding of noncompliance would sometimes be the result of external complaints. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-55 Inappropriate discipline Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 55. (a) Any person, while on child care center premises, shall not engage in or direct any of the following actions toward children: (1) Inflict corporal punishment in any manner upon a child's body. (2) Hit, spank, beat, shake, pinch, or any other measure that produces physical discomfort. (3) Cruel, harsh, unusual, humiliating, or frightening methods of discipline, including threatening the use of physical punishment. (4) Placement in a locked or dark room. Intent: To ensure that children are never placed in a locked room or room without lights as a form of punishment. In fact, children must always be within the sight of staff and shall never be left alone in another room. These actions are abusive and not acceptable in the care of children. (5) Public or private humiliation, yelling, or abusive or profane language. (b) Staff shall not associate disciplinary action or rewards with rest. (c) Staff shall not associate disciplinary action with food or us e food as a reward. (d) Staff shall not associate disciplinary action or humiliate a child in regard to toileting. (e) Caregivers shall not: (1) use time out for any child less than three (3) years of age; (2) use time out for any purpose other than to enable the child to regain control; Intent: To ensure that time out, if used, is used appropriately. \"Time out\" shall not be used with children under 3 years of age since they are too young to understand this consequence. For children 3 years or over, the Center shall selectively use Effective 11-01-2018 Page 73 of 189 \"time out\" only to enable the child to regain control of him or herself. The caregiver shall keep the child in visual contact and shall take into consideration the child's developmental level and ability to learn from \"time out.\" Time out should not be used excessively. (3) physically restrain children except: (A) when it is necessary to ensure their own safety or that of others; and(B) only for as long as is necessary for control of the situation; and (4) use punishment to correct unacceptable behavior. Intent: To ensure that physical restraint is only used when absolutely necessary for the child's own or others' protection. When necessary, the most desirable method of restraint is holding the child as gently as possi ble until the child regains control. Children shall not be physically restrained longer than necessary to control the situation. The decision to restrain a child shall be made by the staff person in the classroom with the most knowledge and expertise in child care and shall only be made for extreme circumstances. Training in the use of any form of physical restraint shall be provided by persons with extensive child care experience including experience with children who have required restraint. Rule 55 is intended to ensure that no Center uses behavior management methods that are cruel, harsh, or humiliating, whether physical or verbal , in dealing with children. To ensure that discipline is not associated in any way with food, rest or toileting. This rule also limits the use of time out and physical restraint. There are appropriate alternatives to punishment which vary as children grow and develop. Anticipating potential problems is more effective and conducive to the child care setting and eliminates most of the need for negative discipline. Factors that tend to foster positive discipline include: 1) arranging furniture to allow for maximal use of space; 2) sufficient equipment and toys; 3) small groups of children; 4) observant adults; and 5) adul t expectations set at a reasonable level according to the child's age and development. Assessment Method: Review discipline policy to ensure conditions specified. Ask Director and staff about discipline procedures and implementation. Observe the program for methods of discipline. Threshold of Compliance: A finding of noncompliance would normally be supported by external complaints or observation of use of inappropriate discipline. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-56 Discipline documentation Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Effective 11-01-2018 Page 74 of 189 Sec. 56. (a) The director shall formulate a child care center -wide written discipline policy and distribute the policy to parents and staff. (b) Caregivers shall have ongoing communication between home and center regarding all aspects of the care of the child. (c) Caregivers shall document any history of recurring disc ipline problems and subsequent formal parent conferences in the child's record. (d) The center shall implement and document a specific plan of action with the child's parents for dealing with the child's unacceptable behavior. Intent: To ensure that the Center clearly states in writing its discipline policy and procedures and its emphasis on positive discipline, in compliance with rules 470 IAC 3 -4.7-55 and 470 IAC 3-4.7-56 and distributes the policy to parents and staff. For the protection of the Center and children, this rule also requires ongoing communication with parents about the care of their children and documentation of recurring problems in the child's record. When a child exhibits unacceptable behavior, the Center shall develop, with the parents, a plan of action and shall implement that plan. The Center should use the resources available to them to help them plan a course of action, including, if warranted, periodic visits from a specialist for individualized treatment. Assessment Method: Ask Director about discipline policy and procedure for providing copies to parents and staff. Ask staff about implementation of discipline policy. Ask Director and staff about procedures for communicating with parents, documenting problem situations, and procedure for developing specific plans of action for children with unacceptable behavior. Threshold of Compliance: For compliance, the Center must have a written policy, provide copies to staff and parents and have procedures for communicating with parents about ongoing children's behavior and problem situations and also have a working plan to work with parents in the event of unacceptable behavior of a child. 470 IAC 3 -4.7-57 General program components Authority: IC 12-13-5 -3 Affected: IC 12-17.2-4 Sec. 57. (a) Caregivers shall recognize each child as an individual whose personal privacy, choice of activities, and cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds are respected. (b) Centers shall work to increase understanding of cultural, ethnic, and other differences. (c) The curriculum and adults' interaction shall be responsive to individual differences in ability and interests. Caregivers shall design interactions and activities to develop children's positive feelings toward learning. (d) Efficient planning and good caregiver communication during transition periods shall be used to avoid waiting periods between activities. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 75 of 189 (e) Caregivers shall arrange learning areas, equipment, and materials so children can work undis turbed either individually or in small groups. (f) Caregivers shall arrange equipment in orderly, clearly defined areas of interest with space in each area for children to see the various activities available to them. Intent: To ensure that materials planned for each learning center shall be visible for children to choose from, not in a closed cupboard or other location where the children must request the items where children have to ask for them. (g) Caregivers shall provide children many opportunities to develop social skills, such as cooperating, helping, negotiating, and talking with others to solve interpersonal problems. (h) Caregivers shall move among groups and individuals to facilitate children's involvement with materials and activities by asking questions, offering suggestions, or adding more complex materials or ideas to a situation. (i) The center shall assign one (1) lead caregiver for each group of children. Intent: Only one (1) lead caregiver is needed per room, even if there are different morning and afternoon teachers. Rule 57 is intended to ensure that children are cared for in a manner that recognizes their individual needs and abilities with sensit ivity to their cultural as well as religious backgrounds. Furthermore, the intent is to provide experiences which are appropriate to the age and/or developmental level of the children in each group. Experiences should be matched to he children's existing interests and skills so that children are challenged, but not frustrated or bored. All children need first-hand experiences with concrete materials; the younger the children, the more chances they need to be active and to choose activities on an individ ual basis. Direct experience is preferable to a reliance on paper and pencil activities. Equipment should be arranged in interest areas for children in which they can readily see and use the activities available to them, with staff facilitating and guidi ng their involvement. Caregivers shall plan carefully and communicate effectively to help with smooth transitions between activities. Interactions with children shal l foster a love of learning. The rule ensures that one (1) lead caregiver shall be assi gned to a group of children. Assessment Method: Observe the activities in each group noting children's behavior in response to the activities and interest areas and noting the extent to which children are able to move freely around the room during the period of observation. Observe the arrangement of areas, equipment and materials to determine if children can work individually or in small groups. Note the variety of activities provided and the role of staff in facilitating learning and positive interactions among children. Effective 11-01-2018 Page 76 of 189 Observe the interactions between children and staff to determine if they promote positive learning and for evidence that the cultural, individual , ethnic and religious backgrounds are respected. Ask Director and staff about the development of the daily program and communication among staff to foster smooth transitions between activities. Threshold of Compliance: The Center is in compliance with evidence that all parts of the rule are met.

Assessment Method: In setting the capacity, the consultant does the following: Consideration is given to any limitations that might be i mposed by applicable State fire, sanitation, zoning or other requirements. As a part of the proposed Center review, the consultant determines room size capacity by measuring all usable play space in each room. Areas not routinely used by the children for sleep or play and excluded from the usable play space measurement are the kitchen, toilet rooms, isolation areas, office, staff rooms, hallways, stairways, laundry areas and the furnace room. The following is used to determine the square footage of each room: 1. Measure the area from inside wall to inside wall or inside boundary to inside boundary. State in square feet to the second decimal place. 2. Measure the area occupied by indoor equipment such as storage cubbies, lockers, the teacher's desk , storage ar eas, permanent built-in cabinets or multi -program areas. Express in square feet to the second decimal place. 3. Subtract measurement (2) from measurement (1). This figure is the total square feet of play area available for a group (s) of children in that room. 4. Divide the available play area three (s) by thirty -five (35) square feet. Round decimals of .50 and above up and those of .49 and below down to express the product as a whole number. This figure gives the capacity for that room. 5. This formula appl ies to most rooms /areas with the following exceptions: a. Rooms /areas that serve infants must have a maximum capacity of eight (8) and must have 50 square feet of space per child. b. Rooms /areas that serve toddlers must have a maximum capacity of ten (10) childr en regardless of size. c.
