Introduction [1](#B1-vetsci-09-00074), [2](#B2-vetsci-09-00074)]. Zhao Fu initially started using hemo-acupuncture at Jing-mai to treat diseases in horses during the Zhou-mu-gong period (947 to 928 B.C.) [ [2](#B2-vetsci-09-00074)]. Bo Le, who lived during the Qing-mu-gong period (659-621 B.C.), treated horses, specifically racehorses, and was considered to be an equine specialist at the time [ [2](#B2-vetsci-09-00074)]. Perhaps one of the first non-domestic animals to be treated with Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) was the elephant [ [3](#B3-vetsci-09-00074)]. Additionally, TCVM has been used in laboratory animals over the years as a part of peer-reviewed literature and as part of evaluating its use in humans and domestic animals grown to be an accepted method of treatment for domestic animals, such as horses, dogs, and cats, and has been used as an adjunctive therapy in numerous other are limited studies on meridians and their use in large varieties of species. However, non-domestic animals, or exotic animals, are becoming increasingly popular pets and the authors have noticed that their owners are seeking veterinary care of a similar caliber to that of domestic animals. [40](#B40-vetsci-09-00074)]. As zoological medicine has advanced, veterinarians are seeking additional multimodal modes of therapy in treating these animals' medical conditions. Acupuncture may have been primarily used in zoological animals in the past during anesthetic procedures. However, with advances in the field of behavioral training, acupuncture is now possible in many animals without anesthesia through operant conditioning, which is a method of training animals through positive reinforcement to accept medical procedures, such as injections or needle placement. 2. Materials and Methods 3. Results [41](#B41-vetsci-09-00074)]. The species with cases published in the literature include elephants [ [42](#B42-vetsci-09-00074)], rabbits [ [43](#B43-vetsci-09-00074)], rodents [ [43](#B43-vetsci-09-00074)], avians tigers [45](#B45-vetsci-09-00074)], and turtles [ [34](#B34-vetsci-09-00074), [35](#B35-vetsci-09-00074)], among others. Approximate meridians have been printed in elephants [ [46](#B46-vetsci-09-00074)], birds [ [37](#B37-vetsci-09-00074), [47](#B47-vetsci-09-00074)], rabbits [ [26](#B26-vetsci-09-00074)], dolphins [49](#B49-vetsci-09-00074)], and fish [ [50](#B50-vetsci-09-00074), [51](#B51-vetsci-09-00074)]. Approximate acupoints have been identified in a boa constrictors as well [ [52](#B52-vetsci-09-00074)]. Transposition of points has been carried out in a variety of species, including rabbits, ducks, chickens, and dolphins [ [41](#B41-vetsci-09-00074), [49](#B49-vetsci-09-00074)]. The following are summaries of the available literature, the methods of treating a variety of non-domestic animals, and examples of conditions for which acupuncture is commonly used in these species. 3.1. Amphibians [53](#B53-vetsci-09-00074)]. Acupuncture has been used by the authors utilizing a method of approximate transposition of canine points to amphibian anatomy. The typical TCVM methods of diagnosis, such as evaluating the tongue color and pulse characteristics, may be stressful and inaccurate in these species. The medical conditions that can be treated in amphibians are typically osteoarthritis, paresis, or paralysis ( [Table 1](#vetsci-09-00074-t001)). [54](#B54-vetsci-09-00074)]. It is also best to rinse the gloves in a portion of the animal's tank water prior to handling the animal in order to minimize the risk of skin trauma. In general, medial and ventral acupuncture points are challenging to access in these species due to their close proximity to the ground in their natural positioning and holding the animal upright, or in dorsal recumbency, in order to access medial and ventral points can induce stress. For predominantly aquatic species, it may be more of a challenge to treat and to keep the needles in the animal; additionally, electroacupuncture should not be used in these species. The needles that tend to work best for acupuncture are the 42-gauge hand needles for a 3 to 5 min long session ( [Figure 1](#vetsci-09-00074-f001)). 3.2. Reptiles [Figure 2](#vetsci-09-00074-f002)) or those on the limbs in the case of snakes). Additionally, the methods typically used to make a TCVM diagnosis, such as through the use of tongue color and pulse, appear to be generally inaccurate, or not possible, in reptiles. The determination of acupoints has made some progress through an initial study to approximate acupoints in a boa constrictor using an electrostimulator [ [52](#B52-vetsci-09-00074)]. Although these points were not identified with a meridian, they are still areas that likely pertain to acupoints. Overall, reptiles appear to respond well therapy ( [Figure 2](#vetsci-09-00074-f002), [Figure 3](#vetsci-09-00074-f003)and [Figure 4](#vetsci-09-00074-f004)). Reptiles also respond extremely well to electroacupuncture and often become noticeably more relaxed once the stimulation is added, even if they initially resent the insertion of needles. [34](#B34-vetsci-09-00074), [35](#B35-vetsci-09-00074)], painful conditions [ [55](#B55-vetsci-09-00074)], and stimulation of appetite. [34](#B34-vetsci-09-00074), [35](#B35-vetsci-09-00074)]. Acupuncture has also been reported to treat locomotive concerns in a tortoise [ [38](#B38-vetsci-09-00074)], and Komodo dragon [ [55](#B55-vetsci-09-00074)]. A boa constrictor has also been treated with an integrative approach using acupuncture for treatment of a recurrent respiratory infection [ [45](#B45-vetsci-09-00074)], and for wound healing, including the use of moxibustion [ [56](#B56-vetsci-09-00074)]. Lizards have benefitted from acupuncture and electroacupuncture when suffering from paresis, paralysis, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, scoliosis, and kyphosis (TMH experience). Another condition that is successfully treated is inappetence. The exact acupuncture points may be challenging to determine in species such as snakes ( [Figure 5](#vetsci-09-00074-f005)), but acupuncture based on region and approximating of transposing points or inserting needles (cranial and caudal) into lesions, such as in spondylosis or spondylitis, appears to be adequate in these species. One author (SMC) has treated two long-term reptile cases in a zoological institution with acupuncture, including a geriatric green iguana with inappetence and poor activity level and a king rat snake with severe spinal osteopathy resulting in poor mobility. Both of the animals were treated weekly for many months with both dry needles and electroacupuncture, and both responded positively. In the case of the iguana, the treatment sessions were coordinated with the research department at the institution and the research team developed a behavioral ethogram in order to monitor and demonstrate the effects of the acupuncture (publication in preparation). Acupuncture in reptiles is best performed by inserting the needles between the scales, so that the scales are not damaged and to prevent future dysecdysis. In smaller species, 42-gauge hand needles are easiest to use. In larger species, larger gauge needles can be used. The length of time for treatment depends on the animals, but generally 3 to 5 min or longer with electroacupuncture can be achieved. 3.3. Avians [33](#B33-vetsci-09-00074), [37](#B37-vetsci-09-00074), [57](#B57-vetsci-09-00074)]. There are a vast number of avian taxa and a great diversity between them. In general, in attempting to make a TCVM diagnosis, observations of the tongue and pulse can be performed, but it may be extremely stressful for the patient and may be inaccurate as many species have pigmented tongues. Different from many nontraditional species, an avian acupuncture meridian charts exists [ [47](#B47-vetsci-09-00074)]. A variety of methods are used in the treatment of birds, including inserting needles and leaving them in, or just putting needles in, manipulating them, and removing the needles immediately [ [47](#B47-vetsci-09-00074)]. In some species, it is substantially easier to use aquapuncture. The anatomical differences between bird species can make accessing certain points challenging or impossible. For instance, while some species, such as cranes and chickens, have long legs with easily-accessible and identifiable anatomy, other species, such as parrots and penguins, have short legs with much of the femur tucked under the body in an inaccessible area. Additionally, when performing aquapuncture in avians, the clinician should be aware of the air sac locations, so as to not induce a fatal aquapuncture injection directly into an air sac, which is most commonly carried out when attempting subcutaneous injections along the back of the bird, and should be avoided. Some gallinaceous birds, such as chickens and peafowl, tolerate needles quite well and have been observed by the author (TMH) to exhibit a deqi response, such as yawning, with a response to therapy within one to two sessions. [Figure 6](#vetsci-09-00074-f006)and [Figure 7](#vetsci-09-00074-f007)). Feather-destructive behavior, or feather plucking, can be treated in conjunction with other treatment and diagnostic modalities, such as behavioral modification, habitat changes, and enrichment [ [47](#B47-vetsci-09-00074)]. The use of the acupuncture point An Shen, located along the midpoint of the ear and directly caudal to the ear opening in avians, is a great aquapuncture location to calm birds for hours or even days. In order to use this point, one author (TMH) uses a subcutaneous 50:50 mixture of saline and Vitamin B12 proportionate to the size of the bird, i.e., for small birds 0.05 mL SQ in this location and up to 0.1 mL in larger birds. One author (SMC) has also used tian-men or da-feng-men in several avian species as a calming point prior to insertion of other needles and found that it consistently produces a calming effect. 3.4. Small Mammals [14](#B14-vetsci-09-00074), [58](#B58-vetsci-09-00074), [59](#B59-vetsci-09-00074), [60](#B60-vetsci-09-00074), [61](#B61-vetsci-09-00074), [62](#B62-vetsci-09-00074), Because these animals are prey species and often have small oral cavities, evaluating the tongue can be very stressful and inaccurate. Similarly, it may be challenging to assess pulse, but of all of the methods of TCVM diagnostics, this is the most feasible method. Most of these animals respond well to bladder meridian or proximal limb points in the authors experience. They tend to be less tolerant of lower limb points and medial points are very challenging to access or stressful to use. The conditions treated typically include spinal injuries, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal injuries, and gastrointestinal disorders [ [69](#B69-vetsci-09-00074)]. [14](#B14-vetsci-09-00074)]. Similar to equines, stasis patients greatly benefit from acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and aquapuncture and tend to respond well to treatment unless the gastrointestinal stasis is caused by a more severe situation, such as a mechanical obstruction ( [Figure 8](#vetsci-09-00074-f008)and [Figure 9](#vetsci-09-00074-f009)). [70](#B70-vetsci-09-00074), [71](#B71-vetsci-09-00074)], clinically, it challenging to use in the authors' experience. Aquapuncture is typically more successful in ferrets and can be used to treat various conditions, such as nausea, pain secondary to trauma, or as a symptomatic treatment in neoplasia cases. Osteoarthritis and spinal conditions tend to be uncommon in ferrets. Ferrets greatly benefit from a \"less is more\" approach to treatment, and it is advisable to start with a small number of points and to work up in numbers of acupuncture points over time. 3.5. Zoological Animals [40](#B40-vetsci-09-00074)]. However, many animals in zoos and aquaria are involved in some sort of operant conditioning or training program and it is often possible to train animals to accept injections. The use of acupuncture needles or aquapuncture is an easy transition for those animals trained to accept injections. Even in the most well-trained animal, however, treatment with acupuncture typically involves gradually increasing the number of points and the duration of the treatment sessions over time. The benefits of acupuncture and additional numbers of needles must be weighed against the risks of losing a needle if the animal unexpectedly leaves during the treatment session. Often, especially in the case of dangerous animals, specialized equipment is used to aid in keeping the acupuncturist, the handlers, and the animal safe and secure, such as squeeze chutes ( [Figure 10](#vetsci-09-00074-f010)). In animals that are not trained to accept needles, or those that cannot be restrained to facilitate needle insertion, acupuncture may be performed under anesthesia. When treating an animal under anesthesia, more points, therapies, and a longer length of the session are possible. When treating an animal under anesthesia, it is best to avoid anesthetic reversal with - and -opioid receptor antagonists, as some, but not all, of the effects of acupuncture may be reversed [ [72](#B72-vetsci-09-00074)]. Of course, the risks of anesthesia must be weighed against the possible benefits of acupuncture. In the authors' experience, an animal might be anesthetized for acupuncture if there are other important procedures to perform for that animal, but it would be uncommon to anesthetize a zoo animal for the purpose of acupuncture alone. [3](#B3-vetsci-09-00074), [42](#B42-vetsci-09-00074)]. The meridian points have been mapped out for elephants and they have been treated for painful or other arthritic lesions for many years ( [Figure 11](#vetsci-09-00074-f011)) [ [46](#B46-vetsci-09-00074)]. Treating elephants can be challenging in many ways, particularly from a safety aspect. Most elephants currently under human care are managed through protected contact, meaning that humans are always separated from the animals by a barrier, and the elephants are trained to come up to the edge of the holding facility. In this method of treatment, the acupuncturist would need to reach through the barriers to treat the animal. This requires positioning of the animal in a method that facilitates close contact to place needles, as well as training the animal to accept the acupuncture. The medial points are not safely accessible in most of these animals. The bladder meridian points may also be hard to access due to the height of the animal, although stepping stools or other tools could aid in this treatment. Needles, such as 26-Ga colored handled acupuncture needles, are easy to use and should be inserted through the cracks in the skin. Elephants can remove needles, therefore, having a needle with a colored handle assists in locating the needle after self-removal. The treatment time can vary depending on the training of the elephant, but typically starts at 5 min in length and could last for 15 min or more. [73](#B73-vetsci-09-00074)]. One author (TMH) has treated a black bear long-term for osteoarthritis with acupuncture, aquapuncture, and photobiomodulation. This animal was treated in a squeeze chute initially with aquapuncture to train it to accept acupuncture. This animal was treated every 2-4 weeks for several years. Many larger felid species have also been commonly reported to have spinal conditions and osteoarthritis and have been treated for these conditions [ [36](#B36-vetsci-09-00074), [44](#B44-vetsci-09-00074)]. Carnivores in particular can be very dangerous to conduct acupuncture on, and depending on the animal, the acupuncturist may only be able to treat one point at a time and then gradually increase the number of points. In general, the medial points are not accessible due to safety reasons and cannot be accessed in carnivores unless they are anesthetized or can be easily manually restrained. The treatment sessions tend to be short in length unless the animal is anesthetized. [32](#B32-vetsci-09-00074)]. The evaluation of the tongue and pulse can be challenging or dangerous to access for a TCVM diagnosis. Some hoofstock, such as camelids, have been reported to have benefitted from acupuncture in the literature [ [74](#B74-vetsci-09-00074)]. For treatment considerations, many larger hoofstock, such as giraffe, are routinely trained to accept injections and to position themselves next to barriers for treatment. The ability to treat other hoofstock, such as cervid, bovid, or equid species, may be entirely dependent on the temperament of the individual. Many hoofstock, however, may only be treatable while under general anesthesia. The medial points are not accessible unless the animal is anesthetized. Other megavertebrates, such as rhinoceros, may also be trained to accept injections and are treatable with acupuncture. Due to the extreme thickness of their skin in certain areas, treating the lateral limbs and the neck may be more feasible than along their spine. The medial points are accessible in some animals, but not safely in others depending on the animal. The evaluation of the tongue and pulse are generally not safe to access for the rhinoceros. The conditions that are commonly treated in hoofstock and megavertebrates are osteoarthritis, other painful conditions, and gastrointestinal issues, such as colic. [4](#B4-vetsci-09-00074)], but through operant conditioning this could be attempted in a clinical zoological settings as well. The biggest challenge in treating primates with acupuncture through training is their natural dexterity and ability to self-remove the needles. [48](#B48-vetsci-09-00074)], although predominantly they have been treated with herbal medicine [ [75](#B75-vetsci-09-00074)]. Acupuncture points have been mapped for dolphins but are not utilized to the authors' knowledge [ [48](#B48-vetsci-09-00074), [49](#B49-vetsci-09-00074)]. The use of tongue color could be accessible for trained animals, but obviously a femoral pulse is not possible due to their anatomy for a TCVM diagnosis. Both cetaceans and pinnipeds are exquisitely amenable to training and could certainly be trained to accept acupuncture, but the greatest risk is in the animal leaving the training session with the needles still in place and then losing needles in an aquatic environment. This could potentially pose a risk to other animals in the pool. Thus, treatment may be encouraged to be performed with the animal \"hauled out\" or voluntarily stationed on a land area in the case of cetaceans, or temporarily \"dry-docked\" and separated from the pool in the case of pinnipeds. The acupuncturist would need to remain in a position near to the trainer and would not be able to move around extensively, which would only allow them to have to access to the points near where they are positioned. The duration of the treatment would likely vary by animal and would be gradually increased over time. Aquapuncture is likely a good option for marine mammals to avoid the risks associated with keeping a needle in place in the aquatic environment. 4. Discussion [76](#B76-vetsci-09-00074)], has been used in zoological species, but as demonstrated in the cases and conditions above, its use is not limited to that. Acupuncture has become a part of a multimodal approach to analgesia and, as a study on myofascial muscle pain in rabbits that demonstrated improved pain relief through affecting endogenous opioids has shown, additional use of acupuncture as a multimodal approach is warranted [ [65](#B65-vetsci-09-00074)]. 5.
