We also desire to return fully to a more normal and vibrant on-campus experience, with limited need for testing, quarantine, and other mitigation efforts. Accordingly, the University will require all students, faculty, and staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before participating in any on-campus activity related to the 2022-23 academic year. We will be able to return classrooms, meeting and event spaces, dining and residence halls, study areas, recreation facilities, liturgical services, and more to their full capacity. The full slate and range of student and service activities can and will be offered. Most importantly, we will do our part to reduce risks of serious illness due to COVID-19 among members of our community. [Submit Vaccination/Booster Information Here](https://www.sju.edu/hawk-hill-ahead/vaccine-disclosure) Primary Vaccination Exemptions Members of the community may apply for a [medical or religious exemption](https://covidsju.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1S3M7apJiI3F91Y) to be excluded from the primary vaccination mandate. If any member of the community is granted an exemption, they may be required to test weekly or follow mitigation requirements by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Health Monitoring Members of the University community may always choose to wear masks as they deem personally appropriate. Any student, staff or faculty member may request those around them to wear a mask when in classrooms, meeting in private offices or other shared spaces. Everyone should be prepared to wear a mask if asked, which means all members of the Saint Joseph's community must carry masks (cloth, surgical or KN95-type) at all times. Masks are available in the Public Safety Customer Service Center in Campion 229 and at Public Safety Dispatch 103 Alumni Hall on the University City campus.
