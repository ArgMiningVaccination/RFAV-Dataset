(Mackenzie, 2019) The most well-known benefits of meditation, however, are those related to the factors that affect an individual's mental wellness. With the world still dealing with the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the world's population continues to struggle with their mental health. According to a recent study on the implications of COVID-19 for mental health, American adults suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorder. To support this claim, recent data from the US Census Bureau's ongoing Household Pulse Survey shows that 4 in 10 adults in the US reported having symptoms of depression and anxiety. It is important to note that this data covers only the month of January 2021. Compared to the data from a similar study in 2019, the surge in the number of cases is staggering. Moreover, the 2019 data covered a six-month period and only 1 in 10 adults reportedly had the same symptoms. There is no current scientific proof to show that meditation can cure depression and anxiety. However, several studies reveal that meditation and mindfulness-based interventions have positive effects on brain activity. - Practicing meditation helps reduce stress response and anxiety as it counters the symptoms of anxiety disorders.

Additionally, how long they have been practicing meditation is also a factor to consider. Below are some statistics on how people incorporate meditation into their lives. - Over 14% of Americans have practiced meditation at least once. (The Good Body, 2021) - Among the Americans who practice meditation, 7% are children. (The Good Body, 2021) - An average person often meditates 2-3 days per week.

It is, however, important to note that the results are not instantaneous: in fact, they also vary according to individual circumstances. Since 2012, the number of people who practice meditation has tripled. The COVID-19 pandemic played a major role in accelerating the adoption of meditation practices across the globe. As people turned to meditation to help reduce stress and anxiety, it is not a surprise that many have chosen to incorporate mindfulness-based practices into their lives. With bad news all around, the practice alleviates some of the negative effects brought about by an unprecedented global crisis. Considering the circumstances and the advantages it offers, meditation and mindfulness is an ideal recreational pursuit.
