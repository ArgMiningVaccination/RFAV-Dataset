I am Suki Roth, founder and care-taker of Herb Haven, a vibrant teaching garden located in the Haw River Valley in Central North Carolina. The garden here is dedicated to the education, growth, and preservation of medicinal herbs. I am involved in the complete process of the production of our products. Together, with the community who supports our mission here, we plant, grow, harvest, create, and package herbal medicines. I am a community practitioner, serving as educator, plant guide and herbal medicine consultant. I enjoy sharing my intuitive wisdom, knowledge of the plants and personal guidance with the wider community. I'm glad you've landed here on my website!
