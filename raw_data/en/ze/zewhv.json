The homeopathic remedy could be changed at every follow-up (week 4) according to patient\u00b4s symptoms. Other Names: inhibitor. | Drug: Fluoxetine | 20 mg per day PO during 6 weeks plus individualized homeopathic dummy-loaded (60 bottle of 30% alcohol-distilled water: 15 drops PO two times per day following agitation). The individualized homeopathic dummy-loaded was repeated at week 4. Other Name: Prozac | Placebo Comparator: Placebo | Fluoxetine placebo plus individualized homeopathic placebo | Drug: Placebo | Fluoxetine placebo (capsules containing sucrose microgranules) PO daily during 6 weeks plus individualized homeopathic placebo (60 ml bottle of 30% alcohol-distilled water: 15 drops PO two times per day following agitation). The individualized homeopathic placebo was repeated at week 4. Other Names: - Change From Baseline in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at 6 Weeks. [ Time Frame: Baseline and 6 weeks ]17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) is a well-known standardized scale used worldwide to assess severity of depression. Score ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (maximum depression severity). A total score in HRSD was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. For this study the change was calculated as the later time point (total score in 17- HRSD at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score at baseline). A score < or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), > 24 (severe depression). - Change From Baseline in Beck Depression Inventory at 6 Weeks. [ Time Frame: Baseline and 6 weeks ]Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that assess severity of depression. A total score range was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. A score 0 (without depression) up to 63 (most severe depression). For this study the change was calculated as the later time point (total score in BDI at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score in BDI at baseline). A score 0 - 8 is considered normal, 9 - 18 (mild to moderate depression), 19 - 28 (moderate to severe depression), > 29 (severe depression). - Responder Rates at 6 Weeks. [ Time Frame: 6 weeks ]17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a well-known standardized scale used worldwide to assess severity of depression. Score ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (maximum depression severity). A total score in 17-item Hamilton Scale for Depression was assessed for this study. It ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (most severe depression). A score < or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), > 24 (severe depression). Responder rate definition: a decrease of 50% or more from baseline score using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression after six weeks treatment. - Change From Baseline in Greene\u00b4s Scale at 6 Weeks. [ Time Frame: Baseline and 6 weeks ]Greene Climacteric Scale (GS) is intended to be a standard measure of core climacteric symptoms. For this study a total range was assessed at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. A total score 0 (without climacteric symptoms) up to 63 (most severe climacteric symptoms). The change was calculated as the later time point (total score in GS at 6 weeks) minus the earlier time point (total score at baseline).The scale measures four separate sub-scales (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and sexual function). The score of the four sub-scales was summed. A total score of 0 -10 is considered without symptoms, 11 - 29 (mild symptoms), 30 - 49 (moderate symptoms) and > 50 (severe symptoms). - Remission Rates at 6 Weeks [ Time Frame: 6 weeks ]17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a well-known standardized scale used worldwide to assess severity of depression. Score ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (maximum depression severity). A total score in 17-item Hamilton Scale for Depression was assessed for this study. It ranges from 0 (no depression) up to 52 (most severe depression). A score < or = 7 is considered normal, 7 - 13 (mild depression), 14 - 24 (moderate to severe depression), > 24 (severe depression). Remission rate definition: 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score < 7 points after 6 weeks of treatment. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
