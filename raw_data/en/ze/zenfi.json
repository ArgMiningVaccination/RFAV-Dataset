With physical damage or disease suffered by an individual, healing involves the repair of living tissues, organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of (normal) functioning. Medicine includes the process by which the cells in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form \"like\" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms. This process may involve medical treatment, psychotherapy(counseling) or alternative approaches such as Traditional Spiritual Healing. Spiritual healing also helps in creating balance of the 7 chakras of the body, this balance keeps an individual away of many diseases.
