Generally speaking, Ayurveda deals more with the health of the body, while yoga deals with purifying the mind and consciousness, but in reality they complement and embrace each other. Besides sharing a philosoph ical foundation, both systems have many similarities in relation to attitude, nutrition, di et, hygiene, exercise, cleansing practices, as well as spiritual practices. Traditionally, a student of yo ga would first live close to and serve the guru for many years, during which time he would learn health y habits. The basic Ayurvedic principles for health and longevity were past on in the lineage in oral form to serve as a foundation for a life of sadhana (spiritual practice). 1 FIRST, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SIMILARITIES BETWEE Bglyph44HL YOGA ABglyph44HLD AYURVEDA 2, 3 /head2right Both are ancient Vedic teachings. Yoga originates i n the Yajur Veda, while Ayurveda originates in the Atharva Veda and Rig Veda. /head2right Both recognize that keeping the body healthy is vit al for fulfilling the four aims of life: Dharma (duty), Artha (wealth), Kama (desire), and Moksha ( liberation). /head2right Both recognize that the balance of doshas (humors), dhatus (tissues), and malas (waste products) is essential for maintaining good health. /head2right Both share virtually the same metaphysical anatomy and physiology, which consists of 72,000 nadis (subtle channels), 7 main chakras (energy cen ters), 5 bodily sheaths, and the Kundalini Shakti (energy). /head2right Both advocate the use of diet, herbs, asana, pranay ama, meditation, mantra, astrology, prayer, puja, and rituals for healing the entire being. /head2right Both encourage physical health as a good foundation for mental, emotional, and spiritual well3 being. /head2right Both share the same view on psychology. Ayurveda em braces all six of the main schools of philosophy including the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali a nd Vedanta (a non3dual philosophical and spiritual path). They both understand that the atta chment to the body3mind complex is the root cause of all suffering and that the ultimate state of health is experienced when we abide in our true nature, which is total peace, regardless of th e state of the physical body. /head2right Both use cleansing methods for the body, all of whi ch encourage the removal of waste products and toxins through their natural routes of eliminat ion. Ayurveda has panchakarma (five cleansing actions) and yoga uses Shat Karma (six pu rification measures). AYURVEDIC ABglyph44HLD YOGIC DIET Ayurveda is more concerned with food being constitu tionally balanced, while Yoga promotes a diet that is sattwic (light and pure). A combination of both aspects is the best choice for a yogi or anyon e wanting to make real progress on a spiritual path. Ayurvedic diet /head2right According to dosha. /head2right Primarily vegetarian (meat is used as medicine, mai nly for extreme deficiencies). /head2right Primarily cooked (raw food in moderation, especiall y for vata types). /head2right Containing six tastes. 4 Pharmacologyonline 1: 797p811 Bglyph44HLewsletter Dandawate et al. 799 Yogic /head2right Sattwic vegetarian diet. /head2right Easy to digest. /head2right Simple meals (to limit desire). /head2right Both cooked and raw. /head2right Foods recommended in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika consi st of rejuvenating substances such as wheat, whole grain, white basmati, corn, raw milk, raw sugar, butter, ghee, honey, dried ginger, mung beans, pure water, and vegetables. /head2right Fruits, roots and nuts. /head2right Avoiding excessive hot, sour, salty, fermented, and fried foods. /head2right Avoiding tamasic (dulling) foods like meat, onions, garlic and mushrooms as a regular part of the daily diet. 5 AYURVEDA Ayurveda (Devangar: the 'science of life') is a s ystem of traditional medicine native to the Indian Subcontinent and practiced in other parts of the wo rld as a form of alternative medicine. In Sanskrit, the word Ayurveda consists of the words yus , meaning 'life', and Veda , meaning 'related to knowledge' or 'science'. Evolving throughout its hi story, Ayurveda remains an influential system of medicine in South Asia. The earliest literature of Ayurveda appeared during the Vedic period in India. The Sushruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita were influential works on traditional medicine dur ing this era. Ayurvedic practitioners also identified a number of medicinal preparations and surgical procedures for curing various ailments and diseases . Ayurveda is considered to be a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) within the western world, where several of its methods, such as the use of herbs, massage, and Yog a as exercise or alternative medicine, are applied on their own as a form of CAM treatment. 6 Figure 1: The god of Ayurveda Dhanvantari.

This does not mean that the principles of Ayurveda are redundant and cannot be applied to modern life . 3500 BC The traditional system of medicine in India , the practice of Ayurveda extends to 3500 BC .

Extremely scientific in its approach, Ayurveda utilized, among other things, well3documents botani cal research. 2000 BC The History of Ayurveda dates back to 2000 BC , though there are diverse opinions on its origin. When ancient India was in the period of 'Vedas,' there w as profound understanding of the cosmic energy from the ancient sages. 1900 BC In India the traditional form of medicine, Ayurveda , saw extensive use of turmeric in early 1900 BC . The use of minerals and herbs in specific proportio ns was suggested by the then physicians Sushruta an d Charaka. 1800 BC Infant massage has been recognised for its importance throughout history in many cultures. It was used in India in Ayurvedic medicine from as long ago as 1800 BC . It was also used in China during the Qing dynasty (164431911). 1500 BC The history of Ayurveda can be traced back to BC 1500 . DHANWANDHARV was considered to be the God of Hindu system of medicine. He was born du ring the churning of the ocean during a tug of war between Gods and DEMONS. 800 BC The Shalihotrasamhita is as significant rega rding the treatment of horses as the Charak Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita are, on the treatment of human bei ngs. It is estimated to be 800 BC . This book is also known as Haya Ayurveda and Turagshastra 600 BC Ayurveda evolved around 600 BC . At that time Ayurvedic scholars did not have microscopes; nevertheless, they knew that life starts in the mot her's womb in 'liquid' form and becomes 'solid' at the time of birth. 500 AD It author, Vagbhata, was born in Sindh (a pr ovince in Pakistan) circa 500 AD and was taught Ayurvedic medicine by his father and a Buddhist monk, named Avalokita . 1930 The company, founded in 1930 , believes in the \"utilisation of modern research a nd development practises to rediscover and validate ayurveda's sec rets\". Himalaya claims to offer \"head3to3heel\" herb al solutions for the entire family. 2004 One in five Ayurvedic medicines (search) contains toxic levels of lead, mercury, or arsenic.

Table 1: History of Ayurveda Pharmacologyonline 1: 797p811 (2010) Bglyph44HLewsletter Dandawate et al. 801 THE COBglyph44HLCEPT BEHIBglyph44HLD AYURVEDA Ayurveda believes that there are energy types in a human body, called 'Doshas' . There are three kinds of doshas in the human body as per Ayurveda, namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha . In general only 1 or 2 off the three are dominant in a human body. The hea lth of any human being or any living being is judged on the basis of the balance of these Doshas in Ayurveda. Ayurveda says that diseases in a living being are nothing but imbalance of the dosha s, which can be easily regulated by following very simple ayurvedic routines. Yoga, pranayams, oil massages and controlled eating habits can easily cure any kind of disease ranging from common cold t o severe heart problems. 9 ELEMEBglyph44HLTS OF AYRUVEDA The 5 elements Water, Space, Earth, Air, Fire Elements in balance = health One element more dominate = imbalance, start of ill ness /head2right Ayurveda treats people as individuals. /head2right Firey energetic people have too much pitta. /head2right Earthy people are heavy and lazy in mind and body. /head2right Airy people move about a lot and find it hard to st ay in one place. /head2right As our mood changes so do the elements. /head2right Elements move up or down depending on our lifestyle . /head2right Our environment, job, family life, thoughts, etc. d etermines which elements dominate us more. 10 BEBglyph44HLEFITS OF AYURVEDIC HERBS /head2right Herbs help in proper digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food. Some of the herbs even work as good appetizers and being rich in roug hages. /head2right Herbs are also very prominently used to strengthen the immunity of the human body and also as preventive medicines for many general ailments. /head2right Some herbs are even used to provide stability and nourishment to the human body, in case the patient is going through a treatment for some chronic disease . /head2right General ailments like common cold and flu can be ve ry easily treated using ayurvedic medicines or even some house hold ayurvedic remedie s. Such house hold remedies are prominently used as the first stage of ayurvedic tr eatment. /head2right Studies reveal that ayurvedic herbs can prove to be a better alternative to allopathic treatment , and even provide successful ailments to diseases like cancer and AIDS , which are incurable till date. 11 THE MAGIC OF SYBglyph44HLERGY 12 Ayurveda calls it sanyog the science of combining to create results far greater than the benefits of each herb in isolation. Every herb has a specific f unction. Pharmacologyonline 1: 797p811 (2010) Bglyph44HLewsletter Dandawate et al. 802 Figure 2: The Magic of Synergy of Herbs The balancing herbs are crucial because they cancel any side effects that could result from taking sin gle herbs in isolation over the long term. AYURVEDIC TREATMEBglyph44HLT p METHODS OF TREATMEBglyph44HLT ABglyph44HLD TIPS 13 Ayurvedic treatment is a multidisciplinary approach , unlike Allopathic treatment where the main stress is on medicines. METHODS OF TREATMEBglyph44HLT Palliative Treatment Palliative treatment refers to means for reduction of increased doshas for curing the disease or decreasing its symptoms. It consists of following measures:p a) Sneha Karma or use of oily substances externally for massage etc. or internally. b) Sweda Karma or fomentation. c) Exercise. d) Exposure to sun. e) Exposure to fresh air. f) Taking medicines which increase digestion. g) Taking medicines which destroy toxins. Pharmacologyonline 1: 797p811 (2010) Bglyph44HLewsletter Dandawate et al. 803 IBglyph44HL AYURVEDA, THE TYPES OF MEDICIBglyph44HLES BASED OBglyph44HL THE SO URCE FROM WHICH THEY ARE OBTAIBglyph44HLED, ARE CLASSIFIED AS FOLLOWS 1. Herbal medicines 3 which are extracted from plants & herbs. 2. Mineral (metal) medicines 3 which are extracted fro m minerals, gems and jewels. 3. Herbomineral preparations 3 which are a combination of both herbs and minerals. ADVABglyph44HLTAGES OF AYURVEDA 14 /head2right It is preventive, protective, health primitive and curative in nature. At the same time herbal remedies are self contained, and nutritive renderin g them harmless and non toxic. This provides a constructive approach against destructiv e forces. /head2right Ayurveda is not man made but is believed to be divi ne gift. It is for us to study, seek, search and take the benefits from the treasure of k nowledge. /head2right Ayurveda is mainly based on herbs, plants, flowers, fruits, vegetables and all vegetation that grows around us in plenty. It is our native sy stem based on the peculiar indian conditions. Further whatever is available on our ow n country is bound to be more suitable in creating good health to us rather than borrowed knowledge as well as materials. Charaka samhita stresses the same point. /head2right Ayurveda begins when everything fails and when the treatment is uncertain and prolonged; ayurvedic approach is the right choice since it cur es chronic and stubborn diseases by its deep3rooted treatment procedures and drugs. Purification Treatment Purification refers to removal of accumulated toxin s or Doshas from the body. This is done by 5 methods known as Panchakarm a. They are as follows: a) Vamana or induced vomiting b) Virechana or induced purgation c) Basti or enema nasal Rakta mokshana or blood3letting. Other forms of Ayurvedic Treatment a) Fasting. b) Urine therapy. c) Rejuvenation (rasaayana) therapy. d) Fish therapy (for asthma). e) Ayurvedic Mental Therapy for Ailments. Table 2 : Method of Ayurvedic treatment Pharmacologyonline 1: 797p811 (2010) Bglyph44HLewsletter Dandawate et al. 804 YOGA 15 The Sanskrit term 'yoga' means union. Hence, 'Yoga' refers to the synthesis of the body and the mind. The source of yoga is called Hatha yoga. It is from this form of yoga that the other forms of yoga wer e distilled and enunciated. Yoga is turning out to be one of the most practiced means of physical and mental exercises across the world. One of the popul ar forms of Hatha Yoga that has been repackaged is 'Hot yoga' of Vikram Choudhury. Hot yoga is havi ng lots of fan following in USA. IS YOGA A MEDICIBglyph44HLE Yoga is indeed a medicine. It is a medicine based o n ancient science rather than modern allopath. Yoga is essentially a kind of mind3body therapy who se benefits are attained by doing various exercises and meditation. Yoga is now universally recognized as a powerful alternative branch of medicine. The sole reason for this is that Yoga has no side effec ts whatsoever. 16 It is perhaps the only medicine whose results are long3lasting and does not lead to any further complications or new diseases which generally happen in case of the orally3administered medicines. If described in other terms, \"Yoga is a healing system of theory and practice.\" It is a com bination of breathing exercises, physical postures and meditation which just needs to be practiced. 17 TEBglyph44HL GOOD REASOBglyph44HLS TO PRACTICE YOGA 18, 19 1. Yoga is not just for athletes, popstars and supermo dels! Yoga is for everyone: young or old, male or female, healthy or sick.

Furthermore, once you begin to practice regularly, yoga will help you to live your life wit h renewed positivity and enthusiasm. 3. Yoga is safe. Where other forms of exercise might p ut a strain on your heart, muscles and joints, yoga, practiced properly (with awareness to your physical limitations), is a completely harmless form of exercise. 4.

While beginning your yoga exercises, experiment with the poses, mov ing in and out as you feel comfortable. If you approach the poses with playful curiosity, feeling of frustration and competitiveness will not enter y our mind. While practicing your yoga exercises, make su re that you don't feel any discomfort or pain. YOGA POSES ABglyph44HLD BREATHIBglyph44HLG 22 Breathing is an essential part of practicing yoga e xercises. You should never hold your breathe during a pose. Also make sure that your breath is never fo rced or strained. Labored breathing is sign that yo u are working too hard and should come out of the pos e slightly. When one starts practicing yoga, one can hold for three full breaths through most yoga poses . If you feel comfortable in the pose, hold for longer, if uncomfortable, you should come out of th e pose immediately. TYPES OF YOGA POSES 23, 24, 25, 26 Seated poses: Seated poses are useful for practicing breathing e xercises and relaxation or meditation techniques. Seated poses are also often used as a w arm up or as a starting point for other poses. Performing seated poses can help improve your postu re and open your hips.

Standing poses are beneficial for strengthening you r legs, opening your hips and improving your sense of balance. Figure 3: Standing pose Inversions: Inversions are excellent poses to perform to improv e your blood circulation, quiet your mind and improve your overall health. Inversions ar e also believed to reverse the ageing process and reduce the effect of the gravity on your body. Figure 3: Inversions pose Relaxation and restorative poses: It is important to take time to perform relaxation or restorative poses at the end of each yoga practice. You can use this time to relax your body and mind and allow energy released by the poses in your practice to mo ve freely throughout your body. Counter poses: A counter pose is a yoga pose that stretches your spine in the opposite directio n from a previous pose or returns your spine to a neutral position. Pharmacologyonline 1: 797p811 (2010) Bglyph44HLewsletter Dandawate et al. 808 Twists: You can perform twists to stretch and strengthen y our back and abdominal muscles, increase the flexibility of your spine and improve your circ ulation. Twists improve the functioning of your internal organs by providing them with a fresh supp ly of blood as you twist and release your body.
