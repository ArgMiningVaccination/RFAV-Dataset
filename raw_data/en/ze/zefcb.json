He mentioned th at the analysis and recommendations of the workgroups are then shared with members to assist them in improving patient care. Ruben Almaguer, Assistant Vice President of Di saster Management and Emergency Operations explained that the all-volunteer team, Florida Adva nced Surgical Transport (FAST), joined the FIU family in April 2016 through a partnership with the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and the University's Department of Emergency Management . He noted that FIU-FAST is comprised of nearly 100 medical professionals, including trauma surgeons, emergency medicine doctors, nurses, and other support personnel, and is deployed to perf orm critical care after disasters both locally and throughout the country AVP Almaguer reported that rece ntly FIU submitted a request for proposal to the Department of Health and was awarded a $300,000 grant to serve as the State of Florida' s disaster response team. He noted that earlier in the year, FIU-FAST depl oyed a team of eight medical personnel in support of the U.S Southern Command and the Navy to tr eat patients in Puerto Barrios Guatemala. He stated that while the need for disaster response continues to increase, there is a shortage of medical professionals that are serving in this capacity. In response to Trustee Leonard Boord's inquiry regarding FIU-FAST's funding, AVP Almaguer stated that the program is self-funded. Sr. VP Rock provided an update on the status of the implementation of the 2011 agreement with Jackson Health and the University of Miami and explained that on May 3, 2011, a resolution was passed by the Miami Dade County Board of Commissi oners, which required the Public Health Trust to develop a plan to establish a comprehensive c linical education program and clinical practice in partnership with FIU and the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine (HWCOM) and to submit a plan in 90 days from the date of the resolution. He noted that the plan mandated that HWCOM faculty would be entitled to apply and be gran ted privileges, HWCOM faculty would practice and provide clinical services at Jackson Memorial Hospital, and that HWCOM students would be provided an opportunity to participate in the full ra nge of clinical experiences at Jackson Memorial Hospital as well as research collaboration. He adde d that on May 2, 2011 the Public Health Trust, the University of Miami, and the FIU Board of Trustees entered into a Memorandum of Understanding, which provided that FIU clinical faculty would serve as hospitalists for unassigned patients admitted from the emergency departme nt one day per week, that FIU would develop a residency program in internal medicine with inpati ent rotations at Jackson Memorial Hospital, and that FIU medical students would work with these residents in the fourth year electives instead of internships. He stated that the University has been in discussions with the Jackson Health System since 2011 to bring this agreement to fruition. He noted that the hospitalist program is currently in place providing services seven days a week. In addi tion, he indicated that FIU physicians are seeing indigent patients at the Jackson Ambulatory Care Center two days per week without compensation. He also noted that patient exposure is a critical part of the student educational platform. Page 7 of 25Florida International University DRAFT Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee Meeting Minutes December 8, 2017 Page | 3 In response to Trustee Michael G. Joseph's inquiry regarding the University's General Counsel's review of the agreement, Sr. VP Rock stated that at this time, legal has not been approached on this matter. Trustee Joseph motioned that the agreement shou ld be made available to the Health Affairs Committee for review. Trustee Joseph's motion could not move forward because there was no quorum. General Counsel, Carlos B. Castillo a dded that the University's General Counsel is available to assist and to provide any legal counseling.

Furton Next regularly scheduled Academic Policy and Student Affairs committee meeting KS December 19, 2017 Page 9 of 25 School of Integrated Science and Humanity (SISH) Report to the Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee May 2018 The School of Integrated Science and Humanity (SISH) in the College of Arts, Sciences & Education provides an interdisciplinary ho me for the study of health-themed sciences such as biochemistry, biophysics, neuroscien ce, and cognitive and behavioral sciences. The following provides an update of recent SISH health-related activities. BIOMOLECULAR SCIENCES INSTITUTE (BSI) Director: Dr. Yuk-Ching Tse-Dinh BSI faculty member Yuan Liu recently received a U.S. Patent (No. US 9809843 B1) for her invention of a high- throughput measuremen t of DNA base lesion repair capacity in human cells and patient tissue. This nove l fluorescence-based technology features a simple, fast, accurate and high-throughput measurement of DNA base lesion repair capacity in cell and tissue lysates, and ca n produce results within an hour. Currently, base excision repair is measured through monitoring decreases of DNA damage, which lacks accuracy. This technology allows for screenings of anti-cancer drugs and environmental toxicants that can inhibit ba se excision repair pathways for disease prevention. Inhibiting DNA repair in cancer cells can slow the progression of disease. At FIU, it has been applied to screening DN A base lesion repair inhibitors in human prostate cancer cells and researchers have successfully identified novel compounds that can significantly suppress prostate cancer progression. The technology can also be applied for monitoring of DNA repair at specific genes and genome sequences as a biomarker for personalized medicine and precision medicine, as well as for the development of a commercial kit to meas ure DNA repair capacity in humans. BSI faculty member Marcus Cooke, head of the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the Robert Stempel College of Public He alth & Social Work, was recently granted a U.S. Patent (Patent No. US 9,897,572, \"Devices and Methods for High- Throughput Assay\") for his invention of an automated device for accelerating and assessing DNA damage and repair in single cells. The novel approach, developed in collaboration with Shekhar Bhansali and his team in Electrical and Computer Engineering, will automate key steps of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) Page 10 of 25FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Update May 23, 2018 Page 2 which is used by many scientists and researc hers worldwide, and in areas such as the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, chemical and petrochemical industries, government research laboratories, CROs, and universities. Specific uses are in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity testing, together with human biomonitoring, environmental and occupational exposure assessments, DNA repair studies, gene-specific assessments, and ecogenotoxicity. In the immediate term, this technology will help scientists in those fields, but in the longer term, their work will benefit both human health and the environment. The patent has been incorporat ed into a proof-of-principle device, and the team is now working with a company to take this to the next step. CENTER FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (CCF) Director: Dr. William Pelham The Center for Children and Families (CCF) is an interdisciplinary team of researchers and service providers committed to improving the lives of children with mental health problems and their families. The CCF is the leading provider of evidence-based services for children with ADHD in Miami, and since its establishment in 2010, it has served approximately 10,000 families across c linical and research programs, with an average of 3,000 to 3,500 families per year over the last several years. The renowned Summer Treatment Programs (STP) served 254 children during the summer of 2017, and is projected to serve at least an addi tional 30 children in 2018 because one of our sponsors made additional funding available, in part because of the high quality of our program. The CCF Summer Reading Explorers Program, an intervention designed to improve literacy skills in young children, is on track to serve roughly 1500 children over the 2018 summer months. The CCF continues to offer important training opportunities to our faculty, students, staff, and community professionals: we offered nine speaker series events this fiscal year, with nationally renowned experts in the field; held six free community workshops that focus on important issues around parenting; and hosted the Miami International Child and Adolescent Mental Health Conference [MICAMH] in February 2018, for which 491 mental health pr ofessionals and students registered to attend. We have continued to offer Contin uing Education Units to licensed mental health professionals, and provided 1,581 CE s for the 2018 MICAMH conference alone. Additionally, our educational websites contin ues to draw many visitors interested in quality information on evidence-based practices. This fiscal year alone, 17,618 total viewers have visited the site. During FY 2018, 14 CCF faculty obtained 14 new awards and five supplements to existing awards incl uding: 3 NIH R01s, an R01-sized subproject Page 11 of 25FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Update May 23, 2018 Page 3 to a U54 NIH award, 2 Goal 3 IES awards, 2 R21 NIH awards, 1 NSF award, 1 agreement from the Health Resources and Services Administration, 1 international award from the University of Glasgow, a $3.4 million award from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), and 2 new Children's Trust Awards for nearly $6 million over five years. Additionally, 2 Su pplements to NIH awards and 3 supplements to Children's Trust projects were awarded to faculty with existing awards for a total of $873,000 additional funding. The total amou nt of new funding in FY 2018 was $26.34 million. CENTER FOR IMAGING SCIENCE (CIS) Director: Dr. Angela Laird The Center for Imaging Science (CIS) is a mu ltidisciplinary research center housed in the FIU Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED). The CIS includes a research-dedicated facility for a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, installed in August 2016. This Prisma MRI is equipped to run the Human Connectome and ABCD Prot ocols which entails state-of-the art multiband data acquisition, advanced motion correction (PROMO), echo planar imaging (EPI), distortion correction (EPIC), wi th ultra-fast data acquisition facilitating high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (HARDI) - in place of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) - and high-resolutio n, sub-second repeti tion time (RT) EPI acquisition. FIU research at the CIS is currently funde d by awards from the NIH, including two U01s, one U54, two R01s, and one R21. In a ddition, we have one project funded by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and another by a private foundation based in Miami. We support 229 CIS facility users, ac ross 17 different imaging projects, including 19 faculty members who serve as PIs or co-P Is. Our newest projects are being led by Drs. Matt Sutherland and Elisa Trucco (\"An tecedents and consequences of electronic nicotine delivery systems in underrepresented youth\"), who are supported by FIU's NIH RCMI award (U54 MD012393) and Drs. Maggie Sibley and Anthony Dick (\"The teenage brain at the transition to high school\") who are supported by the IES. Page 12 of 25 This page intentionally left blank FIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Report to the Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee May 2018 Accreditation HWCOM has been awarded full accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, LCME, for the next eight years, the maximum possible term. The LCME is the accrediting body for medical schools in the United States and Canada. Only graduates from LCME-accredited schools are eligible to apply for state licensing boards and most residency programs in the U.S. As a relatively new school, HWCOM was previously accredited for a period of five years. This was the first time it was eligible to be considered for the maximum review cycle of eight years. Student Achievement Match Day: One hundred and eleven students from Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine's Class of 2018 participated in this year's Match. Everyone one of our students was offered a residency position and they ma tched into some of the most prestigious residency programs in the nation. Our 2018 gr aduates will be continuing their training as far north as Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, as far west as Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, and right here in South Florida at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Mt. Sinai, Niklaus Children's Hosp ital, Aventura Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic. We are pleased that 66 percent of our students will be going into primary care where there is a critical need for physicians nationwide, and that nearly half of them are staying right here in Florida. Master in Physician Assistant Studies On December 16, 2017, the MPAS program graduated its inaugural class of 44 physician assistants and is currently training its second and third cohorts. FIU-FAST Commissioner Joe A. Martinez presented the FIU-FAST team with a county resolution recognizing March 14, 2018 as FIU-FAST Team Day.

FIU Bridge first responders Exactly one week after the pedestrian bridge collapse, the City of Sweetwater honored first responders, with a moment of silence at precisely 1:47 p.m. near the bridge site. First responders included police and fire crews and HWCOM students, faculty and staff working at nearby FIU Health who rushed to help. RESEARCH Distinguished Professor Madhavan Nair, Ph.D ., associate dean for biomedical research and associate vice president for nanotechnology has received a $224,643 grant from the Florida Department of Health to st udy a new approach to treating Alzheimer's disease using nanotechnology. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia. Current drugs only treat symptoms of AD, no t its causes. Nair and his team will target brain cells called microglia and will use hi s FIU patented MENs, (magneto electric nanoparticles) carrier system for the specific delivery and sustained release of two anti- inflammatory drugs, Withaferin A and CRID3, into those cells in hopes that this will inhibit neuroinflammatory response in mi croglia and help to improve cognitive function in AD patients. A study led by HWCOM researchers Jian Chen , Venkadesh Nadar and Distinguished Professor Barry Rosen that looked at how bacteria se nse and respond to arsenic in the environment was selected for the November cover of Molecular Microbiology , one of the top 20 journals in the field. It's the lab's se cond journal cover this year and the fourth in the nine years since Rosen joined FIU.
