A compelling set of teaching modules is available from the Emmy Award-winning documentary about children with cancer, A LION IN THE HOUSE. Based on real-life case studies, where things do not always go so well, the stories offer a forum to consider and discuss approaches to helping families navigate life and death issues related to cancer. The Case Studies in Spirituality and Childhood Cancer Module offers specific, complicated case studies around issues of spirituality during a pediatric medical crisis. The Institute of Medicine defines pediatric palliative care to include the spiritual needs of a family, with a broad view of spirituality as the search for meaning and purpose in life and in death. Many families rely on spiritual resources in times of health-related crises, especially at end-of-life. Yet the majority of medical caregivers do not address issues of spirituality with their patients, with many feeling ill-equipped to do so. This module offers the insight of several veteran pediatric oncologists around spirituality issues. -Each DVD module contains mini movies shot over a course of six years, competencies & objectives, discussion questions, a recommended resource list, and a PowerPoint presentation.

If you come away from this book with only one message, I hope you come to understand that you can be gentle with yourself as you move through the complex stages of grieving. With better understanding of the grief process, and learning the tools and skills you will learn in this WHEE BOOK, you will find you are able to markedly lessen your pain and suffering, or those of people under your care, as you move through the grief process. WHEE: Whole Health - Easily and Effectively AKA Wholistic Hybrid derived from EMDR and EFT WHEE is a self-treatment method that is extremely simple to learn and to use, yet very rapidly and deeply effective. Within minutes it can reduce physical and psychological pains, even when these have been present for decades. WHEE is completely individualized to the preferences and needs of those who use it. No part of WHEE is a requirement. Every aspect of WHEE is but a suggestion - for people to explore and use, as and if it feels right and comfortable to do so. WHEE addresses spirit, relationships (with other people and the rest of the world), mind, emotions and body (as matter and energy).
