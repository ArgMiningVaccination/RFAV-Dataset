The fragrance is heavenly and the lather is perfect. The soap does not deteriorate like other soaps I have used before this brand. I will never use anything else Been looking for something like this for years. I love the scent, the packaging was beautiful and the quality is beyond compare. I've found my go-to company for bath and body care. Absolutely love the soap, the smell, the consistency, and the feel on my skin is just wonderful. Thank you! We're so glad you love our Clay Soap Bars Michelle I love this product so much. My skin just drinks it up and feels so supple and soft. It leaves my skin feeling so moisturized without feeling greasy and I love that I'm putting all natural ingredients on my skin. We are so happy when our customers are happy! Thank you Erika I have dehydrated skin and other butter products have left my skin feeling greasy and heavy. This spreads evenly and my skin stays hydrated all day.
