You have important questions about vaccine safety for you and your baby. Here is the most up-to-date information from medical experts. COVID-19 Disease Pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 infection and disease. COVID-19 may increase the risk of unhealthy pregnancy outcomes for babies, including being born too early. COVID-19 vaccines are extremely effective in preventing death, serious illness, and hospitalization from COVID-19. Fertility: There is zero evidence that fertility problems for men or women are a side effect from COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnancy: Pregnant women were not specifically included in pre-authorization clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines. However, more than 77,000 pregnant women have registered in the V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker for ongoing safety monitoring. No safety concerns have been identified. There are also ongoing clinical studies with pregnant women. We know from recent studies that protective antibodies can be passed to the fetus in pregnant women after vaccination. Breastfeeding: When you get vaccinated, the antibodies made by your body can be passed through breastmilk and help protect your child from the virus. Making A Decision: If you have questions about COVID-19 vaccination, talking to your healthcare provider may help you make an informed decision, but is not required. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) , the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and World Health Organization agree that the COVID-19 vaccines should be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding individuals who are eligible for vaccination. You do not need to take a pregnancy test before getting the vaccine. Providers should not withhold vaccine from people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
