Which variants are circulating now? The most dominant variant of COVID-19 circulating throughout the United States as of early December 2022 is Omicron, specifically BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html). The original strand of COVID-19 that surfaced in March 2020 in the United States is called Alpha, and although it and other variants such as Delta are still circulating, the main Variant of Concern (VOC) is Omicron. Omicron is more contagious and transmissible than the earlier COVID-19 variants. It spreads more easily and its variants are more capable of bypassing the immune system. Those infected with an Omicron variant of COVID-19 are more likely to infect others due to its highly infectious nature. 2. What does the new booster protect me from? The [new bivalent booster](/en/healthu/2022/09/14/understanding-the-new-omicron-boosters-do-i-need-one) is effective against the original Alpha strain of COVID and the two most common Omicron variants, BA.4 and BA.5. When you get the new booster shot, the antibodies in your bloodstream from previous vaccinations are amplified and work to protect you from getting infected with COVID-19. For high risk individuals such older adults (ages 50 and up), those with chronic illness, and those with immunosuppression should consider getting the bivalent booster to protect themselves from severe infections of COVID-19. If you want to know when is the right time to get your booster depending on your age, existing health conditions, or history of COVID-19 infection, check the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). 3. What are the symptoms to look out for? The symptoms for the Omicron variant are similar to the symptoms of previous COVID-19 variants, such as fever, cough and fatigue. Vaccination status, other health conditions, age, and a history of prior infection can affect the severity of the virus when infected with the Omicron variant. [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/index.html), there are less cases of severe illness and death as a result of COVID-19 for those infected with the Omicron variant. 4. What are the treatments for COVID-19 now? Antiviral treatments and monoclonal antibodies have been authorized by the FDA to treat cases of COVID-19. While antiviral treatment can help to prevent severe illness and death by stopping the virus from multiplying in the body, monoclonal antibodies can help to treat mild to moderate cases in people who are more likely to develop worsening symptoms and get more sick. Treatments for COVID-19 must be started within days of your first symptoms in order to be effective. Antiviral treatments have proven to be effective in fighting Omicron, and some monoclonal antibody treatments are effective as well. If you are sick with COVID-19, talk with your health care provider about which treatment might be most effective for you. Treatments for COVID-19 can vary depending on how sick you are. 5. How can I protect myself from getting sick this holiday season? Staying up to date with your influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations can help to protect you and your family from getting sick during the holiday season. If you are a high risk individual, consider masking in crowded indoor areas. \"At this point fewer people are developing severe cases of COVID-19, so it is becoming an important individual decision to judge one's own risk of getting sick,\" says Dr. Varga. Practicing basic health habits can also help to boost your immune system as well, according to Dr. Varga, including: - Spending time outdoors - Eating a balanced diet - Staying home if you feel sick - Getting enough rest and sleep - Staying hydrated throughout the day Next Steps & Resources: - Our source: Daniel Varga, M.D. - To make an appointment with a health care provider near you, call [800-822-8905](tel: 800-822-8905)or visit [our website](https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/search?primary_care=Primary+Care+Providers&sort=networks%2Crelevance&_ga=2.35596584.8602831.1661370315-588859578.1654113522&_gac=1.255327482.1659470033.Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCYOsEG7yPX3n-5ikWxzEe5yylkA3YAaHwvRf9y6kAP-ocjLLXGjCnUaAqEoEALw_wcB).
