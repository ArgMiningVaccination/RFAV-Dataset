Mix the content of one sachet into ~170 ml of hot water. All our coffees can be combined and used daily. We recommend 1 to 2 coffees per day (i.e. 500mg - 1000mg of extracts). Does it taste like regular coffee? Yes! We put a lot of efforts in sourcing the best quality ingredients and the best coffee to offer a delicious coffee packed with powerful benefits. You will not taste the difference, only the delicious aromas of our Organic and Fairtrade coffee. What are the bioactive compounds present in your products? We enhance all our coffees with powerful adaptogenic plants & mushrooms, carefully selected for their outstanding properties, quality and bioactive compounds content. We use highly concentrated mushroom extracts that have been tested for their bioactive compounds content and offer a minimum of 30% polysaccharides (the bioactive compounds responsible for most of their medicinal properties). How many coffees per day should I take? Can I combine different adaptogenic coffee blends? All of our coffees can be combined perfectly. We recommend 1 to 2 coffees per day (equivalent to 500mg or 1000mg of extracts). What is the best time of day to have adaptogenic coffee? Our adaptogenic coffees can be consumed all day and every day, however we recommend that you consume them in the morning or early afternoon. Are you certified organic? Yes! All of our products are certified organic and 100% natural in order to guarantee a total transparency on our ingredients' quality. We also test our powders and extracts for any presence of heavy metals, molds, pesticides and other potential disruptors. What is the difference between medicinal mushrooms powder and extract? There is a significant difference between powder and extract: - The extract results from an extraction which allows to obtain 4 to 15 times more bioactive compounds depending on the medicinal mushrooms. During the process, some fibers are lost, but other active ingredients are released: the polysaccharides. It is precisely these bioactive compounds that have been shown to have the most benefits on the body and that contribute the most to the medicinal properties of our functional mushrooms. The extracts are often consumed in smaller quantities and exhibit more powerful and rapid effects. - The powder comes from the whole mushroom which is dried and then grounded. This process keeps the fibers, vitamins and minerals intact since the drying process is done at moderate temperature (less than 40\u00b0). This is often the preferred form for consumers looking for a detoxifying effect. Can I consume So Mush Organic products during breastfeeding and pregnancy?
