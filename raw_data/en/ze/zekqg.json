It is extremely porous, and forms in conditions that remove nearly all gasses and resins from the stock material. Biochar itself is at least as old as the ancient Amazonian civilizations. Oil-independent people used it to enrich their soils, supporting incredible populations on relatively small plots of land. Because of the way biochar works, these Amazonian gardens and similar sites in Asia continue to be highly fertile long after the indigenous people have moved on. Mark Baker will explain what biochar is, how it works as a soil amendment, how it helps the environment, and more. Ellen F. Bench, DHom, HMC Family Empowerment Monday 9:00-12:00 Homeopathy for you and your family is empowering and facilitating. In addition to explaining the basics of homeopathy (doses and potencies), Ellen will go over the top 48 remedies that she has put together in the Family Kit I, explaining their uses in the home for emergency and acute situations minimizing the needs for meds and antibiotics. Child Immunization Options Monday 1:00-4:00 Why are juvenile diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, asthma and autoimmune disorders on the rise? Why do your children have dark circles, are chronically snotty and can't focus? Join us for information on homeopathic options that are safe and effective. Learn about protection available for: whooping cough, diphtheria, measles, mumps, tetanus, chicken pox, hepatitis, and polio, without the known side effects of conventional vaccines. You have options, come learn about them in a 2\u00bd-hour empowering, interactive presentation. Information packet included. Dean Bonlie, DDS Miracles of Magnetism Friday 8:00-10:00 pm Did you know that magnetism is necessary for life? Our research, and others, indicates it is! Did you know that magnetism reduces free radicals in the body? This slows aging. We will discuss the mechanism of action of magnetism on human tissue and how important the right type is. The different effect of bipolar or unidirectional fields on the body will be shown. Heavy metal toxicity has become a big issue. You will learn the best protocol known to chelate them out of the brain and body. Toxic metals are the major cause for fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, MS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and stroke. Hear recent research proving that being in stronger magnetic field will increase ATP production and enhanced gene expression. Many case studies will be presented. Hilary Boynton (with Mandy Lee) Basic Traditional Cooking - \"COOLKING\" Monday 9:00-4:00 Introducing \"COOLKING\" with super food moms: real recipes made fun and delicious from moms who do it every day. We're bringing 'cool' back to grandma-style cooking. We gotta make it fun or, let's face it, you ain't gonna do it! These two moms have five kids-each!-who've battled health issues from cancer to eczema and autism to epilepsy. So let's just say, we get it! We have been in the trenches and came through with stronger hearts, open minds, and some great strategies for having FUN. In this class we'll enjoy a relaxed and informative session reviewing traditional cooking techniques from America while integrating the complementary methods from around the world, all the while keeping it functionally simple. From homemade bone broth made easy, to kefir, to butter and ghee, to almond and coconut milks, to yummy treats and family dinners, we will tackle a wide range of deliciousness. Oh, and there will be a \"fizztacular\" finale that will add a whole new perspective to your whole and healthy lifestyle! Reclaiming our kitchens is rejuvenating and liberating as traditional methods of cooking are healing to the mind, body and soul! But there is a caveat: if your gut is leaky and your tank is not clean, no matter what you eat, it can backfire. Stressing the importance of a \"clean fish tank\", a \"sealed gut\" and what we have found to be the ULTIMATE SECRET to gaining homeostasis in the body, will be revealed and discussed while together we \"stir the pot\" and \"break bread\"...yes we said bread! At the end of this class, cooking will no longer seem like a chore. It's a platform for a spectacular life. After all, life is good and full of opportunity, so let's live it that way! Natasha Campbell-McBride, MD, PhD Gut and Psychology Syndrome Friday 10:00-5:00 Dr. Campbell-McBride will be talking about GAP Syndrome or GAPS, which stands for Gut and Psychology/Gut and Physiology Syndrome. In addition to the well published psychological and neurological disorders, there will be a wealth of information on autoimmune problems, allergies, asthma, eczema, MS, chronic fatigue syndrome, ME, fibromyalgia, arthritis, diabetes type one, chronic cystitis, chronic skin problems and many other physical conditions. New information on GAPS for those familiar with Dr. Natasha's work will be presented and discussed. This seminar is a must for both those learning about GAPS for the first time and those who are already experienced. This seminar contains information used in the recent GAPS Practitioner Certification Courses. Building a Strong Immune System against Lyme and Other Diseases Sunday 10:30-11:50 Margaret (Peg) Coleman Risk Beyond Numbers: Understanding Data, Gaps, and Assumptions Bridging Them Monday 1:15-2:30 Risk practitioners who contributed to the first issue of the technical journal Risk Analysis in 1981 recognized that risk is not a number, but a set of estimates with attendant uncertainty. Though the concept of uncertainty (what we don't know) is easy to understand, quantifying uncertainty is complex, particularly because available scientific data are nearly always incomplete and ambiguous. Risk cannot generally (if ever) be calculated directly from the data available, and gaps in knowledge require use of assumptions to bridge data gaps. Biases may be imbedded in the selection of assumptions to bridge the gaps for risk assessments, rather than communicated transparently and objectively. Three simple questions are essential to properly frame communications of risk to all stakeholders, including not only technical and scientific experts, but especially the general public affected by decisions based on the risk assessment. These three questions (1. What can go wrong?; 2. How likely is it?; and 3. What are the consequences?) apply to a set of possible scenarios that might describe future hypothetical exposures, potential adverse effects, and costs and benefits associated with the set of scenarios selected by the risk assessment team or their managers. The professional organization Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) who publish the journal Risk Analysis advocate cycles of analysis and deliberation (analytic-deliberative process) to ensure that the public is appropriately engaged in discourse regarding the assumptions that may bias risk estimates, particularly when disagreements exist about the nature and magnitude of risk. This session focuses on the exercise of analytic-deliberative process for the controversial assessments of risk for consumers of certified raw milk and pasteurized milk. Overviews of exposure assessment and dose-response assessment emphasize the knowledge gaps and the impact of assumptions that may bias existing microbial risk assessments for listeriosis in milk consumers. The available listeriosis risk assessments do not yet incorporate expanding knowledge of the healthy human microbiomes. Two concepts from the Human Microbiome Project that influence microbial risk, colonization resistance and dysbiosis, are introduced. These concepts challenge old dogma about microbial contributions to human health and disease that may mislead unwary stakeholders of risk assessments. Mary Cordaro Your Home as Safe Haven: Practical Ways to Protect Yourself from Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Sunday 4:00-5:20 Manmade electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has become an ubiquitous, invisible pollutant in our lives. Often referred to as \"electro-pollution,\" many of us are completely unaware of the sea of toxic, man-made electromagnetic radiation around us, day and night, generated by a host of wired and wireless devices indoors and cell towers, base stations and antennas outdoors. While the majority of studies claiming there is nothing to worry about are industry-funded and poorly designed, thousands of independent studies show a clear cause for concern and the need for well-funded, large, independent research. For the health-minded, independent environmental scientists, researchers and technical EMR professionals are promoting a move toward better awareness about the possible adverse health effects of manmade EMR, including effects on the developing fetus and small children. Learn how to lower your \"EMF body burden\", create a measurably EMR-safe environment, and why it is essential for long term health. Tom Cowan, MD Ask the Practitioner Panel Friday 8:00-10:00 pm We are excited to offer a panel of three highly qualified practitioners. Combined, they have sixty years of experience using a wide variety of treatments. The panel includes Tom Cowan, MD, Kim Schuette, CN and Philip Weeks, LAc, ND. First each practitioner will briefly describe their treatment philosophy. Next, the audience can ask questions regarding treatments for various illnesses as well as how food is incorporated into treatments. Please ask questions of a general nature; this is not a place for individual medical advice or your personal medical history. The Extraordinary Properties of Water Sunday 9:00- 10:20 This talk covers some of the extraordinary properties of water and how this relates to the circulation and the heart. The properties of water also impact other health conditions such as cancer. The health benefits of deuterium-depleted water will be discussed. Hannah Crum Continuous Kombucha (with Both Traditional and Jun Scoby) Friday 3:30-5:00 With almost a decade of brewing experience, John and Hannah will cover the basics of preparing both types of kombucha, the aceto-dominate kombucha and the variant lacto-dominate Jun variety, both using the continuous, traditional method of preparation. The Science of Kombucha Friday 8:00-10:00 pm Hannah and Alex of Kombucha Kamp offer a journey beyond the myths as they explore and explain the large body of kombucha research generated over the last one hundred fifty years; from the first discovery of the culture and its constituents, to the interplay of the many processes involved in tea and sugar fermentation all the way through modern day in vitro and in vivo studies, including newly published papers. Kombucha's anecdotal history as wellness tonic will be examined in light of the specific components present after fermentation, from acids to enzymes to polyphenols and more, a preview of their forthcoming book (Storey Publishing 2016). This extensive research is distilled into a lively conversation that also dispels common \"myth-understandings\" and provides an insider's look at this flexible, funky ferment that has captured so many imaginations and taste buds the world over! Tom DiGuiseppe, PhD Most Americans Drink Treated Sewage... Are You One of Them? Sunday 10:30-11:50 We are all familiar with water, that simple H2O molecule that is as ubiquitous a substance as there any on earth. We all drink it, shower in it, swim in it, prepare meals with it and even flush with it. In fact, many of us are actually drinking treated sewage! You really need to know what is lurking in your water. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by water reports sent to you that have been prepared by those treating your water! In this presentation, Norm LeMoine will provide a global and historical perspective on water and its uniqueness. He will outline how water gets contaminated, the major challenges your water faces and the impact water toxins have on our lifestyle and wellbeing. Tom DiGiuseppe will then focus on the technological solutions available to address your water concerns regardless of the challenges, as he looks in depth at several case studies. Sally Fallon Morell Seminar on Traditional Diets Friday 9:00-5:00 Animal fats, properly prepared whole grains, enzyme-enriched foods and nourishing bone broths kept our ancestors healthy. Sally Fallon Morell, author of Nourishing Traditions, explains why these are vital factors for maintaining good health today. Beginning with a presentation of Dr. Weston Price's unforgettable photographs of healthy traditional peoples, Ms. Fallon Morell explains the underlying factors in a variety of traditional diets, which conferred beauty, strength and complete freedom from disease on so-called primitive populations. Then she presents a step-by-step plan to put nourishing traditional foods\u2014foods that your family will actually eat\u2014back into your diet, including easy breakfast cereals, soups, sauces, snack foods, high-enzyme condiments and soft drinks that are actually good for you. Learn about: - Butter, the number one health food; - The vital role of high-cholesterol foods; - Why lowfat and vegan diets don't work; - The amazing powers of raw whole milk from pasture-fed cows; - The dangers of modern soy foods and soy infant formula; - The conspiracy to promote vegetable oils and hydrogenated fats; - Foods that help babies grow up smart and strong; - Old-fashioned foods that give limitless energy and vibrant health; and, - The unfortunate consequences of modern farming methods. This seminar is highly recommended for both laymen and health professionals new to the work of the Weston A. Price Foundation and makes an excellent introduction to the main conference speakers. - Part I: Introduction to the work of Dr. Price and discussion of the underlying characteristics of healthy traditional diets. - Part II: Fats and oils in traditional diets. Learn about the basics of lipid biochemistry and how to choose good fats and avoid the bad. - Part III: How to change your diet for the better. Practical advice for busy parents including easy recipes for snacks, soups, breakfasts, desserts and enzyme-enriched beverages and condiments. Introduction to the Work of Weston A. Price Saturday 9:00-9:30 A brief overview of the work of Dr. Price appropriate for those new to his work and a good refresher for those who are familiar with it. The Fat Soluble Activators Saturday 3:15-4:30 Weston A. Price identified the vitamins found exclusively in animal fats as vital to health. This lecture explores the scientific validation for traditional foodways that focused on foods rich in these vitamins and shares current testing by WAPF on sources of the fat-soluble activators. Why Raw Milk Monday 9:15-10:30 Raw milk confers many health benefits. This talk delineates the benefits to bones, teeth, immunity, respiratory health, growth, detoxification and even mental health conferred by whole unpasteurized milk, citing studies going back one hundred years and up to the present day. Season Johnson A Cancer Diagnosis for Your Child\u2014What to Do? Friday 8:00-10:00 pm Using real food, detox and essential oils to maintain the integrity of our health while undergoing cancer treatment. Chris Kerston - with Allan Savory and Spencer Smith Holistic Management: Promoting the Restoration of Grasslands to Save Civilization Friday 1:30-3:00 Ultimately, the only wealth that can sustain any community, economy or nation is derived from the photosynthetic process\u2014green plants growing on regenerating soil. Allan Savory One-third of the earth's surface is grasslands. 70% of the grasslands have been degraded. Loss of grasslands leads to climate change, floods, draughts, famines and worldwide poverty. The Savory Institute's mission is to promote large-scale restoration of the world's grasslands through Holistic Management, where holistic managers implement Holistic Planned Grazing to properly manage livestock \u2014 mimicking the predator/prey relationships in which these environments evolved. Its strategy is three-fold: to demonstrate results in diverse contexts; to equip and empower people and share our experiences in learning and achieving success; and to pave the way for a global movement to take off. With an estimated 45 million acres already managed holistically, the institute is on the brink of affecting major change at the landscape level with a strategy that seeks to influence two billion acres by 2025 through the establishment of 100 Hubs, which provide holistic management training and support. Come to this all-day seminar by Chris and Allan Savory to learn why grasslands aren't just important to ranchers, but have a wide-ranging effect on the greater community. Agriculture is the foundation of civilization and any stable economy. Our grasslands can be the genesis of an incredibly strong economy, more self-sufficient communities, and the basis of miraculously renewable food production. Min Kim Redeeming Bread: How to Make Einkorn Sourdough Friday 1:30-3:00 Learn how to hand-craft sourdough bread that has been fermented for forty-two hours. This bread is not overly sour and has a light and airy texture. This is a no-knead technique that anyone can do at home to produce beautiful artisan bread. Alex LaGory The Science of Kombucha Friday 8:00-10:00 pm Hannah and Alex of Kombucha Kamp offer a journey beyond the myths as they explore and explain the large body of kombucha research generated over the last 150 years; from the first discovery of the culture and its constituents, to the interplay of the many processes involved in tea and sugar fermentation all the way through modern day in vitro and in vivo studies, including newly published papers. Kombucha's anecdotal history as a wellness tonic will be examined in light of the specific components present after fermentation, from acids to enzymes to polyphenols and more, a preview of their forthcoming book (Storey Publishing 2016). This extensive research is distilled into a lively conversation that also dispels common \"myth-understandings\" and provides an insider's look at this flexible, funky ferment that has captured so many imaginations and taste buds the world over!

His good friend and colleague, Tom DiGiuseppe will then focus on the technological solutions available to address your water concerns regardless of the challenges, as he looks in depth at several case studies. Celeste Longacre How to Have a Totally Organic Garden Saturday 1:45-3:00 Celeste will show a PowerPoint presentation on how to grow a beautiful garden. With over 100 color pictures designed to provide insights and how-to information on soil preparation, planting, weeding, thinning and harvesting, this gives participants the tools that they need to plant and maintain a garden. Pictures are more specific than just words. What better way is there to take control of our eating than by growing some of our own food? We can give our plants additional soil amenities to provide extra nutrients for ourselves and our families. We can stay grounded by handling and caring for our plants. And the flavor! Nothing beats homegrown fruits and vegetables. Plus, the health benefits are astronomical. So give your family the edge for health\u2014grow your own. Because health, after all, is the greatest wealth. Elaina Luther Culturing a \"Real Food\" Fermentation Business Friday 10:00-12:00 Take a visual journey and imagine seeing yourself at the forefront of an exciting real food movement! In this presentation you will glean some insights as well as practical tools for starting your own business. The presentation will conclude with a question and answer panel of successful real food entrepreneurs offering various business models for you to contemplate. Whether you are just thinking of starting your own business or have already taken the plunge, come get inspired and join the expansion of traditional and fermented foods! Leslie Manookian, MLC Hom The Greater Good: Another Look at Vaccines (Followed by Q&A) Friday 8:00-10:00 pm Vaccines are one of the hottest topics today. In a climate where one hundred thirty-four cases of measles can set off a global media frenzy unleashing an epidemic of fear and the introduction of legislation across the U.S. and the rest of the globe curtailing our rights and freedoms pertaining to vaccination, it is now more important than ever to understand the truth about vaccines, the science relating to them, and the politics surrounding them. Join the lively and illuminating discussion after viewing the film. For tickets go to [https://www.ptfassociates.com/wise/greatergood.html](https://www.ptfassociates.com/wise/greatergood.html) Jim Marlowe Understanding Your Own Blood Test Results Saturday 9:00-12:15 A presentation to help empower you to have a basic understanding of how to decode and interpret standard-of-care blood tests, such as the comprehensive metabolic panel (or CMP) or chemistry panel, the lipid panel, and the complete blood count (or CBC) with differential. Attention will also be given to the value of some additional labs such as: insulin, leptin, TSH, T4, T3, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, ESR or sed rate, magnesium, zinc and ferritin. All of the labs will be explained in relation to our nutrition and other fundamental influences on our health. (Attendees are encouraged to bring a copy of their most recent blood tests.) Chris Masterjohn, PhD The Biological Function of Saturated Fats Saturday 9:30-10:45 Saturated fat has long been demonized as the energy source most likely to raise \"bad cholesterol\" and thereby contribute to heart disease. Only recently is this beginning to change in the mainstream. Despite this, the disciplines of biochemistry and of cellular and molecular biology have been elucidating the positive and essential biological functions of saturated fatty acids for decades. Among these are included the following: regulating the fluidity of cellular membranes, anchoring proteins to membranes, and ensuring that proteins properly interact with one another and thus that proper communication takes place within and between cells. A number of specific saturated fatty acids also provide energy in unique ways that aid in improving body composition and intestinal health. Saturated fats, in fact, are so important that we synthesize many of them in large amounts from carbohydrate. This talk will explore the specific biological roles of saturated fats and conclude by discussing the health implications that these rules suggest for consuming saturated fat in the diet. Resolving Inflammation and Creating Food Tolerance with Animal Fats: Arachidonic Acid as the Unsung Hero Saturday 1:45-3:00 Arachidonic acid has long been demonized as a source of inflammation. It is true that arachidonic acid is needed to initiate inflammation, but inflammation is an essential and important process. What has gone unrecognized until recently, however, is that arachidonic acid is also necessary to resolve inflammation. A failure to actively resolve inflammation, rather than continuous stimulation of inflammation, may underlie many cases of chronic inflammation. Furthermore, arachidonic acid is necessary for the immune system to actively recognize food as safe and thereby create food tolerance. The perception that the resolution of inflammation and tolerance to foods are passive states characterized only by the absence of inflammation and intolerance stands in the way of recognizing arachidonic acid as necessary for the active creation of these states of health. Vitamin A is also necessary to create tolerance to foods, and the large decreases in the intakes of vitamin A and arachidonic acid over the last half-century may have played a role in the increase in food intolerances. Furthermore, while the omega-3 fatty acid DHA synergizes with arachidonic acid to resolve inflammation, the omega-3 fatty acid EPA can, in excess, like many \"anti-inflammatory\" drugs, interfere with arachidonic acid metabolism. This raises the possibility that high-dose fish oil and many \"anti-inflammatory\" drugs could, in some contexts, promote the development of food intolerances. Thus, understanding how to balance these nutrients and limit the use of these drugs is critical to resolving inflammation and creating food tolerance. Methylation Nutrients: Balancing the Diet Targeting the Needs of the Individual Sunday 1:30-2:50 Methylation is the process of adding single carbon units to cellular molecules in order to synthesize molecules or regulate them. It is a ubiquitous process that plays a diverse array of roles in physical, emotional, and mental health. Optimizing methylation is not only about getting enough of certain nutrients or getting them in the right forms, but is also about getting them in the right balance and in a way that is right for the genetics and health status of each individual. \"Health status\" includes one of the most commonly neglected aspects of the methylation process, the need to maintain a high metabolic rate. This talk explores the practical aspects of achieving this balance and correctly targeting the needs of the individual. Mark McAfee Behind the Scenes: What's Really Happening with Raw Milk in the USA? Monday 10:45-12:00 Hear the insider scope on what is really happening behind the closed doors for raw milk across the nation. Jaimen McMillan Moving Towards Wholeness Monday 9:00-4:00 This lively, participatory workshop will give direct experience of how to incorporate healthy movement that enliven, invigorate, and encourage wholeness into our everyday lives. Led by Jaimen McMillan, the founder of Spacial Dynamics, this course will enhance posture, ease, balance, and yes, even grace! This workshop is designed so that every participant, of any age, will come away with new concepts of the body and health, so that the participants can continue to re-create healing spaces for themselves long after the course has ended. Gerald P. McNeill, PhD The PHO Public Health Disaster - the Complete Story Saturday 11:00-12:15 About 50 years ago, a glut of soybean in the U.S. lead to the introduction of a new chemical process: \"partially hydrogenated oils\" (PHO). The process converts liquid oils into semi-solid shortenings that have the same texture as butter and other animal fats. The process is extremely versatile and many new textures were created, displacing butter and leading to a golden age in the baking and snack food industries. Eventually, nutrition science discovered that the main fat in PHO, trans fat, was ten times worse than saturated fat. On June 18th 2015 the FDA announced that PHO were no longer GRAS (generally recognized as safe). This presentation will discuss the events leading to the adoption of PHO, to a major decline in public health and finally a recovery with the elimination of trans fat from the food supply. Marty C. Michener, PhD Vaccines or Nutrition Sunday 10:30-11:50 In the U.S., vaccines are scheduled and promoted by the same federal agency charged by Congress to ensure their safety for the public. The GAO found this to be a conflict of interest, especially as Congress also in 1986 passed an unusual law indemnifying all vaccine manufacturers against citizen redress legal actions (VAERS). In 2009, Dr. S. Humphries, as a conscientious nephrologist in Portland, Maine, discovered the hospital policy was to administer flu vaccines to all adult patients of all ages, regardless of their wellness or of their acting physician's knowledge or approval. After seeing kidney failure in three patients, she began investigating the actual safety record of this and many other vaccines, resulting in her book with R. Bystrianyk, Dissolving Illusions, 2014. During the same period, Dr. Alex Vasquez has created a realistic approach to virus management, based on modern science understanding the complexity of most infections, to include endemic virus in the human genome and the role our microbiome and nutrition play in providing resistance (\"Antiviral Strategies and Immune Nutrition\", 2014). Cells, Tissue and Crystalline Water Sunday 1:30-2:50 Dr. Michener will elaborate on water and cell health. Dr. Gerald Pollack has recently demonstrated that water forms organized deep layers when faced against sulfonated surfaces, such as healthy cell membranes, much thicker than had been appreciated. This organized layer is electrically structured and is called the Exclusion Zone (EZ), as it excludes many solute molecules, as would ice. These in situ observations should not be confused with the \"vortex structured water\" now frequently sold with claims for undocumented health benefits. Water in tissues needs to be carefully investigated, and findings integrated with the physiology of cells, especially of membrane health, an increasingly common factor in degenerative pathologies. Drs. Stephanie Seneff and Robert Davidson have recently provided several highly analytical papers suggesting that deficiency in sulfate metabolism may affect membrane signaling properties as a common basis for nerve and muscle dysfunction. Denise Minger Death by Food Pyramid Sunday 4:00-5:20 Denise's health began to deteriorate after following a raw vegan diet. In an attempt to regain her health, she started to introduce animal products to her diet. As she regained her health, Denise began to question the claims of various health gurus and began doing research for herself. Denise will talk about how she regained her health, how to tell good science from bad science, and why we should question the advice of nutrition \"experts.\" John Moody Continuous Kombucha (with Both Traditional and Jun Scoby) Friday 3:30-5:00 With almost a decade of brewing experience, John and Hannah will cover the basics of preparing both types of kombucha, the aceto-dominate kombucha and the variant lacto-dominate Jun variety, both using the continuous, traditional method of preparation. Dirt Poor, Badly Bred and Improperly Prepared: Missing Nutrients in Modern Food Saturday 9:00-10:30 Changing to traditional foods is about more than just WHAT foods we eat, but HOW they are raised and prepared. Since the time of our grandparents and great-grandparents, foods have lost significant amounts of their nutritional value-anywhere from one third to three quarters of their vitamin and mineral content or more! This talk will explore the depth of these nutritional losses, their causes, and the ways we get truly paleo (nutrient-dense) foods back on our plates. Light, Temperature, Sound, and Sleep Understanding the Complex Interplay to Nourishing Rest Sunday 9:00-10:20 From dusk until dawn-and now long after-light helps define how we relate to the world around us. But light is more than just a means by which we see-it is a medicine to our bodies, a means to assist us in our work, and a master to be respected. This session will cover light's affects on our health, how technologies can help or harm us via their light, and how to use light as safely as possible in the modern world. Jorge Moreno, DO Natural Approaches to Lyme Disease Sunday 4:00-5:20 How do we heal? Our body knows how to heal. Let us support and foster healing in regards to Lyme Disease. Gerald Pollack, PhD Is Water Nature's Best Food? Sunday 1:30-2:50 We've learned that water has three phases: solid, liquid and vapor. But we have recently uncovered a fourth phase. This phase occurs next to water-loving (hydrophilic) surfaces. It is surprisingly extensive, projecting out from the surface by up to millions of molecular layers. And, its properties differ substantially from those of bulk water. This fourth phase is charged; and the water just beyond is oppositely charged, creating a battery that can produce energy. We found that light charges this battery. Thus, water can receive and process electromagnetic energy drawn from the environment in much the same way as plants. Absorbed electromagnetic (light) energy can then be exploited for performing work, including electrical and mechanical work. The energy-conversion framework implied above seems rich with possibilities. Not only does it provide an understanding of how water processes solar and other energies, but also it may provide a foundation for a simpler understanding of natural phenomena ranging from weather and green energy all the way to food and nutrition. Water is good for you! The presentation will cover the evidence for this surprisingly extensive phase of water, especially in your cells, and will consider its potentially broad implications for physics, chemistry, and biology, and particularly for health. For the award-winning book on this topic see: [ebnerandsons.com](http://ebnerandsons.com). Geri Quintero Qi Gong Morning Movement Sessions Saturday 6 am & Sunday 7 am Qi Gong is an integral part of traditional Chinese medicine which has been practiced for thousands of years to help strengthen organ systems, increase circulation, invigorate the brain, and relieve pain and stress. In some hospitals in China, Qi Gong is the main form of medicine. The term \"Qi Gong\" means literally \"moving life force energy with breath and intention.\" The morning sessions of Qi Gong will be gentle breathing and stretching movements that vitalize and awaken the body/mind/spirit. You will learn which exercises affect which organs, blood pressure, digestion, nervous system, etc. Wear comfortable clothing and socks. Normally done standing but may be done sitting. Beverly Rubik, PhD Heart Rate Variability: What Does it Reveal? Sunday 10:30-11:50 Heart rate variability (HRV) is a clinical test that gives a measure of the resilience and dynamic range of the heart and autonomic nervous system. It is used in holistic medicine to monitor stress and certain disease states and conditions. HRV measurements can predict the likelihood of a heart attack or other chronic illness. A variety of cases will be covered showing before and after various interventions, including yoga, qigong, meditation, phototherapy, nutritional supplementation, prescription drugs, cell phone use, and tobacco smoking. You will also learn how you can improve your heart rate variability and autonomic nervous system balance for increased vitality and wellness. Blood Microscopy: Studies on Nutrition and Exposure to Cell Phone Radiation Sunday 4:00-5:20 Dark-field microscopy of live blood shows the biological terrain, the \"soil\" or \"ground\" of the body, which is one important foundation of our health. The dark-field microscope provides exceptionally high contrast. The various factors seen in blood microscopy are related to one's nutritional status and exposure to electromagnetic radiation, including the radiation emitted by cell phones. Dr. Rubik will explain this type of blood analysis and how she uses it in research and education. She will show numerous photographs and explain how they reveal various aspects of health and disease, including blood congestion, nutritional deficiency, electromagnetic exposure, and degenerative disease. Allan Savory - Chris Kerston and Spencer Smith Holistic Management: Promoting the Restoration of Grasslands to Save Civilization Friday 10:00-12:00 Ultimately, the only wealth that can sustain any community, economy or nation is derived from the photosynthetic process\u2014green plants growing on regenerating soil.

Come to this all-day seminar by Chris and Allan Savory to learn why grasslands aren't just important to ranchers, but have a wide-ranging effect on the greater community. Agriculture is the foundation of civilization and any stable economy. Our grasslands can be the genesis of an incredibly strong economy, more self-sufficient communities, and the basis of miraculously renewable food production. Kim Schuette, CN, Cert. GAPS Pract. Simple Support for a Complicated Disease: Nutritional Support for Lyme Disease Sunday 9:00-10:20 Lyme disease continues to plague people in various regions around the world. It is a complex and controversial disease with a wide range of proposed theories regarding its origin and treatment recommendations. Join us as we look at its history and cause as well as Lyme disease diagnostic and treatment options. We will explore supportive therapies, including the Cowden Protocol, which can be implemented with any Lyme disease treatment plan. Stephanie Seneff, PhD Folic Acid Supplementation: Why This is Not a Good Idea Sunday 9:00-10:20 In 1998, the United States government initiated a mandate that wheat-based products should be fortified with folic acid. Today, 1seventeen years later, Europe has yet to implement a similar policy. Who is right? Anecdotally, people with gluten intolerance in the U.S. often find that they can eat bread in Europe without problems. Is the folic acid part of the reason? Folic acid is a synthetic, oxidized, unmethylated form of vitamin B9. It stresses the liver to convert it to methyl tetrahydrofolate. The chemistry is complex, but my research leads me to believe that excessive supplementation with folic acid is contributory to autism and Celiac disease, as well as other diseases currently on the rise in the U.S. It plays into the MTHFR folate trap and cerebral folate deficiency syndrome. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in the pervasive herbicide, Roundup, is complicit with folic acid. Please come and learn all about the intrigue and the science! Blood Flow and Cardiovascular Disease: A New Perspective Sunday 1:30-2:50 Cardiovascular disease is often portrayed as a passive system whereby excess fat and cholesterol in the blood accumulates like sludge in the arteries supplying the heart, eventually becoming so thick that they impede blood flow. The truth is the exact opposite: cholesterol is actively accumulated in atherosclerotic regions in order to assure adequate blood flow through the capillaries supplying the heart. Rather than a cholesterol excess problem, cardiovascular disease is a cholesterol sulfate deficiency problem. Sulfate is normally attached to sugar chains in the capillary walls, and is essential there for maintaining the water in the blood in a healthy state and for promoting smooth transit of red blood cells through the capillaries. Red blood cells also maintain their negative charge through their own supply of cholesterol sulfate, and this creates an electromagnetic field that promotes blood flow. When supplies run low, there is danger of a no-flow situation, and the plaque can rescue the heart from catastrophe in an emergency situation. Ironically, a heart attack itself can improve the vascular flow by renewing sulfate supplies from stored taurine. In this talk, Dr. Seneff will present her latest understanding of the science behind cardiovascular health and disease. Charlotte Smith Monday 2:45-4:00 Building, Managing, Marketing & Sustaining a Raw Milk Micro-Dairy My dynamic, engaging and emotional talk covers how and why my family started and maintains a successful raw milk dairy. Learn how raw milk benefits the small farm. Raw milk is a product that gets people to your farm each week so you can build from there offering other products for sale since you already have a captive audience who trusts you. This is the foundation of a thriving and sustainable small farm. Spencer Smith - Chris Kerston and Allan Savory Holistic Management: Promoting the Restoration of Grasslands to Save Civilization Friday 3:30-5:00 Ultimately, the only wealth that can sustain any community, economy or nation is derived from the photosynthetic process\u2014green plants growing on regenerating soil. Allan Savory One-third of the earth's surface is grasslands. 70% of the grasslands have been degraded. Loss of grasslands leads to climate change, floods, draughts, famines and worldwide poverty. The Savory Institute's mission is to promote large-scale restoration of the world's grasslands through Holistic Management, where holistic managers implement Holistic Planned Grazing to properly manage livestock \u2014 mimicking the predator/prey relationships in which these environments evolved. Its strategy is three-fold: to demonstrate results in diverse contexts; to equip and empower people and share our experiences in learning and achieving success; and to pave the way for a global movement to take off. With an estimated 45 million acres already managed holistically, the institute is on the brink of affecting major change at the landscape level with a strategy that seeks to influence two billion acres by 2025 through the establishment of 100 Hubs, which provide holistic management training and support. Come to this all-day seminar by Chris and Allan Savory to learn why grasslands aren't just important to ranchers, but have a wide-ranging effect on the greater community. Agriculture is the foundation of civilization and any stable economy. Our grasslands can be the genesis of an incredibly strong economy, more self-sufficient communities, and the basis of miraculously renewable food production. Kim Thompson Gentle Movement Friday 7:00-7:45 am and Saturday 7:00-7:45 Relax your body and prepare your mind for a day of learning. Wear clothing that allows you to move comfortably. All levels welcome. How to Sit Comfortably Friday 8:00-8:45 am Good sitting alignment makes you physically relaxed, mentally alert and able to engage with the world around you. We'll look at the role of the feet, knees, hips, spine and shoulders for sitting postures that are simultaneously dynamic and restful. Daily Activities: The Ease of Good Movement Sunday 7:00-7:45am Learning how to sit and stand well is nice. But what about cooking, gardening, moving boxes and milking cows? Try out some simple guidelines to maintain ease even when you're being productive. Sandra Van Gilder, DPT, FAFS Movement and Sleep: Myths and Truths that Affect our Health Sunday 1:30-2:50 Have you ever asked yourself, \"Should I sleep in or exercise in the morning?\" As life gets busy, sleep quality and quantity is often first to suffer. We don't realize the importance of sleep and the detrimental effects of lack of sleep. And just as we cannot reverse the effects of being sedentary, we cannot make up sleep to reverse the harmful effects of its lack. Most Americans don't sleep or move enough. Ironically, not enough sleep is associated with the same health issues, such heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases, as not enough movement. Please join Sandra Van Gilder as she explores the myths and truths about movement and sleep-the pillars (along with food) that support our health. And take home strategies and techniques to obtain the healthy habits and benefits of quality sleep and functional movements. Learn how to use sleep and movement to achieve a healthy, long life. Philip Weeks, LAc, ND Ancient Medicine and the Wheel of Health Friday 10:00-12:00 The Ancient Medicine talk discusses how ancient wisdom is now needed more than ever. Exploring concepts from Chinese, Ayurvedic and Greek medicine, Philip applies these principles to daily life and ways to strengthen the constitution through nutrient-dense foods, lifestyle support and natural medicine. The Wheel of Health model explores five key areas: Nourishment - how to support the body by consciously choosing what to put in it. Detoxification - encouraging the body to eliminate unwanted toxins. Lifestyle - choosing a way of life tailored to our body's needs. Activation - moving our body in a way that prevents stagnation. Mind and spirit - supporting the non-physical parts of our life. Detox and Fasting for Rejuvenation and Health Friday 1:30-3:00 Modern lifestyles overload our bodies with toxins from numerous sources - environmental toxins, pesticides, food additives - as well as waste from normal metabolic processes. As these toxins build up we are faced with poor health and a general lack of wellbeing. Cleansing is a powerful therapeutic tool which can effectively deal with harmful toxins and transform health. Philip has conducted thousands of cleanses with his patients and has a wealth of experience in the area of naturopathy and herbal medicine. Learn how to detox and safely cleanse the body. Guidelines on purifying the digestive system, bowel, kidneys, liver and gall bladder. Understand when cleansing is appropriate and when it's not. Introduction to fasting. Adrenal Health - How to Get Your Mojo Back! Friday 3:30-5:00 Many of us are exhausted as a result of our modern lifestyle and inadequate nutrition. Exploring concepts from traditional medicine Philip explains the route of modern 'syndromes' such as chronic fatigue and adrenal problems. This talk will cover: How to test for adrenal health including home testing. Interpretation of adrenal tests. Common symptoms associated with adrenal fatigue . Lifestyle strategies to restore your core level of health . Nutrition, herbal medicine and supplements. Donna Wild Noninvasive Testing for Nutritional Deficiencies Saturday 1:45-4:30 Taking responsibility for one's personal health is imperative to healing and maintaining an active lifestyle as one ages. This seminar focuses on ways to evaluate nutritional deficiencies based on noninvasive testing for physiological imbalances, which left untreated can lead to diseases in the body. The assessment techniques presented are simple to perform at home or in a doctor's office. Recommended nutrients, herbs and rich food sources to remedy these insufficiencies will be covered in detail, as well as other signs and symptoms related to each contributing deficiency. Louisa Williams, MS, DC, ND Dental Focal Infections: The Silent Killer Sunday 9:00-10:20 The ads have it wrong! Heart disease is not the silent killer; dental focal infections are. These chronic, relatively silent, focal areas generate bacteria that travel to the heart valves and other hospitable places (joints, kidneys, gut) where streptococci can thrive and proliferate. During this talk we will discuss how to diagnose a dental focus (impacted or incompletely extracted wisdom teeth, failed root canals, galvanic foci from mixed metals, etc.) and how to treat it most effectively and conservatively (homeopathy, nutrition, isopathy, etc.) as well as more radically when (cavitation) surgery is required. Those with suspected or diagnosed heart disease will learn that it is often much more efficacious and curative to clean up the cause\u2014the dental focus-rather than only treating the cardiac symptoms. (Questions are welcomed, and if we have time we will demonstrate a kinesiological challenge to the left ventricle and an effective treatment.) Wiser Nutritional and Dietary Choices through MRT Self-Testing Monday 9:00-4:00 Matrix Reflex Testing, or MRT, is a form of energetic testing-a method of measuring directly on the body what is good or bad for a particular patient. This \"in vivo\" type of testing has many advantages over laboratory, x-rays, CAT scans, MRIs, and so forth, since it is a very current assessment of what is affecting the body right now. After a thorough history and physical exam, as well as analysis of appropriate lab work and x-rays, holistic physicians and practitioners utilize energetic testing in order to obtain further diagnostic information. Also referred to as a \"body biofeedback enhanced physical exam,\" MRT and other energetic testing methods allow practitioners to prescribe more specific and effective treatments to their patients. However, MRT is not just a useful method for health professionals. It can be used by everyone for everyday decisions such as which (coconut, olive, etc.) oil tests best, which nutritional supplements should I take today, is that shampoo petrochemical-free or toxic, and am I allergic to that particular food? Thus, everyday decisions about diet, supplements, food sensitivities, and a multitude of other issues can be determined through the use of MRT. In this one-day workshop that includes lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on participant practice periods, you will learn how to use MRT for self-testing. Using this self-testing method can help empower you to make wiser nutritional and dietary decisions, and therefore gain the increased self-understanding that communicating directly with your body can bestow. Will Winter, DVM How To Put NUTRIENT DENSITY Back Into Meat, Milk and Eggs\u2014-We Have Gone from Aurochs to Shmoos Saturday 10:45-12:15 We have come a long ways from Dr. Price's time, when an egg was still an egg was an egg. But now, after 100 years of erosion and topsoil mining all across America, there isn't the degree of mineral density coming into the plants that would be needed to create nutrient-dense meat, milk and eggs properly. Even most of our wild game has lost their indigenous access to essential nutrients; deer living anywhere near farms are basically GMO-corn-fed and therefore disease-ridden, instinct-deprived and sloppy fat! Over 95% of our noble bison are finished in GMO corn feedlots. On top of soil loss, one must add the problems and deficiencies associated with the entire system of CAFO-raised animals, who spent their entire lives with little or no exercise, on wet concrete with no access to sunlight, fresh air or real plants. We now have chickens that mature in eight weeks, hogs in six months, and dairy cows that can live no longer than 44 months. So-called scientists have created livestock that are bred for startling growth, ignorant weight gain and no brains. No wonder people are getting fatter, dumber, sicker and easier to lead around. But it's a new day. We start now from the soil up, creating organic matter-rich, heavily mineralized, pollution-free and biologically-alive soil. We can create biodiverse plant species plantings, as well as fully-nourished and completely drug-free livestock breeds that radiate the deep flavor, color, texture and nutritional density that was common a hundred of years ago. Applying all this true science as well as all this ancient wisdom we can recreate a world of wholesome food that can allow us to raise intelligent, immune-strong, fertile and beautiful children, plus we can save the planet while we are doing it! What's wrong with that? Tiffany Wright, PhD Can FOOD Be Addictive? As Addictive as Cocaine? Cigarettes? Alcohol? Sunday 10:30-11:50 Food addiction is real. It is as real as cocaine or alcohol addiction. Food, namely sugar and flour, affects the brain and the pleasure centers of the brain in exactly the same way as drugs. But addiction has two components, physical and mental. Sugar and flour are physically addictive at a chemical and cellular level, but you also have a system of neural pathways that represent learned associations, habits and reactions to stress and life. The neural pathways in your brain develop according to what you have done in the past, making breaking a habit difficult. To combat this process, new neural pathways must be created and old pathways eliminated. Part One of the Skinny Coach's two-part workshop will present scientific evidence demonstrating that sugar is an addictive substance affecting the opioid and dopamine pathways and how this leads to addiction.
