INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES.In addition to the provider enrollment agreement, each claim s u bmitted by a hospital constitutes an agreement by which the hospital agrees to accept and abide by the Depart ment's rules. Only a Medicare certified hospital, licensed by the state in which it operates, may enroll in the Idaho Medicaid program. Ho spitals not participating as a Medicaid swing-bed provider, which are licensed for long-term care or as a specialty hospital which provides a nursing home level of care, will be reimbursed as a nursing facility. Hospitals not eligible for enrollment which render emergency care will be paid rates established in these rules. (3-30-07) 405. INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT.Under the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act, in reimbursing hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospital charges or the reasonable cost of inpatient services in accordance with the procedures Archive Archive 2013IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfare Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 41 detailed under this Section of rule. The upper limits obse rved by the Department in reimbursing each individual hospital must not exceed the payment that would be determin ed as a reasonable cost unde r the policies, definitions and procedures observed under Medicare (Title XVIII) principles of cost reimbursement. (3-30-07) 01. Exemption of New Hospitals . A hospital that has operated as the type of facility for which it is certified (or the equivalent thereof) under present and previous ownership for less than three (3) full years will be paid in accordance with the Title XVIII principles of reasonable cost reimbursement, including those provisions applicable to new providers for the carryover and recovery of unr eimbursed costs, in accordance with 42 CFR Section 413.64. (3-30-07) 02. Medicaid Inpatient Operating Cost Limits . The following describe the determination of inpatient operating cost limits. (3-30-07) a. Medicaid Cost Limits for Dates of Service Prior to a Current Year. The reimbursable reasonable costs for services rendered prior to the beginning of the principal year, but included as prior period claims in a subsequent period's cost report, will be subject to the sa me operating cost limits as the claims under settlement. (3-30-07) b. Application of the Medicaid Cost Limit. In the de termination of a hospital's reasonable costs for inpatient services rendered after the effective date of a pr incipal year, a Hospital Infla tion Index, computed for each hospital's fiscal year end, will be ap plied to the operating costs, excluding capital costs and other allowable costs as defined for the principal year and adju sted on a per diem basis for each subseq uent year under the Hospital Inflation Index. (3-30-07) i. Each inpatient routine service cost center, as reported in the finalized pr incipal year end Medicare cost report, will be segregated in the Medicaid cost limit calculation and assigned a share of total Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs. The prorated ancillary costs will be determined by the ratio of each Medicaid routine cost center's reported costs to total Medicaid inpatient routine service costs in the principal year. (3-30-07) ii. Each routine cost center's total Medicaid routine service costs plus the assigned share of Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs of the principal year will be divided by the related Medicaid patient days to identify the total costs per diem in the principal year. (3-30-07) (1) The related inpatient routine service cost cente r's per diem capital and graduate medical education costs plus the prorated share of inpatient ancillary capital costs will be subtracted from the per diem amount identified in Subsection 405.02.b.ii. of this rule to identify each inpatient routine service cost center per diem cost limit in the principal year. (3-30-07) (2) If a provider did not have any Medicaid inpatient utilization or render any Medicaid inpatient services in an individual inpatient routine service cost cen ter in the fiscal year serving as the principal year, the principal year for only those routine cost centers without utilization in the provider's principal year will be appropriately calculated using the information available in the next subsequent year in which Medicaid utilization occurred. (3-30-07) iii. Each routine cost center's cost per diem for the principal year will be multiplied by the Hospital Inflation Index for each subse quent fiscal year. (3-30-07) iv. The sum of the per diem cost limits for the Me dicaid inpatient routine service cost centers of a hospital during the principal year, as adjusted by the Hospital Inflation Index, will be the Medicaid cost limit for operating costs in the current year. (3-30-07) (1) At the date of final settlement, reimbursement of the Medicaid current year inpatient routine cost centers plus the assigned ancillary costs will be limited to the total per diem operating costs as adjusted for each subsequent fiscal year after the principal year through the current year by the Hospital Inflation Cost Index.(3-30-07) (2) Providers will be notified of the estimated inflation index periodically or Hospital Inflation Index (CMS Market Basket Index) prior to final settlement only upon written request. (3-30-07) Archive Archive 2013IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfare Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 42 03. Adjustments to the Medicaid Cost Limit. A hospital's request for review by the Department concerning an adjustment to or exemp tion from the cost limits imposed under the provisions set forth in Section 405 of this chapter of rules, must be granted under the following circumstances: (3-30-07) a. Adjustments. Because of Extraordinary Circ umstances. Where a provider's costs exceed the Medicaid limit due to extraordinary circumstances beyond th e control of the provider, the provider can request an adjustment to the cost limit to the extent the provider proves such higher costs re sult from the extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, increased costs attributable to strikes, fires, earthquake, flood, or similar, unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects. (3-30-07) b. Reimbursement to Public Hospitals. A Public Hospital that provides services free or at a nominal charge, which is less than, or equal to fifty percent (50%) of its total allowable costs, will be reimbursed at the same rate that would be used if the hospital's charges were equal to, or greater than, its costs. (3-30-07) c. Adjustment to Cost Limits. A hospital is entitled to a reasonable increase in its Medicaid Cost limits if the hospital shows that its per diem costs of provid ing services have increased due to increases in case- mix, the adoption of new or changed services, the discontinuatio n of services or decrease in average length of stay for Medicaid inpatients since the principal year. Any hospital making such showing is entitled to an increase commensurate with the increase in per diem costs. (3-30-07) i. The Medicaid operating cost limit may be adjusted by multiplying cost limit by the ratio of the current year's Case-Mix Index divided by the principal year's Case-Mix Index. (3-30-07) ii. The contested case procedure set for forth in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings,\" is available to larger hospitals seeking such adjustments to their Medicaid Cost Limits. (3-30-07) d. Adjustment to the Proration of Ancillary Costs in the principal year. Where the provider asserts that the proration of ancillary costs does not adequately re flect the total Medicaid cost per diem calculated for the inpatient routine service cost centers in the principal year, the provider may submit a detailed analysis of ancillary services provided to each pa rticipant for each type of patient day during each participant's stay during the principal year. The provider will be granted this adjustment only once upon appeal for the first cost reporting year that the limits are in effect. (3-30-07) 04. Payment Procedures . The following procedures are applicable to in-patient hospitals: (3-30-07) a. The participant's admission and length of stay is subject to preadmission, concurrent and retrospective review by a Quality Improvement Organizatio n (QIO) designated by the Department. QIO review will be governed by provisions of the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended. If such review identifies that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made. Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Section 405 of this chapter of rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended, will result in the QIO conduc ting a late review. After a QIO review has determined that the hospital stay was medically necessary, Medicaid will assess a late review penalty to the hospital as outlined in Subsection 405.05 of this rule. (3-30-07) i. All admissions are subject to QIO review to dete rmine if continued stay in inpatient status is medically necessary. A QIO continued stay review is requ ired when the participant's length of stay exceeds the number of days certified by the QIO. If no initial length of stay certification was issued by the QIO, a QIO continued stay review is required when the admission exceeds a nu mber of days as specified by the Department. (3-30-07) ii. Reimbursement for services originally identified as not medically necessary by the QIO will be made if such decision is reversed by the appeals proces s required in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.\" (3-30-07) iii. Absent the Medicaid participant's informed decision to incur services deemed unnecessary by the QIO, or not authorized by the QIO du e to the negligence of the provider, no payment for denied services may be Archive Archive 2013IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfare Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 43 obtained from the participant. (3-30-07) b. In reimbursing licensed hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospital charges or the reasonable cost of semi-private rates for in-patient hospital care as set forth in this rule, unless an exception applies as stated in Section 402 of these rules. The upper limits for paym ent must not exceed the payment which would be determined as reasonable cost using the Title XVIII standards and principles. (3-30-07) 05. Hospital Penalty Schedule . (3-30-07) a. A request for a preadmission and/or continued stay QIO review that is one (1) day late will result in a penalty of two hundred and sixty dollars ($260), from the total Medicaid paid amount of the inpatient hospital stay. (3-30-07) b. A request for a preadmission and/or continued stay QIO review that is two (2) days late will result in a penalty of five hundred and twenty dollars ($520), from the total Medicaid paid amount of the inpatient hospital stay. (3-30-07) c. A request for a preadmission and/or continued stay QIO review that is three (3) days late will result in a penalty of seven hundred and eighty dollars ($780), from the total Medicaid paid amount of the inpatient hospital stay. (3-30-07) d. A request for a preadmission and/or continued stay QIO review that is four (4) days late will result in a penalty of one thousand and forty dollars ($1,040), from the total Medicaid paid amount of the inpatient hospital stay. (3-30-07) e. A request for a preadmission and/or continued stay QIO review that is five (5) days late or greater will result in a penalty of one thousand three hundred dollars ($1,300), from the total Medicaid paid amount of the inpatient hospital stay. (3-30-07) 06. AND Reimbursement Rate. Reimbursement for an AND will be made at the weighted average Medicaid payment rate for all Idaho nursing facilities for routine services, as defined per 42 CFR 447.280(a)(1), furnished during the previous calendar year. ICF/ID rates are excluded from this calculation. (3-30-07) a. The AND reimbursement rate will be calculated by the Department by March 15 of each calendar year and made effective retroactively for dates of servi ce on or after January 1 of the respective calendar year.
