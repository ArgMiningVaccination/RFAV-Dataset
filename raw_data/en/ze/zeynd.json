DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 1 1.0 General Overview The energy balance Bowen ratio (EBBR) system produces 30 -minute estimates of the vertical fluxes of sensible and lat ent heat at the local surface. Flux estimate s are calculated from observations of net radiation, soil surface heat flux, and the vertical gradients of temperatu re and relative humidity (RH). Meteorological data collected by the EBBR are used to calculate bulk aerodynamic fluxes, which are used in the Bulk Aerodynamic Technique (BA) EBBR value- added product (VAP) to replace sunrise and sunset spikes in the flux data. A unique aspect of the system is the automatic exchange mechanism (AEM), which helps to reduce errors from instrument offset drift. 2.0 Contacts 2.1 Mentor Ryan C.

DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 3 5.0 Data Description and Examples 5.1 Data File Contents 5.1.1 Primary Variables and Expected Uncertainty 30 minutes : Sensible Heat Flux (h): 10% uncertainty Latent Heat Flux (e): 10% uncertainty Net Radiation (q): 5% uncertainty Average Soi l Surface Heat Flux (ave_shf): 10% uncertainty 5.1.1.1 Definition of Uncertainty We define uncertainty as the range of probable maximum deviation of a measured value from the true value within a 95% confidence interval. Given a bias (mean) error B and uncorrelated r andom errors characterized by a variance 2, the root -mean -square error (RMSE) is defined as the vector sum of these, RMSE =B2+2( )1/2. (B may be generalized to be the sum of the various contributors to the bias and 2 the sum of the variances of th e contributors to the random errors). To determine the 95% confidence interval, we use the Student's t distribution: tn;0.025 2, assuming the RMSE was computed for a reasonably large ensemble. Then the uncertainty is calculated as twice the RMSE.

During daylight hours, both h and e are negative, as energy is lost from the surface. The plot also shows the spikes in the data that can occur at sunrise and sunset when the Bowen ratio is near -1 (see the Bowen ratios annotated on the plot, near the data spikes).

DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 8 5.3 User Notes and Known Problems Some conditions do not require Data Quality Reports (DQRs) because t hey occur somewhat frequently. These conditions include spikes in the sensible and latent heat fluxes when the Bowen ratio is near - 1, short periods when the AEM is not functioning properly (this can be detected from the quality control [QC] checks in the data files), and short periods of missing data. Common instrumentation problems inc lude: condensation or frost on the net radiometer upper polyethylene dome (this can persist well into daylight hours) net radiometer desiccant degradation holes in the net r adiometer top dome caused by bird claws (this can result in water in the net radiometer if the dome is not replaced before precipitation occurs) soil sensors pulled from the ground or chewed by animals a blown fuse in the AEM when the belt slides bind agai nst the track seized bearings in wind instruments aging of sensors and electronic components loosened electronic connections. Preventative maintenance visits every two weeks and instrument mentor quality assurance activities are designed to detect and corr ect these problems to reduce the amount of incorrect data collected. 5.4 Frequently Asked Questions How is the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux derived? The Bowen ratio technique is used to determine Bowen ratio, assuming that the transfer coefficients of heat and water vapor are the same. The Bowen ratio is then used in conjunction with net radiation and soil surface heat flux measurements to determine sensible and latent heat fl ux based on a budget approach. More details are provided in Section 7.2, T heory of Operation. What is the sign convention used for the energy flux densities? All energy flux densities have a positive sign when directed toward the surface , and negative when directed away. For example, values of sensible (h) and latent heat flux (e) could be 0 to - 600 watts per meter squared during the daytime in the summer. In the design of the EBBR stations, which data are considered the most useful to Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Science Team members? The EBBR stations were designed primarily for computation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes. The soil temperature, moisture, and heat fluxes are measured in the upper 5 cm of the soil and therefore are not very useful for determining root zone soi l moisture and soil heat flow. Othe r observations, such as air DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 9 temperature, RH , atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and direction are secondary measurements; Surface Meteorological Instrumentation (MET) measurements, where available, should be used as the absolute measurements of these quantities . For example, the EBBR atmospheric pressure data are not measured with sufficient accuracy for man y applications, whereas the MET pressure data have a smaller uncertainty and might be suitable for calculations of geostrophic winds. Other sources of reliable surface meteorological data are available as external data for the ARM f acility from the Oklahoma Mesonet and from the Kansas network. The data user is encou raged to use the data from the MET for such observations. EBBR data are collected only at the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) extended facilities, including one at the C entral F acility (CF) and some that are co llocated with boundary facilities, and where the local surface is not tilled. Eddy correlation stations exist at nearly half of the ex tended facilities to sample the latent heat, sensible heat, and mom entum fluxes above tilled cropland. EBBR data can be used to compute momentum fluxes w ith a bulk aerodynamic approach. This approach is used as the basis for the calculation of sensible and latent heat fluxes by the BA EBBR VAP (Wesely et al. 1995). What do AEM home signals indicate? The AEM home signal outputs in the 5- , 15-, and 30 -minute data streams are in units of millivolts direct current ( DC). The circuitry producing the millivolt output is fairly rudimentary , and therefore the millivolt value is proportional to the DC voltage output of the EBBR power supp ly (solar/AC charged battery) . The home signal can therefore vary significantly diurnally and can fall to unacceptable levels fo r the 15-minute value if bat tery performance degrades too much. During the first and third quarter hours , the right side (looking from behind the AEM) aspirated radiation shield (hous ing temperature and RH probes ) is normally in the \" bottom \" (lowest elevation) position, and the left side is in the \" top\" (greatest elevation) position . During this AEM state, t he 5-minute \"home ,\" 15-minute \" mv_home \", and 30- minute \" home_15\" values should be between 40 and 55. During the second and fourth quarter hours , the left side (looking from behind the AEM) aspirated radiation shield (housing temperature and RH probes) is normally in the \" bottom \" (lowest elevation) position, and the right side is in the \" top\" (greatest elevation) position . During this AEM state , the 5-minute \" home ,\" 15-minute \" mv_home ,\" and 30- minute \" home_30\" values should be between 15 and 30. What soil measurements are made by the EBBR stations? Five soil heat flow sensors are located at a depth of 5 cm below the surface, five long platinum resista nce temperature detectors (PRTD s) integrate the temperature from the surface to a depth of 5 cm , and five soil moisture probes are located at a depth of 2.5 cm . Each set of five soil sensors is averaged. Because soil is not horizontally homogeneous , the se nsors are spaced out in the soil locally to provide representative samples. The purpose of these sensors is to compute one term, the surface soil heat flux . The soil temperature and moisture probes allow calculation of energy storage in the layer o f soil between the surface and the heat DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 10 flow plate depth of 5 cm. The soil moisture probes allow the soil heat flow measurements to be adjusted for the conductivity of the soil. The sensible and latent heat fluxes are computed by the EBBR data logger with the standard energy balance equation, in which the surface soil heat flux is usually a relatively small term. The surface soil heat flux term cannot be precisely re calculated from the raw information because of the way the soil energy storage term is comp uted with the EBBR data logger , but, in principle, the raw information can be used to recompute the sensible and latent heat fluxes with only a few percent error. If some of the soil probes are not working, can sensible and latent heat fluxes be recalculat ed? Yes. The remaining working soil probe sets can be used to calculate an average surface soil heat flux. See the procedure in Section 7.2, Theory of Operation. What type of diurnal trends should appear in the EBBR data? Some examples of diurnal trends can be seen in various textbooks and articles. For example, some data are shown in the special First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research (97: 18,343- 19,110), e.g., the article by Fritschen et al. beginning on p. 18,697. The ARM facility uses a Fritschen -type EBBR station. What can be said about the quality of the EBBR data? The EBBR systems sometimes experience hardware problems. For example, the AEM will sometimes malfunction. Some problems, like this one, can be di scerned by looking at the data quality flags. The following information should be useful for interpretation of the quality of data from the EBBR stations. Data quality flags should be used to detect when the AEM is functioning properly. The rate of AEM f ailure has been high at times. When it is not working, the estimates of sensible and latent heat flux are unreliable and should not be used for any scientific investigations, even if the flux estimates appear to be reasonable. To use the metadata on the A EM, the user should become familiar with the field and global attributes described in a dump of the netCDF header. The fields are defined there, and, in data sets recently provided, the configuration of the data quality flags is briefly described at the end of the list of the global attributes. The flags themselves are contained in numbers at the end of the data listing. The next paragraph provides some suggestions on the QC numbers (qcmin# and qcmax#) and the e mbedded flags relevant to the AEM. QC flags i n the standard 30 -minute data interval indicate when the AEM is working for each half hour in the time series. The particular QC flags of interest are the sixth and seventh bits of the 24 -bit binary numbers representing qcmin49- 72 and qcmax49- 72. The sixth bit of qcmin49- 72 is set to zero when the home_15 is greater than 35 mV , and to unity when less. The sixth bit of qcmax49- 72 is set to zero when the home_15 is less than 70 , and to unity when greater. A similar set of criteria are applied to the seventh bit, but with a minimum of 15 and maximum of 34.999999. Alternatively, if you choose not to convert the QC numbers to binary form, you can inspect the values of home_15 and home_30 to determine if they fall in the desired range. Because the limit checks on the home signals were not properly set prior to DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 11 April 7, 1993, you must inspect home_15 and home_30, rather than qcmin# and qcmax# for data collected prior to that date. The QC flags should routinely be used for all of the variables. For some variables, however, QC flags have not been set, and for some variabl es (e.g., average soil heat flux [ave_shf ], latent heat flux [e], and sensible heat flux [h]), flags were not set until late May 1998, as is evident in the listing of the field attributes. Nevertheless, some information can be obtained by inspection of the data if you are familiar with typical values. For example, Bowen ratios tend to be positive during the day and negative at night. Daytime values are usually between 0 and 2, and nighttime values can vary widely between positive values and - 50. A negative Bowen ratio during daylight hours should be considered as possibly indicating suspect sensible and/or latent heat flux values. During transition times lasting up to two half hours near sunrise and sunset, the magnitude of the Bowen ratio can sometimes be quite large, in which case the sensible and latent heat flux values should be viewed as suspect. Although no QC flags were set for latent and sensible heat flux, values smaller than - 1000 watts per me ter squared and larger than 200 watts per meter squared are clearly suspect. Routine checks reveal an expected offset drift of the RH probe of about +2% per year caused by aging and dirt contamination of the RH sensing element. This drift has also bee n obs erved in the Tower and MET RH probes. Although this affects the absolute accuracy of the RH measurement, it does not adversely affect the 30 -minute vapor pressure difference calculated from the RH and temperature measurements because the RH probes drift at approximately the same rate, and the AEM exchanging Bowen ratio technique reduces offset effects. Recalibration after two years of use is usually recommended to keep the RH probes within their \" as new \" absolute accuracy specification; this is the goal of the EBBR recalibration program conducted every two years. The absolute value of the home signals varies with the voltage of the battery that powers the EBBR data acquisition system. When the battery condition is good, the home_15 value is typically between 40 and 55; the home_30 value is typically between 15 and 30. When battery condition is low, the home signals can be slightly lower, but then the data from some individual sensors are questionable. Instances have occurred where low battery condition allowe d some sensors to function while others did not. DQRs are written to identify such problems. Unfortunately, the AEM does not always sw itch and occasionally hangs up. Four cases are common: 1. AEM fuse blown. When the fuse blows, the housing positions on the AEM are uncertain and usually yield home_15 and/or home_30 values of zero, although E15 at Ringwood, O klahoma, showed - 2.0 in this condition in May 1994. Usually the fuse blows because of too much friction on the exchange mechanism resulting fr om freezing rain or snow, built -up dirt, or an electrical or electronic failure. 2. AEM stuck at one position. Usually the right housing will stick in the down position (sometimes referred to in site operations log messages as the home position). When this happens, the home_15 and home_30 signal outputs are usually both equal to the proper home_30 value, if the AEM fuse has not blown. There are exceptions to this, of course, which included a period at the Central Facility EBBR in late 1992 when both home signals were 35. 3. AEM stuck between the 15 - and 30 -minute positions. This situation usually produces a very small negative home value for both home_15 and home_30, such as - 0.2. DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 12 4. AEM removed for service. Occasionally , an AEM has been removed from service for repair when no replacements were available (e.g., when the EBBR at E9, Ashton, K ansas, was removed on April 5, 1994) . A resistor in the AEM circuitry had burned out, leaving the left housing in the bottom position (a rarity). This had res ulted in both home signals showing somewhere from 67 to 73. After the AEM was removed, the aspirated housings were tied to the EBBR fram e, approximately a meter apart. Without the AEM circuitry being present, the home signals floated to the thousands. On April 19, a refurbished AEM was installed and the home signals returned to normal. The list above illustrates only some of the possibilities. Generally , whatever their absolute values, if the home_15 and home_30 values are practically the same in the 30- minute data, at least one of them is incorrect, indicating that the sensible and latent heat flux estimates are suspect. Unless both the home_15 and home_30 values are within proper ranges, the sensible and latent heat values must be considered incorrect. No other interpretation is ap propriate. Even if we know the AEM position situation and could thus recalculate fluxes from the available data, those fluxes would still be corrupted with calibration offsets, which are normally removed via the AEM switching process. Most users of the EB BR data only receive the 30 -minute data and not the 5- or 15- minute data. The QC flags in the 15 -minute data might be useful for a comprehensive evaluation of each EBBR sensor. For example, the qcmin# check for battery condition in the 15- minute data is se t to the lowest value at which the sensors will typically operate reliably. Also, soil moisture resistance ratios (rr_sm#, used before April 1996) or soil moisture resistance (r_sm#, used beginning in April 1996) could be examined to help determine when individual soil moisture values are reliable. However, w e do not expect every user of the EBBR to obtain the 15- minute data for such analyses. Finally, users of the data are cautioned that the reliability and accuracy of some individual sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, may be not optimal. The EBBR system was not designed to observe all qua ntities extremely well because its primary purpose is to provide sensible and latent heat flux estimates, which are not particularly sensitive to the uncertai nties o f some of the variables. For example, if accurate, reliable estimates of barometric pressure and air temperature are needed, the values supplied by MET or from external data sets, such as those from the Oklahoma Mesonet , should be used. For soil moisture a nd temperature, we consider the EBBR observations to be mostly inadequate for use in land- surface process and hydrological models or submodels. On the other hand, we expect high- quality data on net radiation from EBBR stations because it is crucial in the energy balance calculations. We expect soil heat flux values to be good because they enter directly into the surface energy balance calculations (but are typically small in magnitude compared to net radiation). Unforeseen types of failures sometimes occur, e.g., the ventilator for one of the temperature and humidity sensors stops. Such problems are usually described in DQRs that are available for data users. When the Bowen ratio is between - 1.6 and - 0.45, \" spikes\" can occur in the latent and sensible heat flux values. What are likely difficulties in comparing surface heat fluxes measured by EBBR stations to results of numerical modeling efforts? One of the greatest difficulties in comparing model versus field data on surface heat fluxes is caused by model c alculations requi ring soil moisture information. The soil moisture across the SGP site can be quite variable for summertime conditions. EBBR so il moisture data provide measurements of average moisture DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 13 content only in the top 5 cm. During 1996 and 1997, a n effort led by Jeanne Schneider , University of Oklahoma , and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for GEWEX Continental -Scale International Project (GCIP) , installed soil water and temperature system (SWATS) profiling instr umenta tion at every SGP extended facility, including every location with an EBBR station . SWATS soil moisture and soil temperature data should be used for modeling efforts, instead of the EBBR soil moisture and temperature data. Since summer 1995, a t least three science team groups have tried comparing model outputs with SGP site data: Jim Liljegren working with Chris Doran at Pacific Northwest Laboratory; Marina Zivkovic working with Jean -Francois Louis at Atmos. & Environmental Research, Inc., in Cambridge, M assachusetts ; and Sarah Fox working with Lee Harrison and others at the State University of New York at Albany. A cooperative program of sorts that has looked extensively at this typ e of modeling is the Project for Intercomparison of Land- surface Schemes (P ILPS). One conclusion of PILPS is that more observational data are needed for developing large -scale models. For example, an article by Betts et al. (1993) carries out a critical evaluation of European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) mode l outputs by using FIFE data. Some other potentially informative articles are as follows: Avissar , R, and MM Verstraete . 1990. \" The representation of continental s urface processes in atmospheric m odels. \" Reviews of and GT Bates. 1989. \" A regional c limate m odel for the Western United States. \" Climatic 15(3): 383 -422, doi:10.1007/BF00240465 . of l and/atmosphere in Geophysics, 12 (1-3): 3-30, doi:10.1007/BF01903410 . 6.0 Data Quality 6.1 Data Quality Health and Status The status of the measurements made by the EBBR system can be found by going to the ARM DQ Explorer web page at http://d q.arm.gov/dq- explorer/cgi -bin/main/metrics . 6.2 Data Reviews by Instrument Mentor Monthly reviews of the EBBR data were prepared by the mentor and submitted to the Instrument Mentor Monthly Summary (IMMS) report database until these ended in late 2014. Beginn ing in FY2006, Data Quality Reports are not written for missing data of less than a day in length or for situations when QC flags clearly show that the data are incorrect (this is true for most of the conditions listed below). DQRs are written for periods when data are incorrect, when the situation is not represented by QC flags in the data, and it is not obvious that the data should have been flagged as incorrect. DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 14 6.3 Data Assessments by Site Scientist/Data Quality Office The following guidance has been provided by the EBBR mentor for use by the Data Quality Office (DQO) in preparing their weekly assessment report for the EBBR systems. EBBR Data Quality Guidance David R. Cook 16 December, 2006 Introduction: The best way to tell someone what to look for in assessing the EBBR data is to describe conditions that refle ct correct and incorrect data. For the most part, the QC che cks provide adequate guidance. However, there are conditions for which the QC flags do not provide the needed guidance to be able to interpr et the correctness of the data. Therefore, please use the information below as further guidance. Primary Measurements: e (latent heat flux), h (sensible heat flux), q (net radiation), ave_shf (average surface soil heat flux); le and h are calculated, where as q and ave_shf are measured. The QC limits set in the ingest are appropriate for the measurements (primary and otherwise), although at times legitimate values fall outside the QC limits. Nuisance QC F lags: The Bowen QC flag is frequently tripped, particularly at sunrise or sunset, when the gradient of temperature can be near zero. This condition produces spikes in h and e, which would be quite obvious without the Bowen QC flag. Tripping of the Bowen QC flag near sunrise or sunset should not be reported in the DQO assessment reports. The hum_top and hum_bot QC flags will trip when the RH reported by the T/RH sensor exceeds a certain valu e. However, the absolute accuracy of the RH measurements is not impo rtant; the difference between them is used to determine e. Therefore, the hum_top and hum_bot QC flag condition should not be reported in the DQO assessment reports. Comparison of Data at Different EBBR Sites: Generally, the measurements can be compared favorably with those at adjacent sites, keeping in mind that climate conditions from one side of the SGP facility to another can differ sharply. There are some soil and surface vegetation differences between sites as well, so comparisons may show significant differences. Comparison of Data with the Eddy Correlation System ( ECOR ): The only collocated ECOR and EBBR are at the SGP Central Facility (CF) and at EF39, Morrison, OK. Caution must be used in the comparison of the two systems at SGP CF because they may see different vegetation surfaces (Cook et al. 2006). At the CF the best comparison can be made for straight north or northwest wind directions, when both systems view the same grass surface. For other directions, the two systems are viewing different vegetation surfaces and the fluxes from the two will probably not be similar , unless perhaps the ground is snow covered. At EF39 the EBBR and ECOR see the same surface, whether the wind blows over the wheat or the grass. Sensible and latent heat flux, and wind speed and direction measurements , could be compared for adjacent ECOR and EBBR sites, again remember ing that climatologically driven differences are likely . Comparison of Data with the MET: MET systems are collocated with EBBR systems at 8 of the 14 EBBR sites (exceptions are E2, E12, E18, E19, E22, and E26). The measurements of upper EBBR DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 15 temperature, RH, and vapor pressure can be directly compared with the MET temperature, RH, and vapor pressure. Even so, the EBBR RH may often be greater than that from the MET, as it is allowed to drift upwards with time for longer than is allowed for the MET . Wind speed and direction for the two systems are at different heights (MET 10 m, EBBR ~3 m), so it is normally expected that the MET wind speed will be gre ater than the EBBR wind speed. Wind direct ion may be very similar, but may be somewhat different if a frontal passage or str ong advection is taking place. The EBBR pressure measurement is not as accurate as that made by the MET, but their trends and general level may be compared in a gross way. Comparison of EBBR Net Radiation with Solar and Infrared Station (SIRS) Net Radiation: EBBR net radiation measurements do not agree with SIRS net radiation calculations when the effective sky temperature is less than about -20 \u00b0C and the EBBR net radiometer sensitivity decreases rapidly with the further decrease in effective sky temperature. First, the REBS longwave calibration is not performed to very low temperatures, and second, the design of the net radiometer may not allow for accurate low effective sky temperature measurements. Infrared thermometer (IRT), atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI), and SIRS net radiation measurements are more accurate under the condition of low effective sky temperatures. The result of this situation is that the EBBR overestimates or underestimates (it sounds odd, but it can be either) the nighttime sensible heat flux (direction is to the surface) and overestimates (sometimes by possibly a factor of 3) the nighttime latent heat flux. This is not a major concern si nce the nighttime fluxes are usually quite small anyway. Daytime fluxes are also affected, but since shortwave radiation dominates the radiant energy budget, the sensible and latent heat fluxes are both overestimated by only about 5 percent during a sunny day and by about 2 percent on a cloudy day during summertime. These errors are well within the 10 percent system error of the EBBR. Common Conditions Reflecting Correct or Incorrect Data: The EBBR data are only useful for particular wind direct ions at eac h extended facility. Please use the following resources to help in interpreting the EBBR data: 1. QC flags in the EBBR data. 2. IMMS at http://www.db.arm.gov/IMMS/ . 3. The information below on wind direction dependencies and conditions that commonly cause incorrect data. Wind Direction Dependencies (numbers are wind direction in degrees); note that there are wind directions at most sites for which the fetch is insuffic ient and th erefore EBBR data are invalid. Appropriate fetch was determined from a 1/40 measurement height to fetch ratio, resulting in a r equired minimum fetch of 120 m. Particular attention should be paid to the limited valid wind directions for the Centr al Facility EBBR. The surface vegetation type for the EBBRs is grazed or ungrazed grassland (refer to the Extended Facility Surface Conditions Observations [EFSCO ] for state ; available at https://www.ops.sgp.arm.gov/ under \"Extended Facility Vegetation Obs ervations\" and selecting 80 ungrazed grass EF40: 0 -360 Some conditions that commonly cause the EBBR primary measurements to be incorrect or missing data are as follows: Sensible and latent heat fluxes are not accurate during times when the a utomatic e xchange mechanism (AEM ) is not functioning properly. The AEM switches the gradient measuring instrumentation between the top and bo ttom positions every 15 minutes; this reduces the effects of instrument offsets. Sometimes the AEM does not reach its full extent of travel, resulting in the home signal being zero. Sensible and latent heat fluxes are sometimes incorrect when surface soi l heat flow is out of range, as seen in the average soil heat flux (ave_shf). Very light winds may be seen at nights for brief periods. Wind direction flops around a lot during low wind conditions (< 1.5 m/s) and is often unreliable during those periods. Missing data periods occur at times. This is usually a site data system collection/communication problem; it can also occur during replacement of the system with a newly calibrated unit. Missing data are sometimes filled in later from manual or automatic re- collection of the data. DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 17 6.4 VAPS and Quality Measurement Experiments (QMEs) The BA EBBR VAP represents a recalculation of sensible and latent heat fluxes using wind speed and temperature gradient information in conjunction with a bulk aerodynamic estimation technique . This VAP has been implemented, and 30- minute average files are available in the ARM Data Center from 1995. Vegetation height and wind speed are used to determine aerodynamic quantities that allow the calculation of sensible and latent heat flux independent from measurements of net radiati on and soil surface heat flux. These calculations help to produce more reasonable flux estimates when the Bowen ratio is between - 1.6 and - 0.45 (the Bowen ratio technique often produces unreasonable flux values under this condition). Data source names take the form \" sgp30baebbrE13.c1.\" Presently , the files can be found in the ARM Data Center by looking under c1 data sources. Results from the BA EBBR VAP can be seen in the second plot in Section 5.2, Annotated Exa mples. A second VAP involves the recalculation of sensible and latent heat fluxes using SIRS net radiation information; however, this VAP has not been implemented. This approach may help to improve flux estimates during times when the EBBR net radiation data are corrupted by dew, frost, or condensation inside or outside of the net radiometer domes. EBBR -related QMEs and SIRS -calculated net radiation. Comparison plots of EBBR net radiation and SIRS -calculated net radiation are produced by the DQO and displayed on the DQ Explorer website. These comparison plots reveal significant differences between these two systems at times. A QME has not yet been performed. Comparison of sensible and latent heat fl uxes from EBBR and ECOR systems can only be made at the SGP CF (only for very limited wind directions; within 30 degrees east or west of north) and at EF39. 7.0 Instrument Details 7.1 Detailed Description 7.1.1 List of Components Vaisala T/RH probes at two heights (1 -m separation), in aspirators PRTD temperature probes at two heights (1 -m separation), in aspirators REBS Q*7.1 Net Radiometer (at 2 m typical) REBS SMP- 2 (5 sets) Soil Moisture Probes at 2.5 cm depth REBS HFT -3 (5 sets) Soil Heat Flow Plates at 5 cm depth REBS STP- 1 (5 sets) Soil Temperature Probes, integrated 0 to 5 cm Met One Instruments 090C or 090D Barometric Pressure sensor (in enclosure) Met One 020C Wind Direction sensor at 2.5 m DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 18 Met One 010C Wind Speed sensor at 2.5 m PRTD Reference temperature of control box REBS AEM Pipe network structure for mounting of the instrumentation Solar panel, battery, AC charger power source Enclosure holding Campbell CR10, multiplexers, J -panels, communication equipment. 7.1.2 System Configuration and Measurement Methods The EBBR sensors (except for soil probes) are mounted on a triangular pipe framework that sits on the soil surface. The net radiometer mount extends from the south end of the EBBR frame. A unique aspect of the system is the AEM, which helps to reduce errors f rom instrument offset drift. The AEM extends from the north end of the frame. Aspirated radiation shields (which house the air temperature and temperature/ RH probes) are attached to the AEM. The openings of the aspirated radiation shields face north to red uce radiation error from direct sunlight. The soil probes are buried just outside the view of and in an arc to the south of the net radiometer. The heights of the AEM aspirators are different at differ ent extended facilities and depend on maximum vegetat ion height; the vertical separation between the two aspirators is 1 m at all extended facilities. The heights or depths of all other sensors are the same at all facilities. The reference temperature sensor, barometric pressure sensor, data logger equipmen t, and communication equipment are located in a control box (weatherproof enclosure) attached at the northeast corner of the EBBR frame. The local area of influence upon Bowen ratio measurements is contained within a horizontal distance of approximately 20 times the height of the top aspirated radiation shield on the AEM. This distance varies among the different extended facilities and for different times of the year because of differences in maximum vegetation height, and therefore the height at which the AEM is installed. The manufacturer's (REBS) name for these systems is SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System); this name appears in the systems documentation. 7.1.3 Specifications The accuracies cited below are generally those stated by the manufacturer. They are sensor -absolute accuracies and do not include the effects of system (i.e., data logger) accuracies. Although it is not known how some of the manufacturers have determined sensor accuracy, it is properly the root square sum of any nonlinearity, hysteresis, and non- repeatability, usually referenced as percentage of full scale. The detection limit is normally restricted to the range (sometimes called Calibrated Operating Range) over which the accuracy applies. In the case of the EBBR, some of the detection l imits are those DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 19 determined by the vendor (REBS) who performed the calibration, not by the manufacturer of the sensor. Some manufacturers also specify an Operating Temperature Range in which the sensor will function both physically and electronically , even though the calibration may not be appropriate for use throughout that range. When the manufacturer or the calibrating vendor has listed no detection limit s, none are stated below.

Soil Moisture: Soil Moisture Probe (fiberglass and stainless steel screen mesh sandwich), REBS Model # SMP-1, accuracy not specified by manufacturer (varies significantly depending on soil moi sture and soil type).

Operational Limit on speed 60 ms -1. Data Logger : Campbell Scientific, Inc., Model CR10, Detection Limits vary by voltage range selected, Accuracy +/ - 0.1% of full -scale reading. 7.2 Theory of Operation The EBBR stations use a standard Bowen ratio approach that has been described by textbooks and articles. A general description can be found in Brutsaert (1982). For an article, see p. 18,549 of the special FIFE issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research (97): 18,343-19,110. DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 20 The surface energy balance equation is used: q + ave -shf + h + e = 0, where q is n et radiation, ave_shf is the ground surface heat flow, h is sensible heat flux, and e is latent heat flux. The units for the t erms in the equation above are w atts per meter squared. ave_shf is measured with five sets of soil heat flow, soil temperature, a nd soil moisture probes . Soil heat flow at 5 cm (shf1, shf2, shf3, shf4, shf5) , measured with soil soil energy storage (ces1, ces2, ces3, ces4, ces5) in the 0-5 cm layer (measured as the change in temperature with time) are added to obtain surface soil heat flow, as follows: g1 = shf1 + ces1, etc., where shf1 and ces1 are, respectively, the soil heat flow from the soil heat flow plate and the change in energy storage measured from the soil temperature probe of soil set #1. The expre ssions for g2, g3, g4, and g5 are similar. Soil moisture is used to adjust the measurements for soil thermal conductivity, which affects the calibrations of the sensors. Surface soil heat flow is then ave_shf = (g1 + g2 + g3 + g4 + g5)/5, When data from one or more soil set(s) is incorrect, that soil set(s) can be eliminated and the average soil heat flow determined from the remaining sets. The Bowen ratio is measured as the ratio of the gradients of temperature and vapor pressure (the latter calculated from RH and temperature) across two fixed heights within three meters of the surface. The Bowen ratio (B = h/e) is computed on the basis of the gradients and the following computations are performed: e = -(q + ave_shf)/(1 + B) h = B * e More detailed information on these and other equations can be obtained elsewhere, including from Ryan Sullivan at Argonne Na tional Laboratory. A large manual provided by the manufacturer, REBS, Inc., describes the general theory, gives rather complete information on each type of sensor, and explains procedures for installation, operation, and maintenance. DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 21 7.3 Calibration 7.3.1 Theory Standard calibration procedures are employed by the vendor(s) of the sensors and equipment used in the EBBR system when each EBBR unit is returned for recalibration, approximately every two years. 7.3.2 Procedures Net Radiometer: Calibration is performed in a temperature- controlled, black -body cavity chamber against a transfer standard. The light source is a tungsten -halide lamp. The transfer standard was calibrated both in the temperature- controlled cavity chamber and by comparison to an Eppley precision pyranometer outdoors. Wind s peed effects are also taken into consideration by ventilating the radiometers in the calibration chamber and outdoors. The transfer standard is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ) through the Eppley pyranometer using a shading technique. Shortwave and longwave calibrations are different, and so they are applied appropriately for daytime and nighttime conditions in the EBBR programming. The longwave calibration performed by REBS does not provide correct measurements under conditions of low effective sky temperatures (below about - 30\u00b0C). 7.3.3 History The EBBR systems are returned to REBS approximately every two years for calibration of all sensors and data logger equipment. Some of the calibrations are performed by REBS themselves, while some are performed by manufacturers of the equipment. For various reasons (the need to provide and calibrate spare sensors, frequent AEM failures, etc.) the time between recalibrations of EBBR units has sometimes been greater than two years; REBS i s a small company and has little flexibility to reprioritize rapidly for individual customers. 7.4 Operation and Maintenance 7.4.1 User Manual A user manual is available from REBS for the SEBS systems. One copy is kept at the SGP CF , and the mentor keeps one copy. 7.4.2 Routine and Corrective Maintenance Documentation SGP Site Operations (Site Ops) personnel maintain preventative maintenance, corrective maintenance, and engineering logs. Maintenance and system checks are performed in accordance with a set of procedures wri tten by Site Ops and the mentor. These procedures are maintained in print form at the SGP CF and in digital form on Site Ops laptops taken into the field during preventative maintenance visits to the EBBR systems. DR Cook and RC Sullivan, April 2019, DOE/SC -ARM -TR-037 22 7.4.3 Software Documentation EBBR programs are m aintained on SGP Site Ops computers at the SGP CF , on laptops used by Site Ops during preventative maintenance visits, and at REBS. The mentor maintains print copies and some digital copies. 7.4.4 Additional Documentation Six-month EBBR checks are maintained on the SGP Operations Management Information System (OMIS) website. 7.5 Glossary Bowen Ratio : the ratio of the sensible heat flux to the latent heat flux.
