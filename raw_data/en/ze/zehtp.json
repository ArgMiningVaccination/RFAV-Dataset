Excludes gift vouchers Hi. My mom has been diagnosed with lung cancer. In addition to treating the tumor with radiation and chemo in coming weeks, she also suffers from pain in her neck and chest, numbness in her hands and feet, and anxiety/depression. I know there are many things going on, but I wondered what advice you might have on crystals to help her. I'm new to these things and am feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the choices. Thank you! Dear J, Thank you for contacting Healingcrystals.com with your crystal questions. I am very sorry to hear about your mother's difficulties and I hope these recommendations are helpful to your Mom. First, let me share the standard disclaimer that I am not a medical professional. Crystals should never replace medical treatment, but rather, are complimentary therapy that should be used to support the treatment recommended by your medical doctor. To support the health of her lungs, I recommend [Rose Quartz](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Crystal_Necklaces_-_Rose_Quartz_Round_Bead_Necklace.html), as it is soothing, physically healing, and is associated with the energy of the heart chakra, which is the energy center that aids in lung and chest-area health. Perhaps a Rose Quartz necklace would be an easy way to keep that crystal energy close to the heart chakra. Many people find it helpful for gentle pain relief. To help her body detoxify from the chemo and radiation, I recommend [Smokey Quartz](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Tumbled_Smokey_Quartz__Dark___Extra__-_Tumbled_Stones.html). This crystal is most effective when worn near the base chakra, or carried in pants pockets to help the body clear away toxins as well as to boost the immune system. For depression, and finding spiritual and mental peace with the enormity of her health situation, [Amethyst](https://www.healingcrystals.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Amethyst) can be a very calming crystal that many find helpful for depression and other issues of the brain/mind. Finally, to help clear these crystals on a daily basis, as is essential when dealing with such strong, toxic-dense energy, I recommend a piece of [Selenite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Selenite) to lay the crystals on each night. Selenite itself never needs cleansing. It also can be applied to sore spots on the body for localized pain relief. I would, however, caution that if she is very sick and weak, this crystal might be too strong, as it pulls the pain quickly to the surface in the process of relieving it. This is better tolerated by people who are in good physical condition. I hope you find these recommendations helpful, and I sincerely hope your mother's treatments are effective. As you support her in this time, you may find crystals with the energy of the sun, such as [Sunstone](https://www.healingcrystals.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Sunstone), [Carnelian](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Worry_Stone_-_Carnelian_Worry_Stones__Extra_.html) and [Citrine](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Crystal_Bracelets_-_Citrine_Single_Strand_Bracelet.html) are helpful for keeping up your energy.
