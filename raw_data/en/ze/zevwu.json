If you are reading this, then you probably have a vested interest in the nation's children as they start another school year. As we continue living with the lingering pandemic, gun violence, and social unrest - all of which unfairly and disproportionately affect BIPOC communities - it is imperative to remember that our youth are also dealing with the intense influences and emotions of growing up in a rapidly changing digital age, which we do not fully understand. Now, more than ever, school-age children need our support, and MHA remains committed to this undertaking. Early-in-life experiences, including adverse experiences and trauma, shape a person's future. Knowing and addressing the early signs of mental health conditions - and understanding the roots of resilience and positive coping - can increase the chances for well-being, recovery, and positive outcomes. In this toolkit, we hope you find ways to interrupt negative feelings and behaviors and promote positive life skills for mental health. MHA created each of these resources for both the adult - parent, caregiver, teacher, coach, school administrator - and the child. While some of these topics span generations of common experiences, such as a hard home life, losing someone, or fitting in with peers, others, such as dealing with the pressures and temptations of social media, are new to our younger cohorts. In this toolkit, we delve into a variety of feelings and behaviors and offer suggestions to help young people thrive. One of the easiest ways to help a child is to validate that their emotions are real and that they are worthy of our respect and attention. MHA assembled these resources with empathy for all children and caregivers, without judgment or criticism, but with compassion and hope. Children look to the adults in their lives for cues on how to react and deal with tough events. If you are an adult caregiver, remember to take care of your emotional health, too, and seek help or guidance when things are overwhelming. We thank you for your commitment to the mental health of all youth.

Children and teens are dealing with the intense emotions of growing up in a digital age. Young people are facing challenges that even adults aren't sure how to handle, like the lingering pandemic, gun violence, and social unrest. Many students will exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety as they return to the classroom, and it is important to let kids and teens know that support is available. Knowing and addressing early signs of mental health conditions can increase the chances of recovery and positive outcomes. One of the quickest and easiest ways to determine whether you are experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition is to take an anonymous screen at www.mhascreening.org. Mental Health America (MHA) has online screening tools, including one that is youth-focused and one for parents. Once you get the results, MHA will provide you with more information and help you to figure ou t next steps. MHA has developed its 2022 Back-to-School Toolkit to help increase understanding of the issues affecting the mental health of children and teens and is providing materials on these topics for parents, school personnel, and young people. Feel free to supplement these key messages with language from the fact sheets and other materials included in this toolkit. SCREENING STATS During the first half of 2022, 82% (N=662,823) of screeners under 18 from the U.S. screened at risk for a men tal health condition. In June 2022, 56% (N= 3,850) 11-13 year olds who took a depression screen in the U.S. reported experienc ing frequent suicidal ideation, which was the highest rate of any age group.KEY MESSAGESUse this article in your next e-blast or share with your local schools to include in their next newsletter. By now, most of us have read or seen stories on the youth mental health crisis plaguing our country. From an ongoing pandemic, lack of in-person social interactions, social upheaval, and more, kids and teens are facing once-in-a-lifetime events that even adults aren't sure how to handle. Adolescence is already a confusing time without the added fears concerning safety in schools, staying healthy, family financial security, and loss of loved ones - so we shouldn't be surprised that the rates of anxiety, depression, suicide, and other mental health conditions are on the rise. Mental Health America recognizes with their new Back-to-School Toolkit that our youth are having \"All the Feels\" as they enter the new school year. These resources look at the issues young people face that are having an impact on their mental health and offer tips on how to deal with them and the resulting emotions. The MHA toolkit can also help parents and school personnel better understand the issues, such as the effects of social media on youth mental health and how to be supportive. Many students will exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety as they return to the classroom, and it is important to let kids and teens know that support is available. Familiarize yourself with the school's education and counseling services, local mental health organizations, and community resources that can make a child feel more secure - like food, clothing, and school supply assistance. Free, confidential, anonymous screening tools are available at MHAScreening.org for youth and parents who are concerned about mental health. After taking the screen, results are provided along with tips for next steps and additional information. Serious signs that someone is in crisis and needs help, such as thoughts or plans of hurting oneself or another person, should be addressed promptly. If you think a child or teen is in immediate danger of taking suicidal action, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Its trained crisis counselors can help you find local resources or suggest next steps. DROP-IN ARTICLEGENERAL Young people are facing challenges that even adults aren't sure how to handle.

ET More teenagers are using social media, and more adolescents are suffering from poor mental health.

However, if adolescents use social media in a purposeful and positive way, it can enhance their self-esteem and help create meaningful social connections. This webinar will focus on helping school and community leaders understand the association between social media use and adolescents' mental health and explore what actionable steps are being taken across the country to help address these challenges.

MHA RESOURCES Addressing the Youth Mental Health Crisis: The Urgent Need for More Education, Services, and Supports Indicators of youth mental health and well-being indicate a growing public health crisis that has only been worsened by COVID-19. Yet, public policy has been slow to respond. This report is designed to guide advocacy at the state level and begin to create a framework for federal policy. The report aims to document the alarming trends in youth mental health and the disparities in access to care; address several innovative state legislative solutions to promote school- based mental health education, supports, and services; and highlight the effect of these policies on advancing equity and the role of youth leadership in securing legislation. Visit MHA's website to access the report. Back-to-School Toolkits An archive of Back-to-School toolkits (like this one) from previous years can be found on MHA's website. Some materials are also available in Spanish. Screening in Schools Providing mental health screenings in schools is one of the best ways to catch mental health problems when and where they are likeliest to arise. Fifty percent of individuals who struggle with a mental health condition will show symptoms during their adolescent years. Childhood brain development research indicates that puberty is especially an important time for monitoring the onset of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. This period is when individuals are most vulnerable to poor outcomes, but also where intervention has the best chance for building resiliency and change. Mental health screenings can be implemented in schools through sharing resources with students on school posters or handouts at the nurse's office, by providing screenings and education in health or physical education classes, or as part of a extensive mental health screening and education protocol. MHA Screening is a free program designed to support schools in any district, across various levels of investment.

VIRGINIA - MHA of Fredericksburg The Suicide Prevention Education Program empowers middle and high school students with the ability to identify the signs and symptoms of suicide and depression and teaches them what they can do to get help. The curriculum used is Signs of Suicide (SOS), developed by Screening for Mental Health, Inc. It is listed on SAMSHA'S National Registry of evidence-based programs and practices for high school, while the middle school program is considered a best practice.

It's human nature to want to fit in and be accepted by our peers. As young people start to become aware of feelings of belonging, they typically seek it out in friends and social groups - a big part of developing a sense of identity outside of their family. Adolescent brains are hardwired to be focused on this social acceptance. Growing up is full of everyday challenges, and studies have found peer friendships to be particularly helpful in coping with stress./one.superior By contrast, brain imaging studies have found that the same parts of the brain are activated by social rejection as by physical pain./two.superior Unfortunately, feeling a sense of belonging and acceptance isn't as easy as just finding some people to hang out with. Even if someone has a great friend group and healthy peer relationships, insecurity or low self-esteem can have them feeling on edge, fearful, or more likely to engage in unsafe behaviors. SOCIAL BELONGING AND CONFIDENCE Low self-esteem and social isolation are major risk factors in developing a mental health condition, like depression. If you think your child is struggling, take the Parent Test at MHAscreening.org to see if they're dealing with symptoms of emotional, attentional, or behavioral difficulties. Most of us remember how tough middle and high school could be in terms of your social life - and that was before what social media is today. As adults it can be hard to think back and remember that social acceptance or popularity is a genuine priority in children and adolescents' lives. When something matters to young people, the adults in their life need to take it seriously - especially when it has real impacts on their health the way socialization does. WHY ARE YOUTH FEELING INSECURE AND DISCONNECTED FROM THEIR PEERS? Even the most confident people have insecurities and overcoming self-doubt during adolescence is part of maturing into an adult. Young people are facing very real pressures from peers, parents, and society, on top of hormonal changes - all of which can set them up to feel bad about themselves. Life is full of shifting social dynamics, most notably during adolescence. Kids and teens frequently have difficult social situations going on, whether it's a breakup, a fight with a friend, or being excluded by classmates. Even the kids and teens who seem to get along with everyone may struggle with not having a close friend group to turn to or feel like no one truly knows them. Feeling lonely or disconnected doesn't necessarily mean being alone - it's a subjective feeling of loneliness that can exist even when around others. This generation of students has also had to cope with situations you didn't experience as an adolescent - the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual schooling. While it's true these youth are used to connecting with friends online, young people have been deeply impacted by social isolation. Just a few months into the pandemic in June 2020, a study found nearly 30% of high school youth didn't feel at all connected to teachers, classmates, or the school community./three.superiorIN CRISIS?FACILITATING CONNECTION AMONG YOUTH SOURCES /one.numerator Scheuplein, M. & van Harmelen, A.L.

Young people need a lot of validation and reassurance as they learn to feel secure in themselves. Name their successes, be excited for them (even if they roll their eyes in the moment), and keep letting them know that they matter to you. Notice triggers. What causes the young person you care about to shut down or turn inwards? Is there a pattern or common factor you can identify when they struggle with insecurity? Finding the root of their feelings can guide you to a clearer starting point on how best to support them. Guide them in establishing goals and strategies to achieve them. Feeling accomplished goes a long way in building self-confidence. Help them figure out what matters to them - what do they want to achieve? Support them in making an action plan and sticking to it. FOR PARENTS: Be mindful of your own self-talk. Even if it doesn't always seem like it, kids listen and pick up on the negative ways their parents talk about their own bodies, intelligence, and self in general. If it would hurt you to know your child is thinking the same thing about themselves, don't say it in front of them (and work on it for yourself, too!). Help set them up for social success. You might feel helpless when it comes to their relationships with peers at school, but that's not the only place to meet people their age. Don't shame them for not having friends at school. Find other opportunities to connect them with peers - do you have coworkers with children their age? Are there neighborhood kids? What about local events, clubs, or classes? Foster open communication. Vulnerability begets vulnerability, so be open to sharing a bit about your feelings or struggles with them. Ask questions, be interested in their answers, and follow up with them so they know you genuinely care. FOR SCHOOL PERSONNEL: Establish a classroom community. Set expectations together - what values does this group have? What behavior is and isn't okay in the classroom? While it's the teacher's responsibility to ensure a conducive learning environment, valuing the input of students sets the tone that the class is a team and you're all here to support each other. Help them meet people with similar interests. Hear of a new book club starting up? Tell the student who you always catch reading at their desk. Have a few students who always turn in amazing art projects? See if they want to have a drawing meet-up during lunch one day. If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

The current young generation - Generation Z - is facing these normal coming-of-age challenges on top of the frequent grief that comes with living in modern society. Youth these days are experiencing tremendous, and often consistent, losses as they grow up during a pandemic, regular mass shootings, and increasing rates of youth suicide and domestic violence. FAST FACTS In the first 15 months of COVID-19, over 140,000 children in the U.S. lost a primary or secondary caregiver./one.superior Sixty-five percent of the youth who have lost a primary caregiver due to COVID-19 are Black, Indigenous, and/or people of color (BIPOC)./two.superior LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than their straight and cisgender peers, primarily because of rejection by and loss of their family of origin./three.superior Firearm-related deaths among children and adolescents increased 30% between 2019 and 2020. The suicide rate for youth ages 10-14 nearly tripled between 2007 and 2017. In 2019, nearly 9% of high school students said they had attempted suicide at least once in the previous 12 months. Fatal overdoses among adolescents increased by 94% from 2019 to 2020. HOW LOSS AND GRIEF IMPACT YOUTH Everyone handles loss in their own way, and youth are no different. Their reactions can depend on many things, like age, gender, personality, type of loss, relation to the person lost, amount of support around them, and more. But they will all need consistent attention, reassurance, and care as they adjust. Below are some common signs of grief in different age groups. AGES 5-12 Elementary and middle school-aged children may struggle to understand loss, whether it comes through death or other change. Look for these signs: AGES 13-18 Teenagers are already in a time of big transition and grief can influence how they move from dependence on caregivers to independence. Look for these signs:WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE LOSE SOMEONE \u00bb Self-blame for the loss \u00bb Seeming distracted, forgetful \u00bb Increased anxiety (often related to loss - fear of others dying, friends abandoning them, the future) \u00bb Increased attachment to caregiver(s) \u00bb Avoidance of school \u00bb Physical symptoms (especially stomachache and headache) \u00bb Withdrawal from usual activities \u00bb Behavior issues (aggression, tantrums, defiance) \u00bb Changes in eating and sleeping habits \u00bb Temporary regression in age-appropriate development (bed-wetting, baby talk, etc.)\u00bb Seeming distracted, difficulty concentrating \u00bb Withdrawal, needing more alone time \u00bb Taking on adult responsibilities, taking care of those around them \u00bb Difficulty expressing emotions \u00bb Increased anxiety (often related to loss - fear of others dying, friends abandoning them, the future) \u00bb Questions about death and dying \u00bb Using jokes and humor to mask/minimize the loss \u00bb Physical symptoms (especially stomachache and headache) \u00bb Getting into trouble, risky behavior to escape or find comfort \u00bb Temporary regression in age-appropriate development (independence, confidence) \u00bb Strained relationships \u00bb Worsening self-image, self-esteem, confidenceIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

Lead with comforting them and acknowledging how hard this must be. Reestablishing safety isn't a quick process, but reminding them that one loss doesn't mean others will follow is a good start. MAINTAIN STRUCTURE Young people often rely on the adults in their life to help them stay regulated, especially during times of significant change. Help them stay consistent with their typical daily activities and schedule and avoid other unnecessary changes until you notice them starting to return to their old self. ANSWER QUESTIONS HONESTLY Kids have active imaginations and are likely to start filling in the details they don't have as they try to navigate a loss. Listen to their thoughts and questions, and don't be afraid to get sad or say that you don't know. Young people need to hear the truth from someone they trust. CONSIDER CULTURE Remember that different cultures and families have different views of death and mourning. Children will likely process grief based on how the people around them handle loss. They usually pick this up from family members but may also have ideas about grief from their peers or media. If a child is struggling, allow them to process the loss in the way that comes naturally to them - as long as it's not harmful to themselves or others. Connect with the child's other communities (school, place of worship, neighborhood, etc.) if you need help facilitating healing. CONNECT TO PROFESSIONAL HELP Additional assistance is never a bad idea, and resources like counselors or support groups can help youth feel less alone in their grief.

WHEN HOME LIFE IS HARD Kids and teens often get a reputation for not liking school, but for some students, it's a relief from their home life. Whether they're dealing with serious challenges at home, like food insecurity, or just don't feel understood by their parents, many children and teens don't see home as an enjoyable environment. Factors related to home life - socioeconomic status, family dynamics, and even home cleanliness - can play a key role in mental health and well-being, especially among adolescents. Seeking independence Everyone goes through the transition from child to young adult, and that \"in-between\" stage can be tough. As they branch out on their own, they may be facing more parent-child conflict, feel controlled or judged, or feel unsure of who they are. Cultural differences A lot of tension between parents and children comes from differences in opinion. Social norms vary among communities, and first- or second-generation children who have grown up in American culture may clash with their parents more than expected. Generations have different cultures, too - children and teens with significantly older parents might also have a hard time understanding each other. Competing responsibilities As much as we wish kids could just be kids, the reality is that many of them have obligations. They're caring for younger siblings, responsible for cooking for themselves at a young age, or may need to have a job (or multiple). They may be struggling to focus on their schoolwork or missing out on social time with their peers. Life circumstances Some young people are dealing with tough situations that can't be easily fixed - financial challenges, food insecurity, houselessness, conflict between parents or siblings, and more. Sometimes little can be done to alleviate these issues, so it's easy for kids and teens in these environments to feel hopeless or ashamed. Abuse Rates of violence in the home increased during the COVID-19 pandemic./one.superior Feeling physically and emotionally safe is the foundation of everything else - including learning, social development, and behavior. Most families face challenges at some point, and it's common for relationships in the home to get more tense as kids grow up and face adolescence. If you think your child is having a tough time at home but aren't sure how to help, visit mhascreening.org and take the parent screen to see if they might be dealing with symptoms of a mental health condition.

Puberty and hormones, social pressures, dating, body image issues, and the list goes on. They're also dealing with modern stressors related to COVID-19, frequent school shootings, and social media. Make an effort to understand what's weighing on your child's mind and support them, even if you don't quite get why it's a big deal to them. Team up with your child. Listen, commiserate, and validate - even if they brush you off sometimes. Young people often feel alone as they figure out what growing up is all about, and while parents aren't usually their first choice of who to turn to, knowing that you'll be there if they decide to can go a long way in helping them feel secure and supported. Get them connected to additional support. If the issues at home are situational and things that you can't resolve or change, the best way to help them is to provide resources to help them cope. If you don't know where to start, talk to their teacher or school counselor about options. Pick your battles. If you know (or suspect) a student has a lot of responsibilities at home or is dealing with other challenges, be flexible and accommodating. Allow them to eat breakfast in class if you have a feeling they're rushing to get their siblings ready for school in the mornings, and understand that sometimes your homework isn't going to be their priority. Ensure you understand your students and their age group. Many youth feel chronically misunderstood, especially by their parents. Putting in the effort to be somewhat familiar with trends and cultural norms will go a long way in making them feel that adults can be understanding and approachable. Be a safe space for them. Offer to listen, help them find support or resources, and be a positive and engaged adult role model in their life. Be cautious of your own capacity to provide support so that you don't overextend yourself. FOR PARENTS: WHY IS MY CHILD UNHAPPY AT HOME AND WHAT CAN I DO? FOR SCHOOL STAFF: HOW TO BEST SUPPORT YOUTH WITH CHALLENGING HOME LIVES SOCIAL MEDIA AND YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH It can be difficult for adults who grew up without or with limited social media to get why it's so important to young people. The technology boom in recent years has created a massive cultural difference between older generations and Generation Z, who grew up with widespread social media. While it might not seem important to you, social media matters to youth and is a very real part of our world - so it's important to understand the unique pressures and challenges they face because of it. \"WATCHING ASMR VIDEOS\" \"BY MAKING ME NOT FEEL ALONE\" \"IT GIVES ME AN ESCAPE WHEN I AM FEELING VERY ANXIOUS\" \"ACCESS TO VISUALS/BITE-SIZED INFO RELATED TO COPING STRATEGIES, MENTAL HEALTH, ETC.\" \"I FOLLOW A LOT OF POSITIVE ACCOUNTS THAT INSPIRE ME\" \"FEELING CONNECTED TO THE GREATER WHOLE\" \"FOLLOWING ACCOUNTS THAT SUPPORT MY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNEY\" \"CONNECTING WITH FRIENDS FAR AWAY\"How does social media help your mental health? \"POSTS GLORIFYING EATING DISORDERS\" \"WHEN I LOSE TRACK OF TIME AND END UP SCROLLING THE DAY AWAY\" \"COMPARISON\" \"BLACK HOLES OF NEGATIVITY\" \"WATCHING EXTREME UNHEALTHY CONFLICT IN COMMENTS\" \"EXPECTING FOR PEOPLE TO RESPOND AS FAST AS I WANT THEM TO\" \"MODELS\" \"LOOKING AT PEOPLE HAVING A LIFE I WISH TO HAVE\" \"SEEING OTHERS THAT HAVE BETTER LOOKING BODIES THAN I DO\"How does social media harm your mental health?WHAT YOUTH ARE SAYING FAST FACTS Forty-five percent of teens believe social media has neither a positive nor negative impact on people their age. 31% say social media has a mostly positive impact and 24% say it has a mostly negative impact./one.superior Most teens who view social media as generally positive emphasized its role in keeping in touch and interacting with others./two.superior 59% of U.S. teens have personally experienced abusive online behaviors, with the most common being name-calling which 42% of teens say they have experienced./three.superior During COVID-19, poorer mental health was associated with using social media for entertainment motives. Better mental health was associated with using social media for personal contact and keeping up relationships. A global study found school loneliness to be correlated with increases in smartphone and internet use - when countries reached a point where half of the teen population had access to smartphones, loneliness levels began to rise. Youth from lower-income families are more likely to report that their online experiences led to negative offline interactions. Almost twice as many LGBTQ+ students reported being cyberbullied compared to heterosexual students (36% versus 20%). Lower socioeconomic status can exacerbate the negative impacts of social media through comparisons to more affluent peers, more unstructured time in the home, or lack of outdoor spaces. If social media use seems to be impacting the mental health of a child or teen in your life, suggest that they take a screen at mhascreening.org to determine if they might be experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition.

You can also reach Crisis Text Line by texting MHA to 741741.While social media can certainly cause problems, it's here to stay and young people are going to use it whether adults like it or not. Parents and schools have a tough job - the goal isn't to keep students off social media altogether, but to support them in developing healthy social media behaviors. Celebrate the positives When youth feel judged or misunderstood about their social media use, they're likely to get defensive or shut down. Make sure to point out how great it is that they were able to connect with their friends and family who live far away, or comment on how helpful it must be to reach most of their classmates for an emergency study buddy. Ask questions Let's face it - most youth know way more about social media than the adults in their life. And they definitely know more about what exactly they're doing online. Instead of starting conversations by talking about the harms or effects of social media, be open and curious about their unique experiences with it. Promote limiting screen time Everything in moderation, right? Excessive time on the internet and social media has been linked to poorer mental health outcomes like depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Younger children will need more help with this - consider setting time limits or media-free zones. As children get older, support them in managing their own usage - encourage them to dedicate time to offline activities or help them update their phone settings to limit time on certain apps.. Model healthy use Young people notice what adults are doing more than we may think, including being told to get off their devices while the adults in their life seem just as obsessed. It can be tempting to try to manage their use, but you're better off modeling healthy habits (age dependent, of course). Studies have shown that parental use of digital technology, rather than their attitudes toward it, determines how their children will engage with it. Friend/follow your kids' accounts Your kids - especially teenagers - might resist you monitoring their social media, but it's important that you're (somewhat) informed of what's happening in their online world. Explain your reasoning, listen to their hesitations, and let them set boundaries. Your virtual relationship with your child is an entirely new one, so be patient. Your best bet to build trust is to stay in the background: Don't comment or like their posts unless they want you to, let the little things slide, and be ready to have offline conversations about the important things.

From around ages 10 to 24, you're in a stage of life where you feel social stressors more intensely - it's just part of how the human brain works./one.superior These days, young people are also feeling lonelier than any other age group, and about twice as many adolescents worldwide are experiencing loneliness than just 10 years ago./two.superior Some experts think kids and teens have lower self-esteem nowadays in part because of technology/three.superior - there are big differences between socializing online and in-person, and things like miscommunications, social comparisons, and fear of missing out (FOMO) can end in hurt feelings. Or maybe you're getting bullied or being excluded by your peers, or have been in the past, and can't stop worrying about it happening again. Keep in mind that at this age, your social circle is likely still limited to people in your school or hometown - depending on where you live, there simply might not be many people around you who have the same interests, hobbies, or values for you to be friends with. And even if you do have plenty of friends to hang out with, it's still possible to feel lonely or like others don't accept the real you. FITTING IN AND SELF-ESTEEM TIPS FOR BUILDING SELF-ESTEEMEveryone feels awkward, insecure, or alone at times - especially during adolescence. Between how media depicts growing up, mean kids at school, and puberty, it's unfortunately common to not feel great about yourself sometimes. The secret is: Most of your peers feel this way too - even the ones who seem to have it all. Self-esteem refers to your overall sense of worth - how much you like and respect yourself! Healthy self-esteem can help you feel empowered to reach your goals, express your needs, and have a more positive outlook on life. Remember: You can't read people's minds. It's easy to assume how someone feels about you - based on a text they never replied to, a weird look they gave you in the hall, or just the fact that you've never really interacted. None of these things mean they don't like you - so try to stop your brain when it starts creating a story about what they must be thinking. Notice your negative thoughts and challenge them. When you catch yourself thinking in extremes (nobody likes me, I'll never have any friends), try to challenge them or find the middle ground. Does nobody like you, or do you feel unwanted by a few people at school? Will you never have friends, or are you just surrounded by the same classmates you've been with for years or people who aren't like you? Most of us are our own worst critics. Use positive self-talk. Everyone has strengths and (many!) good qualities. What do you like or appreciate about yourself? Write these things down so that you have a running list to add more to as you think of them! If coming up with specific things feels too hard right now, try repeating basic affirmations, like \"I am strong\" or \"I matter.\" You can also ask a friend or loved one what they think are your best qualities to get you started. Practice self-compassion. There's a lot of talk about the importance of loving yourself, but that doesn't always feel doable and even just liking yourself can feel too hard. Start with trying to not hate or dislike yourself. Can you think of reasons why you deserve some kindness and patience? There's a lot going on in the world right now - the best you can do is good enough. There are a lot of different ways to form and be in a community. A community is a group of people who usually share interests, neighborhood, school, religion, or other things in common. Chat with a classmate you think you'd get along with. Just because you haven't hung out with someone before doesn't mean they wouldn't be interested in being friends. Talking to or making plans with someone new can be intimidating, but all new friendships have to start somewhere. Get involved outside of school. If you don't relate to other students around you, it's easy to feel alone and isolated at school. Luckily, school isn't your only option for connecting with peers. Look into local clubs, volunteer opportunities, library teen programs, sports, or community classes to meet people that you already have something in common with. Try to start a conversation with one new person every day. It might feel weird at first, but nothing has to come of it. Not all conversations turn into friendships, but getting used to interacting with new people will help you feel more prepared when you do meet someone who could be a great friend. Be friendly to people you see in passing. Quick interactions with people, like a Starbucks barista, the grocery store cashier, or your bus driver, wouldn't seem like they'd make a difference, but it plays a pretty big role in helping you feel connected to your broader community. Your community isn't just your friends - it's also the people you recognize as you go about your days.

Child Mind Institute. https://childmind.org/article/how-using-social-media-aects-teenagers/Loss is a part of life. We all face losing someone we love, whether from death, a breakup, or just growing apart from an old friend. It's not uncommon to experience this a lot during adolescence as friendships and relationships shift, loved ones age, and tragedies occur. Your generation has also faced more death and loss than many other generations when they were your age. You are growing up during a pandemic, regular mass shootings, and increased rates of youth suicide. YOUNG PEOPLE SAY LOSING SOMEONE THEY CARE ABOUT FEELS LIKE... \"I LOST A PIECE OF ME I NEVER KNEW I HAD\" \"THE AIR'S BEEN STOLEN FROM MY LUNGS\" \"I LOST EVERYTHING\" \"I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG TO DETER THEM\" \"AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH\" \"CRUSHING ALL OF THE INNOCENCE I TOOK FOR GRANTED\" \"LIKE A SHADOW I CAN'T REACH\"WHAT IS GRIEF? Grief is the reaction you have after experiencing a loss. It often impacts your mind, body, and spirit. Grief also refers to the process of coping with a loss: dealing with tough emotions, coming to terms with the loss, and finding ways to move forward. This doesn't mean forgetting about loved ones who have passed away or are no longer in your life - it means figuring out how to remember them and adjust to what your life looks like without them. The pain of grief is typically most intense right after the loss, but some people first feel shock or numbness before reality sinks in. People often experience grief in \"waves\" - maybe you have a great weekend and then see something that brings all of the hurt back, or you feel like you've mostly healed and then the one-year anniversary comes and you can't stop crying. Either way, you're bound to have some good days and some really tough days. There's no one way to grieve or limit on the amount of time you're allowed to feel this way.

Talk to someone you trust, write, draw, look at photo albums, or tell stories about your loved one. FIND MEANING IN THE RELATIONSHIP Losing someone you love can be so painful that you question if it's worth it to get that close to someone ever again. Spend some time reflecting on the positives of the lost relationship - what did they mean to you? What did you learn from them? Are there things you appreciate more now? MOVE YOUR BODY Playing a sport, taking a walk, stretching, or even just dancing around your room to your favorite songs can help release some stress and sadness. BE GENTLE WITH YOURSELF Everyone grieves differently and on their own timeline. Try not to compare your healing to others' journeys or have expectations about when you'll be \"over it.\" FIND LITTLE MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS It can be confusing to experience joy after a big loss - it might even feel wrong, like you shouldn't be okay. But happiness fuels hope and can help you start to move forward even though life looks different. DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP Many people find therapy or support groups helpful in dealing with loss, no matter where they are in the grieving process. It's especially important to seek help if you're thinking about hurting yourself or someone else. TIPS FOR PROCESSING GRIEF It can be hard to recognize the difference between grief and some mental health conditions, like depression or PTSD. If a few months have gone by and you still feel how you did at the beginning of your grieving process, or like your grief is making it hard to keep up with school, friends, and hobbies, take a mental health screen at mhascreening.org. THINGS YOUNG PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH AT HOMEWHEN HOME LIFE IS HARD Everyone's home life is different, and no ones is perfect. Growing up isn't easy and feeling sad or uncomfortable at home can add stress to other challenges you might be facing, like troubles with school and friends. Maybe you're even feeling guilty for feeling this way because you suspect that some of your peers \"have it worse.\" But that doesn't make your challenges any less big to you, and you're the one who has to deal with them. No matter what's making life difficult at home for you right now, your feelings about it are valid. Conflict with parents You may find yourself butting heads with your parents as you try to gain more independence. Or maybe you feel like they just don't understand you. Adults and young people have different priorities, so what's important to your parents might not make sense to you, and vice versa. And while some parts of growing up never change, there are many things about your youth that are very different from when your parents were young. There might be cultural differences at play too - depending on if and when your parents came to the U.S. from another country, you might be having an American childhood that is totally unfamiliar to them. Too many responsibilities Depending on interests, family relationships, and privilege, you and your peers likely have lots of different responsibilities. Maybe it's a vigorous schedule of sports and other extracurriculars, or it could be having to take care of chores and siblings while working part-time - or trying to balance all of the above. When you have more responsibilities than your friends, it can seem unfair and leave you feeling like you are missing out on the fun social things other people your age are doing or desperate for some downtime for yourself - which are valid feelings. Unaccepting family members Unfortunately, too many young people live with parents and families that aren't accepting of who they are. Whether it's because of your sexuality, gender expression, interests, style, or something else, feeling like your family doesn't love the real you is painful. This often means you can't talk to your parents or siblings about the challenges you face in your day-to-day life, and you may even feel like who you are is wrong. In some cases, this can escalate to bullying, verbal and emotional abuse, or even physical abuse. Life circumstances Sometimes young people have very adult problems. When your family is having money trouble, you don't have enough food, you don't have a stable place to live, or a family member has health issues, you may find that you're constantly worried. Being on high alert all the time is exhausting and can take a toll on your mental health. Maybe your family looks different than the \"mom, dad, kids\" stereotype. Having a different living situation or family structure than your peers can bring up feelings of stress, anxiety, shame, or uncertainty. It's important to remember that families can be made up of relatives, friends, and any other caregiver. Abuse Child abuse is when someone who is supposed to take care of you intentionally hurts you physically, sexually, or emotionally. It can be hard to recognize abuse because it's natural to trust that the people who are supposed to care for you wouldn't hurt you. If you feel scared or unsafe at home, you might be experiencing some form of abuse. No matter what, abuse is never your fault, and you deserve to feel safe around the people in your life. The safest thing you can do if you're being hurt (or are scared you will be hurt) by someone in your life is to talk to a trusted adult outside of your home.

This might be a physical space that you feel good in and can go to when needed, like a friend's house, library, or local park. You can also find this safety in social connections or groups through clubs, teams, volunteering, or places of worship. Look for small solutions Sometimes we can't fix the main problem, but there's often a way to make some progress. If you keep missing out on plans because you need to watch your sibling, talk to your parents to see if a family member or neighbor can do it, or if your sibling can go to a friend's house so that you have some free time. If you don't have enough to eat or a stable place to live, talk to a trusted teacher, coach, or your school counselor about resources that might be available for your family through school or the community. No matter what challenges you're facing, it can be useful to write down who is in your circle of support so that you know who is there to help you when you need it. Talk to your parents It's easy to forget that your parents are just people, too. They may be unsure how to interact with you, especially if you're their oldest or only child. Let them know what you want - to spend more time together, to have more conversations, to hear more about their experiences growing up. Share a bit about your life with them. This will only help so much if your parents are the biggest part of the problem, but if you think their hearts are in the right place, it's worth a try. Identify a safe adult Unfortunately, not everyone who becomes a parent is ready for that kind of commitment and responsibility to their child(ren). You deserve to have a safe person to look up to in your life. If it isn't your biological parent or guardian, look to other adults, like grandparents, aunts and uncles, teachers, or coaches for support. SOCIAL MEDIA AND MENTAL HEALTH Social media plays a big role in modern society, especially for young people - but it's still pretty new. It's one of the biggest differences about the way you're growing up and the way your parents, teachers, and other adults in your life grew up. While you might not be able to imagine a world ever existing without social media, researchers are still learning about its impact on mental health. Identity exploration. For many young people, especially those in more rural areas, social media can help them figure out who they are and learn from others like them. Connection. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, social media became an important way of staying connected to your friends and family who you couldn't see in person and making new friends online to help combat loneliness. Learning new things. You can't find new interests and things you love if you don't know they exist. Social media is a great way to stumble upon new hobbies, interests, trends, tutorials, books - the list goes on. Taking action. A lot of times, the issues the world is facing can seem too big and make you feel helpless, but social media can connect you to others for social change and help you make a difference through broader campaigns.FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Social media lets you stay tuned in to what others are doing at all times, which can lead to feeling left out if you aren't invited or just can't make the plans. Comparison. The things you see on social media may make you feel like your life is boring compared to others; you may find yourself comparing your body to photos of others (beware of filters and photoshop!); or you may judge how many likes/comments your posts get compared to other people. Cyberbullying and harassment. It is easier to be mean to people from behind a screen, so internet trolls and online bullying from people you know can take place. Information overload. The news or the general state of the world might make you feel down, but it can be hard to give yourself space when things are constantly in your news feed. On top of that, it can be hard to know which sources to trust. Unsafe people. Sometimes you don't know if the person you're talking to is really who they say they are. People may interact through completely fake profiles (catfishing), and others might lie about their reasons for interacting with you.

While there are definite benefits to being active on social media, it's important not to go overboard. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in - getting likes and comments triggers the reward system in your brain, keeping you craving more. If you are doing any of the following or notice yourself falling into these habits, it's probably time to address how social media is impacting you: Checking social media as soon as you wake up. Mindlessly scrolling through your feed longer than you planned to. Constantly updating your followers (photos of every meal, every activity you do). Anxiously checking for likes and comments. Scrolling social media often while spending in-person time with others. Comparing yourself excessively to others based on what they share.Reduce your use. It's easy to not realize how much time you're spending on social media each day or to get sucked into endless scrolling until all of a sudden, hours have gone by. Many phones have settings where you can view your screen time and put a limit on your app usage (your phone will notify you once you've hit your allotted time). You can choose to override it, but it's a great step in becoming more aware of your use. Unfollow or mute people whose content you don't want to see. Your social media feeds can be whatever you want them to be - and there's no reason for them to be full of posts that make you angry, sad, anxious, or have other negative feelings. Even if someone's posts don't bother you but just seeing their name triggers a negative reaction, take them off your feed. Muting is a great option if you're worried about them knowing you unfollowed them. Limit how many news sources you follow. It's important to stay informed, but the human brain wasn't meant to take in as much scary and bad news as most of us do these days. Instead of filling your feed with news, intentionally seek out information when you want it - and make sure it's coming from well-researched sources. This way you'll know you're prepared and in the mindset to consume news instead of having it pop up when you open Instagram for a brain break. Work on your mindset. We're all bound to see things we don't want to see on social media - friends hanging out without you, a cute couple when you're feeling lonely, or photo after photo of seemingly perfect influencers. This can put negative thoughts in your head that you can't seem to get out. Try out this tool to help overcome them: screening.mhanational.org/activity/overcoming-thoughts.
