As a Nepali-American Ann Arborite who recently spent two years living in Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu, I feel it would be a grave disservice to hoard all of my momentous revelations. Working full-time as a yoga instructor throughout my time in Nepal, I had the luxury of conducting yoga treks along various mountain ranges (Poon the biannual trekking seasons. Fortunately, my fluency in both English and Nepali allowed me a unique glimpse into the life of locals as well as a vast touristic populace. For those of us living in the Midwest, here are the top three life lessons I've gleaned \u2014 the lessons I feel are the most imperative for a more fulfilling life. I've included my own experiences from Nepal with each life lesson and added an applicable example for our more modern Western lifestyles. Greetings Matter! I will be the first to admit that I often walk past people without ever making eye contact, particularly during the winter months. Yoga treks in Nepal were some-times brutally lonely. Aside from the few people I had with me in the more rural regions (Khaptad/Gosaikunda), I would hike four or five hours without bumping into a single person. Inevitably, when such a meeting would finally occur, the fellow passerby would greet me, palms pressed at heart center, with a warm smile and a humble offering, \"Namaste.\" When literally translated from Sanskrit to English, the word Namaste means, \"The soul within me bows down to the soul within you.\" The physical gesture to accompany this word is always two palms uniting right above the heart with one palm symbolizing the greeter, the other palm representing the listener, and the placement of both gesticulating the sincerity of the greeting from deep within one's heart. Every time I experienced this, the brilliance and complete magnitude of the gesture took my breath away. When was the last time someone offered you, as a total stranger, the opportunity to unite souls? One way to apply this here in Ann Arbor is to make a connection with those around you. In English there's a similar belief \u2014 \"Eyes are the window to the soul,\" we often say. From now on, let's vow to make more eye contact as we walk past people. Maybe we can even extend a smile! It's a small start, but it could have a radi-cal effect. If someone is feeling invisible and wondering whether anyone notices him or her, direct, soulful eye contact coupled with a smile becomes as sacred as the word Namaste. Release the Kid Within The summit up to Kala Patthar is an arduous climb for a novice like yours truly. With the thinning air and in-creased altitude, I felt more frustrated and completely out of any Zen-mode I had hoped to achieve. Burnt out in the makeshift lobby of our rustic lodge at day's end, Yogi Wisdom from Nepal to Ann Arbor By Roshani Adhikary When was the last time someone offered you, as a total stranger, the opportunity to unite souls?If someone is feeling invisible and wondering whether anyone notices him or her, direct, soulful eye contact coupled with a smile becomes as sacred as the word Namaste. Photo by Julianne PopovecThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 9 I plopped myself down on a plastic lawn chair situated quite hazardously by the open, indoor fire pit. I reached into the pocket of my cargo pants in hopes of finding my Bodhi Balm, a handy natural muscle soother. Instead, I looked down to find a portable kaleidoscope I had forgotten to leave at home. Man, of course I would have this instead of my cream, I thought. I released a sigh of exasperation and slumped my shoulders. Adjacent to me was a Tibetan Buddhist monk from the nearby Tengboche Monas- tery dressed in the traditional maroon robe and golden silk blouse. I'd noticed him during our hike. Sometimes he was ahead of us, sometimes he was behind. All the while a content look remained on his face. He raised an eyebrow and asked, in Ne-pali, what the matter was. A bit embarrassed, I confessed how unprepared I felt. \"To make matters worse, I left my muscle soother at home and packed this stupid toy instead,\" I blurted before realizing how negative I sounded. The monk's training was in painting Thangkas, elaborate paintings on silk with intricate mandalas or Buddhist deities. He had never seen a kaleidoscope before. \"Toy?\" he asked, pointing with curiosity to the object in my hands.\"Yeah, it's called a kaleidoscope. Here, have a look.\" I extended my arm and ex- plained, \"Shut one eyelid and peek in with the other. Point it to the fire so there's enough light to see the patterns,\" I directed almost robotically. The perfect student, the monk immediately did as I said. Before I could even finish offering him instruc-tions, I noticed the most spectacular look of wonder appear on his face. The sheer astonishment as he pulled the kaleidoscope away from his face to cry, \"This is bril-liant!\" was so endearing. Something about the magic in that moment provided me with a much-needed second gust of life. I gave him my kaleidoscope as a token of my gratitude and carried on the rest of my climb with a similar sense of wonder. Recently, I've started teaching multiple sessions of kid's yoga classes. To see the excitement in the faces of these tiny Yogis is awesome. A way we can release the kid within us is simple: take a moment to soak in the experience. Visit the Hands-On Museum, paint with your hands, play on the grounds of the Arboretum. You won't regret it. Disconnect to ReconnectLadies and gentlemen, my name is Roshani, and I am a Facebook addict. To give you an idea of just how bad my addiction is, I will be quite transparent: I have four active Facebook accounts. I check the newsfeed on all four accounts like clockwork, and I change my status on a daily basis. Going on the yoga treks in Nepal was invigorat-ing to my spirit because it forced me into a situation where I had to disconnect from modern day technology. On the more rural routes, there was no electricity or running water, let alone Wi-Fi. These two-week long journeys provided a lifetime of renewal as I reconnected with nature. In our lives it seems impossible to apply this life lesson. Not everyone has the means, the time, or the capability to escape to the Himalayas. Not to worry. Allocate one weekend a month where you shut off your cell phones, unplug your TV, hide your laptops and iPads, and just enjoy the autumn season. Observe the changing colors of the leaves. Take a walk in your neighborhood. Maybe even knock on your neighbor's door, take a moment to chit-chat, invite them over for tea or coffee, and share how your days have been going. If you don't have one weekend a month to go technology-free, try one weekend a year, a day a month, or even just one afternoon. Make the time to disconnect. Reconnecting with yourself is the greatest gift you can offer your soul. Namaste! Roshani Adhikary is a certified yoga instructor and a freelance writer.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 10 By Lynda Gronlund This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses. New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Elephant Ears, a baby and children's store located in Kerrytown, has developed an educational gift registry experience for families expecting a new baby. The experience is like a consultation: a trained staff member asks the family many questions to make recommendations for items to include on the gift registry. The staff member supports and values the family's choices. Families may want to discuss topics such as whether to breastfeed or not and for how long, and whether to practice \"babywearing\" (carrying the child using a sling, so that the parents' hands are free during much of the day). While decisions are placed firmly in the hands of the family, staff members can provide information on the most recent research and best practices in these areas. They actively listen to help the family express their expectations and desires, and then assist the family in creating a gift registry that will allow relatives and friends to give the family the items they truly want and need for the baby. Babywearing educator Angelique Geehan explains that the process is \"less about sales; more about matching.\" She says a lot of expectations are placed on families regarding baby registries, and Elephant Ears can even serve as an impartial third party that can field questions from well-meaning gift givers who may not understand the plans and intentions of the new parents. Store owner Becca Morse is a lactation and babywearing educator and has trained her staff to be knowledgeable about the products in the store and their use. Families who may feel overwhelmed by the registering process can be empowered by the consulting experience and gain clarity in their plans for caring for the child. Morse is selective about the products she carries \u2014 they must be well-made and consistent with current best practices; it helps if they are also fair trade and sustainable. Elephant Ears carries a wide range of items, including bedding, diapering products, nursing products, clothing, slings and carriers, feeding items, toys, strollers, car seats, and more. The store has a price-match guarantee, and the high-quality products and personalized experience may come at a more reasonable price than new families would expect. Elephant Ears is located at 415 N. Fifth Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, and its website is www.elephantearsonline.com. The store can be reached by phone at (734)622-9580 or by email at sales@elephantearsonline.com. Brian Ashin, L.M.S.W., C.G.P., mo ved his psychotherapy practice from Oak Valley Drive to Kerrytown in April 2012 and has recently added an evening group therapy time for interested people.

After living in Austin, Texas, for 22 years, musician, teacher, and brainwave optimization coach Laurel Emrys has returned \"home\" to Ann Arbor. Musically, Emrys plays in the band Celtic Jam and performs as a soloist on harp and flute. She has designed and leads an interactive musical exhibit for children at the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum. She teaches harp, flute, music theory, composition, and piano lessons to children and some adults, and she is also a piano tuner and recording engineer. Her 1996 Serenity Records album Welcome to Earthaven was voted several years running as the \"best album\" for bodywork and massage by the American Massage Association. Having suffered from chronic pain in the past, Emrys is also passionate about healing and has found brainwave optimization to be very relevant to her interest and talents in music and sound. Brainwave optimization uses sound to help the brain recognize and change faulty patterns. She has developed a brainwave optimization coaching system called BrainFlex, which teaches people to \"self-optimize\" without always depending on computer equipment as in traditional brainwave optimization. She explains that BrainFlex helps people \"tune-in\" to their brainwave states and shift themselves out of habitual \"fight-or-flight\" conflict states. Part of the system is called Resonant Core Tuning (RCT), which Emrys used to conquer her own severe chronic pain. RCT uses a mix of breathwork, core muscle strengthening, sound healing tones, and inner body awareness to heal and care for the self. Within six months, she will be publishing a book about the BrainFlex system. Emrys says that BrainFlex is her \"way of contributing to growing world peace,\" by starting from the individual and resonating outward to affect others positively. She says that it is an excellent way to incorporate \"the cosmic plus the practical,\" having benefits both for the self and for the world affected by the self. Emrys is available for musical performances, music teaching, and tuning as well as for coaching in the BrainFlex system. She says that despite enjoying her life in Texas, she is happy to be back in Ann Arbor, which feels like her \"real home.\" Laurel Emrys' website is in progress at www.laurelemrys.com. She can be reached at (734) 761-7699 or laurelemrys@yahoo.com. Anita Rubin-Meiller, L.M.S.W., has been a clinical social worker in private practice since 2001. This year she has added a new focus on the healing power of self-compassion that she will offer in individual sessions, workshops, and groups. This work is offered in the form of workshops: \"Healing Through Compassionate Life Review\" and \"Living Gently with Ourselves: A Group for the Practice of Mindful Self-Compassion.\" The new focus has come through Rubin-Meiller's weaving together of her experience working with older adults and trauma survivors with more recent training in Mindful Self-Compassion practices, and her own life experiences and spiritual path. Rubin-Meiller developed Compassionate Life Review after studying Mindful Self-Compassion, a therapeutic practice created by Christopher Continued on page 12 Brian Ashin, L.M.S.W ., C.G.P., moved his psychotherapy practice to Kerrytown in April 2012 and has recently added an evening group therapy time.

Compassionate Life Review is a therapeutic process that can help put one's life into perspective. It is especially useful at times of big transitions or when one is faced with multiple life changes and challenges, and struggling to find new meaning and purpose. The Compassionate Life Review process can foster connection between the lessons learned, the strengths gathered, and the unique qualities of the self that have been expressed over a lifetime. Incorporating practices such as journaling, Mindful Self-Compassion, and trauma resolution (if indicated) through Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), it can also awaken awareness of regrets, unfinished grief, and unresolved issues in a way that allows healing and self-forgiveness. These workshops are scheduled through local business Intentional Legacies (formerly Peaceful Crossings; www.peacefulcrossings.com) and are listed on Rubin-Meiller's website. Living Gently is a 10-week group that is offered twice a year and focuses on skill building with a combination of teachings, discussion, and meditation practices for fostering mindfulness, lovingkindness, self-compassion, and self-forgiveness. The next Living Gently group is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, September 10. More information is available at www.gentlebe-ing.com.

The People's Food Co-op in downtown Ann Arbor is the first grocery store in Michigan and the second co-op in the nation to adopt the HowGood sustainability rating system. HowGood was developed by brothers Alexander and Arthur Gillett after seven years of research. The system allows shoppers to see at a glance what products are the most sustainable with labels of \"Good,\" \"Very Good,\" and \"Great.\" The ratings are based on three factors in their manufacturing: environment (carbon footprint, waste management, treatment of animals, etc.); social responsibility (corporate ethics, working conditions, etc.); and product integrity (pesticide use, preservative content, chemical additives, etc.). HowGood has rated over 100 thousand individual products so far, which are searchable at www.howgood.com. To come up with the ratings, researchers examine companies for manufacturing practices and labor history by searching legal records, government documents, industry and labor union publications, and other sources. Then they look at individual products, gleaning information from growers, manufacturers, government documents and periodicals. Approximately 65 percent of products examined do not make the \"Good,\" \"Very Good,\" or \"Great\" lists. According to Karen Vigmostad of the People's Food Co-Op, the rating system is an excellent tool to help keep consumers informed, but \"due diligence is still needed. You will want to continue to consider how each product meets your particular needs and interests.\" In regard to GMOs (genetically modified foods), HowGood does not give a better score for a company adopting a no-GMO policy, but GMOs have an impact on the ratings by the growing practices, sourcing standards, and often the ingredient profile scores. The People's Food Co-op is located at 216 N. Fourth Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. The store is online at www.peoplesfood.coop and can be reached by phone at (734)994-9174 or by email at info@peoplesfood.coop. Books by Area Authors Ann Arbor spiritual medium Joan St. John published Mists of Mackinac: Forgotten Folklore, Fantasy, and Phenomena with professional ghost hunter Bob Kaczor in October 2012. The book details the ghosts of Mackinac Island, a place rich with ghost stories, some many hundreds years old. A ghost hunting guide is included for those who are looking to experience Mackinac hauntings firsthand, and the book details actual communications channeled by St. John. Kaczor offers practical advice in the ghost hunting section: \"Remain calm and understand what you are getting into. You have chosen this activity; be mindful that what you may experience can be disconcerting and frightening.\" St. John is also featured in the book Haunted Travels of Michigan by Kathleen Tedsen and Beverlee Rydel. Mists of Mackinac is available in paperback from Amazon.com and electronically through Kindle, Nook, Smashwords, and Kobo. Crazy Wisdom will host a reading with St. John on Tuesday, October 22 at 7:00 p.m., and the book will be available for purchase. Joan St. John's website is www.joanstjohn.com. Author Trish LeSage published her second book: Manifesting Success in Relationships, Career, and Business via Numerology in January of 2013 . The book teaches readers what energies are affecting their lives and how to change them so that they may live a more rewarding and fulfilling life of happiness, success, and abundance. Numerology is the study of the significance of numbers in our lives. The book includes practical advice such as how to select a website, business, or pen name with numerology in mind to maximize success. LeSage's books are available through Amazon in paperback or electronic form. Trish LeSage's website is beyond3dbooks.com. She can be emailed at beyond3dbooks@yahoo.com. Upcoming Events Ann Arbor Active Against ALS (A2A3) will host a Family Field Day on Sunday, September 29 at Burns Park from 1-5 p.m. All proceeds from this event will go toward ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) research. A2A3 was formed in 2008 when Bob Shoeni, a U-M professor and active kids' sports coach, was diagnosed with ALS. According to the organization's website, \"ALS is a disease that paralyzes the body but leaves the mind intact.... Most ALS patients are in a wheelchair and using a ventilator within a few of years of diagnosis.\" There is currently no cure or effective treatment for ALS, and A2A3 explains that research on the disease is underfunded despite the fact that 30,000 Americans suffer from it. Shoeni's friends, family and students formed A2A3 to raise funds toward research for a cure. The group also raises awareness, encourages physical activity (a passion of Shoeni's), and strives to create a compassionate community.

Local retiree Peg Rosenkrands along with her husband Dwight Ebaugh will host esoteric spiritual teacher and author William Meader at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, in October, in his first Ann Arbor appearance. A retired nurse, Rosenkrands describes herself as a \"results-oriented, volunteer social-change agent.\" Since 2009 she has been a student in the Morya Federation Program (www.moryafederation.net), an international online esoteric school of meditation, study, and service headed by U-M alumnus Michael D. Robbins. Rosenkrands and Ebaugh first heard William Meader speak in 2010 through a conference organized by Robbins in Mesa, Arizona. They agreed that Meader's communicative talents made his esoteric presentations very accessible to both beginner and advanced audiences. This year, Meader is expanding his teaching across the Midwest and Rosenkrands has invited him to come to Ann Arbor. Meader will offer four public talks from October 16-18: three related to the Human Soul and one to the Soul of Humanity. The nature and origin of the Soul is addressed \u2014 that intermediary residing within the tri-part nature of every human being (Spirit, Soul, Body) and Humanity itself. Of special importance is the Soul's challenging relationship to the personality as the Soul's Purpose seeks its creative expression in one's life. Additionally, the seven types of Souls (energy expressions known as the Seven Rays) are introduced. \"The Tibetan\" (Master Djwhal Kuhl) states that this is the new psychology of the future. It is an integral psychology, inclusive of all humanity, and it lays a foundation for thinking about the Soul of Humanity. In his presentation on the Soul of Humanity, Meader addresses the \"present period of unprecedented crisis and change\" as the antecedent to a new beginning for humanity. Meader's book Shine Forth: The Soul's Magical Destiny will be available at Crazy Wisdom, and he will offer a limited number of individual 60-minute in-depth astrological consultations for $125, which can be arranged with Rosenkrands by phone or email. Peg Rosenkrands can be reached with questions or to schedule consultations with Meader at (517)580-9630 or peg.rosenkrands@gmail.com. William Meader's website is meader.org.

Local birth and postpartum doula and parent educator Catherine Fischer now offers a parenting class and free teleseminars for parents of young children. Her four-week class, \"Where the Rubber Meets the Road: Strategies for the Emotional Challenges of Parenting,\" will be offered first in September and October, then regularly throughout the year. \"Parenting is an emotional project. I don't think any of us are fully prepared for the ways we will be emotionally challenged as parents or for the intensity of it. Add to that the typical stresses on parents such as isolation, exhaustion, confusion and guilt, and the parenting that we want to enjoy can end up feeling burdensome and overwhelming,\" says Fischer. The class will teach stress-reducing listening tools, which help parents better understand and respond to their children's emotions as well as their own. These tools will help parents respond to tantrums, become better at successfully setting limits, support close sibling relationships, and take the edge off of parental exhaustion, confusion, and guilt. Class will be supplemented by outside readings from the Listening to Children series of booklets by Patty Wipfler and from Hand in Hand Parenting. During each class meeting, parents will have a chance to listen to one another. \"No parent is the bottomless well of attention our children wish we were. We put out so much attention every day, and need to refill our reserves by being listened to ourselves. So emotional support for parents is built into the class, and I will encourage parents to continue including it in their lives in an ongoing manner,\" Fischer says. \"These strategies are primarily about how and when to pay attention to children's feelings through listening and playing, and they are supported by brain research. It's not about being permissive with bad behavior. Parents can still set firm limits. They will just learn to do it more effectively.\" Fischer began using the skills and strategies of the Listening to Children series when her son was young. \"These tools are what got our family through early childhood,\" Fischer states. Her free fall teleseminar is for parents whose children are reluctant to leave the house in the morning. \"From Procrastination to Cooperation: Transforming Those 'Getting Out the Door' Struggles\" will be offered at no charge on Monday, September 16, 7:30-8:00 p.m. The teleseminar will introduce strategies for helping children feel connected and safe in the morning to ease the transition to school or daycare. In her birth and postpartum doula work, Fischer offers non medic al practical and emotional support, which is shown by research to shorten labor, reduce the chance of having a C-section, increase confidence, improve breastfeeding success, and reduce postpartum depression. She specializes in postpartum care and breastfeeding support. Fischer brings more than 25 years of combined experience as a teacher, mother, parent support group leader, and doula to her teaching. She also holds a master's degree in education from Goddard College.Catherine Fischer can be reached at (734) 395 5244 or b y email at catherine@ supportforgrowingfamilies.com.

New Practitioners and Businesses Diane Miller has opened Ringstar Studio, a space for the teaching and practice of physical arts ranging from stage combat, aerial and circus arts, juggling, and hooping to theatre, dance, yoga, and more. As assistant director for local stage combat group Ring of Steel, Miller had been looking for a new home for the group's practices. As an aerial silk artist herself, she realized there was a greater need for a venue in the community of physical artists, many of whom work outside when the weather is warm but have trouble finding space to practice in the winter or in inclement weather. Ringstar Studio is the solution to this problem. Miller has assembled teachers and students of various physical art forms to make use of the large space, which is equipped with mirrors, theatre lighting, and aerial rig points as well as floors with removable martial arts mats, gymnastics mats, and crash pads. Miller's hope is for the community to \"pool as many resources as possible\" in order to create a well-equipped and versatile space for widely diverse classes and practices. As the space develops, Miller hopes to add more equipment and resources, such as a green-screen wall. Ringstar is still developing its class schedule, and Miller is open to speaking with physical arts teachers and groups about using the space. Miller says she wants to provide an affordable and open space for creative people to practice, share, and learn new skills. In addition to Ring of Steel, the circus collective Ann Arbor Performance Dojo will be using the space, along with other individual teachers. Miller herself plans to offer beginning classes in aerial silk for children and adults. Meditation classes are also part of the current plans, and will be donation based. The studio is also open to rent for private parties and practice time. Ringstar Studio is located at 3907 Varsity Drive, Ann Arbor MI 48108. Diane Miller can be reached at inquiries@a2ringstar.com or (585) 307-0402, and Ringstar's website is a2ringstar.com. Local craniosacral therapist and Quantum Touch practitioner Lennen Chance has opened Chance Holistic Therapy and is accepting new clients. Chance practices at the Ann Arbor Institute of Massage Therapy, where she is in charge of admissions and academic coordination. She says that after starting out in a retail career, she was inspired to go into holistic therapy when her mother passed away from pancreatic cancer. She felt the experience showed her \"how little Western medicine can really do for people.\" Chance specializes in helping people with chronic pain and says that she can help people take less medication. As a craniosacral therapist and Quantum Touch practitioner, she is able to help even frail elders who are experiencing a lot of pain with the light touch of these modalities. She is also trained in neuromuscular and myofascial therapies, which use deeper, heavier touch and can be used for athletes and others who are able to benefit from it.

Marjorie Farnsworth, certified hypnotherapist, opened Spirit Assist Hypnotherapy LLC at the beginning of this year. Farnsworth was trained in hypnotherapy by Dr. Philip Holder, one of the United States' foremost hypnotherapists and trainers. She was a corporate middle manager for over 20 years, and said she became interested in various forms of alternative medicine around 2001, when she had some negative experiences with traditional medicine. At the same time, she observed her colleagues in corporate management suffering from high blood pressure, anxiety, and, in her words, \"general rage,\" taking more and more medications to counteract the side effects, and they still had the problems they were seeking to fix. Farnsworth began to explore shamanic ritual healing, meditation, and herbalism, and she also traveled widely. Eventually, she took another corporate job in Ann Arbor, where she was in charge of logistics and had to be \"very results-oriented.\" At that point, she developed a serious interest in hypnotherapy, which she says is also very results-oriented. While traditional talk therapy may go on for long periods of time and patients may not know where to start in solving their problems, Farnsworth says that hypnotherapy is for folks who \"know what they want and want to get it done.\" She explains that she typically sees clients for just three sessions for each issue they are working on. The first session is two hours long, and she works with the client to understand exactly what needs to change and what suggestions will resonate most for the individual. The client and Farnsworth design the suggestions together, ensuring the best result. The following two sessions are shorter, consisting of refining and reinforcing the suggestions based on the client's experiences between sessions. Farnsworth says many misconceptions exist about hypnotherapy, and that it is not like the stage shows or movie scenes that are so common. She explains that it is impossible to harm someone using hypnotherapy, and that a person will not do anything under hypnosis that he or she did not want to do before entering the hypnotic state. This is why it is so important to personalize the suggestions for the person receiving them. Farnsworth explained that suggestions must appeal to the individual's subconscious mind in order to be effective. This is why she spends a lot of time during the first session conversing with the client, asking questions such as, \"What will it feel like when you reach your goal?\" She describes hypnotherapy as relaxing, comforting, and \u2014 because the suggestions need to appeal to the subconscious mind's \"inner child\"\u2014 fun. It is not a magic bullet, she explains \u2014 the person has to really want to change in order to see results. For example, she has seen patients who have come to her for smoking cessation who truly did not want to quit and were only seeking help because family members were nagging them. Hypnotherapy is not magic, and will not make them want to quit smoking; it can only help in accomplishing changes that people truly desire. Through hypnotherapy, Farnsworth can assist people with weight loss, smoking cessation, pain management, sports performance, stress management, self-esteem issues, phobias, and more. Spirit Assist is located at 4488 Jackson Road, Suite 3, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. The website for the practice is www.spiritassisthypnotherapy.com, and Marjorie Farnsworth can be reached at info@spiritassist.net or (734) 206-4204. Registered Dietician Shannon Amori has opened a holistic practice at the New Life Energies Wellness Center located on Ann Arbor's West Side. In addition to her R.D. license, Amori holds a certificate in Medicinal Herbal Studies from the Naturopathic School for the Healing Arts, and will be completing the school's Massage and Energy Medicine program in September. Currently, Amori offers nutritional consultations and assessments and specializes in both cooking and food preparation demonstrations as well as kitchen assessments. She educates her clients not only in what they should be eating, but in how they can create meals to fit their nutritional plans. She incorporates her training in plant-based medicine by making the beneficial plants part of the diet. Amori also offers advice on supplements although she prefers \"real foods\" to supplementation. She says that proper nutrition can help build the immune system, which in turn makes the entire body healthier and more resistant to illness.

Massage and bodywork will complement her nutritional services and help her clients to feel their best.

Eight local artists have formed Dancing Dog Gallery (D2G), which will open in September in downtown Ann Arbor in the former Herb David Guitar Studio building. The studio will be run cooperatively by the founding members: Missy Cowan, Sue Finley, Sophie Grillet, Molly Indura, Bill Knudstrup, Matruka Sherman, Susan Clinthorne, and Sarah Clark Davis. The artists use a variety of styles and media including photography, painting, pastels, and mixed media. After renovations, the first floor of the building will be a gallery for exhibitions of contemporary, original fine art while the second floor will be divided into eight individual work studios for artists to rent, with a common area for their use. The founding artists hope to make the gallery wheelchair accessible with a ramp, and (at the time of this writing) are raising funds through Kickstarter to help defray the costs associated with remodeling the space. The group is in the process of attaining 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. The Grand Opening event will be Friday, September 6 from 7 to 10 p.m. with art, live music, and wine. Afterward, the gallery will be open daily. Dancing Dog Gallery is located at 302 E. Liberty Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 and can be reached at (734) 531-6565 or DancingDogGallery@gmail.com. More information can be found online at www.dancingdoggallery.biz. Lomi Lomi massage therapist Stefani Colbourne began offering bodywork in her private home studio in Saline last year under the name Crescent Moon Massage. Originally from Hawaii, Lomi Lomi is a \"heart-centered\" bodywork that was initially reserved for royalty. What makes Lomi Lomi different is the blend of forearm strokes that Colbourne said are \"like a dance,\" otherwise known as \"flying meditation.\" Each session begins with a sacred chant or prayer after which the client is invited to set his or her own intention, whether that is simply to relax or to release a past trauma. This bodywork combines the use of prayer (pule), breath (ha), and energy (mana) with long flowing movements designed to relax the recipient in body, mind, and spirit. The focus is to invite an opening of the heart and a shift of awareness so the recipient can better let go of old negative patterns. Because the Lomi Lomi practitioner works intuitively from the heart-center, the recipient experiences a reawakening of the spirit. This enables the recipient to become fully present and fully aware of their connection to self and spirit, and to their purpose in life. Eleven years ago, Colbourne herself was able to work through her own stress and trauma by receiving Lomi Lomi treatments from practitioners Tom and Alani Kuzma, who inspired her to learn the method. She began her studies with them and moved on to train with Tamara Mondragon at the Davis Institute in California. She will travel to Hawaii to receive additional training from Master Kahunas in the spring of 2014. The cozy atmosphere in Colbourne's studio invites clients with a bubbling water fountain, soothing Himalayan salt lamps, and relaxing ambient music. In addition to Lomi Lomi, she offers a range of other modalities to support natural health, including Rain Drop Therapy, ear candling, breath work, and Reiki. Tandem Lomi Lomi is also available for couples, for which Colbourne partners with fellow therapist Jennifer Miller. Stefani Colbourne can be reached at (734) 846-9949 or by email at crescent. moon.lomi@gmail.com. Visit the Crescent Moon Massage website at crescentmoonmassage.net.

Life Lessons from Health Coach Dixie Time for some hard truths, folks. There will come a time in your life when you'll need to admit that perhaps you don't know best. It may come when you're contemplating applying that fourth layer of duct tape to a leaky pipe; it may come while you're staring in mute horror at the result of a daring self-inflicted haircut. If, for you, this insight hits when you're contemplating a fast food lunch as a distraction from a soul-sapping job, then health coach Dixie Horlock Lemke is the woman to turn to. Unlike many of her clients, my physical and emotional state wasn't too far gone when I sought her out, so I didn't have any expectations as I climbed the stairs to Crazy Wisdom's second floor for our meeting. She was waiting for me and rose to shake my hand. Dixie is a composed, fit, serene woman, and her handshake and the sparkle in her eye were enough to convince me that she could be trusted to teach me a thing or two about vivacity. After getting to know each another for a few minutes, we got down to the real business. She asked, \"What are some things you'd like to work on?\" I was taken aback by the simplicity and incisiveness of the question. After I had considered my answers for a moment, I found myself opening up about my energy level, the challenges of living with a partner, and the secret to a chocolate avocado mousse. The thing is with Dixie, no topic is off limits. She has the mentality that all aspects of your life contribute to your health, not just how often you can choke down a bushel of kale or how often you hit the gym. In our meeting, she expressed much more concern about my satisfaction and happiness with different aspects of my life, even cooking up an engaging little activity for me to illustrate the areas that need work. Dixie's holistic approach to health coaching no doubt stems from her experience practicing and teaching \"whole yoga\" \u2014 a comprehensive approach that includes not only breath and poses, but meditation and lifestyle. Eventually, we got around to very practical ways I could improve my health. She had gotten to know my weak points by this point, and her suggestions were simple, salient, and scrumptious. Just because I'm a starving writer doesn't mean I need to literally be starving; she recommended affordable, delicious meals tailored just for me (a recipe for a salsa salad bowl was to die for and right up my alley), and helpful hints on shopping smarter (i.e., cheaper). I left our session feeling focused and empowered by all of the small, practical tools Dixie had given me. Her more standard engagement is far more involved and lasts about twelve sessions over six months, and I have no doubt that in that time she could remake almost anyone's life into a shining beacon of healthitude. For more information about Dixie's training and her programs, visit her website at healthcoachdixie.com, or like her on Facebook. Her page is full of amazing recipes and tips.An Astrological Reading with Elizabeth Sullivan I found myself on the receiving end of a radically new experience when I walked into a room and sat down with a stranger who I felt knew more about me than I knew about myself. This peculiar feeling, familiar to those who have had a reading from a professional as capable as Elizabeth Sullivan, is one that had a card-carrying, doubtful Thomas like me a wee bit uncomfortable at the outset. Her office was unassuming: absent were the tapestries, gently smoking incense sticks, and crystal balls I had assumed would accompany my astrological reading. Once Elizabeth and I sat down, her warmth, thoughtfulness, and striking diligence allayed my fears and opened my mind to her insights. She didn't wait to hit me with some \"wow factor\" material. She began by saying right at the beginning that my chart (which, by the way, was bafflingly complex when I snuck a peek), had revealed that despite my having been in a tumultuous astrological house basically since I was seven, I was due to emerge this coming September. On the heels of this hopeful glimpse into the future, she praised the strong enthusiasm and optimism she had read. She tempered this astrological comfort with the hard fact that sometimes my enthusiasm can cause me to become frustrated and overwhelmed when I bite off more than I can chew. Her forthrightness in this regard won me over more than anything else. Elizabeth Sullivan takes her work very seriously and exudes a strong sense of responsibility and duty toward her clients. We spoke for a quite a while, and she told me that her teacher (the renowned Jyotishi and author Hart de Fouw) had advised her to always remember three things: never take away a person's hope, never take away his will, and you can't see grace in a person's chart. Sullivan talked fondly of her mentor and described with rapturous detail the circumstances that brought them together \u2014 a series of truly amazing coincidences, hidden messages, and other things that started to sound a lot like destiny when put together. With this newfound respect, I hungrily absorbed the advice Elizabeth proffered while looking carefully at my chart. A real eyebrow raiser was her comment that I would do well in government. She assured me that my tendency toward being the \"noble crusader\" (a moniker I'm now quite fond of) would help in this regard.

The contents of my package were the source of much excitement, lots of uncertainty, and a considerable dose of trepidation. My little bundle of joy was in fact the bountiful and storied Babo Juice Cleanse, and it was all I was supposed to consume for the next three days. (This whole baby metaphor just became really macabre...) Upon waking the next morning, I leapt out of bed, excited to begin my journey to a detoxified, strong, and dietetically liberated version of myself. I started off with their eye opener, which looks like a squirt of red goo in the bottom of a coffee cup with a jaunty little teabag floating atop it. But with the addition of boiling water, it became the elixir of life: composed of agave, cayenne pepper, and green tea, it curbed my hunger in a flash and was addictively spicy. With my appetite satisfied, I didn't reach for my \"breakfast\" for nearly two hours. The smoothie that awaited me was a thick, glutinous avocado concoction peppered with chia seeds. It was chock full of protein and healthy calories to kick start my day. I was feeling so zesty in fact that I bounced down to the gym and had one of the most vigorous workouts in recent memory. Upon arriving home, I downed an energy shot that was mostly wheatgrass and ginger. It went down like super healthy pond water with a kick. Lunchtime brought me a juice that tasted mostly of beet and so was an enticing red color \u2014 a real treat for this borscht lover. I was still going strong, hunger was a non-issue, my energy levels were great, and I was feeling sharp and focused. My \"happy hour\" juice was the most delicious of the whole program and one I still crave. It was a citrusy, kale-y blend that was a refreshing distillation of an entire produce section (chard, bell pepper, tomato, ginger, and so on). The last juice of the day was a hearty strawberry-banana and hemp milk smoothie that I drank quite late because I have a crippling fear of going to bed hungry. The first day was finished! I had done it! I was master of my domain! Dear readers, the less said about the next two days the better. I found myself staring at my darling boyfriend with a mixture of longing and contempt as he ate his meals. The juices still tasted top notch and kept me nourished, but I started to feel like one of those starving cartoons that looks at those around her and imagines them as giant steaks or sandwiches. I learned that a woman cannot live on juice and a smug sense of superiority alone, but the exercise in willpower and feeding your body exactly what it needs was invaluable. The Babo Juice Cleanse takes place every first Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of the month. For more information, download the online brochure at baboannarbor.com.

HELLERWORK + STRUCTURAL MEDICINE -Dr. Jay Sandweiss, DO, Ann Arbor, MI.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 25 By Syndy Sweeney Photography by Joni Strickfaden Dr. Swaroop Bhojani has a long-time fascination with food and how it affects health. Owner of the Ann Arbor eatery Hut-K Chaats, Bhojani has devoted himself to the subject through years of personal experience as well as academic study. Revealing a personality as large and lovely as his laugh, Bhojani, 44, says that his focus on food came in the form of competitive eating when he was a teenager in Hyderabad, India. He and his friends and relatives would engage in informal eating competitions as a way to amuse themselves during wedding celebrations that would last for days. Bhojani could easily eat several pounds of sweets in one sitting, and describes how he once ate 500 almonds with his cousins. Bhojani continued to eat competitively at university and into adulthood. Often placing third or fourth, he would win free lunches and cash prizes. Recalling these events, Bhojani laughs. \"You're given four or five straws, and you have to make one straw...how fast can a person finish a single bottle of cola through [this] long straw?\" Some of the competitions were dangerous, however \u2014 such as those in which participants consumed salt water or chilies. Bhojani says his competitive eating \"first started just for fun. And I wish somebody would have told me then that's extremely unhealthy...the damage that you do to your body is amazing.... Sometimes, it's irreversible.\" As an adolescent, any negative repercussions to his body were offset by daily karate classes and cycling 25 kilometers a day. But in 1988, when Bhojani was twenty, as his life became increasingly stressful, his exercise dwindled. While working on his bachelor of science degree, Bhojani also took care of his seventeen-year-old brother, Pradeep, who suffered from osteogenic sarcoma (bone cancer). The day Bhojani took his very last final exam before graduating, Pradeep passed away. Rather than follow his family into one of its businesses in the cable industry or luggage manufacturing, Bhojani became determined to find a cure for cancer. Three months later, he began attending Osmania University in Hyderabad, and he earned his masters degree in biochemistry in 1990. He then immediately began \"I went to cancer research...to find a cure for cancer.... Literally, a cure for cancer lies in the prevention. Nothing better than food in preventing it.\" \u2014 Dr. Swaroop BhojaniDr. Bhojani Bhojani's Unique Journey with Food and Health \"I remember when one of my cousins told me I had become big. And I asked him, 'In the sense that I look [like] a real adult now?' And he says, 'No, you've become fat!'\" \u2014 Dr. Swaroop BhojaniContinued on page 26Back 2 Roots: 13 Grain Flat BreadThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 26 pursuing his doctorate at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. In 1997, he received his Ph.D. in cellular immunology, working on nucleic acid reactive antibodies and how they affect cell growth and proliferation. While studying at the Institute, Bhojani used its lab to conduct another kind of experiment. Dorm residents were not allowed to have stoves in their rooms, so when the faculty left at night, Bhojani would make chaats (Hindi for a type of sweet junk food common in India) for himself and his fellow students. Often fried, chaats manage to hit all of the notes for taste and texture: sour, tart, spicy, crunchy, and salty. According to Bhojani, they are a \"multisensory food, and Indians love these kind[s] of food.... On the days I would be making chaats , I would get a huge request from a variety of different people \u2014 from my friends' friends and their friends!\" During this time, Bhojani began to gain weight. Although weighing oneself in India is not common, others could see Bhojani's face filling out. \"It was very visible,\" he says. \"I remember when one of my cousins told me I had become big . And I asked him, 'In the sense that I look [like] a real adult now?' And he says, 'No, you've become fat!'\" In fact, his friends and family started calling him motu, which in Hindi means \"the fatso.\" Bhojani embraced his new nickname. \"I did not feel anything negative. The tone was a very caring and loving one, I liked it.... It was not with the intention to make me feel bad.\" But the weight gain began to affect Bhojani's health. After he went to work as a cancer researcher at the University of Michigan in 2001, following a four-year stint at the Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin, Germany, Bhojani learned from a routine physical exam that he was pre-diabetic and that his liver enzymes were elevated. Eventually, he was diagnosed with Type II diabetes. \"The doctors told me I may have to do a liver scan just to see whether my liver is functioning properly,\" Bhojani says. \"And when we did the liver scans, we found out that I have fatty liver...fat starts depositing around the liver and also goes to neighboring area[s].... It impedes the proper functions of these organs.... And that's the time I actually seriously started looking at my food and started reading about diabetes, nutrition, health.\" Besides, Bhojani didn't have only his health to think about but that of his family: his wife, Sumi, and their two young sons, now 11 and 6. \"It was shocking...my ignorance,\" he says. \"We were actually circulating it to our kids.\" As he researched better nutrition for himself and his family, Bhojani realized that sugar is one of the biggest contributors to ill health. And for evidence, he didn't have to look any further than his own cancer lab. Cancer is diagnosed using a radioactive analog of glucose: fluorinated deoxy glucose (FDG). When it is injected into the body, FDG is recognized by the body as glucose; however, rather than degrade like normal glucose, it accumulates in cells that have a high affinity for glucose. Areas where the accumulation of radioactive glucose occurs \u2014 seen through positron emission tomography (PET) \u2014 indicates a cancer site. \"If you test this logic on the other side,\" Bhojani states, \"then, actually we can control cancer cells by starving those cancer cells of glucose.\" What opened Bhojani's eyes to this possibility was the case of his own cousin. Having been diagnosed with liver cancer that had metastasized, spread to the wall of his stomach, and begun showing up in his lungs, the cousin sent Bhojani his lab results. Bhojani shared them with his colleagues at the U-M, who recommended pain medication only because they were certain Bhojani's cousin had no more than six months to live. \"I've had people coming from California, from Chicago... sometimes they will drive three hours to just tell me, 'I'm coming and you have to make these chaats for me!'\" \u2014 Dr. Swaroop Bhojani Bhojani created Back 2 Roots \u2014 six minimally processed dishes comprised of roti (flatbreads) that contain thirteen different kinds of whole grains, such as amaranth, African millet, and quinoa. \"They don't spike your blood sugars. When blood sugars are not spiked, then you do not see [an] insulin response.\" Dr. Swaroop Bhojani's Unique Journey with Food and Health Continued from page 25Meanwhile, his cousin had chosen Ayurveda over conventional cancer treatments. Ayurveda (Sanskrit for \"the knowledge of life\") is a 5,000-year old holistic system of healthcare developed in India that treats an individual as a whole, rather than treating just symptoms, to bring balance to the mind, body, spirit, and environment. Bhojani says the Ayurvedic doctors told his cousin that \"cancer's fed on sugar,\" and they prescribed a low-glucose, low-carbohydrate diet supplemented with goat's milk, flatbread made from African millet, tinctures, and herbs. Six months later, Bhojani received a new report from his cousin. \"His cancer shrunk quite a bit,\" Bhojani says. \"On the stomach, they could not even find it...his lung nodes, the positivity was all gone.... That was my first experience where you could reverse an existing condition by decreasing the sugar.\" That was two years ago. \"He's still alive,\" Bhojani says. \"I spoke to him [recently] and he said, 'If I die, I will die of some other complication. I will not die of cancer.'\" Bhojani also decreased the sugar in his and his family's diet. For example, he still allows his sons to drink their chocolate milk, but he blends it with carrots and spinach. He says the spinach binds \"to a certain amount of sugar,\" which prevents sugar spikes in the body and keeps his children feeling full longer. He also replaced what he calls the \"bland sweetness\" of sugar found in chaats with the more vibrant, well-rounded sweetness of dates, mangoes and tamarind, and the freshness of salsas made from spinach, kale, swiss chard, mint, and cilantro. And just as when he cooked in his lab in India, Bhojani's healthier chaats have gained a following. He exclaims, \"I've had people coming from California, from Chicago... sometimes they will drive three hours to just tell me, 'I'm coming and you have to make these chaats for me!'\" In addition to enjoying his friends and family's enthusiasm for his cooking, Bhojani lost weight when he changed his diet, and his overall health improved. It was this combination of better health and outside support that convinced Bhojani to take his chaats public. Starting small, he rented a commercial kitchen in 2010 for the annual India Day Event in Novi. With a group of volunteers, he sold 600 chaats within four hours. \"We were like so backed up and literally like making a dish every 45 seconds,\" he laughs. \"It was so well-taken that I was shocked.\" After three more successful events, Bhojani decided it was time to open a restaurant. Taking a six-week sabbatical from his research position, Bhojani opened Hut-K Chaats on April 2, 2011 \u2014 the day India won the Cricket World Cup. It was an auspicious beginning. Though he was expecting only about 60 friends and family members to attend, over 250 customers poured into the new restaurant. Not only have the customers kept coming, they've been reporting how much better the food at Hut-K Chaats is making them feel. Bhojani says that one customer swears his beet juice is the only thing that helps settle her nausea after her chemotherapy. Bhojani, on the other hand, found that running his restaurant, working full-time in his lab, and trying to find time for his family was a recipe for stress. He began to gain weight again. And five months after the opening, Bhojani's oldest son, then ten years old, called to give him what Bhojani called \"a dad's advice. He said, 'Dad, your restaurant is not working well for me. We don't get that much time together.'\" Knowing he could no longer keep up the pace he had set for himself, Bhojani chose his family. But he also kept the restaurant. Realizing that his food meant better health for him and his customers, he left his job as a cancer researcher on June 30, 2012. \"I went to cancer research...to find a cure for cancer.... Literally, a cure for cancer lies in the prevention. Nothing better than food in preventing it.\" The spirit of research still infuses Bhojani's life, both inside and outside of the restaurant. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 27 Calling his food \"nutrilicious\" for both its nutritionally-dense value and great taste, Bhojani created Back 2 Roots \u2014 six minimally processed dishes comprised of roti (flatbreads) that contain thirteen different kinds of whole grains, such as amaranth, African millet, and quinoa. \"They don't spike your blood sugars. When blood sugars are not spiked, then you do not see [an] insulin response,\" he says. Bhojani is experimenting with offering Back 2 Roots as frozen foods. Turning to the friends who've supported his journey (and who also gave his restaurant the name Hut-K, meaning \"unique\" in Hindi), Bhojani has sent several of them frozen Back 2 Roots foods. After six months in the freezer, the foods are thawed and cooked to see if they've maintained taste and texture. According to Bhojani, the foods have held up well \u2014 an advantage for breaking into the expensive and competitive frozen food market. Bhojani also writes. Currently, he is working on an article called \"Nutritional Oncology\" about the roles antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and sugar play in cancer. He's also compiling recipes for a cookbook, tentatively titled Nutrilicious Recipes: Delighting Mind & Nourishing Body . But what is most exciting to Bhojani is passing on his knowledge about nutrition to young people. He cooks with his sons and says they love to pick herbs and chop vegetables, although they dislike when their father sneaks spinach into their ice cream! Bhojani also teaches other kids to take ownership for their health and food choices. From 2009 to 2012, he coached kids at Martin Luther King Elementary School for their Science Olympiads. He taught them how their bodies work like machines and how to read food labels. When parents started calling him, \"saying that 'my kid is asking whether Dr. Bhojani would approve of this food,'\" Bhojani envisioned starting a nonprofit organization that would teach children what their bodies need for optimal health and would motivate them to make healthy food choices so these choices would then become lifelong habits. Bhojani has sought advice from experts in the fields of psychology, gastroenterology, integrative medicine, and pediatric endocrinology, and has been consulting with software engineers to develop a video game that reinforces positive food options. According to Bhojani, the nonprofit should be active by the middle of 2013. Not only has Bhojani's own relationship to food positively evolved, but it has put him on a unique path toward health \u2014 his own health and the health of his family and his customers. \"I'm living my dream,\" he says.

It is well known that we pay twice as much as other countries for our health care needs, and most developed (and many developing) nations surpass our actual health ranking. What are we doing with these resources? Why do we tolerate such inefficiencies in health care and such exorbitant costs for mediocre results? In my experience over the past 25 years in medicine, there has been an increase in the demands on physicians to focus on administrative tasks unrelated to the actual care of the patient. Our society places a high value on security and safety. We have created a standard of regulations that require a cadre of employees to understand and implement compliance. In order to keep the \"business\" of medicine working, the focus is on how to get reimbursement rather than on the patient and the problem the patient is presenting. From electronic medical records to new, more specific diagnosis codes, the burden of our regulatory policies is significant. The next strategy in health care administration is to create large entities called accountable care organizations. Through efficiencies created by centralized information access and flow, these organizations will supposedly become the answer to our nation's exorbitant health care expenditures and prevent duplication in services and procedures. However, my concern is that we are looking at just more of the same approach \u2014 only this time it's ramped up to a level such that no small practice will survive, the quality of health care will diminish, patients will be shuttled through the system, and costs and waste will not decrease. Another direction in which our regulatory advances are headed is to require electronic prescriptions to the pharmacy. The idea is to reduce mistakes and to make it easier for the physician and the pharmacist to monitor medication use. While this approach has its advantages, the other side is that the pharmacy has a program that automatically generates a refill on prescriptions without the trigger of the patient or the doctor requesting the refill. As you can imagine, the over-dispensing of drugs is the result. A nationwide study done in 1999 and 2000 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) found low levels of drugs such as antibiotics, hormones, contraceptives, and steroids in 80% of the rivers and streams tested, which means active chemicals are likely ending up in our drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates the filtering of contaminants and other harmful substances from our drinking water, but there are no standards for pharmaceuticals and not much funding available for even studying this potential public health issue. Should we not be spending some of the millions raised for cancer research on studying the potential effects of such contaminants rather than on continuing to search for the drug that will cure cancer? We expect the government or the insurance companies to fix the skyrocketing costs of health care, but their approach \u2014 increasing standardization of medicine in order to strengthen compliance and safety and decrease duplication of services \u2014 is going to be more expensive in the long run. Why? Because the actual societal expectations of health care delivery are unsustainable, and no one wants to talk about that issue. We demand health care to be top notch, the best treatment for everyone. We allow the overprescribing of medications, lab tests, home care, and imaging procedures. We, as Americans, are trained to over-consume in the pursuit of happiness, and we apply that orientation to our health care as well. More testing must be better; free pills or devices provided by our insurance companies might be useful \u2014 they don't cost anything, so why not? These basic attitudes and expectations about our health care cost all of us a lot of money, which we all complain about regularly. What we don't think about is the incredible waste of resources incurred with the increased treatments, testing, pill prescriptions, and medical devices. Imagine the whole footprint of a medical intervention. This is an area where we are using lots of energy, materials, and person power and creating lots of waste. The amount of materials discarded daily in hospitals makes them a prime target for a massive overhaul in resource allocation and disposal. Patients are not conscientious about this because they have no incentive to decrease the waste. Again, patients rarely refuse the services of the home care agency or the extra supplies hospitals provide even when they know the items aren't really necessary. Since it is free, they agree to receive whatever the system will provide. With a similar mindset, a patient hardly ever says, \"I just had blood drawn last month at another doctor's office. Perhaps we should look at that first.\" We naively believe that the more times we are tested, the safer we are. In medicine, physicians are very keen to find out what every abnormal value might reveal, and we go to great lengths to be sure that it doesn't show anything pathological. We all have been taught that if you order 12 lab tests in a healthy subject, statistically one will fall out of the normal range. The results must be interpreted with a clinical understanding of the patient. Physicians would like to diagnose disease early and treat it when it is easily treated. We also have a litigious society, and all physicians are trained that it is better to over treat by a great measure than to face a lawsuit over missing a diagnosis. We do not tolerate mistakes in medicine. It is past the time that our society should be looking at everything we do with an understanding of its environmental impact. We talk about climate change frequently, but we rarely get to the \"Reduce\" part of the three Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). What if all of us made a conscious effort to reduce what we eat? Again we are not in the mindset that it might benefit the planet if everyone ate less food! And consider the effect on diabetes, kidney failure, and heart disease. More and more discussion is happening about food waste in schools and restaurants, and they are starting to find ways to reduce it. The next step should be to look at medicine, analyze waste on all levels, and reduce the obvious redundancies. It would also be very helpful to incentivize health care by having a co-pay associated with services, drugs, and medical supplies. Many times I have heard a patient defer a medication they felt they didn't need because it had a co-pay of $10. Had it been free of charge, the patient would have simply filled it and not used it! A patient can also request smaller prescription amounts, such as 10 pills rather than 30. A standard prescription for patients leaving the hospital is 30 pills. Most of my patients do not need all those pills. So what can we do right now? Everyone can become mindful that everything we consume, even medical care, has a carbon footprint. If you don't need something, you can voice that. For instance, if a patient declines intervention, the system can document \"patient refused Vicodin prescription \u2014 will use Ibuprofen instead,\" and then health care practitioners are safely relieved of their mandate to offer each patient strong pain killers. You can refuse an unnecessary refill on a drug you are no longer taking if you know a computer generated that refill. You can ask your physician whether you really need a certain prescription and ask for the minimum amount at that time. You can treat health care resources like you would your own household resources and responsibly reduce your consumption, knowing that the system is rewarded for overuse and overtreatment.

What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. One of the businesses, Back to the Roots, is fairly new. The other, Collected Works, is 36 years old and an Ann Arbor institution. Back to the Roots Sushi, Coffee, and Global Humanitarianism Caleb Lange, Jason & Ida Bendinelli, and Jason & Suzei Povlich, owners Back to the Roots Restaurant and Cafe with Gourmet Coffee Bar, 115 S. Main Street, Chelsea, Michigan 48118; (734) 475-2700; website: backtotheroots.org Not only is Back to the Roots a restaurant and cafe featuring a diverse menu with fresh food from local farms, it is also a music and art venue for local artists, a place where you can buy fair-trade clothing, and a community of people passionate about global change. Located in Chelsea, Back to the Roots opened in 20ll when Caleb Lange, Jason and Suzei Povlich, and Jason and Ida Bendinelli combined their talents and philanthropic activism. Lange, co-owner, first met the Povlichs and the Bendinellis in 2008. Before then, the humanitarian, musician, and master sushi chef had been traveling around the world helping others.\"We want to connect and be part of the community whether it means donating our time, or whatever we can do.\" - Caleb Lange, Co-owner of Back to the RootsThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 30 Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local Businesses Lange's interest in helping impoverished people began while he was a college student at Tennessee Temple University, and he \"felt compelled and empowered to go to Africa.\" While the university offered short trips, usually a week to a month long, Lange wanted to go for a longer period. After researching several nonprofit agencies, he discovered a Christian missionary group called Africa Inland Mission (AIM) that had a year-long program, similar to an internship. With AIM, Lange traveled to Swaziland, Africa, where he worked with AIDS victims and sex trafficking victims. He also structured a curriculum for poor high school students so they could further their education, and toward the end of the program, he was involved in creating a food program for children. The program still feeds up to 1,200 children in rural Swaziland areas. After leaving Swaziland, Lange joined the AIM staff and traveled from South America to Asia and Africa. He eventually led a trip to India with an AIM team in March of 2007. At that time, Lange and a few of his friends decided to start a safe haven Caleb Lange While on the music festival circuit, Lange met Jason and Ida Bendinelli and Jason and Suzei Povlich.... As they began to talk with each other, they found they had common goals of seeking more purpose in their lives, and seeking something bigger than themselves.

The restaurant stage provides a concert venue for local musicians, and local artists exhibit their work on the restaurant walls. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 31 and an educational training center for women and children who were embroiled in sex trafficking. \"Due to the cultural shame of rape, women [in India] often turn to prostitution in order to support themselves because they are ashamed to go home, and have no other means of support,\" he explained. Lange and his friends were able to rent a local building after pooling some money together. They initially took in two children. Now the home, called Asha House, provides shelter for 26 children. After starting Asha House, Lange decided to break from AIM in 2008, return to the United States, and start his own nonprofit organization to fund Asha House and support other global charities. Feeling a \"disconnect with American culture and American religious culture,\" Lange decided to join the homeless. He lived in his car and in shelters while he traveled to music festivals in order to raise awareness about Asha House. He also sold fair-trade merchandise that he had purchased before leaving India in order to support Asha House and to provide self-sustenance. While on the music festival circuit, Lange met Jason and Ida Bendinelli and Jason and Suzei Povlich. The Bendinellis owned a fair-trade retail store called Back to the Roots in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and they were selling their merchandise at the festival. \"They had a mega booth literally 12 times the size of my booth! And my tiny little booth was right next to theirs,\" Lange described. At first he was worried they would put up too much merchandise for him to be able to compete, but as they began to talk with each other, they found they had common goals of seeking more purpose in their lives, and seeking something bigger than themselves. When the couples heard Lange's story of Asha House, they knew they wanted to become involved with this type of charitable work. Eventually, the Bendinellis and the Povlichs moved to Chelsea, Michigan, to start a Jet's Pizza franchise. But, Lange said, \"It was in their hearts to start another Back to the Roots.\" Their goal was to open a fair-trade retail store that was also a little tea bar with some organic food options. And one night, over a few beers at Jet's Pizza, the Bendinellis, Povlichs, and Lange decided to partner and start a Back to the Roots in Chelsea. \"Our goal is always to help with sustainability and empowerment; whatever we can do,\" Lange said. Lange took a position at Back to the Roots as an owner-operator and master sushi chef. He said he didn't know anything about operating a restaurant or making sushi when he first began, but he has gained much experience in the two years the business has been open. In addition to gourmet sushi rolls, the diverse menu includes hearty American breakfasts, fish and rice bowls, and rich desserts. The restaurant is one component of the group's larger humanitarian mission. The nonprofit aspect of Back to the Roots, which was started before the restaurant, aids many projects, including Asha House. It also helps with a food and shelter program in Haiti and funded a heart surgery for a poor Haitian boy. \"Ten cents of every dollar goes toward the nonprofit aspect,\" said Lange. \"As we expand, we hope to donate more.\" Back to the Roots also solicits donations on its website: http://backtotheroots.org. In addition to global efforts, Back to the Roots is actively involved in the local community, providing an open stage for nonprofits that need a venue. For example, the Waterloo Recreation Area Education Program recently sponsored a talk about some of their nature programs available for kids. The restaurant stage also provides a concert venue for local musicians, and local artists exhibit their work on the restaurant walls. The restaurant employs 30 people, and buys its food from local farmers. Lange says that ultimately they would like to partner with local job program organizations to help people learn the restaurant business. \"We want to connect and be part of the community whether it means donating our time, or whatever we can do.\" The restaurant is one component of the group's larger humanitarian mission. The nonprofit aspect of Back to the Roots, which was started before the restaurant, aids many projects. Feature continued on page 32 \"We were, and still are, driven by the artistic. We carry things you cannot find at the mall.\" - Irene Patalan Co-owner of Collected WorksThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 32 Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local Businesses Feature continued from page 31 Collected Works Clothing as Art Irene Patalan and Rich Thompson, owners Collected Works, 303 Detroit Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104; (734) 995-4222; website: collectedworksannarbor.com In 1977, Collected Works was born in the basement at 309 E. Liberty Avenue. Created by husband and wife team Irene Patalan and Rich Thompson, the homegrown women's clothing store derived from the couple's eye for the artistic, and their political activism as college students at U-M. Over 30 years later, the store still reflects the couple's artistic sensibility and their activism in the Ann Arbor community. \"It was both a fabulous time and a horrible time,\" Irene said of her experience at U-M amid the Vietnam War and continuing Civil Rights Movement. It was horrible because of the causalities at war and on home soil, and it was fabulous because she became part of the widespread response to the war and the unfair treatment of minority groups. \"I remember we closed down the University in protest as part of the Black Action Movement. We wanted more equality in faculty representation. It was a time when we were surrounded by traditional life values, but those values had been challenged, and we could see that life could be different; things could be done differently,\" Irene recounted. It was with this post-60's counterculture sensibility that Irene and her husband, Rich (though they were not married at the time), approached opening and running Collected Works. \"During the time when polyester was the fabric of the day, we decided that we would sell no petroleum-based clothing; only beautiful and beautifully made fabrics should touch our bodies.\" Whether music, painting, sculpture, or written word, art was thriving globally and locally, capturing the sentiment of the younger generation. Irene and Rich joined the movement with unique clothing and accessories. \"We were, and still are, driven by the artistic,\" Irene explained. \"We carry things you cannot find at the mall.\" In its first basement location, Collected Works carried a lot of jewelry and accessories. Most items were handmade and hand-sewn by small groups of people trying to live differently than the \"norm.\" Rich and Irene embraced clothing's ability to serve as a reaction to politics and a statement of personal beliefs. \"I remember a time when we sold sundresses made out of burqas,\" Irene said. \"The bodices were made out of the burqa, and the rest was made from other fabrics. Now, just imagine using something so fraught with political overtones to make an article of clothing as [light and whimsical] as a sundress. And they were made by Afghani women.\" During the early years of business, Rich traveled often for work and would come home with ideas about what other items the store should carry and what things were working in other locations similar to Ann Arbor. Meanwhile, Irene ran the store and began raising their family. She even gave up teaching to own and operate Collected Works. In the 1990s, Collected Works moved to Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor, and Irene and Rich quickly became innovators in promoting Main Street businesses. Together with the proprietresses of the Fantasy Attic (now located on Packard) and Generations (no longer in business), the couple met once a week at the Real Seafood Company to plan out promotions for Main Street. Two of those promotions, the Car Show and Taste of Ann Arbor, continue today. Around this same time, Irene, her son, and a Collected Works customer named Susan Lerch decided that something needed to be done to help fund AIDS research and education. \"This was the early 1990s,\" Irene explained. \"Ann Arbor [as a community] Irene Patalan\"During the time when polyester was the fabric of the day, we decided that we would sell no petroleum-based clothing; only beautiful and beautifully made fabrics should touch our bodies.\" In its first basement location, Collected Works carried a lot of jewelry and accessories. Most items were handmade and hand-sewn by small groups of people trying to live differently than the \"norm.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 33 was talking about AIDS, but nobody was really doing anything yet. The three of them, along with help and inspiration from family, friends, and customers, initiated the first Ann Arbor AIDS walk at Collected Works. \"We went around to all the Main Street businesses and asked the owners if they would support [the cause],\" Irene explained. \"It was truly wonderful the way our business community stepped up and supported that first AIDS Walk. And, 23 years later, Ann Arbor still does the AIDS Walk annually.\" After a few years at the Main Street location, Irene and her husband felt that it was time to take a different approach in their business. \"While what we were doing was wonderful and we loved it, we realized we were getting older. That's a hard lesson because you don't think about it, well, until you have to. We found ourselves at a real crossroads as to whether we would continue with the store or not,\" Irene said. The location, formerly a music store with several rooms and several large pieces of furniture, was simply too much to maintain and too difficult to fill with merchandise. \"It was a great space. It was a place where I'd practically raised my children and met such fabulous women. It was a place...where women could come and feel comfortable with what they were wearing and with their bodies,\" Irene recalled. She didn't want to stop being a part of and helping to create that atmosphere, so in 2000, Collected Works left the 2,500-square-foot space and took residence in a much more manageable 590-square-foot space on Detroit Street, where it has been for the last 12 years. Three years ago, Collected Works underwent yet another transformation. When the business next door moved a little closer to the heart of downtown, Irene was inspired to expand. \"Two wonderful women owned a floral shop in that space, and we got along beautifully. It was such a joy having the floral shop and the clothing store right next door to one another,\" Irene said. Though she knew she would miss her neighbors of 10 years, Irene immediately thought of how she could utilize the space, and she \"couldn't deny the idea was appealing.\" The economy at that time was improving, but expanding was still a risk. \"I wondered to myself whether this was the universe's way of telling me it was time to once again expand Collected Works. I'd taken risks before, so why not?\" And so, in 2010, Collected Works grew to 1,300 square feet. \"I've noticed a new trend within the store,\" Irene explained. \"About 80 percent of the clothes makers I carry are American women. Is that amazing or what?\" Most of them either run small solo operations or have just a handful of employees. Some have worked for other clothing manufacturers and have decided to strike out on their own and began designing their own lines. Irene found most of these designers displaying their lines at clothing shows in New York, California, Chicago, and Georgia. \"I just find it interesting to note that as political thought has changed and centered on more homegrown, eco-friendly, small business sorts of things, that my business has done the same thing.\" Irene still carries beautiful fabrics and prints from locations such as Africa and India, but most are produced by American women. Through its many storefront changes, Collected Works has stayed true to its mission and has evolved as an Ann Arbor institution. In her many years as a business owner, Irene said the biggest lesson she has learned is to be grateful. \"You know, Ann Arbor is a special place because it welcomes the new and different, and as a community, it supports creativity. This cannot be said of every town across America.... I'm grateful for all the amazing women I've met throughout the years, and for this fabulous community that has supported Collected Works through all its incarnations. Most of all, I am grateful to my family, especially my husband, who has loved me unconditionally, supported me, and worked as hard as I have over the years to make all of this possible. I'm grateful for where I'm at and who surrounds me, and I must never take it for granted.\"Irene still carries beautiful fabrics and prints from locations such as Africa and India, but most are produced by American women. \"You know, Ann Arbor is a special place because it welcomes the new and different, and as a community, it supports creativity.

Ever humble, Rimpoche is quick to caution audiences that he learned about American life and language by watching TV , adding with a smile \u2014 especially the series Days of Our Lives!Many Ann Arbor area residents know Jewel Heart's Gelek Rimpoche as Gelek or \"Rimp\" or perhaps just as the guy next door, while his colleagues, students, and friends marvel at the rare twist of fate that allowed Gelek Rimpoche, an incarnate Buddhist Lama, to not only come to Michigan but to live right here in our midst. Rimpoche adds a little more to the picture when he shares how the 1959 experience of his sudden exodus from \"Old Tibet\" was akin to being airlifted from the 16th or 17th century and dropped squarely into the middle of the 20th century. Of course, it was much more complex than that. Due to the Communist Chinese invasion of Lhasa, Rimpoche was forced to flee his home and find his way to India over the treacherous Himalayas, not long after the narrow escape of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Living in India became a life changing time for Rimpoche, with exposure to a world completely different from his previous way of life. He often speaks of this transition period as a time to explore many new possibilities. He wore various hats while in India, including serving as headmaster of a school for exiled Tibetan children, working at the newly formed Tibet House in Delhi as well as at Air India Radio, and compiling over 1,000 interviews about the fall of Tibet. All of this while also partici - pating in other roles serving the needs of his many teachers and the exiled Tibetan community. In 1980, friends Aura Glaser (who founded Crazy Wisdom in 1982, and ran it until 1989) and Sandra Finkel met Rimpoche while they were traveling and studying in India. They quickly invited Rimpoche to Ann Arbor upon their return home, and he was happy to accept. He came to the U.S. to work with Ti-betologist Melvyn Goldstein at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and would drive up to Crazy Wisdom to give public talks in the early 80's. Rimpoche soon became a full-time resident of Ann Arbor, and in 1988, he co-founded Jewel Heart with Glaser and Finkel, a non-profit organization dedicated to the authentic preservation and presentation of \u2014 and accessibility to \u2014 Buddha's message through the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of Je Tsong Khapa. At Jewel Heart, Rimpoche offers teachings on Sundays and hosts retreats throughout the year. Ever humble, Rimpoche is quick to caution audiences that he learned about American life and language by watching TV, add-ing with a smile \u2014 especially the series Days of Our Lives ! That being said, his friends know that Rimpoche's traditionally intensive education and upbringing as an incarnate Buddhist Lama in Tibet has provided him with a remarkably clear perspective on life and adaptability in the 21st century. Indeed, Rimpoche's fluidity with the language and culture of our time reveals his deep understanding of the universality of human experience as well as his perceptive wit \u2014 a wit that is quick to convey a light-heart - ed touch to life's sometimes difficult lessons. Rimpoche's embrace of Western culture has allowed our community accessibility to a Tibetan Buddhist Lama in a way that is dramatically different from what his life otherwise might have allowed. Back in Tibet, Rimpoche was born into a family belonging to the high society of politics, government, and monastic communities. In fact, his great-uncle was the 13th Dalai Lama. From that unique vantage point, Rimpoche studied with the greatest spiritual masters of the day, was a firsthand witness to history in the making, and had the uncommon privilege to experience whatever technology managed to find its way into Tibet at that time. He often enjoys sharing his boyhood memory of the first time he witnessed someone using a telephone in Tibet. He recalls being unable to stop laughing at the sight of someone standing in the middle of a room, speaking to himself while holding an unfamiliar object \u2014 a.k.a., a telephone. Now, mindful of technology's ever changing devel-opments, Gelek Rimpoche not only finds himself completely at home with the gadgets of the day, but he's also willing to transform them into the perfect vehicle for a 21st century Tibetan Buddhist Lama. One example occurred during Rimpoche's 70th birthday celebration when the late Gene Smith of the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center in New York arrived to personally deliver one of the first hard drives to hold the largest scanned Tibetan collection of classical Buddhist literature. As a young man, Rimpoche had collaborated with Smith and the U.S. Library of Congress not long after arriving in India. Known from early childhood for his remarkable memory, Rimpoche was pivotal in collecting, editing, and preserving 170 volumes of precious manuscripts that, in the aftermath of the Communist invasion, would have otherwise been lost to humanity. Rimpoche continues to work tirelessly for the preservation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan culture, which is still at risk to this day. So it was certainly a special day when all those years later Smith presented his Rimpoche as a young Lama in Tibet with his attendant in the background.

In addition to this precious digital resource, Rimpoche will sometimes search the web for particular Buddhist texts and commentaries, now downloading them directly to his iPad! Rimpoche's outreach through technology is visible via simple day-to-day needs, whether he's using Power Point to design an elaborate presentation demonstrating the meaning of the many images used in Tibetan Buddhism, or relying on Skype to keep in close touch with people around the world. Enjoying technology's qualities of accessibility and connection, Rimpoche remains alert for new avenues that will make it easier for people to bring a little wisdom, compassion, and peace into their lives. This is evident through Rimpoche's open ap-proach to both dharma and technology. From the dharma, or spiritual window, we hear it when Rimpoche reminds audiences that Buddha's message of compassion and wisdom is for everyone and that one needn't be \"Buddhist\" to develop those qualities to the fullest. From the technology angle, we see with the Jewel Heart website ( jewelheart.org) one of the most far-reaching aspects of Rimpoche's 21st century method. Among its many features are free audio and video talks available on the homepage, and a subscription service that allows people around the globe to enjoy Rimpoche's teach-ings and public talks through both live stream and recorded on-demand formats. The webcast subscription hosts live teachings every Sunday morning at 10 a.m. as well as special events with Rimpoche and prestigious guest speakers, some of whom have included Rimpoche's own teachers. The vidcasts have also included such guests as Jewel Heart Board Member and international composer Philip Glass; the mag - netic Indo-Tibetan scholar Professor Robert Thurman; and pioneering scientist and researcher Dr. Richard Davidson, founder and chair of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds. Rimpoche also demonstrates his appreciation for the opportuni - ties available today by encourag-ing students to pursue doctorate degrees in the fields of psychology and the sciences, with many of his friends working in fields seeking a better understanding of the body and mind relationship. The fields of science, mental and physical health, education, sports, and business \u2014 to name a few \u2014 are on the brink of recogniz - ing the practical applications that mind training, or meditation, holds for society. As a spiritual teacher, Rimpoche is happy to share the efficacy of such training, an inner science of mind that helps us man-age our lives with clarity, care, and understanding. His unique way of sharing Buddha's message coupled with technology's global acces-sibility holds promise for a better world for everyone. A welcome guest to scientific conferences himself, Rimpoche once participated in a panel discussion with futurist, author, and inventor Ray Kurzweil, on the possibil - ity of a consciousness entering a computer. Rimpoche pointed out that when the conditions are right, anything is possible! Indeed, Buddhism and modern science are coming together in many ways to explore and understand the realities we all experi-ence, as well as to understand the moral issues that accompany them. Early on, for instance, Rimpoche was quick to comment on cloning and the need to reflect wisely on the important moral issues associated with it.Fascinated by technological advanc-es, Rimpoche keeps things hopping wherever he goes. At a retreat in Ann Arbor a few years ago, the room was abuzz with giggles when people real-ized this ancient tradition and their technology-hip teacher had joined forces as they watched Rimpoche's fingers swiping the screen of his iPad in search of a passage from a centuries-old commentary he wanted to share. In reference to Tibetan paintings, which often depict beings carrying tools symbolic of their individual qualities and attributes, a friend recently shared how he would picture Rimpoche. He visualized him with the traditional Tibetan bell and vajra, but thought a cell phone and a TV remote would make a fitting addition to show how well versed Rimpoche is on ev-erything happening in the world, be it politics, world and domestic events, technology, or movies \u2014 the list goes on. Savvy with the day's latest inventions or touched by recent news, Rimpoche regularly includes them in his teachings, whether he's humorously introducing an image from a recent commercial or movie, or offering keen insight in response to news of tragedy, controversy, or accomplishment. At a recent retreat, Rimpoche was asked if he could explain where karma is stored, to which he replied with impish delight, \"Why, in the Cloud, of course!\" Needless to say, his reply was met with shared looks of surprise, followed by sounds of uproari-ous laughter. Gelek Rimpoche is the spiritual leader of Jewel Heart, founded in 1988 as a non- profit organization with Ann Arbor serving as the international headquarters.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 36 By Maureen McMahon Photos by Joni Strickfaden This past December I had the pleasure of attending a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore at Hill Auditorium. In a grand collaboration, the 90-voice University Choir, 20 strings, multiple jazz soloists, poets, and Sreyashi Dey's Odissi dancers (featured in our winter 2012 issue) brought Tagore's poetry to life in a technically fascinating and beautiful performance. To me, it represented the best of what a university can offer and I wanted to learn more about this multi-disciplinary work's genesis. The creative director at the center of the collaboration was Professor Ed Sarath, a performer, composer, recording artist, and author. In addition to his large body of work in music and music learning, Sarath has pioneered the in tegration of contemplative studies into traditional academics at the University of Michigan for the past decade. I spoke to him about these endeavors and the unique cross-disciplinary community he has formed through the Program for Creativity and Consciousness Studies. Ed, you are a musician and composer. What do you play? What kinds of works have you composed? The flugelhorn is my primary instrument. My music draws from a wide range of influences, and I have composed for many different kinds of ensembles. My most recent recording features the London Jazz Orchestra performing a set of my compositions for large jazz ensemble. As you know, last December I had works performed in Hill Auditorium for the 150 th anniversary of the birth of Tagore. I set two of his poems to music for this concert, and can attest that there is little more exciting than to have 125 performers play your music. I thought the Tagore celebration was fantastic, really showcasing a university's potential for outstanding artistic collaborations. In addition to composing and teaching, you are an author with a book coming out and have published many articles. You have also founded and serve as president of the International Society for Improvised Music. How do you juggle everything?Actually, the new book is my second one within a few years. I published a musicianship textbook in 2010 called Music Theory Through Improvisation , which came out on Routledge. My forthcoming book is more of a philosophical nature, Improvisation, Creativity and Consciousness : Jazz as Integral Template for Music, Education, and Society (SUNY/Albany, 2013), due out in June. I am also co-editor of a forthcoming volume on contemplative education, called Contemplative Approaches to Learning, Teaching and Inquiry, also coming out on SUNY this year. Yes, I have had to learn to be super organized in terms of time management, and work in cycles. Sometimes the music takes precedence, other times the scholarship \u2014 although it is important to sustain some degree of activity in the different realms even when they are on the backburner. I might add that the academic writing was not originally in the game plan when I joined the music faculty in 1987. It was just that I saw a need for a kind of story to be told in that world \u2014 about improvisation and creativity and their link to consciousness and spirituality \u2014 that I felt I could make important contributions to. This first began to dawn on me in my work teaching improvisation to classical musicians, which I do with both students and professionals. It is one of my most favorite activities, and I was in Siberia for just this purpose last November. But oftentimes, classical performers who are courageous enough to try improvisation tend to view it as a kind of embellishment to interpretive performance, something that may free them up, deepen their expressivity, but not a deep means of music making in its own right. And when it comes to jazz or other music with Black roots, I find the same kind of lack of awareness of its transcendent foundations. So in addition to designing coursework and methodologies that aim to cultivate this depth of perception and appreciation, there has been an equally important need for theoretical/philosophical models that also illuminate this depth. My new book goes into this, which is essentially the primary motivation for my founding the International Society for Improvised Music (ISIM) in 2004. Can you tell us more about that organization? The basic idea is that the past several decades have seen the emergence of a wave of musical activity that transcends conventional categories to a degree that defies description. So musicians have resorted to describing this wave in terms of the underlying process \u2014 improvisation \u2014 that is central to the synthesis. I had long felt the need to form an organization predicated on this principle, not only to empower musicians in the field but also to help promote the incorporation of improvisation \u2014 from both style-specific and stylistically-open perspectives \u2014 in musical study. A Conversation with Musician and Educator Ed Sarath on Improvisation and Creativity and their Link to Consciousness and Spirituality Humanity is an improvising ensemble that, even with its seven billion members, needs to function just like a jazz trio or quartet \u2014 digging deep into the present moment to fathom heightened inventive and interactive strategies in order to address the \"chord changes\" of our world. We are at a historic juncture where education as largely an exterior, objective affair is opening up to the interior, subjective dimensions of the learner. I call it crossing the \"exterior-interior divide.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 37 So ISIM was formed, with conferences held here in Ann Arbor at U-M, Denver, Chicago, Santa Cruz, and New York. Plans are being laid for the organization's first overseas event. Many leading artists have been involved, including Pauline Oliveros, Steve Coleman, Oliver Lake, Karl Berger, Charles Lloyd, Stephen Nachmanovitch, Geri Allen, and Jin Hi Kim. What are your roles at the U-M School of Music? Please explain more about your areas of interest and academic expertise? I am Professor of Jazz and Contemporary Improvisation at the U-M School of Music, Theatre, and Dance. I also direct the Program in Creativity and Consciousness Studies, which is a cross-campus initiative affiliated with the National Center for Institutional Diversity. During the course of a given academic year, I teach an innovative, improvisation-based approach to musicianship studies for classical undergraduate music majors, a contemporary improvisation class for classical and jazz students, a graduate improvisation class for jazz students, and a course in creativity and consciousness open to students from across campus. And last fall, I taught a graduate seminar called \"The Music School of the Future,\" which is based on a chapter from my forthcoming book. So my teaching spans the same kind of wide-ranging boundaries as my music and my scholarship do. How did the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Jazz and Contemplative Studies come about? What is the connection between improvisation and contemplative practices? The B.F.A. in Jazz and Contemplative Studies, which was put in place in 2000, has an interesting story. I had long been interested in the improvisation-meditation relationship and would commonly incorporate meditative practices in my improvisation classes. I think of improvisation as a parts-to-whole vehicle for creativity-consciousness integration, and meditation as a whole-to-parts vehicle. The two processes complement each other wonderfully. It occurred to me that students would benefit from a class that was entirely devoted to this connection, and which addressed the consciousness component more fully. An opportunity to design such a class presented itself in 1997 when the American Council of Learned Societies launched its Contemplative Practice Fellowship program, the purpose of which was to support the use of meditation and related practices in university coursework. I was among the first round of fellows in this landmark initiative and designed the creativity and consciousness class. A few years later, it occurred to me that students who were interested in even further grounding in this area could benefit from a curriculum with a significant meditation component. At which point I drew up a proposal for the B.F.A. in Jazz and Contemplative Studies curriculum. As the first curriculum of its kind \u2014 in or beyond music \u2014 at a mainstream academic institution, it is not surprising that it stirred quite an intense debate among the music faculty. But it passed with close to a two-thirds majority! To me, it's really exciting to hear that contemplative practices made it into an academic curriculum, especially towards a university degree at a top music school. What was the gist of the debate? For many faculty, in and beyond the jazz department, the connection between jazz and meditation seemed perfectly natural, and some were genuinely excited about this as a potentially pioneering curriculum. Loren Hollander, the great concert pianist, heard about the proposal and sent me a nice email expressing his strong support. Gaining that feedback from an artist of that stature in the classical world was quite encouraging. Shortly after that I ran into the great jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker at a festival we were both playing in Paris, and he had heard about the proposal and was equally excited. As the debate was playing out, there were colleagues outside of music, both at U-M and across the nation through the contemplative studies network, that were also following the debate intensely. And of course, as I mentioned, there were others who did not share our enthusiasm. Why not? A number of causes might be cited, ranging from challenges inherent in assessing meditation in credit-bearing academic coursework, using class time for students to meditate (a very small percentage of total class time), and possibly creating openings for what might be construed as spiritual practice in the academy. I view all of these concerns as valid from a certain standpoint, and, in addition to addressing them during the advocacy of the proposal, have elaborated on my rationale in a number of articles that have come out in the years since the degree has been in place. A point I argue is that we are at a historic juncture where education as largely an exterior, objective affair is opening up to the interior, subjective dimensions of the learner. I call it crossing the \"exterior-interior divide.\" Colleagues who are disposed to the conventional model as the gold standard against which alternatives need to be weighed will naturally be averse to a curriculum like the one in question. In my experience, a growing number of colleagues throughout education find the conventional paradigm insufficient to the challenges of our times. What must be kept in mind is that the B.F.A. in Jazz and Contemplative Studies curriculum is not only most likely the most radical in the history of the School of Music, Theatre, and Dance, it is also arguably among the most radical in the history of the university, and possibly far beyond. As excited as I am about what the students enrolled in it are gaining, I am probably even more excited about the possibility for the same template to be applied across fields. When a few years back a contemplative studies concentration was established at Brown University medical school, Michigan's B.F.A. in Jazz and Contemplative Studies was cited as a precedent in this emergent pedagogy. Your new book is the first application to music of an emergent worldview called Integral Theory. Tell us some about that. What is Integral Theory and what are some of its compelling features? Integral Theory has a long history and is generally associated in recent times with the work of the philosopher Ken Wilber. In a nutshell, Integral Theory maps the interior and exterior dimensions of human nature and development, which is synonymous with creativity and consciousness development. Integral Theory draws from wide \"I think of improvisation as a parts-to- whole vehicle for creativity-consciousness integration, and meditation as a whole-to- parts vehicle. The two processes complement each other wonderfully. It occurred to me that students would benefit from a class that was entirely devoted to this connection... \" But oftentimes, classical performers who are courageous enough to try improvisation tend to view it as a kind of embellishment to interpretive performance, something that may free them up, deepen their expressivity, but not a deep means of music making in its own right.... [they have a] lack of awareness of its transcendent foundations. [So I have been] designing coursework and methodologies that aim to cultivate this depth of perception and appreciation... Continued on page 38Academic writing was not originally in the game plan when I joined the music faculty in 1987. It was just that I saw a need for a kind of story to be told in that world \u2014 about improvisation and creativity and their link to consciousness and spirituality \u2014 that I felt I could make important contributions to. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 38 ranging disciplines in promoting this growth. Spirituality, art, and science are all essential to any program of development, and thus need to be balanced in our educational systems. Meditation practice is central to integral education. A core theme in my book is that the arts, often neglected in overall educational discourse and society at large, are not only essential to human evolution, but have the capacity to play an enormous role in educational reform in uniting science and spirituality. The final chapter in my book is called \"Planet Earth Takes a Solo\" and basically argues that humanity is an improvising ensemble that, even with its seven billion members, needs to function just like a jazz trio or quartet \u2014 digging deep into the present moment to fathom heightened inventive and interactive strategies in order to address the \"chord changes\" of our world. Why do you see this movement as the next frontier of higher education? From an integral perspective, conventional education is caught up in exteriors, which is part of the picture, but vastly incomplete. If education is to prepare citizens to address the challenges and opportunities of today's world, a broader educational vision is needed that unites inner and outer \u2014 which is where the integral vision excels. Are there classes in the jazz and contemplative studies major about meditation specifically? Are the resources for teaching students contemplative studies contained within the university setting? We have been really fortunate to have exceptional resources in our U-M community for this work. Not long after the curriculum was established, Martha Travers began teaching some sections of its core classes in the jazz department and has done a fabulous job. Richard Mann in psychology, who has been featured in Crazy Wisdom [Editor's Note: Issue #27 of the Crazy Wisdom Journal , on our website's CWJ archive at http://www.crazywisdom.net/journal-archive.html], has long been one of the most extraordinary teachers and thinkers on our campus and has recently been co-teaching what sounds like a great class, \"Mind, Brain, and Spirituality,\" with William Gehring. Ram Mahalingam and David Meyer might also be noted for their work in this area from the psychology department, as well as Elliot Ginsberg in Judaic studies. I get rave reports from all of them about jazz and contemplative studies majors who take their classes. Do you have firs t hand experience with improvisation paired with contemplation? Who are some other jazz personalities who have modeled combining meditation and musical improvisation? My journey in jazz began around the same time as my involvement with meditation practice \u2014 both in the early 1970s. The jazz tradition boasts a long legacy of artists, including John and Alice Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Herbie Hancock, Mary Lou Williams, Wayne Shorter, Paul Horn, Charles Lloyd, and Don Cherry, who have complemented their creative excursions with contemplative engagement. Are you involved with any of the meditation communities in the Ann Arbor area, or with other local groups doing contemplative practices? My own primary practice is from a Vedantic lineage, which serves as a solid and unwavering foundation for broader explorations. Although I am not as engaged in local communities as I would like, I do encourage students to partake of these resources. You founded the Program in Creativity and Consciousness Studies (PCCS) at U-M and are currently its director. What does this program entail and who is involved? Is this unique to U-M? PCCS hosts lectures, symposia, and promotes coursework and research dealing with creativity and its interior foundations in consciousness. It brings together faculty, students, and staff from all corners of campus, from art, athletics, business, and law to medicine, music, neuroscience, and sociology. Currently PCCS is affiliated with the National Center for Institutional Diversity, and I am particularly excited about developing that connection because it expands and strengthens diversity work and provides a toehold for creativity and consciousness work. A future aim is to design a cross-campus major in creativity and consciousness studies. PCCS is among a handful of units nationwide devoted to consciousness studies from both practical and theoretical standpoints. What kinds of events has the Program in Creativity and Consciousness Studies hosted? Are mostly people from the university community attending? PCCS hosts a variety of events, ranging from team-taught coursework and collaborative research, lectures, and symposia. Notable examples include a symposium on creativity, consciousness, and the academy that drew attendees nationwide; a visit by the legendary filmmaker David Lynch to a packed Power Center; a science and spirituality discussion featuring Professors Richard Mann (psychology), Sharon Kardia (genetics/public health), and Jeffrey Evans (neuropsychology); a panel discussion exploring the inner dimensions of athletics and performing arts featuring myself, Carol Hutchins (softball), Tommy Amaker (basketball), Annette Masson (theatre), and Donald Sinta (music); and a lecture on \"Deep Change\" by Professor Robert Quinn (business); talks by Andean shaman Don Alberto Tatzo on consciousness and the future, and author Philip Goldberg and his book American Veda. Does your program in terface with the larger Ann Arbor community at all, and if so, in what ways? Individuals from the community attend our events. We would like to bolster community ties. What are some future plans for PCCS? As I mentioned, PCCS would like to design degree programs so students could gain significant grounding in this richly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary area. Finally, are you currently living in Ann Arbor? How long have you lived here? And please tell us a bit about your wife, Joan. My wife, Joan Harris, and I have lived in Ann Arbor since 1987 \u2014 we live in the Hunt Park neighborhood. Joan is a Kripalu yoga teacher, adept gardener and potter, part-time instructor at Washtenaw Community College (where she teaches a physiology lab), former physical therapist and massage therapist, and a long-time meditator. She directed a feminist women's health clinic in Iowa City \u2014 where we met. Where do you lik e to hear music in Ann Arbor? Both large concert halls and smaller venues like Kerrytown Concert House and Canterbury House. Musically, what do you see is Ann Arbor's strength?Great audiences who are very sophisticated. Interesting pool of local musicians, including many who did their studies at U-M and excellent musicians from other parts of the country and world. Are the jazz student performances open to the public? What's the website for more information? Yes. More information is on the School of Music website at www.music.umich.edu.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 39 That humanity has arrived at a crossroads of historical significance by now requires little elaboration. The question is how, or even if, we will navigate our way through this critical juncture. On one hand, issues such as climate change and environmental devastation, widespread poverty and disease, drought and famine, terrorism and increasingly sophisticated means of warfare, economic disparity and instability, along with a broad complex network of sociocultural challenges raise unprecedented questions about the sustainability of civilization as we know it. On a more optimistic yet scarcely less daunting note, individuals and communities across the globe have unprecedented access to an ever expanding knowledge base that transcends disciplinary, cultural, historical, and geographical boundaries. While often spawning the overwhelming morass of data that exacerbates the alienation and disconnectedness that pervade much of contemporary life, this broad spectrum of resources \u2014 were it to be effectively harnessed \u2014 might be the source of newfound solutions to the present challenges. Although some may be inclined to think that the present slate of crises, particularly in regard to global warming and related consequences, has progressed beyond the threshold of reversibility, I have faith in humanity's ability to dig deep into its wellsprings of ingenuity and invoke levels of understanding and action that enable not only survival but entirely new kinds of progress. Almost a half century ago, Buckminster Fuller predicted that Homo sapiens sapiens would approach a point at which two options \u2014 as expressed in the title of his book Utopia or Oblivion \u2014 would be available . To encapsulate Fuller's central premise: There will be no middle ground \u2014 the kind of change required for mere survival will be of such scope as to catapult human civilization onto a new evolutionary plateau. Echoing the viewpoints of a growing contingent of more recent thinkers, I believe that at its core this transformation will occur on the level of consciousness, which in this book I approach in terms of the creativity-consciousness relationship. By creativity I refer to such qualities as inventiveness, interaction, the ability to synthesize new forms of knowledge from diverse sources, and the emergence of an individual voice or style within a discipline. Consciousness pertains to self-awareness, transcendence, realization of wholeness and interconnectedness, noetic experience, and the wide range of feeling and emotion that are thought to distinguish human beings from other species. Expanding upon these working definitions from the standpoint of an emergent worldview called Integral Theory, I will view the two realms as inextricably linked aspects of an unbroken, inner-outer wholeness. \"[F]or the first time,\" remarks Ken Wilber, commonly regarded as the leading contemporary exponent of integral thought, \"the sum total of human knowledge is available to us \u2014 the knowledge, experience, wisdom, and reflection of all major human civilizations . . . are open to study by anyone.\" Within this cross-disciplinary expanse, one of the most important contributions of Integral Theory is its capacity to embrace both the timeless insights of \"the ancient shamans and sages\" as well as the latest \"breakthroughs in cognitive neuroscience,\" thereby bridging the interior and exterior realms that are often seen as inherently competing with one another. From this vantage point, we will see creativity as an exterior entryway and consciousness as an interior entryway to this inner-outer totality. This in turn gives rise to a conception of spirituality that, in encompassing this totality, transcends denominational boundaries, manifests in all areas of life, and is entirely compatible with \u2014 without, as some insist, being reducible to \u2014 science. I develop two central themes related to the impending creativity- consciousness, integral revolution that tend to elude much of the thinking about this kind of paradigmatic change. One is that it will need to take place within, and be driven by, our educational systems if is to manifest on any significant scale in society at large. No other public agency has as much contact with as much of the population and thus the capacity to shape thinking and behavior as our schools. Unfortunately, by inhibiting inquiry \u2014 both practical and theoretical \u2014 into the interior, transcendent dimensions of human nature central to creativity and consciousness development, our educational systems have arguably perpetuated the very paradigm that needs to be transformed. Second is that the arts uniquely embody integral properties and will play a key role in this educational and societal shift. Within the arts, moreover, the creativity-consciousness relationship is uniquely embodied in the improvisation-based musical art form of jazz, pointing to the potential for this idiom to assume leadership in the arts-driven integral revolution. Why jazz? Why, among the infinite array of musical genres that exist, is jazz a primary candidate for transformational catalyst? What might jazz-driven change look like? Two aspects of the jazz process realm are key. First is jazz's improvisatory core, which integrates a wide array of other processes \u2014 including composition, performance, and various kinds of theoretical analysis \u2014 that are also central to creative growth in music and beyond. This improvisation-based creative foundation will be shown to promote penetration beyond the idiom's discipline-specific boundaries and openings to the broader musical landscape, wide-ranging interdisciplinary connections, and innermost dimensions of consciousness that shape creative expression and growth. Whereas much of academic and commercial thinking and practice are bound by a highly fragmented conception of the musical landscape as comprised of innumerable, discrete stylistic compartments, an integral musical perspective views these as inextricably linked areas within a broader whole. The central pulse of the musical world, moreover, resides in the melding of genres, at which point the purpose of engagement in any given area is to realize it not as self-confining destination but self-transcending tributary. This leads to a second aspect of the jazz process scope. The jazz tradition boasts a long legacy of leading artists, including Alice Coltrane, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Charles Lloyd, John McLaughlin, Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter, and Mary Lou Williams, who engaged with meditation and related methodologies for growth of creativity and consciousness in order to integrate the transcendent experiences glimpsed during their musical excursions more fully into their work and lives. We will see that improvisation and meditation, even if the first occurs in the turbulence of creative activity and the second in silence, share important common features and invite mutual engagement. Meditation, viewed here as an anchor for a broader spectrum of spiritual growth, is thus regarded as an important aspect of the jazz process spectrum, in so doing broadening the integral template the idiom brings to the overall educational and societal evolutionary spectrum. ### Why jazz?

Music Reviews By Sarah Newland The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 41 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 42 By Sarah Rigg Photography by Joni Strickfaden Smell might be the most powerful of the physical senses, yet it's one of the most underappreciated. Unlike sight and sound, which must pass through the thalamus to be processed in the cerebral cortex, the seat of higher thinking, the sense of smell bypasses the thalamus, stimulating the oldest, primal parts of the brain. Scent molecules enter the nose and flow into a part of the brain called the olfactory bulb, where they are passed into our limbic system. \"We have layers of brain development, one on top of the other, and the limbic system is the deepest layer. The limbic system is sometimes referred to as the 'reptilian brain,'\" said Dr. Amy Saunders, a physician who recently established an integrative private practice after working in the University of Michigan Health System for 20 years.\"Smell is a very important part of animals' instinctual response in many species, connecting on a deeper level because it doesn't go through conscious thought, but rather to the basic pre-mammalian instinctual brain. That's why smell is so powerful,\" Dr. Saunders said. When I recently talked to local practitioners and experts who use scents as a way to heal, bring balance, or promote creativity, each mentioned how primal the sense is and how scent and pheromones (hormonal molecules that enter through the nose but are not perceived as aromas) affect us on a level below our conscious awareness. These local healers and aromatherapists believe that this unique sense not only connects us to our feelings and memories, it can also be a tool to access our creativity and inner wisdom.\"Smell is a very important part of animals' instinctual response in many species, connecting on a deeper level because it doesn't go through conscious thought, but rather to the basic pre-mammalian instinctual brain. That's why smell is so powerful.\" - Dr. Amy Saunders Scent as a Tool for Spirituality, Health, and Creativity Jessica Elkins Rachel Eckenrod Bronwen Gates Nancy Harknett Scent's Link to Creativity and Memories Have you ever wondered why you associate smells with some of your strongest memories? Or why a scent can jolt you into a memory, and even stir feelings of longing? When I spoke to Michelle Krell Kydd, an Ann Arbor-based flavor and fragrance expert who has an award-winning blog about the sense of smell, she told me \"Smell is memory.\" This deep connection results from the olfactory bulb funneling scent molecules and pheromones to the amygdala, where emotional, biographical memories are stored. \"Emotion and memory live in the limbic system, which makes the sense of smell so visceral,\" said Krell Kydd, adding that we process smell emotionally before we can come up with words to describe it \u2014 \"something that is universally difficult for most people.\" Krell Kydd teaches workshops to help people train their noses and use scent memories to spark creativity in programs such as \"Smell & Tell: Using Your Sense of Smell for Creative Inspiration,\" a lecture she gave at the Ann Arbor Public Library a while back, and a \"smell and tell\" workshop called \"Sacred Scents and Aphrodisiacs\" held at the library in October of 2012. \"I teach people to use smell to access autobiographical memory and to learn how to be objective with their likes or dislikes of aromas, and to become aware of how important this sense is in everyday life,\" she said. Her workshops are \"part of a personal initiative to evangelize the sense of smell and help people become more confident in developing their expertise.\" Bronwen Gates of Gateways Wellness has a doctorate in botany and refers to herself as a \"joy coach.\" She incorporates aromatherapy and essential oils in her practice. She said that a certain amount of conditioning from events in our lives affects how we react to smells. One person might find a scent brings back happy memories, while another might be disgusted by the same smell, she said. Gates gave a personal example from her life, saying that her own mother's feelings of disgust about dogs and how \"dirty and nasty\" they were conditioned Gates to think dogs smelled bad. This made it difficult for Gates to warm up to her own son's puppy until, one day, a client rushed up to the puppy, hugged it, and remarked how much she loved the \"puppy smell.\" \"I had to laugh out loud,\" she said, realizing how subjective each person's reaction to different scents can be. Another local healer I spoke to, Nancy Harknett, a Reiki master and proprietor of Hand & Hand Healing in Ann Arbor, provides aromatherapy treatments to clients and echoed Krell Kydd's ideas about sparking memories and creativity through scent. She talked about ways essential oil therapy could help promote creative thinking. \"Well, you can't say, 'I want to be creative, so give me an oil,'\" Harknett joked. \"But if you put some oils together, maybe the 'believe it' blend or rubbing a little 'joy' blend on your heart. Or maybe 'brain power' or 'dream catcher' blends. If you're joyful, if you're in gratitude, it will increase the chances your creativity will be opened up.\" In addition to sparking creativity, playing with scents and learning to describe those smells provides exercise for the brain, Krell Kydd said. Training the sense of smell helps keep the brain sharp, flexible, and adaptable. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 43 \"Once you realize how important your sense of smell is and start to pay attention to it, your world becomes richer,\" she said. \"Exercising your sense of smell is good for brain plasticity.\" Having \"brain plasticity\" means your nervous system can change and adapt to differing stimulus over time, something all humans need to survive and thrive. Exercising your sense of smell not only sharpens the logical faculties but also can help bring richness and texture to creative endeavors, Krell Kydd said. \"When you teach children about the way smell, taste, and memory work together, they realize they are capable of creating stories that are authentic and imaginative.\" Scent for Health and Life Balance While some practitioners use scent to spark creativity and memories, others use essential oils and aromas to foster physical health, reduce stress, and promote life balance. Jessica Elkins, owner of Jessica's Skin & Body Apothecary, said that her aromatherapy practice focuses on helping clients with life balance. In fact, she changed the name of her business to reflect a change in philosophy. \"I changed my business name from Ananeo Skin Care to Jessica's Skin & Body Apothecary to reflect the direction my business was going in,\" she said. Elkins is a licensed esthetician who had offered day spa services out of a room at A2 Yoga for several years, and then moved into her own space in Kerrytown. While her interest in essential oils and aromatherapy began in college, she said the use of essential oils and the mixing of her own oils and scented products came five years into six years of running her business. For Rachel Eckenrod and many other aromatherapists, the focus is on the vibration of the essential oils and on how the oils make a client feel, rather than how pretty the oil might smell. It's less about scent in and of itself and more about how essential oils can shift a client's energy.

Organic body oils and body scrubs with Himalayan pink salt came next,\" she said. \"In my work lavender is the most important oil to use, because when clients come in for a facial, they want not only for their skin to end up looking and feeling good, but they want to let go of stress in their life and relax. Hot towels with lavender help with that,\" she said. Traditional Western medicine is beginning to back up what aromatherapists have known for some time about the relaxing effects of certain aromas. \"Research that's been done shows that some molecules, like those from lavender, trigger the same part of the brain that sleep medication does,\" Dr. Saunders said. \"The scent has been shown to have an affect beyond just the connection to the limbic system or our conscious brain. At least in some cases, there's a molecular level to the effect.\"Lavender is far from the only useful essential oil, however. Harknett said each oil she uses is classified by its vibration level, with rose oil being the highest. She said the vibrations from the oils \"can transform you.\" \"Say you're functioning at a low energy level; if you take a blend of the oils at a higher vibration, you'll have something for depression,\" she said. Rachel Eckenrod, owner of Back into Balance Healing Center in Ann Arbor, uses all five senses to help clients get perspective on their life problems and get \"unstuck.\" Scent plays an important role in her work. Her clients come for aromatherapy and essential oil treatments for reasons ranging from, \"I want to feel better\" to \"I don't know what to do with my life.\" For Eckenrod and many other aromatherapists, the focus is on the vibration of the essential oils and on how the oils make a client feel, rather than how pretty the oil might smell. It's less about scent in and of itself and more about how essential oils can shift a client's energy. \"I'm an empath,\" Eckenrod said. \"I tune into other people's energy patterns. I try to find out which oils shift the energy in the direction they want.\" She will create a blend for a client based on trial and error, offering them different oils and asking how the scent makes them feel. \"I'll often know what they will and won't like,\" she said. She might tell a client \"I don't think you're going to like this one,\" but she will have the client smell it anyway because \"sometimes that causes a shift, too.\" \"I have them pay attention to how it feels, not what it smells like.

The scent creates an energetic environment based on smell, all around the person, and calls forth an emotional experience. [It] brings about feelings of where they want to be or more confidence or openness in a particular area.\" Eckenrod said she often sends a scent or blend of scents that worked well in therapy home with a client so they have a reminder of how to make the shift on their own. \"But it's important they get the essential oils in a way they'll use them,\" she added. \"Bath salts aren't effective if they don't take baths, so maybe it'd be better to send them home with a shower gel or a little diffuser, or a roll-on [applicator] they can keep around, near them, all the time. It's something they can take with them to recreate the state they were able to get to in the session.\" Scent and Spirituality Scent and aroma not only affect our mental and physical health, but also can be a tool in our spiritual lives. \"Breath and spirituality have a significant link themselves, but when you add a natural scent, the essence of the plant imparts balance to the subtle nature of our body,\" Elkins said. \"When we feel off balance, there is an oil that, when inhaled, can help. When we feel scattered, or are spending too much time thinking or on the computer, richer oils like vanilla, vetiver, rosewood, and sandalwood can help. When we are feeling depressed or down, a top note like bergamot, neroli [derived from bitter orange], and lime can lift our minds,\" Elkins said. Eckenrod said she believes essential oils work most powerfully in the emotional realm, which then can cause physical changes, and more deeply, changes in her clients' ability to access their intuition and learn to heal themselves.\"I'm an empath.

For instance, Eckenrod mentioned that a client came to her who hadn't ever felt anything from working with crystals, but she did after working with essential oils. Eckenrod also offers essential oils for chakra balancing. \"Scent can be a really good introduction, a good place to start, in that it's a transitional way into energy healing,\" Eckenrod said. \"Once you awaken that 'feeling' part of what it smells like, it gives you access to the world of energy, a way of tuning into our inner senses.\" For Gates, physical healing and spirituality area closely linked. \"I believe, at some level, all healing action is spiritual,\" she said. \"I think of essential oil as a distillation of these unique molecules, like the soul of the planet, and they're received by our cells, by our bodies as incredible gifts of healing.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 46 Scent as a Tool for Spirituality, Health, and Creativity Continued from page 45 \"When we think about the world of fragrance, the molecules given off by the natural world, they were not designed for our benefit, but we're so human-centric and think it's about us.

Gates added that we not only should pay attention to what molecules we're taking in from plants, as a healing gift, but should also be aware of what molecules we're putting out and how they affect mother earth. \"When we think about the world of fragrance, the molecules given off by the natural world, they were not designed for our benefit, but we're so human-centric and think it's about us. A lot of these were created not for us but to help promote balance and harmony in the natural world, and we just take advantage of that,\" she said. \"We shouldn't get greedy and fail to recognize these molecules are needed for the balance and harmony of the whole world, not just for our body. As humans, we are contributing many molecules into the atmosphere,\" she said, from harmful polluting molecules to helpful molecules like the pheromones that promote bonding between mother and baby. \"We, as humans, have within us the capacity to give out mother hormones, calming molecules. We're just on the edge of major breakthroughs of understanding the ways we impact each other and the earth. I hope we will then choose to put our focus on developing ways that bring harmony and balance rather than promoting conflict and entropy.\" Cautions Though essential oils and aromatherapy have great potential for promoting healing, the practitioners I spoke to had a few cautions as well. Elkins suggested following your gut instinct about which scents to use and which to avoid. \"Usually when people have scent sensitivity, it is sensitivity towards synthetic perfumes,\" Elkins said. \"However if the scent of an oil makes you feel uneasy, you should avoid it. Additionally, essential oils should be used with caution on the skin, especially undiluted essential oils.\" Special caution should be used with concentrated, undiluted cinnamon or peppermint oil on the skin, for instance, since these can cause an unpleasant burning sensation. Generally speaking, pure, therapeutic-grade essential oils are safe, but experts caution beginners who might want to receive aromatherapy or do their own \"I believe, at some level, all healing action is spiritual. I think of essential oil as a distillation of these unique molecules, like the soul of the planet, and they're received by our cells, by our bodies as incredible gifts of healing.\" - Bronwen Gates \"Because scent goes to the amygdala, where primal emotions are stored, where emotional trauma is stored, there's no question things can come up.\" - Nancy Harknett The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 47 experimentation with essential oils. Several of the healers I spoke to recommended asking for mentorship or getting formal training in aromatherapy and use of essential oils. Harnkett and others also mentioned that the quality of essential oils differ by manufacturer. Harknett only uses Young Living Essential Oils, while others recommended other brands. All agreed that the purest, organic essential oils tend to cost more and that beginners should use oils from a reputable source, warning that some cheap brands are adulterated or mislabeled. Harknett also cautioned that therapeutic-grade essential oils are meant to be used at room temperature, and practices such as putting the oils on a candle or light bulb will destroy the therapeutic value of the oils. Some books and experts offer standards for what essential oils are to be used to address specific conditions, but beginners should be aware that opinions vary. For instance, some aromatherapists believe in using essential oils for supporting pregnancy or as supplemental holistic therapy for cancer, while others said they don't recommend using essential oils for either condition. Harknett and Eckenrod both cautioned about the double-edged nature of scent tapping into the \"reptilian\" part of the brain. \"Because scent goes to the amygdala, where primal emotions are stored, where emotional trauma is stored, there's no question things can come up,\" Harknett said. Scents and essential oils can bring up bad memories along with good ones, she said. Those who are new to aromatherapy should be aware that strong feelings could surface in response to a particular aroma.

Workshops inspire and educate us. But what makes an assemblage of good practices into a coherent spiritual path? I invite you to consider a well-held, coherent spiritual path to be one that identifies the issues most stressful and important to you in particular. It then addresses them directly with practices that induce the issues to evolve. In addressing your issues, it offers a means, not necessarily always for you to feel better, but at any moment to marshal the most essential you, enlarging your scope of understanding and repertoire of responses. In this view, to progress along a spiritual path is to awaken to this larger, essential self. For those who want to awaken, what is needed is a means to progress and to map that progress. That is, awakening requires a path that can be actively worked and observed. Synthesized here is an underlying template of all spiritual paths and what you need to know to map the particulars of your individual life along it. If you record the fluctuations of your diet and your exercise, you can expect to improve both, from the fact of witnessing alone. Track the workings of your spiritual path and you will tend to advance in the directions you value, because you're developing consciousness, and thereby notice your choices and move along faster. Though not itself the be all and end all, awakening is a requisite step on the spiritual path. At the very least, with awakening, meaning accrues to all of life, and though the slings and arrows continue to arrive and invoke participation, they arrive within a trustworthy immanent order. The synthesized template of spiritual paths offered here has three parts. Everyday reality is the horizontal dimension of life, and the much larger transcendent reality is the vertical dimension. Besides these two parts, we need a third, which is practices that enlarge our perspective from the horizontal toward the vertical. We need these not because verticality is better as such, but because we need both, and generally, by adulthood, we have only the horizontal. The scale of vertical perspective includes a larger reality, and so more choices. With more choices come more feedback and, as it's incorporated, a larger understanding reached faster. The larger the understanding, the greater the sense of choice. And so the natural system for refining understanding self-perpetuates, until being awake is our stable background state. Horizontal and Vertical. The horizontal dimension is the physical world that we are born into, with all of its resources and our participation with them, not only physically, but mentally and emotionally. Except as viewed from the vertical dimension, the horizontal is everything. If the horizontal dimension includes all of our everyday reality, why do we need a map to somewhere else \u2014 the vertical \u2014 especially since it's outside the reality we all share? If you intuit that there must be something more to what we're doing here on earth than standardly appears, that's reason enough. The esoteric branches (at least) of all of the major religions, as well as the nonreligious spiritual \"ways\" (such as those of A. H. Almaas, Ken Wilber, Judith Blackstone, and Sri Aurobindo), refer in their own terms to aspects of the vertical dimension (God, heaven, the Tao, Atman, Allah, dharmakaya, foundational consciousness, higher power, and many more). And though all religions and ways construe the vertical, each through its own lens, if you don't choose to follow one of them, you can certainly still explore verticality. What you need is to notice when you're in the ballpark, so as to consciously incorporate your spiritual experiences and allow them gradually to compound. On the vertical dimension, the day-to-day reality we're usually aware of enlarges toward the scale of infinity. Meaning and all else begin there, and all information exists there. From the vertical we sense the endless waves of energy that flood our cosmos, scaling down for our use, each gradation less rarefied and more differentiated (the dralas, latifs, and lesser gods, as several traditions perceive these differentiating waves; what tai chi, shamanic passes, and Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi's \"flow\" connect to). Finally, these energies coalesce through levels of individual energy fields and then into physical form: the horizontal. The horizontal dimension is thus a sort of bloom and outermost expression of the infinitely larger vertical. Accessing the vertical dimension isn't a matter of getting somewhere else but of focusing differently. On the horizontal, we look at the world as though at stained glass windows from inside a structure communally built. On the vertical, we have refocused so as to look through the stained glass, to the much larger natural world outside. In order to perceive the vertical dimension, we need to refine the energy fields that are the foundations of our bodies \u2014 the individualized energy that they are built on. Thus, our need for spiritual practices. As, over eons, the world's communally held energy field slowly clears, information not previously perceptible in the incoming waves of energy can be perceived broadly. Every hundredth monkey picks it up. Levels within Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions. Within the horizontal dimension, and then the vertical as we're able to perceive it, there are describable gestalts of comprehension that all humans grow through. Beginning at birth our understanding can only be in terms of basic physical needs. Then, as we grow, it proceeds through standard childhood magical illusions and adolescent selfishness, and, gradually, as our edges are worn away throughout adulthood, our understanding features increasing appreciation of people and conditions as they are. Each larger gestalt of understanding, or developmental level, also varies by including as \"myself\" a larger swath of the universe. Though each of us occupies only one body, our vested interests enlarge as we mature. After ourselves and our immediate families we can develop identity with, and so vested interest in, larger and larger groupings of people. With great maturity, finally we consider as ourselves all of humanity, all beings, all entities . . . the universe, horizontal and vertical. Each larger level of developed identity transcends and includes (as Wilber says) all of the narrower understandings of the smaller levels that we have grown through, Awakening: A Map of the Territory By Caroline Charlesworth Track the workings of your spiritual path and you will tend to advance in the directions you value, because you're developing consciousness, and thereby notice your choices and move along faster.

The horizontal dimension is thus a sort of bloom and outermost expression of the infinitely larger vertical.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 49 The fir st principle for choosing a specific practice is to choose what appeals to you, for logical and illogical reasons: whatever appeals. The second principle is to sample several that appeal and choose what you find works. You're looking for practices that you'll be willing to use regularly to fill in your understanding from the vertical dimension, with peak experiences that jump levels to suddenly reveal larger understandings. And for the horizontal dimension, you're looking for practices you'll use regularly to surface bothersome issues and integrate their opposing elements, so as to gradually build larger levels of understanding. All of the practices named here are included because detailed instructions exist for them. Look for the how-to in books and articles by their teachers and on websites. Here are some grounds on which you could gauge various practices' appeal. The fundamental skill for self-development is the ability to hold awareness. Can you hold a focus on the sense within you of something troublesome without your standard defensive thoughts taking you away? (For example, \"This is stupid / unimportant / too hard / proof I'm always wrong / beneath me / not what I should be doing right now...\" or thoughts just bounce to another topic.) Because the minds of even longtime meditators can balk when asked to bring steady openness to troublesome issues, awareness practice is useful lifelong. For this, choose a form of meditation, such as Vipassana, or centering prayer as described by Thomas Keating, or especially the meditative forms that have a body-sensing component, such as Reginald Ray's and Shinzen Young's. Choose Eugene Gendlin's Focusing, as well, if your regular practice doesn't include a bodily-state component. Focusing also offers the advantage of very well worked out directions and troubleshooting. All awareness practices demonstrate what issues are ready for you to take up by what arises to interrupt the practice. When your conscious awareness is held on these interrupting thoughts, it will gradually see into the underlying issues, and so help to deconstruct them. Follow such issues steadily, as they arise repeatedly over time, and you'll illuminate grounds for compassion, and then develop larger, uncharged understandings. Less pleasant responses usually come first. If y ou meditate only, you necessarily will eventually clear the structures of your energy field, enlarge your identity to the vertical, and awaken \u2014 possibly not, however, in your current lifetime. Apply practices that build on meditation to intercept what interrupts it and you'll speed the awakening process. Apply the knowing of your body and you'll sharpen your clarity; your intellect's following instructions is what sets up the practice, but if it's productive, it's productive because your body carries it out. Many practices that build on meditation are available now, associated with current teachers. For example, to expand immediate conscious awareness without meditation's standard sitting or walking forms, pursue Eckhart Tolle's coming into the present moment. To enlarge your identity using the energy field inside and outside your physical body and your surroundings, use Judith Blackstone's Enlightenment Process. For practice in dropping a fertile question into your being and deriving a considered answer, take up A. H. Almaas's Inquiry. The Big Mind / Big Heart process developed by Genpo Roshi can be DVD-led as though you're present with a group of people who all are locating aspects of themselves, each aspect having a coherent, relatively independent agenda. The aspects are addressed as named beings in their own right and respectfully plumbed. By the end, awareness of all of them at once constitutes Big Mind / Big Heart, which is greatly expanded awareness and often is temporary awakening. Meditation will always be the proven, venerable means of enlarging understanding to that of the vertical dimension, but at some point on an individual's spiritual path, Big Mind / Big Heart can be a genuine shortcut. Psychotherapy, especially as sometimes is described as transpersonal, with at least one mind being consciously aware of meeting another and the associated internal states, can also further internal unfolding and integration. The limit on this happening when the person in therapy isn't trained in such sensing is what Gendlin developed Focusing to address. Two practices are especially effective for resolving conflict by developing a larger level of understanding between people. The Dialog practice developed by Harville and Helen Hendrix structures two people's conversation to optimize respectful understanding of their differences. Framing romantic love as complementarity that denotes wholeness in two people as a unit, rather than as is desirable in each individual, the Hendrixes put the couple's complementarity in conscious service of individual growth. Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication (NVC) also relies on structured conversation. It can be used as a recognizable formula with little training that still has effect, or with practice can skillfully wind down even dangerously charged situations by getting everyone on the same side. If we all always skillfully used NVC, we'd have awakening, and world peace, in no time.even though (barring trauma) we're unlikely to fall back to the logic of any of those preceding levels, once our personal world has enlarged. Each developmental level makes perfectly good sense within its own foundational beliefs and the experience set that is woven in terms of those beliefs. (Academic researchers on developmental levels include Clare Graves and Don Beck, Robert Kegan, and Susanne Cook-Greuter.) Each next-larger level is a successively clearer approximation of the ultimate clarity that transcends space and time on the vertical dimension, a sort of stair-stepping of humans' communal development toward the ultimate understanding. With each larger level there are fewer co-occupying people. But as our world culture develops and each generation shifts a bit beyond the last, greater credence is communally given to the largest understandings. Forty years ago people creating their own realities was news to the zeitgeist of the West; that has been somewhat incorporated, and now what's under communal consideration is, for example, high sensing (which is on the vertical) and how it is limited within individuals (very much on the horizontal), and what death is (it only exists on the horizontal) and how to consider reincarnation (as a vertical experience). Peak Experiences. Direct experiences of the vertical have often been called peak experiences. They move us beyond ordinary comprehension of life and convey directly its inherent, trustworthy meaning and order. They needn't be ecstatic in order to be useful, by any means. For working purposes, consider a peak experience to be briefly, unsustainably but informatively skipping some developmental levels. Nature, birth and death, and meditation can offer these experiences, as can music and the arts, bodywork, and other prompts to release the tension in our heads and simply be and observe. At first the several-levels-larger observation happens by accident. But as such experiences compound it can be invoked at unexpected times, then more often, and over time it becomes readily retrievable. As we grow through more levels of development, eventually the former peak is the ordinary background state. In the Western zeitgeist that determines how much of the vertical dimension can be supported in our shared perception, peak experiences are becoming much more common. Consider noting for yourself as peak experiences all instances of your knowing, unquestionably knowing, how coherent and safe life is, in the broadest sense. Notice that there's a comforting acceptance at such moments of how what's difficult for us nevertheless is part of a trustworthy order, and that this sense then goes away. The reason many people think they haven't had spiritual experiences is that these experience states, though ordinary, are not an ordinary subject of discussion and at first are temporary. They come \u2014 we're in them but might not register what we know then as a complete gestalt or even as notable \u2014 and they go. To make use of your own peak experiences, notice and credit them when they arrive. Look around inside your state of being at those times and see what you know that you ordinarily don't. It will be taken over by a more typical state, but remembering any segments of the trustworthy wholeness you experience then will help you to own it for longer periods. It will help fill in your path from the vertical end. Dual and Nondual. As a primary feature, the horizontal dimension is dualistic. That is, there are poles of opposition: insides and outsides, things we like and things we reject, mutually exclusive things and beings. These are features of life so standard and ordinary we don't even question their reality. You are not me; the chair is not the table. It isn't that, from the vertical dimension, these mutual exclusivities are unreal, though in esoteric teachings they are called illusion. Rather, it's that what's mutually exclusive on the horizontal is perceived from the vertical to be, more fundamentally, mutually integral. Like beams of colored light separated out by a prism, what's separate on the horizontal never ceases to be whole on the vertical. Looked at from the horizontal, the separated colors seem the more basic and real. From the vertical, the colors certainly exist but always as expressions of whole, clear light. Making use of the differences and conflicts among things on the horizontal to play them against each other, by means of concerted practices, we discern the larger patterns at work. [See the Sidebar: How Conflict Is Made Useful.] Thereby, we thin and clear out the tightly woven structures of belief in our individual energy fields and enlarge our current developmental level. Eventually, as gradually as we require, we awaken to perception of and identity with the nondual vertical. All awareness practices demonstrate what issues are ready for you to take up by what arises to interrupt the practice. Follow such issues steadily, as they arise repeatedly over time, and you'll illuminate grounds for compassion, and then develop larger, uncharged understandings. Less pleasant responses usually come first. How to Choose Spiritual Practices Each developmental level makes perfectly good sense within its own foundational beliefs and the experience set that is woven in terms of those beliefs. As, over eons, the world's communally held energy field slowly clears, information not previously perceptible in the incoming waves of energy can be perceived broadly. Every hundredth monkey picks it up. Continued on page 50The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 50 Here's an example of the usefulness of enlarging horizontal perspective toward the vertical. On the horizontal dimension no two people have identical beliefs and preferences. Some of us differ wildly from each other. So, generally, we hold each other far enough away to respectfully ignore our differences, or in some degree we go, if not to war, into friction. It certainly appears that at least some of us have got to be wrong. But with a vertical, nondual point of view, our differences are valid expressions of universal human experience, and are complementary to each other. No beliefs can be wrong. Since they arise from necessarily limited (horizontal) experience, they are correct within that experience set, and in the gestalt of that developmental level. Certainly, bringing this understanding to the bargaining table doesn't itself resolve all difficulties. It does support setting up conditions in which everyone's underlying needs receive value, so that goals including everyone's vested interests can form. Then, everyone being on the same side and the emotional charge of our having been against each other being allayed, our differences are much easier to address. Of course, it follows that to grow from the horizontal into the vertical is to give up ever being wholly right. Is that too much to sacrifice in order to come to awakening? At the level where designing one's own spiritual path seems important, maybe not. We're all progressing, headed in the same direction. The only error is our focus on the quite real, needful, and admirable concerns of the horizontal, such as career, partnership, home life, and legacy, without knowing this: We unthinkingly make them stand-ins for our underlying need to awaken to the vertical, where meaning actually lies. Our culture encourages us to think that the horizontal concerns are what give us meaning. But in truth they bring fulfillment only temporarily, and with endless repetition of our labors and our mental constructions. The requirements of life on the horizontal are real for as long as we're in bodies, and they are not to be slighted. We do need to tend to ourselves, our families and communities, and the planet. Again, the problem is when we gauge the effects of this tending on the horizontal dimension only. While oriented only to the horizontal, either \"success\" or \"failure\" may influence us to course-correct wrenchingly out of alignment with the universe, as opposed to knowing that ultimate outcomes extend beyond our lifetimes and trusting the process even so. Horizontal-only course correction shows up in our lives as frustrating repeated feedback loops, outright addictions, and the same old, same old attractions and repulsions that we can't seem to see further into. The endless efforts of our lives oriented to the horizontal are not at all wasted, however. Only when we succeed in our horizontal efforts well enough to see that meeting ambitious goals doesn't bring reliable fulfillment are we inclined to seriously reevaluate. Or alternately, it's when, after all our efforts, we smack up against the limits the horizontal dimension inevitably features (not least, death) that we finally have to give up. And so we cast about more broadly for where deep meaning lies. That's when a map of the spiritual path is most helpful. Direct Experience: Practices. To recap, by adulthood we have full lives on the horizontal but typically are missing ready access to the vertical dimension. We can increase access to the vertical by enlarging our developmental level, that is, by gradually enlarging how much of the universe we identify as ourselves. In the process, our individual energy fields refine and clear. The vertical appears, and we awaken. Though we cannot force this refinement of our identity and our energy fields, we can invoke the process and support it to proceed. To do this requires making concerted use of dualism. The whole point of being incarnate is to make use of the dualism of the horizontal dimension. As the primary tool on the horizontal to clear our understanding, dualism exists specifically to free up access to the vertical. With rightly used practices it can become the means of awakening to vertical inherent meaning and trust. A rightly used practice is one that holds in awareness at the same time elements of our lives that seem most in opposition, most directly dualistic. By consciously How Conflict Is Made Useful Conflict supports spiritual growth when, in order to resolve it, a larger level is accessed. For example, if in meditation the thoughts swim up that right now I should return an email I had forgotten about and then immediately that I've got to apply myself to meditating, it's easy to favor one thought over the other. The urge to return an email is probably going to recur over the course of the meditation no matter how effectively I apply myself, with me beating back the urge or turning away from it just as often. In the moment, the two alternatives appear to be in conflict. (If I act out the alternation, returning the email and meditating afterward, something else will rise to distract me. I know; I've done this before.) My meditation is hijacked. Then I remember to look into whether these two urgent thoughts share some larger, common ground. My focus enlarges to objectively represent both thoughts on my mind-screen, in a Focusing-style Inquiry. I'm still thinking, not meditating, but now at least I know I'm doing it. Even just that much leeway decreases my self-judgment about the thinking. With this ease allowed myself, my brain relaxes a bit; I'm willing to let go of the entertainment value of conflicting elements in a fight. With relaxation comes the softer, more open sense of a larger level to look around in. I look around, and something turns up. When I allow the return-email thought and also the meditate-now thought to co-occupy my mind-screen without judgment, each shows up with a tinge of fear. Now able to hold both thoughts with more definition, more clarity, I notice that under each of them is the previously unformed sense that if I don't do this right, I lose value. Maybe I'm not a valid human being. Existential crisis, here on my meditation cushion. The existential fear is the real issue, not which of two actions to take. I spend some time with this flavor of fear, giving it undemanding attention while its emotional charge develops and then recedes (or turns into something else). Once I allow all of this to arise, once the pieces have become coherent, the urge to return email and the urge to apply myself to meditation become mutually understandable. They are poles of action having in common habitually protecting me from the experience of fear. When held in conscious awareness, they are no longer in conflict but alike, as objects of a larger level of understanding. Experiencing this, my mind is present, open, unfraught: meditating. The existential fear is the real issue, not which of two actions to take. I spend some time with this flavor of fear, giving it undemanding attention while its emotional charge develops and then recedes (or turns into something else). Holding respectful, steady awareness of our own internal sense of any of life's elements prompts that sense to unfold, to evolve: to genuinely change. Direct experiences of the vertical have often been called peak experiences. They move us beyond ordinary comprehension of life and convey directly its inherent, trustworthy meaning and order.Awakening: A Map of the Territory Continued from page 49 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 51 opening to larger levels of understanding that unite these elements, we can, practice by practice, level by developmental level, enlarge our understanding to include more and more of the universe. Practices that make specific use of dualism to refine our understanding and our fields are numerous and ripe for our use. (See the Sidebar: How to Choose Spiritual Practices.) There is a difference between these practices and much less productive spiritual emulation \u2014disciplining ourselves without foundation into wished-for goodness and benevolence. Spiritual practices as recommended here involve cultivating patient, conscious awareness of our internal bodily states so that they actually evolve. Making skillful use of the horizontal is not necessarily about being good, or doing good, but about holding awareness consciously so that larger understandings can develop. Useful as discipline can be in making our practice regular, using it to force ourselves into wished-for states rather than evolving into them is not sustainable. Note an assumption being made here. Holding respectful, steady awareness of our own internal sense of any of life's elements prompts that sense to unfold, to evolve: to genuinely change. It's a trick and perk of being in physical bodies that we have this capacity. Further, to hold within the body the sense of two seemingly exclusive elements at once is to allow the body to integrate them. To integrate, here, means to allow an understanding to grow that is large enough to encompass both (rather than for either element to be judged the correct one; that is, to be evaluated dualistically, at the other's expense). By means of this unfolding and integration, we use our bodies to move along the spiritual path, further clearing our energy fields by clearing our understanding of the horizontal dimension. As the process proceeds, we recognize ourselves actually always existing on the vertical, even while immersed in horizontal, daily-life concerns. Each practice either develops awareness as such \u2014 which in its pure form is without words or thoughts, a dwelling in the vertical \u2014 or it specifically connects for integration one part of immediate horizontal reality with another. The parts can be awareness connected with the body, one aspect of self with another, or oneself with another person or with the environment. Spend time regularly with any such practices and the issues most fertile for your use will arise. Spend more time and you have the opportunity to transcend these issues \u2014 if not to make them go away, to use them to enrich your life rather than suffering from them. \"Ego\" and \"negative\" emotions elaborate into worthy, addressable aspects of ourselves, bringing forward information and fullness of experience that we need. For modern-day folks who are well rewarded but also scolded for living in our heads, having that good, intelligent head from which to follow the how-to instructions for these practices finally becomes a plus on the spiritual path. From the practices, understanding compounds, and all else on the path ensues. Leeway. The dark night of the soul is the ramped-up dynamic tension that precedes cycling on to a next, currently challenging developmental level. Leeway, space between you and what's in your face or pressing on your spirit, is available in the form of time off from practices and also of adding in buffering comforts for yourself of all sorts. You are a trustworthy system; your reactions to the feedback your practices generate are just more horizontal feedback to be valued and worked with. Too much challenging feedback can be handled by looking into it further, certainly, but also by intentionally setting it aside for a while. (It will come back. Trust the universe to up the ante.) Like all other dualisms, the practices/leeway complement becomes useful instead of an oppositional block in your system when each part is consciously chosen and mapped, and their alternation is intentional. As is often pointed out, we are already in the rarefied state of the vertical dimension but don't realize it. That is, whether or not we \"get\" the larger reality of the vertical dimension directly or understand it (first) intellectually, we (and everything in physical existence) are literally made of its rarefied energy. As long as we're in bodies, we have the equipment to perceive life on the horizontal. And as soon as we've encompassed enough of the disparate elements of the horizontal dimension with our understanding and our identity, the vertical opens to us; we know ourselves to be that, even more fundamentally than we are our minds and bodies. It was there all along. Until then, until we've cleared and opened our personal reality enough to include the whole of the horizontal, our separation from elements within it offers continual opportunity to develop ourselves.As we grow through more levels of development, eventually the former peak is the ordinary background state. What's mutually exclusive on the horizontal is perceived from the vertical to be, more fundamentally, mutually integral. Horizontal-only course correction shows up in our lives as frustrating repeated feedback loops, outright addictions, and the same old, same old attractions and repulsions that we can't seem to see further into.There is, in other words, from this large perspective, no way to do life wrong. Every life features the everyday horizontal and the larger vertical dimension of which it is the expression. Our typical practices, intentional or not, determine the relationship between the two. We all have the same three parts, but no one else's life has exactly the same issues and experiences and preferences. On the horizontal, what issues complicate your life and convey its tensions? What experiences of the vertical draw you toward ultimate wholeness? Which practices draw you out best, and what forms of leeway allow you the room to incorporate your findings without their emotional impact derailing your motivation? As you refine your answers, you refine the coherence of your path. Finally, what happens when we consciously work the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of a path? Our body-based practices yield feedback on what dualities we have yet to understand and transcend, and are the means of resolving them. They let us know how much of our horizontal reality we have yet to bring inside our identity. And the touchstone for each of us to courageously, concertedly bring everything into our identity is our experience on the vertical of how trustworthy and meaningful that inclusion actually is. Daily life then becomes spiritual practice, and we continually adjust for how much development we can support. Instead of generally living good lives, we're deciding how fast, how deep, and how far to move on our own paths. Through my lens, this creation of consciousness is exactly what we have incarnated to do. ### Caroline Charlesworth has offered an Ann Arbor-area practice, Conscious Bodywork, for eighteen years.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 52 In a mutual interview, two local professional healing artists \u2014Stefanie Cohen and Milagros Paredes \u2014 demonstrate how sharing expertise with each other has significantly benefited them and their clients on numerous levels. In a relaxed back-and-forth question and answer session, Stefanie and Milagros discuss body knowledge and the physicality of being, healing, and life in a conversational exchange that mirrors the client sessions they trade with one another. Milagros, 51, is a shiatsu practitioner and Certified Apprentice Integral Coach\u00ae. In her work, she seeks to facilitate the healing process through an integrated approach to shiatsu, incorporating touch, awareness, food, herbal medicine, and ongoing encouragement to clients to practice awareness and movement techniques. She sees clients out of her home in Chelsea, and also does housecalls. She and her son, Joseph, who is 13, live in Chelsea. Stefanie, 45, is a Registered Somatic Movement Educator and a performing artist who facilitates group classes and conducts private, individual sessions. Her teaching approach centers on helping students develop keen physical awareness, mindful presence, respectful touch, and collaborative connection; she facilitates exploration of somatic movement practice as a means of self-discovery, artistic expression, and self-care. She owns and manages SOMA (Studio Of Movement Arts) in the Kerrytown area of downtown Ann Arbor. She and her partner, Corey Gearhart, and her two children, Shane, 13, and Billie, 9, live on the west side of Ann Arbor. Stefanie Cohen: Milagros, you and I have been trading client sessions with each other for the past four years, and we have found that it has had an effect both on our own well-being and on the way we conduct our work. We've gone through some similar life stages during this time \u2014 we've both participated in professional training programs, have been raising our children, and have each also gone through a divorce. Over the course of this time, through conversation, writing, and sharing some of the practice and theory behind the techniques we employ, we have grown to become more knowledgeable about each other's work and appreciative of its value. This has supported both us and our clients. Within this context, you came up with the idea to write an article about our work and the processes we've been engaged in, in the form of a mutual interview. Thank you so much for inviting me to do this with you. Stefanie: First, how would you describe this cross-pollination, Milagros? Milagros Parades: I am interested in how the work we receive from one another informs and starts to get integrated into the way that we work with clients \u2014 the presence we bring. For me, one of the most interesting aspects of bodywork, and what I have benefited most from, is a greater awareness of my body. Increasing body awareness is what allows for ongoing healing \u2014 it's what begins to help us see how we participate in our own suffering and what choices we have for altering habitual patterns that no longer serve us. Before I was engaged in Authentic Movement practice with you, I had wanted to find a way to strengthen this aspect of my work by inviting my clients to a more active awareness of their body, but I wasn't sure how to do this. Through our work together in this practice, and through my recent work in Focusing Technique, I am learning how to do this. Stefanie: Within our trading with one another, I have appreciated the opportunity to receive regular, consistent bodywork and to barter for it during a time when money has been tight for me. In doing so, I have been able to self-tend through receiving not only skillful touch but herbal and nutritional guidance that has supported me through stress and distress. So often, this kind of self-care can go by the wayside when we are concerned about our finances. Creating a small-scale \"barter economy\" not only addresses these concerns but also, I believe, upholds a sense of value for the work that we each have to offer.Beyond the economic exchange, however, I appreciate how actively you have participated in a conversation with me about somatic work, including both practical and theoretical aspects. I've been able to experiment with and expand upon ways I might work with my movement clients and students. You have been particularly forthcoming about the ways in which psychotherapy and somatic work complement each other, for example, which has made my research process more rich and interactive. Though the specific manner in which we work with clients is different, what you model for me in terms of your commitment to your practice influences and inspires me. This has been tremendously supportive. For me, an interesting aspect of our process together, in our trading and even within this conversation, is how we seem to move fluidly between being the receiver of care and being the giver of care. What is it that we hold for ourselves to make that possible? With some of our clients, we would never choose to trade. Certainly, if we were traditional psychotherapists or physicians, we wouldn't place ourselves in the role of receiver of care to our clients \u2014 we wouldn't alter those relationships or share certain aspects of ourselves. But for some reason \u2014 likely a philosophical sense about this kind of work \u2014 you and I seem to be able to make those flips. I'm interested in this and am sure we will touch upon this in our conversation. Stefanie: To begin with, though, I'm curious to hear more about your background. Can you tell me a little about where you were born and about your cultural upbringing? Milagros: I was born in Manila, Philippines, in 1962. My parents were both Spanish-Filipino, what's known as \"mestizo\" in the Philippines. I grew up with English, Spanish, and Tagalog, and I spoke English mixed with a few Tagalog words and expressions here and there. I have an older sister and brother and a younger sister. In Manila we lived in a family compound consisting of four homes and a swing set. It was separated from the rest of the neighborhood by huge cement walls with broken glass rimming the top and large spiked green gates on each end. Because the extreme poverty of Manila made it a dangerous place, we were not allowed to leave the compound unless we were with an adult. Several members of my father's family lived there with us so, in a sense, we lived in a co-housing situation. My grandmother took me to ballet classes and to the country club where I learned to swim and, later, trained further in swimming with my brother several times a week. I loved that country club. It was one place we could roam freely outside of the compound. Stefanie: How old were you when your family left the Philippines? Milagros: When I was about nine, my father decided to emigrate to Canada, in anticipation of political unrest under the Marcos regime. My father had some savings, but very little really, and with this courageous and loving decision, he changed the course of our lives and opened up worlds of possibilities \u2014 for my whole family. After six months, during which time he found work and a home for me, my siblings, and my mother, we followed him. The rest of his family followed as well, while my mother's family remained in the Philippines. We lived in the suburbs of Toronto for a year and a half and then, as a result of my father's job transfer \u2014 he was a salesman \u2014 we moved back to Asia, this time to live in Singapore. Life there was safe, secure, and full of opportunities. I lived in Singapore until I was seventeen, when I moved back to Canada for university. My parents stayed in Singapore for a few more years, so it remained a home base, and my brother and I would return there a couple of times a year during vacations.

I love to see this birthing of change and hope.\" \u2014Milagros Paredes\"While I believe that healing does not necessarily equate to 'fixing' or 'curing,' and that we have much that we can learn from injury and limitation... I'm aware that the support of a knowledgeable, thorough practitioner is invaluable.\" \u2014 Stefanie CohenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 53 Milagros: I actually know very little about your childhood, Stefanie. Where were you born, and what were your early years like? Stefanie: I was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1967 to a culturally, though nonreligious, Jewish family and moved as a small child to Cambridge, Massachusetts. My parents were quite young when I was born \u2014 in their late teens and still in college \u2014 and they actively participated in the antiwar movement of the late 1960's and early '70s. I am told that I spent a good deal of my infancy in a stroller at demonstrations and rallies! We moved to Cambridge initially because of contacts and friends my parents had in the area and so my dad could go to graduate school; but we settled there, and I grew up there along with my younger sister, Gillian. My mother, Phyllis, has worked for the American Friends Service Committee, a peace and social justice organization, for more than thirty-five years. My father, Stu, was a journalist \u2014 initially with a newspaper called The Real Paper, which became The Boston Phoenix. He was a foreign affairs writer and arts critic and was also an artist \u2014 a musician and photographer. Certainly, my dad's engagement as an artist and with the connections he made between art and social change was a great support to me. Over the years of his career, which sadly ended with his death in 1996, the focus of his writing shifted to public health and policy. My sister, who grew to become quite engaged with public policy herself, and who is particularly interested in educational needs of children, works for the U.S. Department of Education and lives in Washington, DC. Stefanie: Would you describe your work with shiatsu and say something about the other modalities you use? Milagros: Shiatsu is a form of massage involving the application of pressure. I practice Zen Shiatsu, developed by Shizuto Masunaga. In this form of shiatsu, pressure is applied to all parts of the body along specific pathways called meridians. In a session, I work on a mat on the floor and, using my weight in a relaxed manner, I apply deep, slow, perpendicular pressure to stimulate the body's parasympathetic nervous system and support the body's inherent impulse toward healing. In addition to touch, I often find it important to ask the client about his or her diet and to offer recommendations that seem relevant. I also integrate Focusing Technique wherever I think it will support release and, from a big-picture perspective, I allow the Integral Coaching\u00ae method to inform my approach. Stefanie: Restoring a balanced flow of energy seems key in your work. Can you say more about that? Milagros: The opposite of flow is stagnation and congestion. Everybody experiences this in one way or another. In Chinese medicine, disease results from stagnant energy, and in my work, my effort is toward promoting a smooth flow of energy. After a session, clients report experiences of profound relaxation, a clear mind, diminishment of symptoms, greater flexibility, a new sense of lengthening, and flexibility. These are the result of clearing stagnation, supporting deficiencies, and dispersing excess energy. I have noticed and am excited about how people often also have a motivation to proactively care for their bodies and their health in new ways. I love to see this birthing of change and hope. The healing happens not only because I am facilitating a smoother flow of energy but because I have opened my body to receive their energy. This connection between us \u2014 I think this in itself is healing. Milagros: Stefanie, this aspect of connection is something that I experience powerfully in the movement work I do with you. Would you describe Authentic Movement and speak about this practice? Stefanie: Authentic Movement is a contemplative movement practice founded by Mary Starks Whitehouse, a modern dancer and pioneer in the field of dance therapy, in the 1950s. She investigated the ways in which people, rather than having movement imposed upon them, could have their bodies lead them into movement. When people allow themselves to listen deeply and to be moved by their bodies, a tremendous number of images and insights can come forth. Milagros: What do you mean by movement being imposed? Stefanie: For instance, in forms including our everyday, utilitarian tasks, sports, or dance choreography. I'd say that a big question the practice poses is this: \"If left to its own devices, what does your body feel inclined to do? How do you feel drawn to move or rest?\" When people allow themselves to listen deeply and to be moved by their body's impulses, a tremendous number of images, emotions, and insights can come forth. Typically, the practice includes eyes-closed movers, listening for their body's movement impulses \u2014 however subtle or expressive \u2014 attended by eyes-open witnesses who watch them compassionately. After a period of movement, the movers and witnesses may write or draw or otherwise further creatively explore the material or themes that have emerged in the session. Practitioners use Authentic Movement as a physical exploration, an artistic resource, a therapeutic modality, and as a form of movement meditation. Milagros: And what's your role as a facilitator of Authentic Movement? Stefanie: I serve as an attentive witness to my clients, observing the sensations, feelings, images, and thoughts that I experience as I watch them move. Upon first hearing their own reflections on their movement experiences, I offer my responses to them. I do this in an attempt to provide other kinds of insights alongside those that they have found for themselves, but never as a way of overriding or rewriting them. I hold this role within my individual sessions and also often in my group classes; but in the groups, I facilitate others to learn to witness one another as well. Mary Whitehouse's early students, Janet Adler and Joan Chodorow, contributed significantly to developing the role of the witness to be held not only by a teacher/facilitator but by peers within the practice as well. In my classes, we spend a lot of time considering the ways in which we see and all of the things we might project upon each other. We explore what it is we bring to and project on what we see. Stefanie: Milagros, you mentioned that you have begun to integrate some awareness practice into your sessions. How do you do this? Milagros: In general, I begin by guiding my clients to get a felt sense of their bodies. I then ask clients to check in to see what part of them wants attention. I ask questions that require them to pay close attention, to become intimate with the sensations they are having during the session. I believe that when clients participate in the session in this way, patterns can change more readily because the nervous system is consciously engaged. There is a kind of disconnect that can happen over time between muscles and nerves, and the muscles maintain a holding, contracted state, as if locked. The connection begins to get restored with attention to sensation. I learned this through some work I did in Hanna Somatics. I have found that when my clients participate in this way, the work takes on greater depth and meaning, for both of us. Stefanie: Right. Yes. Thomas Hanna is the one who coined the term \"somatic\" as we use it today. Milagros: Say more about this, Stefanie. Stefanie: When we use the word \"somatic\" here, it derives from the term \"soma,\" which essentially means a body conscious of itself in movement. A \"soma\" is a living body, fully inhabited, inclusive of its physical anatomy, psyche, and spirit. Somatic movement educators and therapists work with people to support their well-being and invite them into the process of their own self-care. We help clients foster a sense of wholeness and of interconnection; of ease, presence, and vitality; and to gently repattern their bodies through physical exploration. Authentic Movement is one of a number of different disciplines that can be characterized as somatic movement education practices, and it is a key modality with which I work. Milagros: How did you come to this practice? Stefanie: I studied theater through high school and college, majoring in it at Brandeis University and working a bit in Chicago. In my early adult years I worked as a director and stage manager. Toward the tail-end of college, though, I found had become passionately interested in movement. I took all of the classes available to me, and when I graduated I fell into the improvisational dance community in Boston. I took classes and workshops in Authentic Movement and also in Contact Improvisation (CI) \u2014 a dynamic form of dance partnering \u2014 as well as in performance improvisation, which is real-time composition of dances. \" For me, an interesting aspect of our process together, in our trading and even within this conversation, is how we seem to move fluidly between being the receiver of care and being the giver of care.\" \u2014Stefanie Cohen \"When I was about nine, my father decided to emigrate to Canada, in anticipation of political unrest under the Marcos regime. My father had some savings, but very little really, and with this courageous and loving decision, he changed the course of our lives and opened up worlds of possibilities \u2014 for my whole family.\" \u2014 Milagros Paredes Continued on page 54The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 54 Milagros: What drew you to focus on this work? Stefanie: When I danced and performed, I got very positive feedback from others. The culture felt different to me than theater in many ways \u2014 especially when I was a young woman \u2014 and through working in these modes, I felt I got to develop a voice or find signature styles of movement that suited my body. Those kinds of approaches gave me an opportunity to find and develop ways of moving that felt unique to me instead of being in a class where I was trying to pattern my movement to the teacher's. I was very self-conscious of having a body that was so unlike a more traditional image of a dancer's body. But when I was able to find my own movement \u2014 not through looking at a mirror, imitating someone else \u2014 I found that my body had a lot to say. Milagros: You have mentioned to me before that Authentic Movement also played a role in your hospice work.... Stefanie: Yes. In addition to my artistic explorations, drawing upon Authentic Movement as a place to generate movement or text for performance, I also found it very supportive to me as a hospice worker. At the time \u2014 in my early- to mid-twenties \u2014 I worked hands-on as a home health aide with terminally ill patients, working in people's homes and in a small hospice residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In my movement classes, I was able to literally move with and through some very intense parts of doing that work. For instance, in the movement sessions, I could sometimes try on or imitate the movements of people with whom I'd interacted during my workdays \u2014 this allowed me to abstract my experiences and see them aesthetically, from a greater distance. Also, importantly, I got to draw upon the model of witnessing in order to discern what the hospice clients or their loved ones really needed. I learned to try to differentiate what was mine \u2014 my own fear for their discomfort or my projections of grief \u2014 from what was actually being asked of me. In this way I could better learn to meet what was requested of me and to more truly serve. Milagros: You trained as an Authentic Movement facilitator many years ago, but you also recently completed a masters degree in somatic education. Can you say something about that? Stefanie: Yes. I studied Authentic Movement in 1998 in western Massachusetts through a program called Contemplative Dance. My masters program, which I attended in 2010, is called \"Dance and Somatic Well-being: Connections to the Living Body,\" offered through the University of Central Lancashire, in England. This particular program, in addition to its location in England, is offered in a U.S. branch through the studio Moving Body Resources in New York City. It's a comprehensive masters, with theoretical, practical, and experiential aspects. It covers similarities among different somatic modalities as they are practiced throughout the world but primarily focused in Europe and the U.S. There's quite a bit of activity, particularly in Great Britain, with regard to somatic education and somatic therapy. As a Registered Somatic Movement Educator, (through International Somatic Movement Education and Therapy Association \u2014 ISMETA), I work not only with Authentic Movement within my practice, but also incorporate experience I have with Continuum Movement, experiential anatomy, and to a lesser degree, Body-Mind Centering\u00ae (BMC). Milagros: Can you describe what a session typically looks like? Stefanie: The individual sessions I conduct are co-created and improvisatory in nature, and they can follow many different structures; they generally last about 75 minutes. We usually begin with a verbal check-in with one another, followed by inquiries into my client's felt-sense experience; moving directly to an investigation of sensation, I might ask, \"What are the qualities of movement within your body that accompany what you describe of your experience? What does your state feel like?\" How do you wish to feel? Further, what might support you to feel this way?\" I witness their movement throughout the session \u2014 sometimes from a still location at the periphery of the space or sometimes in close proximity. Moving, sounding, and breathing in unison with my clients can be surprisingly powerful for us both. Later I may offer reflective responses through my own movement gestures, and from time to time I can make specific suggestions with regard to movements, breath, or sound that they can experiment with both in and out of the studio. I may offer or respond to requests for supportive touch, and/or provide bolsters or blankets to my clients to increase their comfort during their movement investigations. Occasionally I serve as a scribe, writing down insights, images, or language that my clients voice and may wish to keep. I also make a range of art materials available with which they might further explore images that arise in the sessions. Our sessions then end with reflections on the process together.Stefanie: Milagros, what brought you to shiatsu? Milagros: I started receiving shiatsu when I was 26, for an eating disorder I had had for ten years. I was also seeing a psychiatrist who practiced hypnotherapy. Both therapists were gifted, and I continue to feel so blessed to have found them. From that time on, shiatsu became a regular part of my therapy. My shiatsu therapist was someone who encouraged me to connect with my emotions during our sessions. She was very much inclined to working with people psychologically through bodywork. My eating disorder had a lot to do with not wanting to feel my emotions \u2014 I used food to avoid feeling emotions, both positive and negative. Therefore, the bodywork I did with her provided a safe structure for entering the world of my emotions. It was profoundly therapeutic on this psychological level. And it worked very well alongside the hypnotherapy I was doing. It allowed me to come back into my body and inhabit it more fully. Stefanie: This is during that time in your late twenties? Milagros: There was an intense period of about three years, from ages 26-29. The symptoms of the eating disorder gave way to deeper psychological issues quite quickly, and during this time I stayed engaged with shiatsu and hypnotherapy. I continued to receive bodywork after that more intense time, with shiatsu always being my preference because I love the way it clears, opens, and balances me on an energetic level, and I also love the way the deep pressure feels. It simply became an essential part of my process of healing, self-care, and self-discovery. Stefanie: That sounds so powerful. When, then, did you decide to study as a practitioner, yourself? Milagros: I was 32 years old. At the time I was doing community development work in Toronto, working with immigrant and refugee women. In the end, that work wasn't fulfilling to me. Stefanie: In what way was that so? Milagros: I didn't feel that I was helping to lessen suffering in any significant way, and I really wanted to make a difference in people's lives. From the time I was very young I have been interested in helping people suffer less. After the experience of being a community development worker and the experience of healing through shiatsu and psychotherapy, I reached a feeling of clarity about wanting to support people in the way I had been supported, from the inside out. I had learned so much by discovering myself through psychotherapy and shiatsu. I knew I had an affinity for bodywork, and since shiatsu had been so helpful to me, and since I believed in the effectiveness of Chinese medicine, I wanted to do bodywork within that modality. I s tudied at the Shiatsu School of Canada, in '93-94. It was a 2,200 hour program that included both Western and Eastern modalities of health and healing. Stefanie: Much has happened, I know, with regard to your work since that time. I know lots of life has happened, including your having had a child. How do you think your work as a shiatsu practitioner affects your son? Milagros: That's a good question, and I think the answer reveals a two-way street. Joseph came into the world with a set of needs, and the way I met him in these needs has a great deal to do with my deep interest in holistic natural healing. From birth, my son suffered from severe constipation and abdominal pain. And from the beginning, I believed that children have the potential to be healthy and radiant. My son was not, but I was convinced that I just had to find the key to make that so. I was single-minded about that. From the very beginning of his infancy, I used my skills as a shiatsu practitioner to relieve pain, gas, and to facilitate bowel movements. Compression on specific acupressure points and energy work were significant tools I had, literally at my fingertips, for soothing him through many painful times. Homeopathy was also very helpful for treating symptoms. I sought help from a wide variety of natural health practitioners, most of whom were not able to help in any significant way. After eight years, I eventually found the solution with critical help from Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride. She was the one who was finally able to put all the pieces together and offer a systematic way through the healing process. The path was tolerable, though not easy; it was natural and, above all, effective. Essentially this path consisted of eating according to the GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) diet, beginning with a very simple, easily digestible \"introductory\" diet for a week and, in the case of my son, an extremely gradual expansion to include foods and ways of preparing /cooking food that were more challenging for the digestive system. Stefanie: Is that when you started to research nutrition more? Milagros: Yes. While I had studied nutrition on my own for years before the birth of my son, and had struggled with weaker digestion myself, most of what I now know about gut healing and its relationship to the rest of the body comes from my work of healing Joseph. Working with and observing him 24 hours a day, and noticing how he responded to certain therapies Exploring Whole-Body Healing Continued from page 53 \"When I receive bodywork and nutritional support from you, I have a strong sense that I am actively engaged in a process of self-care rather than going to a practitioner to 'be done to' \u2014 healed or repaired. I bring my knowledge and experiences within my body and pair it with the insights you bring; I feel a genuine sense of respect from you for the intricacies of my self-knowledge.\" \u2014 St efanie Cohen (to Milagros Paredes)\"I serve as an attentive witness to my clients, observing the sensations, feelings, images, and thoughts that I experience as I watch them move.\" \u2014 Stefanie Cohen \"Somatic work holds the body as central, and movement seems to be a powerful way of enacting change within our lives. It's a way to begin practicing a new way of being.\" \u2014Milagros ParedesThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 55 and foods, showed me a lot. Today he is a thirteen-year-old, and he shows a lot more resistance to my medicine ways. He still welcomes foot massages, though! Stefanie: As your client, I have to say that I have truly reaped benefits of the research that you have done. Your sensitive support around healing digestive issues has been so helpful to me \u2014 particularly in times of intense vulnerability and transition. You have mentioned some of what exploring movement is bringing to your work with clients, principally having them take a more active role. Since my graduate studies in somatic movement education, my practice has expanded from facilitating Authentic Movement to including other elements of somatic work. For example, I now include more verbal interactions during the body of a session and also more touch. I worked with a client today, and I noticed myself bringing touch to his body in similar ways as you do with me with shiatsu \u2014 at least in terms of my posture and body mechanics. At the heart of the work with this client, I still frequently asked questions about his awareness of what he experienced and what he felt he needed at any given moment, but the touch proved integral to the session. Milagros: It's interesting to hear how we influence each other's work. Can you describe your work with another client and some of the ways your practice has expanded? Stefanie: A client of mine \u2014 a psychotherapist who had been particularly interested in integrating more embodied approaches within his own work \u2014 came to a session with me a few years ago experiencing a high degree of limitation and discomfort in his shoulder. He had been having difficulty sleeping and had jolts of pain upon even slight movement. He felt quite vulnerable, unsure as to what would cause his pain at any given time, and was concerned about the extent to which he would be able to move, cook, garden, or do any of his other meaningful activities. Though our work together up until this point had been a more open-ended inquiry, serving as creative and emotional support to him in his work and family life, we chose to spend time on this day attending his injury and the accompanying trauma he seemed to experience. As a way of initially taking some emotional pressure off, easing into the process during this particular session, we determined to focus primarily on his noninjured side. We looked for the support and insights it might offer in helping to care for his other, more fragile one. As the time unfolded \u2014 through movement and breathing together, my questions as to his felt-sense experiences, and some subtle, supportive touch \u2014 he reported feeling more freedom of movement, less tension, and what he termed an unexpected sense of \"newness.\" Through moving and speaking, he expressed his desire to invest that possibility of newness into his everyday activities. He also observed that, through focusing on the greater range of movement throughout other parts of his body, he had began to feel more of a calm indifference toward his injured side; this made it possible to greet his sensations with more curiosity and less fear. When he returned the following week, he noted that whenever he brought a sense of curiosity to his pain, it would diminish more quickly. He could more calmly and clearly begin to articulate the details of his discomfort (shooting pain versus throbbing; directions in which the sensations moved, etc.) and also connections between his activities and his pain. Milagros: Are there instances where you refer your clients for other complementary therapies? Stefanie: In this case, we actually did end up doing so. Together, he and I brainstormed about the other kinds of local therapists, such as Trager or Feldenkrais practitioners, who could further help to support his healing. I was then able to make some referrals. My sense was \u2014 and you talk about this with regard to your own clients, Milagros \u2014 he was then better supported to participate actively in his own healing. His ability to articulate his experience and needs and to identify and \"peel back\" some of the layers of emotional and physiological tension he'd held made it possible for him to offer himself \u2014 and then to receive \u2014 more integrated and nuanced care. Although some of the other somatic modalities take more of a systematic anatomical approach, aiding people structurally and correctively, Authentic Movement and the kind of work that I do with clients may be considered more cognitive in nature. By this I mean that, by and large, rather than engaging in more structural explorations, people often focus on personal narrative, identity, feeling states, and behaviors. While I believe that healing does not necessarily equate to \"fixing\" or \"curing,\" and that we have much that we can learn from injury and limitation \u2014 I have had these experiences many times throughout my life as a dancer\u2014 I'm aware that the support of a knowledgeable, thorough practitioner is invaluable. As a long-time CI dancer and movement teacher, and as a receiver of bodywork myself, I certainly have a lot of information about respectful and supportive touch, but the work I do is not from one particular modality or system. Though I have skills and anatomical knowledge, the touch that I offer may not directly serve a corrective function. I'm so glad to live in an area where there are so many gifted practitioners with whom to consult and cross-refer. Stefanie: Milagros, can you tell me about clients with whom you've worked, for whom shiatsu really made a difference beyond what traditional allopathic medicine was accomplishing? Milagros: I have a client who's been seeing me on and off for about ten years. He worked as a lawyer and also did some farming, growing hay on his land. He started seeing me in his fifties and, like your client, came in with a shoulder injury \u2014 to the shoulder cuff muscles, which reduced his range of motion in that joint by at least half. He was on the verge of getting surgery but decided to try one last thing before doing so. After several shiatsu sessions, his range of motion improved by at least 90 percent. I had also made recommendations of foods to eat and to cut back on. Unlike most people, he was very open to making changes to his diet, and this led to an ongoing process of exploring different foods and their effects on his body. As a result of diet changes, blood tests showed a reduction in his cholesterol and blood pressure, and he lost weight. His flexibility and mobility are better now than they were ten years ago. Besides improvement in his health, he also became a food activist. He continues to see me \u2014 about every four weeks. He's had a hip issue that is quite stubborn and, little by little, we are learning about it and how to work with it. Alongside shiatsu, he has been seeing a physiotherapist over the last several months, and he has been attending a Pilates class for years now. All of these modalities inform his growing awareness of his body and his knowledge of what exacerbates or relieves the pain. Stefanie: What kind of support do your clients generally want? Milagros: While most people come to me presenting physical complaints, I have several clients who come to me wanting emotional support as well. Most of these clients already know that the physical and psychological are inextricable. They come to me knowing that bodywork will help them face life from a more grounded and clear place, that it can help them shift out of \"One of my teachers once said, 'The reason we improvise is because we yearn to move on uneven ground.' ...As humans, we use a great deal of energy trying to fix life so that it's familiar and predictable; we want ground under our feet. But the reality is that everything is always changing, and life is simply uncertain.\" \u2014 Stefanie Cohen \"People who come for a more integrated psychological and physical kind of support come more regularly and consistently. For these clients, bodywork tends to be included in their lifestyle as part of what they do to stay well, supporting them through the challenges and burdens that life brings.\" \u2014Milagros Paredes Continued on page 56The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 56 stuck places and create more spaciousness in their thinking and feeling, and that it can strengthen and empower them. There can often be more conversation in their sessions but, even when conversation is minimal, these clients show an openness to expressing emotions as they surface during the session. It's amazing to feel the energy suddenly flowing freely again in response to emotional energy being expressed. Recently I trained in Focusing Technique because I have always had a keen interest in emotional healing through bodywork. Focusing technique is founded on the belief that the body knows and that we can access the body's knowledge for emotional healing by listening to the body's language of sensations. At first these sensations don't have much meaning or are little understood, but with the warmth of attention, listening, and a gentle curiosity, these largely unconscious sensations blossom into awareness. I love being able to support clients in a fuller way as they face emotional pain. A client might be expressing great frustration about a particular issue that feels like a dead end to them because they haven't found a way to resolve it. I can take this as an opportunity to ask them to tune into and get a felt sense of the physical sensations that arise as they speak about the issue, and we go from there. As the client pays attention to the sensation, engaging it by being with it or by articulating in words what it's like, the sensation changes and reveals itself. Very often, the essence of the frustration is revealed and the client finds a way through. Stefanie: Do people tend to come to you over years for regular sessions, for a few months at a time, or more sporadically, as needed? Milagros: Most clients come when pain hinders their ability to move in ways that are important for them. Naturally, they want the pain to go away and their range of motion restored. When they feel better, they tend to stop coming and use their resources for other things that are important to them. People who come for a more integrated psychological and physical kind of support come more regularly and consistently. For these clients, bodywork tends to be included in their lifestyle as part of what they do to stay well, supporting them through the challenges and burdens that life brings. Stefanie: What are some limitations of shiatsu, as you've observed? When might a client need a different approach to complement what you're doing? Milagros: Shiatsu, based on Chinese medicine, uses a framework and language that is unfamiliar to the majority of people who see me. I find this limiting sometimes because some people want me to be able to explain what I sense is happening in anatomical terms. My training included the standard anatomy and pathology content as contained in a registered massage therapy program, and although I was successful in the study of these subjects, the actual practice of shiatsu does not use the same language and ideas with regard to body and health. We talk about \"kyo\" (\"empty\" in Japanese) and \"jitsu\" (\"excess\"), and these terms refer to the energetic state of meridians and areas of the body. It's actually very simple! When energy is deficient or in excess in a particular area or along a meridian, people usually experience some kind of discomfort. By moving the energy and supporting flow , pain dissipates and healing occurs. Flow in energy is the basic, original, and well state of the body. The body has its own logic \u2014 it always tends towards healing \u2014 and in shiatsu, my work is to support this logic by encouraging a flow with my touch and my openness. I have several clients who do other complementary therapies alongside shiatsu. One client has low back and hip pain, and she sees a chiropractor and does yoga regularly in addition to seeing me at about four-week intervals. Many of my clients use chiropractic therapy, either alongside shiatsu or alternating for periods of time, using one and then the other. I have often recommended clients for osteopathy as well. The other complementary modality that my clients frequently use is physiotherapy. Both chiropractic and physiotherapy tend to be covered by insurance, which makes them accessible forms of therapy. Milagros: Stefanie, I have done a lot of work with you and have benefited in a profound way, mostly emotionally. Are there clients for whom somatic work has really moved them beyond what they've be able to work on in more talk-only therapy? Stefanie: What comes to mind right now, specifically, are the ways in which several of my students and clients have attended to grief through the Authentic Movement work. There have been several instances in which people have done so both independently of and in conjunction with their talk therapy. For some, their grief has had to do with the deaths of loved ones; for others, it's been for jobs losses, relocations, or dramatic shifts they've experienced in their sense of identity as they have aged or become parents. Some clients come to the movement work from talk therapy sessions in which they have felt validated, seen, and acknowledged for the strength they've demonstrated within challenging life circumstances, but are unsure of how to proceed beyond there. Within the movement work, then, they come equipped to experiment, to play, to listen to other possibilities beyond the meanings they have made of their experiences, and to practice \u2014 quite literally, taking other kinds of stances. They then sometimes return to talk therapy with new insights from their embodied investigations. One particular experience I had with regard to support through grief had to do with a couple who, after attending classes with me for two years, suddenly and tragically lost a child. During the early weeks following the full-term stillbirth of their son, their respective families came to visit them and to lend them support. But of course the loss of this child \u2014 who was to have been the first grandchild and nephew on both sides \u2014 was felt acutely by all family members. As our movement work had been a key practice for this couple up until this point, they asked me to facilitate group sessions to which they invited their families. We conducted two sessions \u2014 one with the woman's parents, siblings, and sister-in-law, and another, a couple of weeks later, with her husband's father. In my studio, on each of these mornings, the families received an introduction to the context of the Authentic Movement work and spent time individually sorting through a stack of postcard images that I often offer as part of the process. These postcards \u2014 evocative, sometimes iconographic photos and illustrations that include bodies in motion, landscapes, plant and animal life, and humans of a wide range of ages, races, and cultures \u2014 can serve as a means for identifying inner feeling and experience with imagery. I also use them to support my teaching of witnessing, in that each of us sees each image very differently from one another on any given day. By drawing upon this particular tool, as well as opening up the time for movement sessions in which I served as witness to all of them, each family member had an opportunity to connect in unexpected ways with the feelings accompanying their loss. They could then share these with one another through both vivid and sometimes indirect means. I particularly remember having had the sense that they were each seen \u2014 both by me and by one another \u2014 for their own experiences, and free of a need to protect one another as they may have if they had simply been invited to sit and talk. I also recall witnessing the deep care and respect the family members seemed to express toward this couple for drawing on these creative resources as they sat with the rawness of their grief. Milagros: I am moved to hear how effectively your work supports people through their lives and how you offered this exquisite container for that family to safely stay with their vulnerability of loss; to express their sorrow and pain freely, directly, and simply. Milagros: Stefanie, would also you speak about some of the limitations that you come up against in this work? Stefanie: The majority of the people with whom I work are highly engaged, high-functioning individuals. However, in terms of work with issues people might label as psychological disorders, such as complex responses to trauma, schizophrenia, and dissociative conditions, these \u2014 perhaps ironically \u2014 are conditions that can both be helped by the somatic work I do and are beyond its scope. When people are prone to disconnect from their experiences of their bodies, as someone might in response to rape or other violence, movement work that brings them gently back into relationship with their sensory selves can be of tremendous help. According to Colorado-based mental health professional Peter Levine, PhD, who has done quite a bit of research in this area, movement and physical action can help us to disrupt cycles and patterns of trauma that have us paralyzed in shock. When someone is in a state of profound dissociation or perhaps prone to frightening hallucinatory experiences, however, it may be more difficult to gauge the extent to which this work may be reliably and safely done. Certainly, in these contexts I would need to work in very direct and consistent collaboration with other therapists and caregivers, and I have done so a bit in the past. Milagros: Somatic work holds the body as central, and movement seems to be a powerful way of enacting change within our lives. It's a way to begin practicing a new way of being. Stefanie: Yes. My sense is that when we move through something physically, we have already shifted. Our bodies have changed, and new possibilities, new behaviors, even new neural pathways have been created. Authentic Movement practice is based on the theory that all of Exploring Whole-Body Healing Continued from page 55 \"From the time I was very young I have been interested in helping people suffer less. After the experience of being a community development worker and the experience of healing through shiatsu and psychotherapy, I reached a feeling of clarity about wanting to support people in the way I had been supported, from the inside out. I had learned so much by discovering myself through psychotherapy and shiatsu.\" \u2014 Milagros Paredes \"I would say something that the somatic modalities share is a deep belief in the self-authority of the people with whom they are working. The work that I do as a somatic movement educator is entirely co-created; I'm here to help people recover their own, sensual, self-authority.\" \u2014 Stefanie Cohen \"I've also frequently noticed how, after I do an Authentic Movement session with you, my awareness is heightened significantly, and I am able to meet my clients more fully.\" \u2014Milagros Paredes (to Stefanie Cohen)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 57 what we have experienced in our lives is stored in our bodies \u2014 all of it is mapped there. If we introduce a way of being that we would like to enforce and reinforce, that's there too. The more we can cultivate that awareness, try that on, the more resourced we can be. Again, this work is based philosophically on the sense that we are our bodies, no matter how much we operate from awareness of that or not. And all of our consciousness \u2014 our mind, our corporeality, our spirit \u2014 is all integrated. There are many different ways to connect with and support this. Sometimes people come to the work because they have a particular injury or illness that they've identified and, as with your clients, they might come because they want to develop more strength or range of motion. But more often than not, people want support in making decisions and consciously integrating significant life transitions such as pregnancies and new parenthood, endings or beginnings of relationships, leaving school, retirement, and losses of various kinds. They want inroads to connect with themselves as physical and creative beings. Milagros: Can you say something about ways of supporting people through transitions? Stefanie: Most importantly, through helping them cultivate interest in what is happening. Interest can help us to tolerate experiences that we might not think that we can; it can help to reduce the tension that we're holding and see what else might contribute to the fear or discomfort that we experience. Milagros: That reminds me of Pema Chodron's teachings. She addresses the habit human beings have of creating stories about the strong emotions we are having. She shines light on how our meaning-making usually reinforces an old and negative story, causing us more suffering. The practice is to be curious about the sensations that are present, and she talks about seeing it, tasting it, smelling it. When we stay with the sensation of the experience, the discomfort, and we are curious about it, this takes us to an open place, a place of possibility. Stefanie: Equally, I find it important to identify our experiences of pleasure and to draw upon them as resource. When we move, we can inquire into the experiences our bodies enjoy \u2014 stretching, pushing, rocking, self-massage; a balance of effort and ease. We need to draw on quite a number of resources that we have for self-care. This allows us to have stability, to have our nervous systems be in balance. We require quite a bit more rest and integration than any of us gives ourselves, for sure. When we don't give that to ourselves, we don't function well, draining our adrenals, among other effects. Milagros: I have a very clear sense of how empowering it is to be able to comfort and soothe myself. I've also frequently noticed how, after I do an Authentic Movement session with you, my awareness is heightened significantly, and I am able to meet my clients more fully. This is an example of how my inner resources become more available to me. Stefanie: For me, that calls up how important it is to be able to adapt to situations as they arise, to have a kind of fluidity in how we interact. One of my teachers once said, \"The reason we improvise is because we yearn to move on uneven ground.\" Milagros: I am not sure that most humans are aware of that yearning for uneven ground, but I believe it. There's this life force \u2014 what some refer to as Eros \u2014 that moves within us, that longs for that. As humans, we use a great deal of energy trying to fix life so that it's familiar and predictable; we want ground under our feet. But the reality is that everything is always changing, and life is simply uncertain. We need to be adaptable as a species. We could instead use our energy to notice our yearning to be in the unknown, to stretch, evolve, and explore new territory \u2014 and we could use it to become more integrated and whole. Milagros: I'd love to talk about the somatic session we recently had together. I said that I wanted to explore a specific issue rather than having a more open-ended exploration, which is what I usually do. Can you describe your approach in this case? Stefanie: I asked you what it was that you were feeling and how you wanted to feel. We figured out how to bring that into the present. Some of what you described you spoke of in particularly physical ways \u2014 you described specific sensations you were feeling through your legs, thighs, belly, and arms. You also used language such as flighty, not feeling grounded, and running away . I listened for these physical metaphors, and when I didn't hear them I asked for them. A key came for me when you started talking about feeling \"wobbly.\" I had the sense that sitting wasn't the way to continue to explore that. As I recall, I asked, \"Do you feel wobbly sitting? Would you feel wobbly lying down?\" You took my suggestion to try standing. Milagros: Your facilitation today led me to identify an image \u2014 of a very tall tree. Rather than simply imitating, I found myself embodying it. This was very different for me, and it allowed me to move toward a more empowered stance in this issue. Stefanie: You also had spoken about relationships to space and objects and others \u2014 you said, \"I'm feeling clumsy. I'm bumping into things\" and \"I don't do that when I'm doing Contact Improvisation.\" I felt curious about how you might take this really rooted image into your dancing, interacting with space and objects \u2014 so you could continue to be both stable and malleable. I was also curious about how you could allow your relationship to an image to have a fluidity about it. Milagros: Yes, I did take my embodiment of the image into the next Contact Improv jam and found that I was effortlessly able to do things I was previously unable to do, like handstands. Stefanie: I think it can be really powerful to take an image like that \u2014 a strong, green, vibrant, rooted tree \u2014 and draw upon it when we want to feel stable or hold a different perspective. There are ways in which we can hold too tightly to ideas, however. I'm sure you can relate to that as a meditator, Milagros \u2014 the need to cultivate a willingness to step into what is happening in this moment; not defining the experience one fixed way but allowing those images to remain in our consciousness as long as they do before transforming or falling away. Milagros: In this work it seems important to create some space around the stories that people use to make meaning of themselves and their lives. Stefanie: One of the questions I want to hold is \"What's my role when I'm working with people?\" It's not my job to impose my desires and my opinions on my clients. So when I try to help someone reconsider a narrative, I want to do this really gently and humbly. In general, I would say something that the somatic modalities share is a deep belief in the self-authority of the people with whom they are working. The work that I do as a somatic movement educator is entirely co-created; I'm here to help people recover their own, sensual, self-authority. This is a phenomenological approach, to say that our subjectivity holds tremendous value \u2014 to say, \"This is your experience; you know your body; you live in your body; all of your experience and knowledge comes directly from your movement in the world. \" Milagros: This self-authority assumption is different from what you see in other therapies, where people are experiencing sensations in their bodies and look to an expert \u2014 the therapist or practitioner \u2014 to tell them what is happening. To a significant extent, there is an abdication of their knowledge in favor of what the expert tells them. I try to ask my clients how they are feeling and what changes they are noticing. It makes sense that I have a perspective that my role, training, and skills allow for, and I can share that \u2014 but I want their own perspective to hold equal weight as well. People are conditioned to believing that they don't know \u2014 that somebody else knows them better than they do. A process for reclaiming that self-authority is important. Stefanie: Yes. When I receive bodywork and nutritional support from you, I have a strong sense that I am actively engaged in a process of self-care rather than going to a practitioner to \"be done to\" \u2014 healed or repaired. I bring my knowledge and experiences within my body and pair it with the insights you bring; I feel a genuine sense of respect from you for the intricacies of my self-knowledge. Milagros: As we talk about self-authority and phenomenology, here, I wonder if you make any connections between the political and social activism of your family and your work as a somatic educator? Stefanie: I think that I really struggled during my teen and college years and even early adulthood with feeling as though I could make a meaningful difference. Certainly, given my background, I felt an imperative to try. But my experience coming of age in the late 1980s rather than the more radical 1960s as my parents had, felt a bit less empowered to me. I felt overwhelmed and ineffectual and a bit cynical, I think. I have found as I've grown older, however, that the work that I do now does feel meaningfully political, and that it is something that I can contribute. It's just in quieter, more intimate ways. I have the sense, though, that the ripples that extend from spending time to truly hear and see people \u2014 from facilitating others to see one another and to hold their own experiences as meaningful \u2014 are farther reaching than we can know. The degree to which we can cultivate a sense of compassion and respect for ourselves and bring this to our interactions with others has an immediate and lasting effect on the kind of environmental and interpersonal choices we make and the kinds of opportunities we make available to one another. The majority of the w ork I do is with adult students and clients. But I do some work as a teaching artist through Living Arts, an arts-infused education program for children in Detroit, as well. When I work with the kids, I make sure to close each class by asking them each what Continued on page 58\"...We can access the body's knowledge for emotional healing by listening to the body's language of sensations. At first these sensations don't have much meaning or are little understood, but with the warmth of attention, listening, and a gentle curiosity, these largely unconscious for healingand wholeness.

I want them to know that their bodies contain the knowledge they need to navigate the world and that how and what they feel is worth listening to. There's so much unlearning of habits many of us must do as adults \u2014 or relearning of ways of listening to ourselves \u2014 it feels important to me to provide a voice asking these small children to pay attention and respect themselves in these ways. Milagros: I have my own experience of what you are talking about. I went to private, Catholic convent schools from kindergarten through third grade, and these schools had a huge impact on me, shutting me up and shutting me down. It was education by rote \u2014 students hardly spoke or moved. It took until my forties to find my voice and open up to the creative force in me. It's clear to me that my early schooling shut me down at a time when I should have been encouraged to play and create. That's why I went to great lengths to make sure my son went to a school that supported his creativity and why I myself have always supported him in this way. And the movement work I am doing now has been monumental in this regard; I feel like I am finding my soul again. Milagros: You introduced me to Contact Improv. You have spoken about how CI and Authentic Movement complement one another. For you, I imagine that the various somatic practices you engage in can merge and become integrated. I would like to know how these somatic practices, as a whole, serve you in your life as mother, teacher, artist, lover.... Stefanie: Certainly artistically, improvisational practices have been very much at the heart of the ways in which I have made my work, however that has manifested itself \u2014 whether as writing, drawing, dance, or performance. Embodiment is at the heart of each inquiry. Using sensation as a jumping-off point, dropping myself into the center of experience, also helps me to circumvent a self-critic \u2014 to generate material that I can go back to, to shape with more intention. Interpersonally, I receive support in training myself as a witness, to come face to face with my projections and then to be able to stand back and really listen \u2014 to take a sense of ownership of what I am bringing to a situation. As a parent, I need to remind myself of this time and time again! Something I talk about a lot when I run workshops for other health practitioners, as with students at the Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts, for example, is how to listen for what our clients are really asking of us, instead of what we think they need or want. Milagros: Stefanie, how did you end up here in Ann Arbor? Stefanie: I moved to Ann Arbor from Boston in the summer of 2000 when my former husband, George, began teaching in the Romance Language Department at the University of Michigan. He had been a professor at Boston University and I had been dancing, performing, and teaching movement in Cambridge and Boston. We came here with our then six-month old son, Shane, our three cats and knowing really very few people here in town. It was more difficult than I had expected to leave the East Coast at that time, where all of my family and community resided \u2014 especially as a new mother. Milagros: I know that throughout the period of your raising your children you have continued to make art and cultivate yourself as an artist. This has been an essential aspect of your work and life. From what I know of you, it seems as though you have been able to create a satisfying life for yourself here. Stefanie: Yes. Definitely. New opportunities also came with the challenges associated with moving, and I feel grateful for the support I have received. Over the last dozen years since coming here, I have met many kind and interesting people \u2014 fellow parents, friends, colleagues, students, and clients who have made Ann Arbor a warm and engaging place to live. During this time, I also traveled across the country to teach and perform; helped to found both a local and a regional community of Contact Improvisation dancers; gave birth to my daughter, Billie, in 2003; took on my studio, SOMA (Studio Of Movement Arts), above the People's Food Co-op; commuted to graduate school in New York City; separated from my ex-husband, with whom I still actively co-parent; and began a new artistic collaboration and life partnership with Corey Gearhart. Milagros: You and Corey have been making performance work together for the last three years. Your company has an interesting name... Stefanie: Yes. The work we make is interdisciplinary and devised performance \u2014 meaning collaboratively conceived and created \u2014 and includes movement, sound, text, and often video or sculptural installations. We perform this work in site-specific installation events in academic institutions and performance festivals and in alternative performance venues. Our collaborative identity is Upended Teacups \u2014 the name both refers to the object-based nature of the work we make as well as to the fact that we manage to spill things a lot! Stefanie: How did you end up here in Ann Arbor, Milagros? In the late '90s, while living in Toronto, I was a member at the Toronto Zen Buddhist Temple. My son's father was a member of the Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple, which is sister to the Toronto temple, and he and I would attend many of the same intensive silent retreats. I ended up moving here to get married, and we had a son together. Although I had thought I was finally going to settle in one place after moving so often throughout my life, the decision to leave Canada came quite easily. Moving to Chelsea from Toronto was a radical change but, fortunately, my history of moving has made me adaptable in this way. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 58 Exploring Whole-Body Healing Continued from page 57Stefanie: Were you already a shiatsu practitioner when you came here? Milagros: I moved here shortly after I graduated from my training program. Stefanie: Can you say something about what keeps you here in Ann Arbor? Milagros: That's a good question. After my divorce, this question surfaced a lot for a period of time, which is not something I had anticipated. I have always been grateful that my move to the U.S. landed me in a place that I enjoy and feel safe in. Here I have met many extraordinary people who share my desire for conscious community and who work passionately and sincerely in their various fields of healing, art, farming, and wilderness living. When I left Toronto, I was ready to leave the big city life and explore what it might be like to live in a quieter place with easy access to rural areas and wilderness. My connection with nature and to the source of my food \u2014 to farms and farmers \u2014 were birthed here. These are at the very heart of my life now, nourishing and enriching me deeply in every way. Ann Arbor and Chelsea, where my actual home is, are small enough that I can sense the contribution I make, and this matters to me. I sometimes get homesick for the diversity I grew accustomed to in Toronto and Singapore, yet I balance that with the belonging and intimacy I experience in the various communities I am a part of. The difficulties for me are the absence of any family and the loss of security afforded me by socialized health care, especially as a self-employed single mother. What the future holds \u2014 one never knows! I have decided to remain open about where home is or will be, at least in a geographical sense. Milagros: Stefanie, do you find Ann Arbor to be a good place for you as a movement educator and artist? Stefanie: It does feel as though this is a place rich in resources for complementary and alternative therapies; many of the people I come across also seem to have an openness and interest in including practices of mindfulness in their daily lives. I have been so privileged to have been able to work steadily with one group of students for the past five years and within my own Authentic Movement peer group for more than a dozen. I didn't necessarily make this connection before, but, interestingly, Ann Arbor has been a supportive place to expand artistically while also raising my kids. Both Corey and I had also lived in Chicago and other larger cities before moving here. He had done both his BFA and MFA in studio art and fine art-based performance art at the School of the Art Institute, and I'd made theater, dance, and performance work in Boston. In either of those metropolitan places our paths may not have crossed, or we simply may not have had the occasion to collaborate as intensively with someone outside our discipline. It may also have been much more difficult to have had access to the kind of studio space I have, which allows us the time and room to experiment. Shane, like Joseph, is thirteen now, and Billie has just turned nine. I think that, ultimately, when they have grown and the most intensive time of co-parenting has passed, I will feel drawn to living in a more urban area again \u2014 I'm really a city girl at heart. I can imagine that the performance work that Corey and I make together may have a little more play in a bigger city and that having a larger pool of students and clients may potentially make it easier to continue to grow both my somatic and art-making practices. However, this feels like a good home base for now. Also, given our current economic climate \u2014 Michigan generally is in such an interesting (if desperate) place of reinvention, at the moment \u2014 I'm excited to see how I can participate as it develops in the next several years. Stefanie: Milagros, what further developments do you imagine exploring in your practice? Milagros: In March 2012, I graduated from the apprenticeship program of Integral Coaching Canada. One of my greatest passions is witnessing people succeed in what they love most. This method is a spectacular tool \u2014 so comprehensive and powerful for helping individuals manifest richer and fuller expressions of their potential. Facilitating this process makes me very happy. Practicing Integral Coaching\u00ae also balances me out as a human being so that I am using and developing not only my somatic/kinesthetic and intuitive skills but also my cognitive, analytical, and intellectual skills. I have the job now of reframing my practice to include Integral Coaching\u00ae. I will be creating an integrated wellness practice. I'm excited about this. Stefanie: Thank you so much, Milagros, for starting this conversation and for helping to extend our exploration into this realm. It has felt so fruitful to me to get to articulate our practices in this way and to do so in such a collaborative manner. Milagros: You are welcome, Stefanie. My gratitude also goes to you. In these last years I have realized my self more fully through our deep, intimate explorations of consciousness through the body; and in this conversation, we have used the fertile ground of our process to share our work and thinking with the broader community. I hope this work ripples outward to inspire and bless others. Stefanie Cohen, MA, ISMETA, Registered Somatic Movement Educator, can be reached at 734-474-1517 or stefaniemovingstories@gmail.com.

Richard Andres bought the 40-acre farm in 1993 and, that same year, had his produce certified organic. In 1994, he met Deb Lentz, who joined him on the farm the following year. They married in 1997. Today they have an 11-year-old daughter, Ariana, and 80 acres of produce. They raise a few pigs, cows, and chickens, and harbor anywhere between 4 and 15 interns, depending on the season. The main house, home to the Andres-Lentz family, is across the road from the cottage housing some of the interns. The rest of the interns are lodged in the dormitory that Richard built in the barn down the field. He doubled the size of the barn, creating a second-floor dormitory over the storage room where crates of potatoes are piled high. Everyone gathers for communal meals in the main house, where interns prepare most of the meals. Interns are free to come and go on their own time. If they have no place to go for, say, Thanksgiving, they know they have a place at Deb and Richard's table. Tantr\u00e9 Farm is a model of sustainability and enjoys a reputation for being one big family. The farm community is composed of interns, several apprentices, and a few employees. The farm embraces the Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model, in which subscribers pay at the onset of the growing season for a share of the anticipated harvest and receive weekly shares. The 375 Tantr\u00e9 Farm CSA members make up the extended farm community. If it takes a village to raise a child, Ariana is one lucky girl. The farm is always humming with people and activity, and, between interns, children of CSA families, and school friends, Ariana never lacks for playmates \u2014 or help with homework. Elaine Economou, a CSA member for over 12 years, met Deb and Richard in 2000, while organizing the Chelsea Farmers' Market. Their families have become close. She explained: My kids have grown up crawling on the lawn, picking berries, planting seeds in the children's garden, feeding chickens, and swinging on the rope swing. They know our food \u2014 for as much of the year as possible \u2014 comes from Tantr\u00e9 Farm, and even if they don't love spinach, they witness me get excited every winter when the first sweet crop comes in. Deb and Richard...have created a sense of community, environmental education, and a joyful reverence for the earth. Their kindness, generosity, and commitment are evident in all that they do. The village quality is also evident in the eclectic assortment of play equipment behind the main house. A homespun hut, made of branches and kindling, stands beside the worn, plastic swing set and play house. The stick hut is courtesy of a farmworker (and friend) who wanted play equipment made of something other than plastic. En route back to the house, he points out rhubarb, spinach, potatoes, kohlrabi, and strawberries. The rows seem endless. The sense of peace is palpable. Richard mentions the serene walks that he and others take here. This atmosphere draws the CSA members who pick up their weekly produce at the farm.

On my first visit to the farm, Richard gave me a tour. He points out the several fruit trees around the house, and then we follow fields of lettuce, cabbage, onions, garlic, squash, beans, beets, peppers, kale, broccoli, and more. Many of the vegetables, fruits, and herbs are represented by multiple species, with over 160 varieties overall. Our walk takes us to a large, shady grove of trees, where I find rows and rows of logs piled in \"lean-to stack\" configurations. They resemble tally marks \u2014 five line groups drawn to help count. These log stacks stretch out over five acres, for a total of over 10,000 logs. The logs are drilled with holes and filled, each year, with cultured sawdust. The culture is mycelium, or mushroom spawn. The mushrooms start fruiting when weather conditions are cool, in spring and fall. Each log can grow mushrooms from three to ten years, depending on log diameter, hardness of the wood, contamination, and growing environment. Richard said he learned all this on the job. \"We worked with a professor [Dan Greene] who did mushrooms, which is how the mushroom project began.\" En route back to the house, he points out rhubarb, spinach, potatoes, kohlrabi, and strawberries. The rows seem endless. The sense of peace is palpable. Richard mentions the serene walks that he and others take here. This atmosphere draws the CSA members who pick up their weekly produce at the farm. Many bring their children. Other members collect their shares at other distribution sites, including the Ann Arbor and Chelsea Farmers' Markets, where the farm sells additional Today, Richard Andres and Deb Lentz have an 11-year- old daughter, Ariana, and 80 acres of produce. They raise a few pigs, cows, and chickens, and harbor anywhere between 4 and 15 interns, depending on the season.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 62 produce. Tantr\u00e9 also sells to area restaurants: Grange, Zingerman's Deli, Zingerman's Roadhouse, Pacific Rim, Jolly Pumpkin, Ravens Club, Silvio's Pizzeria, Inn Season Cafe, Darcy's Cart, and People's Food Co-op kitchen. Local food artisans, such as Harvest Kitchen, Locavorious, and The Brinery, use Tantr\u00e9 produce. Tantr\u00e9 has also reached large, institutional markets. An article in The Nation (October, 2012) began with a description of farmer Richard Andres arriving at a St. Joseph Hospital loading dock with 200 pounds of his local, organic green beans. He and Deb have expanded their network of community connections to include schools and stores. Richard and Deb are engaging in different ways. He is quiet, with a Zen-like temperament. His initial shyness and self-effacing proclivities mask an encyclopedic knowledge of organic farming \u2014 and much else. He can hold forth about different kinds of soil (his is an \"esker farm,\" on a glacial river bed), pest-ridding insects (he points to corners of the shed, harboring nests of Golden Paper Wasps, or European Golden Antenna Wasps, which eat cabbage loopers), crop rotation, weather requirements of various plants, hoop houses, and more. (Hoop houses are greenhouses made of large plastic sheets over a frame of hoops. These large but simple structures extend the growing season, protect plants from predators and adverse weather, and offer storage space in cold weather.) Richard is a self-taught autodidact, a farmer-philosopher. \"He reads a lot,\" said Deb, who is quick to sing her husband's praises, as he is hers. She mentions that he attends conferences, participates in panel discussions, and has networked with neighboring farmers since buying the land. Over the years, he has been invited to speak about local food, farming issues, and the CSA model. Some of the interns call him \"Uncle Richard,\" which he uses as a byline for his poems in the farm's Digest, a monthly publication created by Lizzie, one of last season's interns. It's a mini-magazine with poems, stories, and drawings, and known informally as the \"zine.\" Deb grew up on a 160-acre cattle farm in Minnesota bluff country, the middle of five children in a Catholic family. Her father was known for his rotational grazing practices, and he taught Agriculture (\"Ag\") at a local high school. Today, at 83, he still raises cattle. (Deb's mother died eight years ago.) Outdoor adventures were a Tantr\u00e9 Farm: Agricultural and Spiritual Bounty Continued from page 61 Richard Andres and Deb Lentz Deb and daughter Ariana Their combined leadership makes for harmony. The farm hums along. Fruits, Vegetables, & Mushrooms Grown on Tantr\u00e9 FarmThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 63 routine part of Deb's life. She remembers learning about foraging from her father, and going off with him to look for mushrooms and edible plants, or exploring rock formations and little caves. Like him, she enjoyed spending time in the woods. \"And my dad and I both liked poetry.\" As a young adult, she spent 12 summers working in a German summer camp. After earning her degree in elementary education at College of St. Benedict, in St. Joseph, Minnesota, she began teaching at a Catholic elementary school. Each summer, she spent several weeks taking groups of teens on camping trips. The teens were from the school's church. The priest was a fellow outdoorsman, and he welcomed her involvement. To this day, when asked, Deb says she's Catholic, but she acknowledges that her identification with Catholicism reflects family legacy more than current practice. Richard has little use for organized religion, but he practices various forms of meditation, including, from time to time, getting out on his tractor at dawn to watch a sunrise. The main house is dotted with Eastern artifacts. A photo of a Buddhist master and various decorative pieces suggest a Buddhist influence. When I asked Richard where the name \"Tantr\u00e9\" comes from, he told me that it's from a talk he attended by Thich Nhat Hanh, whose lecture included a digression involving his niece, Tantr\u00e9, who enjoyed spending time with him in his monastic setting. For the record, Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk who studied at Princeton, published over a hundred books \u2014 40 in English \u2014 and now enjoys a world-wide following. He coined the term \"mindfulness,\" which now has widespread currency. He now lives in the Plum Village Monastery in the Dordogne region of France. The main religion in the Andres-Lentz household seems to be environmental awareness and activism. Even the happy clutter of the house \u2014 the colorful paintings and photographs, piles of books and paper \u2014 bespeak a joy of living in the present. It was through Deb's brother, Kevin, that Richard met Deb. Kevin, a mechanic, made his way to Michigan years before Deb did. The second of the five Lentz children, Kevin was a curious, single-minded, and mischievous kid. \"I was the middle child,\" said Deb. \"I don't like conflict. I won't dump the flower pot \u2014 no matter how much I want to see the flower's roots. I don't want to make a mess and get into trouble.\" Kevin liked working on Richard's tractors, and the two became friends. Richard grew up in Canton, Michigan, one of four children. The Andres family lived on a parcel of land big enough to plant strawberries, corn, and muskmelons. That was Richard's project, growing up. He learned to farm by working on neighboring farms. His parents' land was also spacious enough for two trailers, one for each set of grandparents, who parked themselves there and remained for 15 years. This is curious, because Richard remembers his extended family as being somewhat dysfunctional. There were stories of alcoholism and unwanted children. His grandfather, for instance, was raised by the couple that found him on their doorstep, an infant in a shoebox. Yet Richard remembers his own parents as nurturing, with a strong work ethic, and determined to shield their children from the harsh parental criticisms that marred their childhoods. As a young adult, Richard spent several years tending Asian gardens at the Ann Arbor and Toronto Zen Buddhist temples. Then he apprenticed himself to an architect, Gary Cook, an expert in the timber-frame style of carpentry. For many years, Richard worked full-time as a carpenter. He showed me the distribution shed (for distributing CSA shares) that he built behind the house. Its dimensions are 12 x 16. It is made of white oak and is rot resistant. It features a second floor children's playroom. Richard used mortise and tenon joints, a practice that involves tailoring timbers by fitting a tenon (a projection) at the end of one and a mortise (a cavity) at the other. Such joints create corners of 90 degrees, and no nails are needed. His structures also feature his time-tested, timber-frame construction, using wattle and daub. This involves thick planks and exclusively natural substances, which make for sturdy, well-insulated, and ecologically sound structures. Deb, who defers to her husband on agricultural matters, is in charge of the CSA and most domestic matters. Her 16 years of elementary teaching are manifest in the farm's workings. She has brought Tantr\u00e9 into Michigan's Farm-to-School program, the national movement to teach kids that food comes from farms, not from supermarkets. She often brings interns with her to area schools. She particularly appreciates the opportunities to visit her daughter's school, where she helped start a garden. She offers children a hands-on experience through the \"Agrarian Adventure\" program, (www.agrarianadventure.org), where she's been a board member for the last two years and a leader for its \"Farmer in the Classroom\" program. She introduces herself to the children as \"Farmer Deb\" and her interns as \"Farmer Emily\" or \"Farmer James.\" For her \"Kids Project,\" as she calls it, she developed a lesson plan called the \"Parts of the Plant.\" It satisfies the school system's \"benchmarks,\" or units of required material in the district's curriculum, and it satisfies Deb's need to ensure 1.

I don't want to make a mess and get into trouble.\" -Deb LentzThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 64 that each visit is an effective educational experience. She brings fresh produce from the farm, orchestrates guessing games (root vegetables and plant stems hidden in tote bags become the riddle; the children must identify the plant parts), and the kids taste the food. They are, invariably, enthusiastic. She demonstrates to them that they are using their five senses. \"Each sense is a tool that scientists use,\" she tells them, \"but we carry them around with us.\" Deb also updates the farm's website, creates the monthly online newsletter, works in the fields when she can, and coordinates meal preparations. The opportunity to combine teaching with farming is one she finds gratifying. My goal is always education. That's my favorite part of the CSA. I like teaching interns new recipes, or how to do their laundry, or how to work the herbs, or how to harvest without hurting the plant \u2014 or us. My teaching fits the CSA model for our farm. CSA is not just about community, but educating in ways that stores cannot. Farm to School pulls me off the farm, makes me delegate things here. According to Richard, Deb is also responsible for 90 percent of their daughter's upbringing. (Each gives the other abundant credit for their personal and professional successes.) Richard loves that Deb draws people out, that she knows how to listen, that people are drawn to her. She demonstrates this knack at our first meeting. She keeps mum, allowing Richard to be drawn out before she speaks. Richard mentions that Deb does all the writing for the Tantr\u00e9 Farm newsletters. Deb points out that Richard provides the material. \"I just edit,\" she said. Their combined leadership makes for harmony. The farm hums along. Tantr\u00e9 Farm's interns come from all over the U.S.A. Interns from Michigan know about Tantr\u00e9 through word-of-mouth. Interns from afar find Tantr\u00e9 through postings on the ATTRA website. (ATTRA stands for Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas.) ATTRA is devoted to sustainable farming, and its website features a quotation from Thomas Jefferson: \"Cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interest by the most lasting bands.\" ATTRA's National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service lists internships and apprenticeships across the country. In recent years, applications have soared. When I first arrange to visit the farm, I am invited to join the gang for lunch. Family and interns all gather for meals in the main house. Before we eat, I sit with Richard and Deb in a sunroom adjoining the dining room. As we talk, interns arrive with huge, steaming pots, giant bowls and platters of food \u2014 salads, lentil stews, curried string beans, and more. They make their way through the sunroom to the dining room. I marvel at the picture of health presented by these young interns filing in. Lean, fit, natural, stunning, they seemed to me the hope of the future. They are right at home, literally and figuratively, and their passing through does not impede the flow of conversation. Over time, I gather details about some of these interns. The ones I have the privilege to interview speak of the spirit of creativity on the farm, and how Richard and Deb encourage it. Lizzie, who has an undergraduate degree in writing, said that Richard is always writing poetry \u2014 and singing poems. Lizzie founded and publishes the Digest, and she remains one of its regular contributors. She noted that the zine now has corporate sponsors: John Roos, a local coffee roaster, and The Brinery. The Brinery's owner, David Klingenberger, is her friend and former employer. \"I loved working for David; he would pay me to write him poetry. I still write The Brinery's newsletter. David and Richard have a similar sense of humor \u2014 and similar personalities. When I came to Tantr\u00e9, I felt right at home.\" Allia, 31 years old, has a Master's in Women's Literature. She talks about how everyone on the farm is \"fiercely independent\"; that \"they are all creative and expressive about their creativeness \u2014 through writing, or music.\" She pauses. \"People here are pot stirrers. One guy felt it was his job to get people to think. Corn Harvest By Allia Cole The sky is heavy with clouds this morning. Shades of blue and gray swim above our heads. Rays of the early morning sunlight escape through gaps in the clouds to outline their rounded edges. Not one large cloud, but many, thick with the weight of collected water. They move with the current of the winds. The air is cool and feels refreshing on the exposed skin of my arms and legs. We climb in the back of the farm truck and hang on to the skeleton of a metal cage. The ride to the neighboring rented land yanks us out of our morning stupor with each bump and change of gear. We pass the pigs, gray with black patches, who shuffle around their pen as they greet each other, us, and the morning light in the pig patois. The rows of corn undulate with the rolling hills. The tops of the golden stalks ripple from the nudging wind like the surface of a lake disturbed by a passing breeze. We climb off the parked truck. S describes ripe corn: fat, domed top, firm when squeezed. When in doubt, peel open husks and look for plump kernels. I'm assigned a row and disappear into the tall stalks. The others are more familiar with what to look for, so they move more quickly through the rows. V oices are heard conversing through the vegetable forest. It's as if the corn is talking to itself in different tones, making conversation with all the parts of itself. I'm focused on the task at hand, wanting to get my first job done correctly and well. I'm getting comfortable with my ability to tell apart the ripe corn from those that still need maturing when I hear a few plip plops around me. I smile at being so completely immersed in nature. My bare feet covered in the fertile soil below me, my body hugged by the stalks around me, the blanket of clouds above me. Fat droplets rain onto every part of me, my fellow harvesters, the crops we harvest, and the ground on which we walk. We are one of the earth, with Earth, and we are wet. Midway through the row, I pull a cob from the stalk and peel open the husks to check for ripeness. I squeal and drop the corn when a grayish caterpillar about an inch long, living between the kernels and the husks, startles me. I finish harvesting my assigned row as the others reappear from other rows. There are crates and crates of corn. I manage to fill one, maybe two. The six others have been at this for months, some years, and fill two or three times that. I'm not quite a quick corn harvester, yet. There is time to improve. We load the crates onto the trucks as the rain continues, hop on the back between the crates and hang on for the rough ride. Excerpt from Tantr\u00e9 Journal, Thursday, September 6, 2012 Tantr\u00e9 Farm: Agricultural and Spiritual Bounty Continued from page 63 \"Sometimes there's so much love. Deb and Richard encourage people who are growing \u2014 in maturity, experience. Today might be difficult, but tomorrow we have to work together.\" -Allia, farm intern Richard has little use for organized religion, but he practices various forms of meditation, including, from time to time, getting out on his tractor at dawn to watch a sunrise.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 65 He played devil's advocate. Many feel responsible to change things.\" She likes the communal life at Tantr\u00e9. It feels, she said, like one big family. \"Sometimes there's so much love. Deb and Richard encourage people who are growing \u2014 in maturity, experience. Today might be difficult, but tomorrow we have to work together.\" Asked about what it's like to work for Deb and Richard, the interns seemed to agree: \"We're all pretty fond of them.\" When I probe, I discover that some are sometimes discomfited by Richard's cryptic way of communicating, particularly when he's asked for advice. He often responds by telling a story, usually entertaining, often long. It may or may not relate to the subject at hand in any obvious way. If asked to give instructions, he may offer options. He prefers discussing procedure to dictating it. Deb, on the other hand, speaks clearly and directly. \"But she tends to repeat herself,\" said one intern, who hastened to add that this may be because \"she's trying to prevent misimpressions, or because there are always so many people coming in, or she doesn't know who's heard what, or who needs to hear things more than once.\" It takes patience, time, and effort to learn to work and communicate with twenty people. And, said the intern, \"Some people refuse to follow directions.\" Allia, one of the older interns on the farm, grew up in northern Kentucky (\"the greater Cincinnati area\") and spent six years as a nanny. She and Lizzie have become good friends. Both are regular contributors to the Digest, and each plans to grow her own food no matter where she ends up in the future. Each also plans to devote herself to creative writing. At Tantr\u00e9, Lizzie has been tapped to write some of the online newsletter's pieces. And Allia's learning curve has been traced in her writing for the Digest. Creativity at Tantr\u00e9 is also expressed in the way the farmhands work together. Deb and Richard are open to new ideas, and interns have initiated new crops, developed sales prospects, and even altered divisions of labor. Sometimes, of course, such expressions of creativity can lead to trouble. Said Richard: The main religion in the Andres-Lentz household seems to be environmental awareness and activism. The 375 Tantr\u00e9 Farm CSA members make up the extended farm community. Continued on page 66 Rudolf Steiner spoke about \"a future worthy of the human being.\" How do we get there?

When rapport is lost \u2014 if there's too much work, or not enough time to communicate, or other stresses \u2014 then things can unravel. But it's important to step away and look at the whole season, to say, Okay, this is but one moment in a long season. Even when I'm feeling legitimately frustrated. Come back to it as matter-of-factly as possible. On the other hand, there's that balance: Who's allowed to get angry? But we have to be very careful not to demean when frustrated. It affects people psychologically to be demeaned. We try to be as nurturing as possible. That's the key. Deb and Richard prize individual entrepreneurship within the community. When Stephanie and Taik [pronounced TY] decided to strike out on their own after their two-year internship at Tantr\u00e9, they had Richard and Deb's blessing \u2014 and more. During their internship, Richard introduced them to a pig farmer down the road who taught them the rudiments of his business. They asked Richard whether they might raise chickens on the farm. He gave them permission and raw materials to get started. They built a chicken tractor to house the 50 chickens they raised that trial year at Tantr\u00e9. Stephanie explained that the chicken tractor was built using Joel Salatin's model. \"Salatin\" is mentioned as though it's a household name. I look him up and learn that Joel Salatin has written eight books on sustainable agriculture and lives with four generations (including his own four children) on his family's farm in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. A self-described \"Christian, libertarian, environmentalist-capitalist-lunatic-farmer,\" a \"steward of the earth\" who \"respects the design of creation,\" he has inspired a generation of young farmers. 26-year-old Stephanie spent two years studying at I.S.D.S.I. [International Sustainable Development Studies Institute] in Thailand before arriving at Tantr\u00e9. When she returned to her family in Grand Rapids, she met Taik, three years her senior. Stephanie and Taik still spend a good deal of time at Tantr\u00e9, but the couple now owns their own farm in Grass Lake, ten miles from Chelsea. Last summer, they raised 9 pigs and close to 200 chickens to start their own pig and chicken CSA business, which they called \"Two Tracks Acres.\" Stephanie added: \"Richard advised us with codes and regulations. There are lots.\" When learning the ropes, Richard gave them time during work and space in his greenhouse to keep the piglets warm. He also provided space for interns and the pig and chicken CSA members to learn how to make bacon and sausage, and how to butcher a chicken. A chef from Grange came out to the farm to show them how to butcher a pig. (\"We slaughtered that first one ourselves.\") They launched their meat CSA through Deb and Richard's largesse \u2014 through the Tantr\u00e9 CSA list. \"They're very giving,\" said Stephanie about Tantr\u00e9's owners. This young couple is unusual in knowing where they're going and in the determined steps they've taken to get there. Richard remembers others who sought refuge at Tantr\u00e9. \"We've had young people in limbo,\" he said. \"We've had young people struggling with drugs, mental illness including psychotic episodes, Asperger's, and simple loneliness.\" He added: We've been through everything \u2014 falling in love, breaking up, cheating in relationships. But people somehow manage to be civil to one another. People can clear their heads by being on the land. When a problem gets really big, we have so many resources in this area \u2014 friends, neighbors, professionals \u2014 we know somebody who can help make things better. There's lots of social and spiritual capital around here. We just connect the people. We have a lot of good friends. He also has good books. He mentions behavioral psychologist Barb Coloroso, a Franciscan nun who left the order and started a family. He learned from her how to handle mistakes. Discipline should be a simple matter of cause and effect; not punishing but clarifying. \"Mistakes have consequences,\" Richard said. From Coloroso, he learned to be matter of fact but compassionate. \"Deb practices this, too.\" After twenty years of farming, Tantr\u00e9 is well established \u2014 but still evolving. Richard mentions Ari Weinsweig's A Lapsed Anarchist's Approach to Building a Great Business , and explained that Ari (a founder, with Paul Saginaw, of Zingerman's) studied these anarchists' writings as a graduate student. \"[Ari] basically said these anarchists were not into destroying everything. They were willing to look at these systems, see how they worked, how they can be improved.\" Meanwhile, Tantr\u00e9 Farm, which has never received subsidies, is self-sustaining. The CSA helps enormously. So do local sales, particularly to large institutions. The farm's budget allows for interns to get room and board (plus experience); apprentices to get stipends (between $500-1,000 per month); and the farm's four or five employees to be salaried. Richard has become the go-to guy for both business and farming.Tantr\u00e9's reputation has rippled nationwide. Lizzie first heard about Tantr\u00e9 from her friend and former boss, David Klingenberger, in Ann Arbor. He spoke of Tantr\u00e9 as a \"magical place.\" Deb's way of welcoming interns to the \"farmily\" is now legendary. Two years ago, The New York Times did a feature on the farm. Closer to home, Richard Horan, the author of Seeds, devoted a chapter of his newest book, Harvest: An Adventure into the Heart of America's Family Farms, to Tantr\u00e9 Farm. Richard is amused by the way Horan and his daughter call each other \"losers.\" \"It's a term of endearment,\" Richard told me. \"People should enjoy losing; if one gets riled by losing, one just makes more of a mess of things.\" Hearing this philosophy helps clear up an earlier conundrum. The first time I spoke with Richard, I was somewhat baffled by his use of words like \"failure\" and \"desolation\" in speaking of himself. Then I learned that in using these words, he referenced Buddhist masters, who teach that one must embrace failure; that \"desolation\" refers to lack of direction. Richard remains enamored of the family farm work ethic, which ensures that every family member pitches in. While grateful for his family, he thinks wistfully about the urban influences on his daughter. Deb recognizes that Tantr\u00e9's mission does not require or justify the kind of rigor required by family farms of yesteryear. She is pleased that her daughter has had \"an alternative childhood...diverse...rich. You can't buy that.\" Deb admires her daughter's verbal facility and said, \"Her interpretations are honest.\" At the annual CSA membership meeting each April, Deb likes to ask for testimonials. Last year, she asked Ariana if she would talk about things kids do on the farm. Ariana stepped right up. \"She's kind of a shy kid,\" said Deb, \"but she's capable of speaking to people.\" A new generation is primed. ### It takes patience, time, and effort to learn to work and communicate with twenty people. Deb and Richard prize individual entrepreneurship within the community. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 68 All creatures great and small By Dr. Crystal Eberly Does my pet have a food allergy? The cause of your pet's itchy or irritated skin may not be what you initially think. While your first thought might be fleas or seasonal aggravators, such as pollen or ragweed, you might be surprised to learn that a food allergy could actually be to blame. Typically we divide allergies into three main categories: flea allergy, food allergy, and atopy. Atopy refers to your pet's response to allergens in the environment, which may vary from season to season. For example, in the fall we think of ragweed; in the spring we think of cottonwood. Because seasonal allergens can aggravate your pet's skin, it might be hard to determine if food allergies also exist. During the winter, we can start to cross some common allergens off the list if we are fortunate enough to have a good deep freeze. For pets that continue to itch through the true winter months and do not have a concern with fleas, we can narrow our search. Itching or redness of the skin, feet, and ears during winter months is typically caused by either an indoor inhalant allergy, such as dust mites, or by true food allergies. I use the phrase \"true food allergies\" because there is a difference between food intolerances and food allergies . Food intolerances are reactions that result in vomiting or diarrhea but rarely cause an allergic response. A true food allergy is a condition where the immune system reacts to one or more components in a particular food. Food allergies are one of the most common causes of itchy skin diseases pets present and, unfortunately, medical therapies, including steroids, are not often helpful. There are also many myths and confusions regarding food allergies in both dogs and cats. Myth : My pet cannot have a food allergy because he has been on the same food for years.Fact: Actually, food sensitivities are more likely to develop if your pet has been on the same food for years, as the consistency in diet increases the chance of your animal reacting to one of the main ingredients, and it takes years for antigens to build up in the immune system. Most food allergy cases occur in pets five years or older who have been on the same diet for most of that time. Myth: Food allergies are caused by the additives/chemicals in food. Fact: The most common food allergens for dogs are corn, chicken, beef, egg, and wheat. These five ingredients account for 85% of canine food allergies. The most common food allergens for cats are beef, egg, and fish. These three ingredients account for 80% of feline food allergies. While additives can cause reactions, pets usually develop a sensitivity to one of the main ingredients, either a protein or carbohydrate. Myth: If I think my pet has a food allergy, all I have to do is switch her/his food.Fact: Unfortunately, most foods have a blend of some antigenic sources. Ingredient labels can be very misleading. The only true ways to properly change foods is to either use food or treats that are \"predigested\" (processed into very small particles) or introduce a novel source of protein and carbohydrate. A novel ingredient is one that your pet has not previously consumed on a regular basis. For instance, if your dog has been on a beef-based diet, one novel protein might be venison. If your cat has been eating a fish-based diet, you might switch to chicken. The novel diet gives the immune system a break from aggravators. Typically, I also recommend grain-free food because fillers, such as potatoes and grains, can stress a pet's immune system over time. The simpler the diet, the easier it is to determine the source of your pets food allergy. Myth: My pet only partially improved on a novel diet, so he must not be allergic to the food. Fact: I like to talk about allergic animals as having a threshold that we aim to stay below. Most pets with food allergy will also have atopy or flea allergy as well. Timing of a food allergy trial is very important. For example, a dog who has an inhalant allergy to ragweed would not be a good candidate for a food trial conducted in the fall. In order to determine if a response to a diet trial is real, a pet owner should select the appropriate time to do the trial. At the end of the trial, the pet should be challenged with the original diet. If itching restarts within two weeks of the challenge, the food allergy can be diagnosed. Food allergies can be very frustrating. If you think your pet has an allergy to something in his diet, make an appointment with your veterinarian. It is extremely helpful if you record a list of foods, including brand and flavor names, and if you keep a food journal over a months' time, so your vet can review your pet's dietary history. What should I do if my pet's food is recalled? Recently we've had several voluntary pet food recalls due to salmonella contamination concern. It is very easy to panic when our pet's food has been recalled, so it's important to know what we should do as pet owners when this happens. The first thing we should do is check the bag of food against the FDA's website. You can always find current, unbiased lists of recalled foods on this site. If you normally put your pet's food in a container and throw away the bag, it is recommended that before disposing of the bag, you cut out the barcode label and write down the name, variety, and expiration date to keep for your records. If you see your food listed on the recall list, stop feeding it to your pet immediately. Next, you should seal a sample of the food in a plastic bag in case the food company or the FDA requests a sample. Sanitize any containers the food may have been in, including food and water bowls. You can ensure proper sanitization either by running items through a hot cycle in the dishwasher or by washing them with hot, soapy water and a small amount of bleach, then rinsing. Depending on the type of recall, your food supplier or your vet's office can tell you if you need to switch to a brand that has not been recalled, or if you can simply purchase the same type of food with a sell-by date unaffected by the recall. If you have to switch your pet's food entirely, select a diet that is as close as possible to the formula you were previously using, paying attention to the protein, carbohydrate, grain content, and so on. A quality pet store should be able to assist you with several choices. It is best to keep the percentage of protein, fat, and fiber as close to the original diet as possible. Once you've chosen a new diet, offer small meals gradually. Over the course of 24 hours, you can offer a full amount, assuming your pet has not experienced vomiting or diarrhea. If your pet refuses the new food, withhold it for eight hours, without offering treats, and try again. If after 24 hours your pet is still refusing, please call your veterinarian for help. For animals with historically sensitive stomachs, pick an easily digestible version of the new diet. We can advise you on using probiotics in conjunction with a new diet if loose stools become an issue. It is important to realize that not only pets can become ill with a contaminant. As owners, it's imperative that we wash our hands after every feeding to prevent human contamination. Practicing good prevention is essential too. We should handle pet food the same way we handle meat sources in our own diet. Store food in a clean, air tight container. You should clean containers with hot soapy water in between each new bag addition, and food should be stored in a cool location. Also, remember to clean your pet's water and food dishes in the dishwasher daily.

Kids in the Concert Hall: Cannibal Ushers and Other Useful FictionsThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 71 Kids like music. Parents like music. Why, then, am I often the only person in the concert hall with a little one in tow? I want others to enjoy the half-smiles of fellow patrons who find themselves simultaneously charmed by your child, yet terrified that they will be seated next to them. And while I don't want kids to suck the fun out of adult outings, I do think that American society tends to be real sticklers when it comes to drawing boundaries for what is and is not \"Family Time.\" In Spain, the kids are out until midnight soaking up culture in flamenco clubs. They have chest hair at two. They smoke cigars. Like our European counterparts, my scrappy little family is at its best when we pick a few days a month to laugh in the face of reasonable bedtimes, get out of the house, out of our comfort zone, and into the concert hall. My husband and I are pretty culturally omnivorous, which is handy as this means we can let price dictate what we see. The University Musical Society has a program called Kids Club that sells $10 kids tickets (grades 3-12) with the purchase of a $20 adult ticket; there are also great $10 tickets in the balcony for most Hill Auditorium concerts in the season (minimum age requirement: three). The Arab American National Museum in Dearborn has a monthly program called Global Fridays where you can hear awesome world music for $10. The DIA has Friday Night Live concerts every week from 6 to 10 p.m., free with the price of admission. Then, of course, there are free gigs like Chip Tune night at Ann Arbor's Lab Cafe, the great music programming that happens at UMMA's After Hours, and of course the Ann Arbor Summer Festival's Top of the Park concerts. Occasionally, we'll splurge real money on tickets. We took our daughter to Lollapalooza in Chicago when she was one. That outing really is one of my favorite concert-going memories, as we \"discovered\" a group that lives on as one of our family favorites for living room dance parties and road-trip playlists (Mexican Institute of Sound, if you're wondering). The only downside of bringing a toddler to Lollapalooza (aside from trying to fit giant adult earplugs into tiny toddler earholes) is that the whole family is susceptible to a contact buzz. Plan your snacks and picnic goods accordingly. So how do I do it? How do I successfully bring a toddler to concerts that range from informal to formal, listening to music that ranges from electronica to chamber music and everything in between? Well, aside from an in-born knack for throwing myself blindly into potentially embarrassing situations, I have developed a few strategies to make family concert going fun. All the glamor and glory can be yours by following these easy tips: Family Happy Hour Happy hour with the family will help you overlook some of the more glaring flaws of your plan, like the fact that you accidentally let your kid wear those light-up princess sneakers into the dark sanctuary of the concert hall (tap shoes are only marginally less inappropriate). Of course, any loving parent needs to be functional, safe, and attentive, but a cocktail beforehand will ensure you're all in the mood to let loose, let go, and let the evening take its own course. Tios on Liberty Street makes a mean Kiddie-Margarita that looks exactly like mommy's drink. Aside from being fun and delicious, these make for hilarious Facebook pictures that will worry your in-laws and possibly welcome Child Protective Services into your life. Make Rules Once the family is appropriately inebriated, take a moment to review the expectations of the concert hall. If this is a night of electronic music at Lab Cafe, make sure to tell your kid that the music will be loud, there will be lots of dancing, and that while the frozen yogurt machines are awesome, they are not levers for her imaginary spaceship like last time. If you are going to a classical music concert in Hill Auditorium, ask her some basic questions: Mommy: Do we kick the seats at a concert or will that make the person sitting in front of us turn around and shoot laser beams out of her eyes? Child: No! Real lasers? Mommy: Do we scream, \"I HAVE TO GO POTTY!\" just as the conductor raises his baton for the orchestra to play their first piece? Child: We go potty before!Mommy: Do we rush on-stage and start booty dancing during Flight of the Valkyries? You get the point. Set the scene, let her know what to expect, and let her know that people who don't obey the rules get eaten by the head usher. Location, Location, Location Having a strategy on where you sit in the concert hall is critical, especially if you're going to a classical music performance. You need a place that will allow for a stealthy exit and dancing. For concerts in Hill Auditorium, we like aisle seats in the balcony, row L. Aside from being the first letter in my daughter's name (kids love things like this), row L is toward the back of the balcony, which means that we can easily slip out of our seats and dance quietly in the rear of the auditorium. You've got to trust me on this one: If you've never grooved to Handel's Messiah with a toddler, you're missing out on something truly hilarious and sweet. Set the Bar Low My grandpa grew up outside of London during WWII, and this experience has given him a worldview that he's boiled down to the following: \"Set your expectations low in life; then you get to be pleasantly surprised when things go well.\" I think this is a pretty rock solid theory applied to surviving a world war and concert going with a toddler. While there may be some child-shaped robots out there with the ability to sit through a five-hour performance of Einstein on the Beach, most of us are lucky to get away with 45 minutes of quality patron behavior before things start heading south. We accomplish this with the help of illicit stashes of snacks in Tupperware containers (do not bring things in wrappers; they are a dead giveaway that you're breaking the rules and the sound of a crinkling Skittles wrapper in a chamber music concert might make an old person jump you in the parking lot). While your kid is likely to enjoy the first 15 to 20 minutes of a concert, after that they might want to run around in the lobby. This is totally fine, just make sure your exit is stealthy. In a classical music concert, you need to wait until a piece has finished. You may need to up the ante with candy while you wait; Dum-Dums are a universal enjoyment, and the waxy wrapper is nearly silent. Once the song has ended, slip quietly from your back aisle seat and scurry out into the lobby before the applause has died down. Kids get a thrill from the upper-mezzanine lobby of Hill Auditorium; something about the wide open carpeted space really makes them happy. Best of all, thanks to the acoustical magic of Hill Auditorium, you can still hear the music from the lobby. Is it the same as hearing it in the hall proper? No. But remember that this section of the article is called \"Set the Bar Low.\" If your kid seems recharged and ready to do some interpretive back-of-the-auditorium dancing, make a stealthy re-entry between pieces. If implementing these strategies, you enjoy the concert for an hour or more: gold stars all around. Treat your little patron to a post-show hot-cocoa to reinforce the fabulousness of after-parties. But make sure to get out of the concert hall while the going is still good. As a friend of mine likes to say, \"A lady leaves while she's still having fun.\" Truly Render is the Press & Marketing Manager for the University Musical Society.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 72 By Sierra Hillebrand Photography by Tobi Hollander Sixteen years ago, I gave birth to my first child \u2014 a robust baby girl, who is now a vibrant, active, and deeply insightful teenager. Like most of the new mothers I've known and worked with since then, I was both excited and terrified to face the day-to-day adventure of parenting a newborn. I needed a lot of support and affirmation, especially in developing confidence and trust in my own sensibilities as a parent. During my pregnancy, at the urging of my midwives, I enrolled in an infant massage class with Audrey Simon, a local massage therapist who specialized in bodywork for the childbearing months. When my daughter Maura was four weeks old, I bundled her up in her snowsuit, and we headed out to our first infant massage class with Audrey. Little did I know that this would be the beginning of a wonderful experience that would profoundly shape and enhance my parenting relationship with Maura, and later, with her younger sister, Leika. Nor could I have predicted that these experiences would deeply influence my professional development as a midwife and childbirth educator, and later as a psychotherapist and as an infant massage instructor myself. When we arrived, Audrey welcomed us into her warm and inviting space, offering me a cup of tea. I immediately felt at ease, and I settled in with the group of parents and babies who had gathered for the class. Over the next four weeks, we learned a series of massage techniques that are specifically intended for parents and other primary caregivers to use with infants and growing children. Through practicing these techniques, both in class and at home, I learned valuable tools for soothing discomforts, preventing fussy periods, and improving Maura's sleep and digestion \u2014 all very welcome skills for a new parent. Perhaps even more important, Maura and I experienced countless moments of joyful, and often playful, face-to-face interaction, in which I got to know my sweet baby in a deeper and more immediate way than ever before. Over time, Maura grew to love her massage, and often communicated this by smiling, laughing, kicking her feet, waving her arms, or engaging in direct, eager eye contact. Occasionally, she would clearly let me know that the moment was not right for her to receive a massage; she would turn away, look away, or cry to be fed, picked up, or soothed to sleep. With practice, I learned to \"read\" and respect these signals, which made our massage time together all the more enjoyable. History of Infant Massage Infant massage is a traditional component of daily infant care in many parts of the world, and continues to be widely practiced in India, Nigeria, Bali, and parts of New Zealand, as well as other parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Infant massage became popular in North America and Western Europe in the 1980s, primarily due to the work of Vimala Schneider McClure. Ms. McClure was influenced by her exposure to traditional infant massage during her work in an orphanage in India in the early 1970s. In her book Infant Massage \u2014 Revised Edition: A Handbook for Loving Parents, she writes, \"I became aware of the importance of traditional Indian baby massage, both for its soothing effects and for its role in affectionate nonverbal communication.... It was a type of nurturing I hadn't seen in the United States\" (Bantam Books, 2010). After having her own children, and incorporating massage into her parenting, Ms. McClure developed an infant massage curriculum based on traditional Indian practices, modern Swedish massage, and yoga. In 1986 she founded the International Association of Infant Massage (IAIM), an organization that now provides infant massage education, instructor training, and research in over 30 countries throughout the world. Benefits of Infant Massage for Infants and Parents Infant massage offers many immediate benefits for infants and parents alike. Physiological benefits for babies include improved sleep, reduced fussiness, relief of digestive discomfort, and improved weight gain and nutrient assimilation. Babies who are massaged also appear to have improvements in circulatory, neurological, and hormonal function. For infants born prematurely and those with other special needs, infant massage used with other therapeutic protocols can enhance overall well-being and strengthen parent-child relationships impacted by children's health challenges and stress from separation during hospitalizations or other medical treatments. The benefits of infant massage for parental well-being are also considerable. First as a parent, and now as a teacher of infant massage, I have experienced and observed what has been documented by ongoing research: that parents who massage their babies show reduced stress, improved mood, and greater confidence in their ability to soothe and care for their infants. Infant massage can offer infants and their parents opportunities to develop healthy and secure relationships through joyful, loving, and responsive communication. In \"Touch Communication, the Power of Infant Massage,\" psychologist and infant massage instructor Elaine Fogel Schneider, PhD, CIIM, writes, \"In the infant massage process, communication plays an active part. The parent talks to the infant, asks permission to start the massage, questions the infant, and facilitates dialogue. The massage process is composed of about 20 percent technique and 80 percent communication \" (http://www.healthyfamily.org/cs/user/print/article/2). Touch, Attachment, and the Senses The types of communication and interaction facilitated by infant massage form the cornerstone of healthy attachment between parents and infants. Attachment is typically defined as a strong and lasting emotional connection, such as the relationship between a child and a loving parent, or the bonds that develop in a long-term friendship or a supportive romantic partnership. Attachment is developed primarily through sensory experience. With infants, this can take place through affirming eye contact, playful imitation of facial expressions, safe and loving touch, reassuring words, or a soothing lullabye. Infant massage does not in itself \"create\" attachment; rather, it offers quality time for mutually enjoyable sensory experiences that deepen the attachment relationship already unfolding between most infants and loving parents. Experiences of secure attachment and responsive care in infancy also create a foundation for healthy relationships throughout the lifespan. Infant Massage and Later Development The processes and techniques developed in infant massage can be adapted for growing children, sometimes becoming a soothing tummy massage for a toddler with a stomachache or a bedtime foot rub for a school-aged child. As children grow, they also may delight in engaging their own ability to offer loving and nurturing touch \u2014 perhaps by giving a back rub to a parent. Over the years, my own daughters have taught me time and again that what they need most from me is exactly what they needed when we sat down in Audrey's infant massage class \u2014 something that sounds like this: Love me. Hold me close sometimes, and allow me to explore at other times. And above all, listen to me. Listen to all of me, not just my words (because sometimes I don't have words \u2014 even now).

Foundations of Love ~ An Exploration of Infant Massage and Attachment Audrey SimonSierra HillebrandThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 73 Physiological benefits for babies include improved sleep, reduced fussiness, relief of digestive discomfort, and improved weight gain and nutrient assimilation. Babies who are massaged also appear to have improvements in circulatory, neurological, and hormonal function. \"In the infant massage process, communication plays an active part. The parent talks to the infant, asks permission to start the massage, questions the infant, and facilitates dialogue. The massage process is composed of about 20 percent technique and 80 percent communication.\" \u2014Elaine Fogel Schneider, PhD, CIIMInfant massage does not in itself 'create' attachment; rather, it offers quality time for mutually enjoyable sensory experiences that deepen the attachment relationship already unfolding between most infants and loving parents. The processes and techniques developed in infant massage can be adapted for growing children, sometimes becoming a soothing tummy massage for a toddler with a stomachache or a bedtime foot rub for a school-aged child. Cobblestone Farm Market A casual conversation between neighbors in April 2011 led to the creation of one of Ann Arbor's newest farmers' markets, the Cobblestone Farm Market. Each Tuesday from 4:00-7:00 p.m. dozens of vendors and hundreds of families enjoy the picturesque grounds of Cobblestone Farm at 2781 Packard Road. \"It started out as just a farmers' market,\" explained Miriam Vincent, the market's volunteer coordinator and a member of the coordinating team. \"We knew we really wanted a market on this side of town and this location is just so wonderful.\" The market opened on June 19, 2012, with over five hundred people in attendance. \"It just blossomed!\" said Vincent. \"Then we realized we needed to expand the activities we offer and keep it going a long as possible.\" The Cobblestone Farm Market now has many free activities for children and families each week, making it a destination for those not only seeking locally-produced edibles but also concerts, performers, and games. \"We didn't initially intend to have entertainment every week,\" said Vincent, \"but opening day was so much fun that we decided to try to keep it going.\" Vincent said Entertainment Coordinator Carisa Wilder usually plans two activities for each market day, often a children's activity and a concert. Recent performers included storyteller Laura Pershin Raynor and musicians Mr. Lawrence and Joe Reilly. \"Most of the musicians and performers do this as volunteers,\" said Vincent. \"Some are sponsored, but most do it as volunteers partly for the exposure, but mostly just because they are truly dedicated to this community and to sharing with families.\" In addition to watching musical performances, children themselves have the opportunity to perform and to learn about music. Nearly every week, Wilder leads a drum circle for younger children, ages two to five. \"They work on rhythm, saying their names to the beat of the drums,\" said Vincent. \"I looked over at the circle at a recent market and there was a nice crowd of little kids. People are coming here just for that activity.\" Children interested in performing for attendees also have that opportunity; at a recent market, children sang and played violin on the porch of the historic farmhouse. In addition to musical events, other children's activities draw families to this market. Free face painting and crafts are available each week, as long as there are volunteers to coordinate them. \"We depend on our volunteers for everything,\" said Vincent. \"This is an entirely volunteer-run market!\" Community members and businesses have been especially generous in providing other activities for families, said Vincent. Recent programs have included a survival skills workshop by Frank Levey of Blue Turtle Camp and giant bubbles by \"The Bubble Lady.\" Local bicycle store Two Wheel Tango also held a bicycle clinic to teach children about bike safety and maintenance. \"The staff who volunteered for this event were terrific with the kids,\" said Vincent. \"They took the time to help the kids actually tune up and fix their own bicycles. The kids learned something and got their bikes checked out. We are so grateful to everyone who shares their time.\" Some of the most special children's activities, said Vincent, are the lantern parades that will be held again this fall. Other than the year-round market in Kerrytown, the Cobblestone Farm Market is open the longest into the fall, according to Vincent. \"The farmers and vendors want it to go as long as possible,\" she explained. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 74 New, Fun, and Just Plain Cool Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community \"By November, it's dark by the time we close. Last year, we had children create lanterns out of cans and recycled materials and we had fabulous lantern parades around the grounds. The vendors also put lanterns on their tables. It was really beautiful!\" Market volunteers are also planning a fall festival for families. Another activity that may be offered again is a demonstration of the trebuchet owned by Cobblestone Farm. \"A couple created the trebuchet to toss their bouquet after their wedding here,\" said Vincent. \"They donated it to the farm. We used it in the fall to fling some of the children's stuffed toys. It was a safe and fun way to use the trebuchet!\" Parents and kids can learn more about the unique children's events hosted by the market by visiting their events page on their website, www. cobblestonefarmmarket.com. While the children's activities draw many to the Cobblestone Farm Market, both the historic property on which the market is held and the locally-produced edibles and crafts are increasing interest in the market. The market is held on the Cobblestone Farm property, which has heirloom gardens, a three-story oak-framed barn with farm animals, and the historic landmark Ticknor-Campbell Farmhouse. \"It's been great fun to collaborate with Cobblestone Farm,\" said Vincent. \"It feels like we are part of the 'continued history' of this historic landmark, and that makes this whole effort even more special.\" Vincent describes the location as a \"match made in heaven.\" Ample, free parking is available in the Buhr Park lots just adjacent to Cobblestone Farm. The grassy lawns provide a perfect setting for families to relax and picnic and plenty of space for the approximately thirty weekly vendors who offer plant seedlings, vegetables, fruits, honey, eggs, prepared foods, and unique gifts. Prepared food offerings at recent markets included Pilar's Tamales, Hut-K Chaats Indian food, Silvio's Organic Pizza, The Mother Loaf, Simple Pleasures, and baked goods by Lydia and Her Mum. \"It's a great place for families to come and picnic and enjoy free activities,\" said Vincent. The Cobblestone Farm Market welcomes beginning and experienced farmers who grow food using organic practices, and local bakers, cooks, and fermenters who create foods without the use of GMOs. In addition, the market organizers ask that vendors avoid refined sugar and use whole grains whenever possible. Adults and children who make their own crafts and wares and non-profit organizations are also welcome to reserve space at the market. To keep it accessible to everyone, new vendors can exhibit once for free; after that, the cost is less than $10 per market.

On a Tuesday evening as she surveyed the scene, Vincent realized that what they have created is more than just a market. \"What I saw when I looked around was a true commitment to community. All those people were there for a shared purpose and everywhere you looked, there were smiles. People were practically giddy. The thing that struck me the most was the thought that those children who were there and would continue to come will grow up feeling that having a neighborhood farmers' market was normal. And hopefully, one day it will be.\" This year the market will continue through Thanksgiving, weather permitting, making it the only evening market open in November in Ann Arbor.

He received his bachelor's degree in percussion performance from Wayne State University, studying under the famed timpanist Sal Rabbio. Sikorski said that his own experience with percussion and the effect that a musical beat has on people attracted him to Interactive Metronome training. \"We've known about it anecdotally forever,\" said Sikorski. \"Think about the disco music craze that enveloped everyone, about African drummers and their dancing. It's hypnotizing.\" Years later scientific measurements have demonstrated that these repeated rhythms have definite effects on the brain. \"Now we have documentation from major universities and neurological researchers,\" explained Sikorski. \"It says that there's something to this beat and its ability to forge new neurological pathways in the brain.\" The majority of Sikorski's IM students are children between five and fifteen. He often works with students who are struggling academically, including those who have been diagnosed with A.D.D./A.D.H.D. and those on the autism spectrum. He explained that academic tasks, such as reading, involve physical skills as well as intellectual skills, and that being able to focus on and replicate rhythms often greatly improves academic performance. \"Repeated, rhythmic auditory stimulation helps to build new pathways in the brain,\" explained Sikorski. \"The brain has plasticity, it's just a matter of accessing it.\" He said that the average child who completes 12 one-hour IM sessions will increase their reading fluency by approximately two years and their math fluency by approximately one year when measured on the Woodcock-Johnson test of cognitive abilities often used by educators. The techniques used to achieve these results may appear deceptively simple. Sikorski uses a computerized metronome that trains users to coordinate hand and foot movements (beginning with simple clapping) to a specific beat (54 beats per minute, or the average person's resting heart rate). The user wears special gloves with sensors in the palms and he or she gently claps to match the beat provided by the computer, which records how close they approximate the rhythm. The precise measuring system detects within milliseconds how close the user's clapping is to the beat they are trying to match. As the user becomes more proficient, Sikorski makes the tasks more challenging. For example, additional, distracting sounds might compete with the \"cowbell\" sound the user is supposed to match. \"With lots of added distractions and sounds, it becomes more difficult to maintain the focus on just that cowbell sound, the rhythmic center,\" said Sikorski. Later, students use their feet to match the rhythm on a touch pad. The most challenging tasks involve alternating left foot/right hand and right foot/left hand. \"These crossover tasks cross the midline in the brain and stimulate different pathways,\" explained Sikorski. Sikorski said that some children may never be able to complete the entire 14-task sequence, but most can still benefit. \"For kids on the autism spectrum or those with A.D.D., the distractions of everyday life can be overwhelming. This training may help them find a new ability to focus that will help them academically and with life in The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 76 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Interactive Metronome \"Success comes with the ability to tune out distractions,\" explained Paul Sikorski, chief executive officer of Michigan Peak Performance. \"You have to learn where the switch is in your own head to turn these distractions on and off. Once you intuitively learn where that switch is, you have access to it.\" Using a tool called Interactive Metronome, Sikorski's company offers students the opportunity to improve concentration and focus, which often produces improvement in math and reading skills, as well as other life skills. Interactive Metronome (IM) was developed in the early 1990s by James Cassily, a Michigan-based music industry professional who worked as a record producer and engineer for musicians, including Bob Seger and Janis Joplin. Cassily noticed that musicians need to intuitively know precise timing and rhythm in order to be successful. According to Sikorski, Cassily also taught piano at Greenhills School and noticed that children who took piano lessons performed better in their other academic subjects and often had better behavior and self-control than students who did not take music lessons. Coincidentally, one of Cassily's piano students had Attention Deficit Disorder (A.D.D.) and was traveling to George Washington University for instruction with Dr. Stanley Greenspan, a clinical professor of psychiatry, behavioral science, and pediatrics well known for his influential approaches to treating children with autism spectrum disorders. Cassily's student exhibited marked improvement in his ability to focus and concentrate after using the IM technologies. Greenspan was impressed by this success and became a proponent of the IM approach. He became the director of research at Interactive Metronome in 1997. The IM program was formally introduced for use by medical professionals in the treatment of disorders, including A.D.D., autism spectrum disorders, and traumatic brain injury, in 1999, with the training program for improving academic and sports performance being made available to professionals, such as Sikorski, in 2001.Continued from page 75 Interactive Metronome developer James Cassily noticed that children who took piano lessons performed better in their other academic subjects and often had better behavior and self-control than students who did not take music lessons.\"Repeated, rhythmic auditory stimulation helps to build new pathways in the brain,\" explained Sikorski. \"The brain has plasticity, it's just a matter of accessing it.\" Sikorski uses a computerized metronome that trains users to coordinate hand and foot movements (beginning with simple clapping) to a specific beat (54 beats per minute, or the average person's resting heart rate). Paul SikorskiMetronome Photographs by Tobi Hollandergeneral.\" He said research has shown that because IM develops new pathways in the brain, most children retain the academic gains they achieve. \"With typical children or children who might be described as high-functioning autistic, they don't go backwards after they complete the sessions. The brain seems to recognize superior pathways and continues to use them.\" He said that many children don't initially notice a difference in their ability to focus, since \"they are living in their own skin all the time and the change is gradual.\" After four to six sessions, though, Sikorski said that testing starts to show change and improvement. \"What kids may notice is an internal calmness that they can feel. They recognize that calmness. There is so much overstimulation now. Even for a typical child, the classrooms have so much going on at one time.\" Sikorski described the program as the opposite of the MTV model of constant, flashing images and changing focus. \"That exists even in classrooms now with multiple activities, groups talking, colors and posters all over the place. For some children, this is simply a lot to take in. When kids learn how to tune out distractions and how to flip that switch, we see some very positive changes,\" he explained. Sikorski said that this type of training can benefit nearly all children. \"Children perform much better when they are able to be calm and to learn to calm themselves. This technique helps them to feel calm and in control.\" He said IM training is similar to other beneficial activities that promote calmness and mind-body connection, but added, \"The rhythmic baseline we use seems to have a quicker effect on people than similar activities such as yoga. The kids who do the best with this program are the ones who come in with just a bit of internal fire. They want to do better than themselves and the computer feedback is able to instantly show them how they are doing. It becomes a way to compete with themselves to achieve just a little more each time. It's a very focused and direct.\" Although Sikorski said that the academic improvements seen by IM students may be difficult to achieve after age 15 or so, the program is still useful for older teens and adults for specific purposes. He works with high school and college-level athletes and has even worked with National Hockey League players who want to improve their focus. \"We're trying to reach that pointy-end-of-the-spear focus,\" he explained. \"These athletes are lifting weights, doing everything they can to achieve strength and focus. They are self-disciplined.\" For hockey players, he said that combining the IM training with a Bosu balance ball helps them to replicate the slippery surface of the ice and the other distractions during play. \"They need to learn to think independently in the face of multiple levels of distraction,\" he said. In addition, individuals of any age who have survived stroke or other brain injury or who have progressive disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, may benefit from IM training. \"For stroke survivors, they have noted that it can be very beneficial in helping them re-learn the alphabet, numbers,\" he said. \"The repetitive movement helps build and enhance pathways in the brain.\" Sikorski typically conducts his IM classes in his students' homes, although some may choose to meet in a doctor or counselor's office. \"As long as a house is quiet and it's treated like a private music lesson, it's very easy to do this in someone's home.\" Sikorski occasionally offers free introductory workshops to demonstrate and explain IM training, including a recent workshop at the Ann Arbor District Library.

This technique helps them to feel calm and in control.\" Continued on page 78 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 78 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 77 Lisa Ballo was an executive at an advertising agency when she noticed that many of her co-workers were consistently stressed out and fatigued. Ballo managed her own stress by practicing yoga, and she brought her knowledge to her co-workers. \"I received yoga training so that I could begin to teach others.\" What began as yoga classes for co-workers grew into a full-time career for Ballo. Now a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) and certified Yoga Ed Instructor with more than 20 years experience, she is the founder and owner of Belightful Yoga, a mobile yoga studio that brings yoga classes to people's homes, schools, businesses, and community centers across southeastern Michigan. The idea for a mobile yoga studio came to Ballo during her time at the advertising agency. \"I realized that while most people love and benefit from yoga, many are just too busy to commit to weekly yoga classes held in a traditional studio. Getting to classes can be difficult. Our lives are hectic and complicated,\" said Ballo. Belightful Yoga began in 2009 and remains an entirely mobile yoga studio. \"That's the uniqueness of this program. It's convenient. We will come to you, wherever you are. People are just so busy, so stressed out. It can be very hard to make it to a class. Let us come to you!\" Belightful Yoga has 15 teachers with a wide range of yoga specialties who teach classes for people of all ages, from young children through senior citizens. For Ballo, though, teaching children is her passion: \"As I began to teach, I fell in love with the children, especially children with special needs. I saw instantly how much benefit they get from yoga. Teaching children with special needs is what I love the most.\" Ballo said that while all children benefit from yoga, for children with disabilities or special needs and those on the autism spectrum, yoga may enhance their lives in especially important ways. \"It helps with motor skills, flexibility, and strength. It can also help children with attention deficit disorder or those on the autism spectrum with self-regulation. The repetition of poses can help the children learn routines in a fun way. It's about strengthening the connection between one's mind and body, while teaching relaxation, flexibility, and self-awareness,\" explained Ballo. According to Ballo, parents of children with special needs report noticeable changes in their children after regular yoga classes led by Belightful Yoga instructors. One mother observed a significant decrease in her child's anxiety and said that medications could be reduced. Another said that her son became more relaxed and that his stuttering diminished. Belightful Yoga's instructors are skilled at tailoring their classes specifically for children and families with different special needs or for groups supporting children with special needs. \"Our teachers all have different specialties,\" explained Ballo. \"For example, one of our teachers is a special education teacher who took specialized training in yoga therapy. All of our teachers have basic yoga training and many have more specialized training, as well.\" Belightful Yoga offers classes for the Down Syndrome Guild of Southeastern Michigan (for teens and young adults) and many of the centers in the area supporting children with autism. Belightful Yoga has also worked with a camp in Livonia for survivors of traumatic brain injury and with children with cerebral palsy. \"That's one of the benefits of our mobile studio,\" said Ballo. \"For our students with cerebral palsy, for example, we can work with them right in their home. For the parents, they don't need to even leave the house, to get siblings out the door. It just takes one level of stress out of a process that is aimed at reducing stress.\" For parents of children with special needs, yoga classes can offer them time to network with other parents, time to take a break for themselves, or time to practice yoga with their children. Ballo emphasized that the word \"yoga\" means \"union.\" \"It's both a union of one's mind and body and a sense of community while practicing,\" she explained. \"There's a sense of community that's created, of coming together and supporting one another. That might mean parents and kids coming together to practice together or that might mean a time for parents with similar challenges to network among themselves or just to take a needed break. It's all beneficial.\" In addition to her work with children and families with special needs, Ballo and her staff work with parents, teachers, and children's organizations to create yoga programs for all ages and abilities. For example, Belightful Yoga works with many area Girl Scout troops, sometimes helping the Scouts earn their patches or complete a Journey. \"We can provide one class or a series of classes in a large basement, a school, a church, even outside!\" In some cases, the parents will choose to enjoy adult time while the Scouts practice yoga; other times they join in alongside their children. \"Sometimes, troop leaders like it so much that they have asked us to create a mother/daughter series of classes for them. We've also done just moms' groups while the children are doing their own class.\" Belightful Yoga is a mobile yoga studio that brings yoga classes to people's homes, schools, businesses, and community centers across southeastern Michigan. \" As I began to teach, I fell in love with the children, especially children with special needs.\" -Lisa Ballo, founder of Belightful Yoga\"For our students with cerebral palsy, for example, we can work with them right in their home. For the parents, they don't need to even leave the house, to get siblings out the door. It just takes one level of stress out of a process that is aimed at reducing stress.\"Belightful Yoga Lisa BalloAlthough Ballo said that a series of classes is more beneficial than just one class, even one class can provide benefits to children. \"Parents find that we can teach tools that can be very helpful during stressful times at home,\" said Ballo. \"For example, if a child is having anxiety, the parent can pause and the parent and child can take a few rainbow breaths together. Even in one session, we can give kids and parents some tools that help everyone calm down.\" Schools also work with Ballo to address specific concerns or issues. \"Sometimes parents and schools will call us with a concern like bullying and we can work with them to create a class that gives kids strategies,\" said Ballo. \"As long as we have a place to hold the class, like a school room, we are happy to make it happen. That's a great benefit of our mobile studio.\" Ballo said that after school classes might include skills such as, \"breathing exercises, visualizations, guided imagery, very fun, playful activities for children. We can also help the children work together on partner poses and help them do affirmations, repeating words like 'I am balanced. I am strong.' These classes help them feel strong and confident, especially if they are dealing with bullying situations.\" Teachers and administrators who have worked with Belightful Yoga have found it to be a positive experience for their students. Chris Schoenherr, Head of School at Four Corners Montessori School in Madison Heights, found that offering yoga for his students, \"builds self esteem and supports physical wellbeing by focusing on breathing, visualization, yoga poses, and games.\" In addition to working with children, the Belightful Yoga mobile studio also conducts classes in senior citizens' facilities for older adults and an on-going yoga series for corporate clients, including DTE Energy in Ann Arbor. The uniqueness of the Belightful Yoga program, said Ballo, is that it comes to the student and is tailored to each student's needs. \"Let us come out to you. No matter where you are. No matter your age, your ability. This is for everybody and for every body. It's also about learning acceptance, especially for children with special needs or for seniors. It's about celebrating the gifts they have, which can be especially important for someone with a disability,\" Ballo explained. \"It's about empowerment, feeling strong, and focusing on what they can do.\" For more information about Belightful Yoga or to discuss creating a class, email info@belightfulyoga, call (248) 761-6815, or visit www.belightfulyoga.com.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 79 \" As long as we have a place to hold the class, like a school room, we are happy to make it happen.

For more information and to submit nominations visit us at http://risingphoenix.peacefulcrossings.comBy Dr. Mazhar Shaik (Editor's Note -- Dr. Mazhar Shaik is an Ayurvedic physician working at the Parkway Center. He received his Doctor of Medicine from Osmania University in India. Now 51, he and his wife, Mastanbee (Seema) Shaik, have been in the United States for 21 years, and in Ann Arbor for three. They have 3 children living in town, the eldest of whom is studying at the U-M Medical School.) One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. With statistics like these, breast cancer will impact virtually every woman in one way or another. Fortunately, nearly all types of breast cancer can be treated successfully if found early. Early detection gives women a lifesaving head start on the road to a cure. Per the Center for Disease Control (CDC), in 2011, an estimated 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 57,650 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer. Worldwide, more than one million women are diagnosed with the disease every year. CDC statistics are scary, and the question needs to be asked again \u2014 should we continue to concentrate on procedures that can only detect an existing lump, or should we be focusing on screening methods that can warn of a pending problem far in advance of a lump developing? A technology originally developed by the U.S. military for night vision could help women cut their risk of developing breast cancer. Known as infrared thermal imaging, the technology scans for spots of breast cancer like a heat seeking missile. I first took notice of infrared technology while working for the National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC) at Wheeling Jesuit University. Having started my career in the U.S. as a researcher, I worked at the NTTC for 17 years, serving as a principle investigator for a number of federal health technology grants. During that time, one of the technologies that caught my attention was infrared technology being developed by NASA for use on Mars to detect life and weather patterns. Later, it was further developed by the Department of Defense for medical use and for picking up wounded soldiers at night from the battlefield. My wife, an obstetrician by background, and I opened Green Health Thermography in Ann Arbor in January 2012, motivated by my interest in technology and her passion to serve women. Together, we practice a blend of the preventive, well-care philosophy of Eastern medicine and the technical innovations of Western science. Green Health Thermography offers breast and full-body thermography services using infrared thermal imaging technology. Defined by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunctive diagnostic screening for detection of breast cancer, thermography is not a standalone device and does not replace mammography. It is pain free, 100 percent safe, and entirely non-contact, which means no painful compression of the breasts. It is also non-invasive, so there are no injections of harmful dyes or contrast mediums into the blood stream, and it involves no exposure to radiation. There are no contra-indications for breast thermography, making it safe for pregnant women and those with implants. The technology works by identifying and measuring metabolic changes in breast tissue. New blood vessel creation is critical to the development of a malignant tumor. Breast thermography detects the increased blood flow needed by cancer cells early in their development by measuring the excess heat radiating from the skin. The result is the ability to detect tumor growth beginning at very early stages. Supported by more than 800 peer-reviewed studies encompassing more than 300,000 participants, breast thermography offers an effective method for early detection of cancer, no matter what your age or circumstances. In many cases, it detects cancer eight to ten years before a mammogram. At Green Health Thermography, we see a number of patients who are at risk of getting cancer because of their family history, as well as women who are looking for a pain-free, radiation-free, and safe imaging alternative to mammograms. Also, survivor patients taking alternative and supportive treatments come to us to monitor the disease and effectiveness of the treatment. Younger women under 50 years who are not eligible for mammogram screening under the new Health and Human Services (HHS) recommendations now have a safe alternative to screen for breast cancer with thermography. Also, women with a family history of cancer (1 in 10 women) should screen their breasts on a yearly basis. For these high-risk women, breast thermography is a reliable alternative to screen for breast cancer. The breast tissue of younger women tends to be denser, which makes conventional mammogram scans less reliable. The technology isn't limited to scanning for breast cancer. Thyroid, sinus, T.M.J., dental, cardiovascular, digestive, and other diseases can be recognized in the patterns of heat given off by the body. For instance, patients at risk for diabetes will present a reading with blue coloring on the hands and feet. The image is recorded and looks much like a weather report with varying colors representing weather conditions. Our center is unique because we specialize in women's health and offer private imaging respecting individual needs, preferences, and cultures.

Most of our clientele are health conscious consumers who want to \"heal before they can feel. \" We support our patients' choices to take control of their health through prevention, and we are happy to show how their thermographic image can be a part of their commitment to a healthy lifestyle. The testing results can help patients become proactive in instituting personalized prevention, such as lifestyle modifications, increased physician surveillance, and medications.

Call Karen at 417-9511; krngrnbg@gmail.com or clair-ascension.com. By Tiffany Mazurek Photos by Joni Strickfaden On a typical day, I may arrive to work to greet a pregnant woman. As she follows me into the office, she discusses her fears that the baby is presently in the wrong position and that her first pregnancy resulted in a cesarean delivery. During our session, we use craniosacral therapy to open up the pelvis, making room for the baby to move. Throughout the session, we process her fears about the delivery, and I assist her in relaxation by using some guided visualization and energy clearing techniques. Two days later, I receive a call canceling our follow-up session as the baby had not only turned, but had been delivered successfully without needing a cesarean. Next, I might work with a veteran who has experienced multiple head traumas during his time in a war zone. This client deals with chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, and one of his goals is to be off the heavy pain medications that he has taken for years. Through a combination of massage and craniosacral therapy, he is able to lower his dosage. His pain and anxiety begin to decrease, and he feels that his overall quality of life is starting to improve. Another client I might see is a young adult in her twenties dealing with anxiety and depression. This client feels overwhelmed by life and just wants to feel \"normal. \" With bodywork and psychotherapy, she begins to see how her thought patterns are not only affecting her mood but also her physical body. These are just a few stories of those whom I am blessed to work with in my private practice. The examples represent a combination of clients, no one specific person. But they illustrate how a variety of techniques can be useful for individuals. Nineteen years ago, I completed my graduate studies in social work at the University of Michigan. I believed I was well prepared to begin employment in a field where I could make a difference in the lives of individuals and families. I began working in foster care, and then moved to a nonprofit agency where I counseled survivors of child abuse and sexual assault. Within a couple of years, however, I realized that something was missing. Traditional therapy wasn't enough for many people. I became curious about incorporating bodywork into therapeutic techniques with clients, as I saw how important it was to integrate the person with his or her body. I knew I was inherently a holistic practitioner. I first discovered craniosacral therapy for my own personal healing and growth. Craniosacral therapy is a holistic healing practice that uses very light touch to balance the craniosacral system in the body, which includes the bones, nerves, fluids, and connective tissues of the cranium and spinal area. It releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole-body health and performance. It served me very well emotionally and physically. After experiencing this amazing treatment I fell in love with it, and knew this was another tool for many of the clients I worked with at the nonprofit agency. A Multi-Level Healing Approach ~ Meeting the Complex Needs of Clients The final push came one day when a client asked me about adding massage as part of her healing, and I encouraged her to do so. She found a massage therapist and scheduled an appointment. When she returned the following week, she reported that the appointment had not gone well. While on the massage table, the client had experienced an emotional release, a common reaction for people who have dealt with traumatic incidents. Unfortunately, the massage therapist was neither prepared nor skilled in dealing with this type of reaction. I felt as though I had let my client down. I decided that I would never again recommend treatment without first having a referral to someone I trusted. However, I didn't know any massage therapists at the time, so I decided to further my education by attending a massage therapy program. When I first started my private practice nine years ago, I was feeling the effects of compassion fatigue and burn out. I thought how wonderful it would be to just give a nice, relaxing massage for a while. I soon realized how foolish that notion truly was, as I continued to draw clients who would open up at different times and share their history of depression, anxiety, abuse, and other issues. More often than not, they would come in for a massage and end up talking about the issues contributing to the tension in their bodies. I am lucky to have my private practice at the Center for Sacred Living. I get to work with a wide variety of clients with different needs. I also get to work with many other healers that offer things that I do not. I love my work and consider it an honor to participate in another person's healing journey.I began working in foster care, and then moved to a nonprofit agency where I counseled survivors of child abuse and sexual assault. Within a couple of years, I realized that something was missing. Traditional therapy wasn't enough for many people.

Main St., Ann Arbor 734.665.2757 - crazywisdom.net By Chris Wucherer Running a private practice in the midst of an economic downturn in a geographic area with lots of competition can feel as futile as pulling a wagonload of molasses uphill. At every turn, we ask ourselves, why are we doing this? What is the payoff to all this hard work? Where did my joy go, and isn't there an easier way to get to my goal? We all have stories that inform who we are and what we do for a living. For over thirty years, I have been a clinical social worker, spending most of my career in private practice. Ten years ago, I trained as a life and business coach and added this niche to my practice. Over the course of my career, I have experienced the ups and downs of running a private practice, from the early years of abundant clients and a great income, through the managed care era, and now, in the environment of economic challenge, insurance industry domination, and the rise of social media. When I was working with family business owners from the late 80's through the mid-90's, I became interested in integrating more traditional business ideas into the running of my private practice. I began to see that if my practice was not just going to survive, but thrive, it was important to begin thinking like a business owner rather than a private practitioner. Language is powerful and shapes who we are in the world, personally and professionally. A \"private practitioner\" practices the art of psychotherapy, Reiki, massage, acupuncture, and so on, whereas a \"business owner\" defines, grows, markets, and runs a business. This is a tough shift for most private practitioners. We love what we do. We want to be with our clients, listen deeply, ask interesting questions, provide helpful feedback, and offer relief in the way our profession demands. We want to help people heal and grow through their pain into happier, more functional people. This is who we are trained to be and what we are trained to do. The nuts and bolts of running a business is antithetical to what we feel is our soul work. We seem to have a severe allergy to business concepts and models. We are confused by terms such as mission, vision, values, and goals \u2014 and wonder what they have to do with helping people heal. Focusing on such things feels like a distraction. We just want to be with clients and use our healing practice to help them lead healthy lives. I understand this. I have been through all the phases of change from having a private practice to running a business. These phases parallel the stages of loss: denial, anger, grief, and acceptance. It's common to deny that a change in how we practice is necessary, to feel anger because we have to spend time learning business concepts and applying them to our practice, and to feel grief that the climate for private practice is becoming more complicated. Finally, we accept the inevitable, which means rolling up our sleeves and getting down to business. Currently, I have a thriving private psychotherapy business working with clients three days a week out of my home. My overhead is low, my clients are ideal, my income is good, and my joy for work is back. The bald truth is that the glory days of private practice are over. The landscape is changing for healing professionals, and it is only going to get more difficult to ply our craft, as solo or group practitioners, and make money while doing it.The business of healing professionals is no different than any other business. Things change and thus businesses need to change what they do, what they offer, and how they do it \u2014 or they die. Video stores are gone; instead we use Netflix or stream shows from sites like Hulu. Bookstores are fading; instead we download books to our Kindles, Nooks, or iPads. When was the last time you listened to a cassette tape or CD? Now we use iPods or other mp3 players. In other words, the storefront we were once used to is either no more, or has morphed into a newer version of itself. Our challenge as healing professionals is to shift from having a practice to running a business in a way that works with our values and sensibilities \u2014 to establish a newer version of our business. You may be surprised to find that many business concepts are simpatico with the healing arts. Here are some key tips that will help convert your practice into a thriving business: Build a solid foundation for your business by creating a three-dimensional vision that includes your ideal practice, clients, and income. Do you work with your clients to visualize change, to help them see themselves as healthier, less anxious, and more confident? In a similar way, you can create a vision for your ideal healing business. As Walt Disney said, \"If you can dream it, you can do it. \" Take small steps and work steadily toward the vision of your ideal healing business. If you accomplish two or three small steps every day, at the end of 30 days, you will have taken between 60 and 90 steps (completed goals) toward the thriving healing business you visualized. For example, if your ideal practice involves spending less time on administrative tasks and more time doing what you love, you might set a small goal to research three billing systems daily. Other small daily steps could include putting $50 each pay period toward an automated billing system and reading one article online about the business of the healing professional.Do You Have a 21st-Century Private Practice? Christine Wucherer For over thirty years, Christine Wucherer has been a clinical social worker, spending most of her career in private practice. Ten years ago, she trained as a life and business coach and added this niche to her practice. The bald truth is that the glory days of private practice are over. Language is powerful and shapes who we are in the world, personally and professionally. A \"private practitioner\" practices the art of psychotherapy, Reiki, massage, acupuncture, and so on, whereas a \"business owner\" defines, grows, markets, and runs a business. This is a tough shift for most private practitioners.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 108 Identify your fears and discover how you are getting in your own way. Fear-based living is common, and as healing practitioners, we share many techniques with clients to help them recognize and overcome their fears that we can apply to our own efforts as well. Invest money in your healing business. We ask our clients to invest their money with us to help them improve their lives. Similarly, we have to invest money in our business so we can work smarter, not harder, and spend our energy on what brings us joy. Familiarize yourself with new technologies, from web-based billing programs, to social media, such as podcasts, blogs, Twitter, videos, and Facebook business pages. We encourage our clients to move beyond excuses and fears and try new things because we know it works. The same is true for shifting our business models. We have to hunt more for clients, and social media is a low-cost way of marketing. Get support. I have had a business coach, and I currently have a small group of trusted colleagues who are not in the healing arts with whom I meet monthly for business support, advice, and brainstorming. The bottom line is that you love what you do, and you deserve to make money doing it. While change is not easy, it is constant, and getting proactive about upgrading your private practice will allow you to be in charge of change rather than a victim of it. The landscape of the healing professional's business world is evolving. Where do you want to be in five years? Chris Wucherer is a psychotherapist and a life and business coach with over 30 years of experience. She is the author of Creating a 21st-Century Private Practice: The Saner Living Way to a Thriving Private Practice. She loves helping people and businesses create saner lives and saner businesses.

Go to AnnArborHolistic.com.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 113Animals are feelers and resonate deeply with the emotional body of their human, with each other, and with nature. So, when we allow ourselves to feel how we feel, and rest in these feelings without judgment, without running away from our feelings, automatically we are in intuitive communication with our animal friends. We do not have to struggle with the mind so hard, to try and \"figure it out. \" If we just allow our feelings, what the animals are feeling will be given to us in that moment. The human mind is a very active creation that tends to judge, measure, compare, and compartmentalize. It puts limits on the self, on the emotions, and on the heart. Animals have minds too, but not in the dominant manner of the human, by which I mean, their minds do not dominate their emotions. Human emotions and animal emotions are basically the same. Animals are feelers, and feelers just feel; feelings just \"are\" with no explanation. Human feelings are exactly like this too, and when we can go more into our feelings and not get so caught up Communicating with Our Animal Friends By Shoh Nah Hah Lieh in our minds, and especially our judgmental mind, we can much more easily get in tune with our animals and \"communicate\" with them. That is an interesting word, isn't it, the word \"communicate\"? It has so many levels of meaning. There is the mentally based communication that is so human. There is also the emotionally and heart based communication that is so human and animal. What I would like to share here is how to help oneself become more aware of how easy it is to communicate with our animals; how easy it is to \"heart feelingly\" communicate with our animals. One way we might start is to say something like \"the animals live in the dreamtime, \" meaning the animals who live so profoundly in their emotional bodies live as though they are in our own human dreamtime. Recall when we are dreaming how easy it is to just flow and move about from one reality or situation to another; how things in the dream can often morph into something else spontaneously. All of this just happens and we experience it without any explanation. It just is. We are just experiencing it and that's that. Not like living in the mind. So one thing that will help with communicating intuitively with our animal friends is to just allow ourselves to relax our bodies, relax our minds, and, whenever possible, allow ourselves to receive the meditation that is the love of God, which is everywhere all the time. The love of God is Feeling, and it is by receiving this Feeling of Love that our own emotional bodies, our feeling bodies, can open more and more to our animal friends, our human and plant friends, and all of nature and the cosmos. And, as we relax, as we \"give over\" and allow ourselves to receive the energies coming into us, automatically what the animals wish to share with us will be given to us. It is this simple. There need be no efforting, or \"trying to pick up\" the information, or seeking to find out what the animal is \"saying\" to us. All will be given as we rest and relax and allow ourselves to receive what is always spontaneously flowing to and from our emotional bodies, those of the animals, of nature. Love. It is a God-given and every day thing to be able to communicate with our animal friends. It is not something esoterically available to just a few. I have yet to meet one human who is unable to communicate with animals. I have had the really happy opportunity to help people \"remember\" their intuitive abilities, their communication abilities again. As children, we are in complete communication with our animal friends, with nature. We do not feel our bodies and our emotions as separate from nature, from the animals. As we grow older, we begin to separate from these emotions. It is just a matter of remembering, of allowing ourselves to feel again oneness with our bodies, emotions, and nature. When we remember this, we rediscover that animals are spontaneously One way we might start is to say something like \"the animals live in the dreamtime, \" meaning the animals who live so profoundly in their emotional bodies live as though they are in our own human dreamtime.As we relax, as we \"give over\" and allow ourselves to receive the energies coming into us, automatically what the animals wish to share with us will be given to us.Shoh Nah Hah Lieh (Betsy Adams) is the author of Self Love and the Healing of our Animal Friends.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 114Teachers, Lecturers, Workshop Leaders and the Centersalways communicating with us. They have never stopped communicating with us. We stopped communicating with them! And this is okay really. It is just a matter of whether or not you want to be in a deep feeling relationship in your body, your emotions, and your heart, with the animals, with nature again. And ultimately, with the Love you Are. I will say this: Never doubt that you can communicate with your animals. As a friend of mine, Michael, used to say, loudly, \"Doubt the doubt!\" Instead, find ways to be in peaceful, mind-quieting, serenity creating spaces and moments in your life. And while in these moments, breathe deep, deep into your cells, your body, your being, your essence, and allow yourself to feel how you feel. And sometimes if these feelings are scary or not nice, that is okay, just breathe them out to God and breathe in Love instead. It's like a replacement therapy. And then, while in this quiet and serene openness, gently, gently focus on your animal friends, on nature, on the one you wish to communicate with. This being will be there, and you will have a wonderful re-experiencing of who you are emotionally, a being tenderly created and in synchronicity with nature. It has been my own experience that the animals are always present and happy to receive communion with us, with our heart. Even when your animal friend is ill, or perhaps becoming ready to pass on, always the animal loves to be in communication with you. Even the wildlife, all the creatures of nature, in all the various stages of their lives, love to be in communication with you. Never doubt this. It is the doubt within the human mind, its tendencies to create separation between the heart emotions and nature that has created so much doubt about our natural gifts here. Go into nature, explore, and above all receive the Love you Are. Have fun, enjoy, trust. Shoh Nah Hah Lieh (Betsy Adams) is the author of Self Love and the Healing of our Animal Friends. She brings over 30 years of experience in working with animals to bear in helping guide students to develop meaningful connections with their beloved animal companions.
