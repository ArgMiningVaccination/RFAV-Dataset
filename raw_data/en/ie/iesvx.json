I've often stated that they are my favorite wellness tools. In this article, I will explain the five main reasons why these heavenly smelling [plant secondary metabolites](https://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-potency/) play such a vital role in how I [support my clients](https://dr-lobisco.com/naturopathic-medicine-and-functional-medicine-services/). 5 Ways That Naturopathic Medicine and Essential Oils Make Perfect Partners 1. Essential oils have immediate, [multiple beneficial effects which simultaneously](https://dr-lobisco.com/uses-of-essential-oils-for-health/) impact the [emotions](https://dr-lobisco.com/the-basis-of-emotion-how-essential-oils-inspire-hope-joy-and-abundance/), [body,](https://dr-lobisco.com/uses-of-essential-oils-for-health/) and [spirit. ](https://dr-lobisco.com/how-essential-oils-and-spirituality-can-help-one-cope-with-addictions-during-the-holidays-a-link-to-november-2018-holistic-and-integrative-medicine-top-reads/)For example, they have been shown to help mitigate [stress, balance mood](https://dr-lobisco.com/mission-statement-for-naturopathic-doctor-and-functional-medicine/), support the brain of those struggling with \" [mental illnesses](https://dr-lobisco.com/suffering-in-silence-the-barriers-to-better-mental-health-naturopathic-wholisitic-essentialoils/),\" and [aid in recovery from](https://dr-lobisco.com/how-essential-oils-and-spirituality-can-help-one-cope-with-addictions-during-the-holidays-a-link-to-november-2018-holistic-and-integrative-medicine-top-reads/) substance use disorder. These characteristics are all in alignment with the [naturopathic medicine principle](https://dr-lobisco.com/mission-statement-for-naturopathic-doctor-and-functional-medicine/) to treat the whole person, not just their symptoms. 2. Their [multi-factorial and synergistic](https://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oil-choose/) properties work [with the body and mind, rather than manipulating them](https://www.saratoga.com/healing-health-wellness/2018/05/essential-oils-antibiotics-medications/). Essential oils are gentle, yet powerful, and guide the organ systems in a non-invasive way. This honors the [naturopathic medicine principl](https://dr-lobisco.com/mission-statement-for-naturopathic-doctor-and-functional-medicine/)e to work with the healing power of nature. 3. Essential oils seamlessly fit into many wellness practices. This is based on the [naturopathic principle](https://dr-lobisco.com/how-essential-oils-and-spirituality-can-help-one-cope-with-addictions-during-the-holidays-a-link-to-november-2018-holistic-and-integrative-medicine-top-reads/) to teach healthy living. For example, some oils are stimulating and invigorating and assist with exercise performance. Several studies have reported how cardamom and peppermint oils can augment workouts [ by increasing attention](https://dr-lobisco.com/the-power-of-peppermint-oil-for-back-to-school-brains-and-august-2016-top-holistic-and-integrative-health-reads-link/) and cardiorespiratory fitness. [(source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318534548_EVALUATION_OF_THE_EFFICACY_OF_CARDAMOM_AROMATHERAPY_ON_AEROBIC_FITNESS_AUTONOMIC_FUNCTIONS_AMONG_STUDENTS_1_2_1), [source](https://dr-lobisco.com/can-an-essential-oil-help-improve-exercise-performance/)) These same oils [can also be used to help with focus](https://www.saratoga.com/living-well/2017/08/essential-oils-blends-kids-back-to-school/) during the workday. Other [essential oils are calming](https://www.saratoga.com/living-well/2017/02/why-you-may-want-to-frequently-sniff-the-soothing-scent-of-ylang-ylang-essential-oil-part-ii/). They can be used after a workout, if one is over-stimulated from the day, or stressed from project deadlines looming. Various combinations of oils can be used with meditation or simply diffused to soothe the nerves, support the [body's defenses](https://www.saratoga.com/healing-health-wellness/2018/05/support-your-mind-and-body-with-essential-oil-synergy-to-fully-embrace-a-healthy-summer/) and aid recovery from stress effects. 4. My [naturopathic and functional medicine specialties](https://dr-lobisco.com/naturopathic-medicine-and-functional-medicine-services/) wellness](https://dr-lobisco.com/tag/essential-oils-and-digestion/), and [hormonal balance](https://dr-lobisco.com/valentines-day-weekend-oily-tip-using-essential-oils-for-healthy-hearts-hormones-and-human-connections-during-the-month-of-love-and-beyond/); therefore, using essential oils allows me to incorporate an intervention that not only addresses physiological imbalances, but often what precedes or co-occurs with them. [As they modulate neurotransmitters, essential oils also balance hormones, assist digestion, and enhance mood.](https://dr-lobisco.com/uses-of-essential-oils-for-health/) They also combine [well with the herbs](https://www.saratoga.com/healing-health-wellness/2018/05/essential-oils-antibiotics-medications/) and supplements that I also often suggest. Care should be taken with using them with [certain medications, but often essential oils enhance prescription drugs' positive effects and decrease their side effects.](https://www.saratoga.com/healing-health-wellness/2018/05/digging-deeper-into-the-three-most-import-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-an-essential-oil-factor-two/) 5. Essential oils' effects are [based on biochemical individuality](https://www.saratoga.com/healing-health-wellness/2019/01/for-the-love-of-biochemical-individuality-consideration-of-the-latest-cbd-oil-craze/). This means everyone [will respond differently](https://www.townsendletter.com/Dec2016/sniff1216_4.html) to essential oils based on [many distinct factors including](https://www.saratoga.com/healing-health-wellness/2018/05/digging-deeper-into-the-three-most-import-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-an-essential-oil-factor-two/): one's own unique chemical makeup, detoxification capacities, genetic variances in enzymes, health status, and associations with a particular aroma. This makes essential oils a form of personalized medicine that is so essential to naturopathic treatment. Bonus: Prevention is the Best Cure As a [naturopathic doctor](https://dr-lobisco.com/naturopathic-medicine-and-functional-medicine-services/) who upholds all of the [six naturopathic medicine principles](https://dr-lobisco.com/mission-statement-for-naturopathic-doctor-and-functional-medicine/), I take to heart that \"prevention is the best cure.\" Starting with tips for [a healthy fall](https://dr-lobisco.com/essential-oils-2019-october-essential-oils-orange-oil-nutmeg-oil-cinnamon-oil-bergamot-oilautumn-oils-for-immune-and-kids-sleep-2/) using essential oils and moving into specific essential oils blends to [inspire hope, abundance, joy](https://dr-lobisco.com/connecting-your-brain-and-heart-with-your-gut-essential-oils-the-microbiome-and-mental-health/) and [gratitude](https://dr-lobisco.com/tis-season-cheer-finding-gratitudein-essential-oils-bottle-part-ii/), I have been making a commitment to help divert the \"festive stress\" that peaks right about... now!
