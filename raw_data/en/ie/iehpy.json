Schappert, M.A., Division of Health Care Statistics Introduction During the 12-month period from January 1992 through December 1992, an estimated 762.0 million visits were made to nonfederally employe~ office-based physicians in the United States\u2014about three visits per person. This rate is not significantly different from office visit rates observed since 1985 (l-4). This report presents data highlights from the 1992 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a national probability sample survey conducted by the Division of Health Care Statistics of the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Statistics are presented on physician, patient, and visit characteristics. Because the estimates presented in this report are based on a sample rather than on the entire universe of office visits, they are subject to sampling variability. The Technical notes found at the end of this report include an overview of the sample design used in the 1992 NAMCS, an explanation of sampling errors, and guidelines for judging the precision of the estimates. The Patient Record form is used by physicians participating in the NAMCS to record information about their patients' office visits. This form is # SWlcc$.b U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES reproduced in figure 1 and is intended to serve as a reference for readers as they review the survey findings presented in this document. The physician sample for the NAMCS was selected with the cooperation of the American Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association. Their contribution to this effort is gratefidly acknowledged. Physician characteristics The distribution of office visits according to physician specialty for the 13 most visited specialties is presented in table 1. The largest share of visits was made to physicians specializing in general and family practice (28.8 percent). Compared with 1991 data, increases were noted in the proportion of visits made to general and family practitioners and pediatricians. Conversely, the proportions of visits made to internists and dermatologists were significantly lower than in 1991. No significant differences were found in the distribution of visits made to obstetricians and gynecologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons, otolaryngologists, psychiatrists, urologists, cardiovascular disease specialists, or neurologists. Vkit rates to each of the 13 physician specialties were not found to ditYer significantly from 1991 visit rates (4). Doctors of osteopathy received 45.0 million visits during 1992, or 5.9 percent of all office visits. Vusits to this specialty occurred at a rate of 17.9 per 100 persons, which was not significantly different from the 1991 visit rate. Vkits according to geographic characteristics of the physician's practice are also displayed in table 1. Visit rates by region\u2014Northeast, Midwest, South, and West\u2014were not statistically different from each other in 1992. Neither had they changed from the previous year's rates with the exception of the South, where the rate was slightly higher in 1992 than in 1991. However, it is suspected that this is due largely to sampling variability and changes in the NAMCS survey methodology for 1992 rather than to an actual increase in the number of office visits. A discussion of these changes and the impact they may have had on the survey results is included in the Technical notes.

These patterns were also observed in the 1990 and 1991 NAMCS. T&it rates were found to increase with age after the age of 24.

Vmit rates for four of six age groups were not statistically different from those observed in 1991, nor were visit rates by sex found to be significantly different from the previous year's rates. Small but significant increases were noted in the rate of office visits made by persons in the age groups under 15 years and 15-24 years.

The rate was higher for black persons, but no significant difference was noted in the rate for white personsin this age group between 1991 and 1992. The visit rate for the white population was not significantly different from the 1991 rate, but the rate for the black population was higher in 1992 than in 1991. In addition, the percent of visits madeby black persons was higher in 1992, but it is suspected that these findings may be largely a result of changes inthe 1992 sampling methodology (see Technical notes). Visit characteristics Referral status and prior-visit status In general, 6.3 percent of office visitsin 1992 were made as the result of a referral from another physician, not significantly different from the 6.2 percent noted in 1991. The majority of office visits (85.3 percent) were made by patients who had seen the physician on a previous occasion, and more than half (62.2 percent) of all visits were made by persons who were returning to the physician for care of a previously treated problem (table 3). Only 14.7 pereent of the visits were made by new patients. The proportionof visits madeby new patients was statistically Iowerin 1992 compared with 1991 data, whilea corresponding increase was found in the proportion ofvisits made by patients who were not new to the physician but who were seeking care of a new problem. Nodifference was notedin the percent of return visits made for the care of previously treated problems between 1991 and 1992. Expected sources ofpayment Data unexpected sourcesof payment are shown in table 4. Physicians were asked to check all of the applicable payment categories for this survey item, with the result that multiple payment sources could be coded for each visit. The patient-paid category includes the patient's contribution toward \"co-payments''and \"deductibles.\" Expected sources of payment were most often private/commercial insurance (32.9 percent of visits), Medicare (19.9 percent of visits), HMO/other prepaid (19.2 percent), and patient-paid (19.1 percent). Significant decreases were noted in the proportion of visits that listed privatefcommercial insurance, Medicare, and patient-paid as expected pay sources between 1991 and 1992. Conversely, a higher proportion of visits showed \"HMO/otherp repaid''and Medicaid as expected sources of payment in 1992 as compared with 1991. Injury-related visits Injury-related office visits are presented in terms of patient's age, sex, and race in table5. There were an estimated 65.6 million injury-related office visits in 1992, representing 8.6percent ofallofEce visits. More than half of these (56.7 percent) were made by maIes, snd 39.7 pereent were made by persons 25-44 years old. Males had a higher injury-visit rate than females did overall (30.4 visits per 100 males compared with 22.0 visits per 100 females), but these differences were noted ordyinthe age groups 15-24 years and 25-44 years. Injury-visit rates for males and females in the under 15, 45-64, 65-74, and75 years and over age groups were not found to differ statistically. Among females, injury-visit rates showed little variation between six age groups. The only statistical difference noted was between females under 15 years compared with those 25-44 year.$ the injury-visit rate was significantly lower for the former group as compared with the latter. For males, the injury- visit rate was higher for persons 25-44 years than for those in three other age categories: under 15 years, 65-74 years, and 75 years and over. Males in the age group 45-64 years had an injury-visit 4 Advance Data No. 253 August 18,1994 Table 2.

No significant differences were noted in the rates for males under 15 years and 15-24 years. The injury-visit rate for black persons (25.7 visits per 100) was not significantly different than the injury- visit rate for white persons (26.3 visits per 100) in 1992. The injury-visit rate was found to be significantly higher for white males compared with white females. This was not the case with rates for black males and black females, which showed no statistical difference (data not shown). Patient's cigarette-smoking status Results from the1992 survey showed that 78.6 million office visits, or 10.3 percent of the total, were made by patients who smoke cigarettes. However, the patient's smoking status was not reported for26.0 percent of office visits. Data on visits according to patient's cigarette smoking status are presented in tables 6 and 7. Patient's principal reason for visit Item 10ofthe Patient Record form asks the physician to record thepatient's (or patient surrogate's) \"complaint(s), symptom(s), orother reason(s) for this visit in thepatient's own words.'' Up to three reasons for visit are classified and coded from the Survey according to the Reasonfor Viit Classification for Ambulatory Care (RVC) (5). The principal reason for visit is the problem, complaint, or reason listed in item 10a. The RVC is divided into the eight modules or groups of reasons displayed in table8. More than half of all visits were made for reasons classified as symptoms (57.9 percent). Respiratory symptoms accounted for 12.4percentof all visits, and musculoskeletal symptoms accounted for 10.8percent. The 20 most frequently mentioned principal reasons for visit, representing 40.7 percent of all visits, are shown in table9. General medical examination was the most frequently mentioned reason for visit overall (4.5 percent of the total), while cough was the most frequently mentioned reason havingto do with illness or injury (4,0 percent), Of the top 20 reasons for office visits in 1992, 19 were also listed among the20 most frequently mentioned reasons in 1991, albeit in slightly different order. It is important to note that the rank ordering presented in this and other tables in this report may not always be reliable because near estimates may not differ from each other due to sampling variability. Diagnostic and screening sewices Statistics on diagnostic and screening services ordered or provided by the physician during the office visit are displayed in table 10. The list of diagnostic and screening services appearing on the Patient Record form is changed periodically to reflect the changing needs of data users, recommendations of advisora, and anticipated future health data needs. The most recent revision to this item was in Advance Data No. 253 August 18, 1994 5 Table 3.

These modifications are discussed in two previous publications (4,6); all were retained in the 1992 NAMCS. More than haIf (64.5 percent) of alI office visits included one or more diagnostic or screening service. The most frequently mentioned servicx. was blood pressure check, recordedat 43,5 percent of visits. This percent was not significantly different from that recorded in199 l. Blood pressure checks were ordered or provided at a significantly higher proportion ofvisits by females (48.2 percent) than at visits by males (36,5 percent). Other frequently mentioned diagnostic or screening services were \"other\" lab test (16.7 percent of visits), urinalysis (13.9 percent), visual acuity (5,5 percent), and radiology (excluding chest xray) (5.4percent). Cholesterol 4.0 17,773 2.3 source of psymert may be reported pet visit measures were reported at 3.1 percent of office visits. Pap tests and mammograms were reported at 6.6 percent and 3.0 percent ofvisits by females, respectively. A statistically higher proportion of visits by males included resting EKG's and chest xrays than did visits by females. Significant differences by sex were also noted in the percent of visits with exercise EKG's, radiology other than chest xray, hearing tests, and visual acuity examinations, alIofwhich were reported more frequently at visitsby males. Wits by females were more likely toinclude urinalysis and \"other\" lab tests than were visits by males. Ambulatory surgical procedures Initem140fthe NAMCS Patient Record form, physicians were asked to record up to two outpatient diagnostic or therapeutic procedures either scheduled or performed at the current visit. This item first appeared in the 1991 NAMCS. There were 50.0 million ambulatory surgieal procedures reportedat 6.1 percent of all office visits during 1992. This is not significantly different from the 1991 figure of6.2pereent. Tablesll and12show visits with ambulatory surgery scheduled or performed by patient's age, sex, and type of physician seen. The proportion of ambulatory surgery visits was not significantly d~erent for persons in the age groups 45-64, 65-74, and75 yeara and over. However, each of these groups was more likely to have an ambulatory surgery visit than were those in each of thethree agegroupsunder45 years. No statistical dtierence was noted by patient's sex in the percent of visits with ambulatory surgery scheduled or performed. Visits to specialists in urological surgery, orthopedic surgery, general surgery, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, and dermatology represented 23.Opercent of all office visits, but accounted formore than half (52.7 percent) of all ambulatory surgery visits. Procedures areclassified by type of operation in table 13; the 10 procedures most frequently mentioned by physicians on the Patient Record form are shown in table 14. Physician's principal diagnosis Item 11 of the Patient Record form asks the physician to record the principal diagnosis or problem associated with thepatient's most important reason for the current visit as well as any other significant current diagnoses. Up to three diagnoses are coded and classified according to the International Classification of Drkeases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) (7). Displayed in table 15 are office visits by principal diagnosis using the major disease categories specified by the ICD-9-CM. The supplementary classification, used for diagnoses that are not classifiable to injury or illness (for example, general medical examination, routine prenatal examination, and herdth supervision of an infant or child), accounted for 15.4 percent of all office visits.

Medication therapy was the most commonly mentioned therapeutic service in1992, reported at 486.0million office visits or 63.8 percent of the total (table 18). There were 922.6 million drug mentions at visits to office-based physicians during 1992. 'Ilk yields an average of 1.2 drug mentions per office visit, or 1.9 drug mentions per drug visit. Data on number of drug visits and drug mentions by physician specialty are shown in table 19. The highest proportion of drug visits was found among visits to cardiovascular disease specialists; 85.6 percent of the visits made to this specialty included at least one drug mention. Drug mentions are displayed by therapeutic class in table 20. This classification is based on the therapeutic categories used inthe National Drug Code Directory, 1985 edition (NDC) (8). It should be noted that some drugs have more than one therapeutic application. In cases of this type, the drug was listed under the NDC classification that occurred with the greatest frequency. Cardiovascular-renal drugs and antimicrobial agents accounted for nearly one-third of all drug mentions (15.8 percent each). Other prominent categories included drugs used for relief of pain (ll.O percent) and respiratory tract drugs (10.4 percent). hypertension was reported in item 11 of the Patient Record form and suggests that physicians tend to underreport chronic conditions initemll. It should benoted that initemll, physicians are instructed to record up to two additional current diagnoses if any, in addition to the principal diagnosis, whether or not they are of direct concern to the current visit.

Nonmedication therapy was ordered or provided at 30.9 percent of all office visits during 1992 (table 23). Diet education or counseling was mentioned most frequently byphyeicians, at 11.8percent of the total, or 89.6 million visits, Other prominent categories included exercise (7.3 percent), weight reduction (4.Opercent), and cholesterol reduction (2.9percent). The percentof visits where smoking cessation services were either ordered or provided increased significantly between 1991 and 1992, from 1.9 percent (13.0 million visits) to 2.4percent (18.3 million visits). Disposition of visit The majority ofoffice visits (64.4 percent) included a scheduled followup visitor telephone call in 1992, but this percent was significantly lower than that noted in1991 (66.7 percent). Another 24.2 percent of office visits included instructions to return if needed, which represents a statistically significant increase over the 1991 proportion (21 .6 percent). I_ess than lpercent of visits resulted ina hospital admission in both 1991 and 1992. Table24 displays dataon disposition of office visits. Duration of visit Data on the duration of office visits is presented in table 25. Durationof visit refers to the amount of time spent in face-to-face contact between the physician and the patient. l%is time is estimated and recordedby the physician and does not include time spent waiting to seethe physician, time spent receiving care from someone other than the physician without the presenceof 6.1 0.4 2.3 0.3 4.7 0.6 5.7 0.4 7.8 0.6 &8 0.8 9.1 0.9 5.8 0.4 6.5 0.4 the physician, or time spent by the physician in reviewing patient records and/or test results. In cases where the patient received care from a member of the physician's staff but did not actually see the physician during the visit, duration was recorded as ''zero\" minutes. About two-thirds (66.6 percent) of physicians' office visits had a duration of 15 minutes or less in 1992. The mean duration time forall visits was 17.6 minutes. Comesponding numbers for 1991 were 69.3percent and16.7 minutes, respectively. Additional reports that utilize 1992 NAMCS data are forthcoming in the Advance Data from Wal and Health Statistics series.

The target universe of NAMCS includes office visits made in the United States by ambulatory patients to nonfederally employed physicians who are principally engaged in office practice, but not in the specialties of anesthesiology, pathology, or radiology. Telephone contacts and nonoffice visits are excluded. A multistage probability sample design is used in NAMCS, involving samples of primary sampling units (PSU'S), physician practices within PSU'S, and patient visits within physician practices. The PSU'S are counties, groups of counties, county equivalents (such as parishes or independent cities), or towns and townships (for some PSU'S in New England). For 1992, a sample of 3,000 nonfederal, office-based physicians was selected from master files maintained by the American Medical Association and American Osteopathic Association. Physicians were screened at the time of the survey to ensure that they were eligible for survey participation. Of those screened, 858 physicians were ruled ineligible (out of scope) due to reasons of being retired; employed primarily in teaching, research, or administration; or other reasons. The remaining 2,142 physicians were in scope or eligible to participate in the survey. The physician response rate for the 1992 NAMCS was 71.4 percent. Sample physicians were asked to complete Patient Record forms (figure 1) for a systematic random sample of office visits occurring during a randomly assigned l-week reporting period. Responding physicians completed 34,606 Patient Record forms. Characteristics of the physician's practice, such as primary specialty and type of practice, were obtained from the physicians during an induction interview. The U.S. Bureau of the Census, Housing Surveys Branch, was responsible for the survey's data collection. Processing operations and medical coding were performed by the National Center for Health Statistics, Health Care Survey Section, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. For 1992 several changes were made in the sample design of the NAMCS, which should be considered in the interpretation of the survey results. In an effort to even the precision of estimates across each of the physician specialty strata in the sample design, the decision was made to increase the proportion in the sample of specialists in general surgery, psychiatry, otolaryngology, and neurology. Although this would result in a corresponding decrease in the sample of the larger physician specialties, most notably general and family practice, internal medicine, and pediatrics, the precision of these estimates tended to be much higher relative to the smaller specialties, and it was expected that the end result would be an acceptable balance of precision levels across all strata. However, the reduced numbers of general practitioners, internists, and pediatricians sampled in 1992, coupled with the high percents of sampled physicians in these specialties who were determined to be ineligible (out of scope) for survey participation, resulted in low numbers of survey respondents in these categories and a lowering of the precision of these estimates relative to other survey years, especially when disaggregate by other variables such as race. Because visits made by black patients were often found to be clustered among the sampled physicians and were more likely to be made to general and family practitioners, which were undersampled in 1992, it is recommended that caution be exercised when interpreting differences in race data and individual physician specialties. Sampling errors The standarderroris primarily a measure of the sampling variability that occurs by chance when only a sample, rather than an entire universe, is surveyed. The relative standard error of an estimate is obtained by dividing the standard error by the estimate itselfi the Table L Approximate reiativa etandard errors for estimated numbers of office visits National Ambulatory Medical Care suNey, 1ee2 Relative Estimated number of office standard visits in thousands error in 200,000 .................. 5.0 500,000 .................. 4.8 I,ooo,ooo ................. 4.7 NOTES The smallast reliable estimate for VMS to aggregated apesiaRies is 676,0W visits.

Adjustments for nonresponse Estimates from NAMCS data were adjusted to account for sample physicians who were in scope but did not participate in the study. This adjustment was calculated to minimize the impact of response on final estimates by imputing to nonresponding physicians data from visits to similar physicians. For this purpose, physicians were judged similar if they had the same specialty designation and practiced in the same PSU. Test of significance and rounding In this report, the determination of statistical inference is based on the t-test. The Bonferroni inequality was used to establish the critical value for statistically significant differences (0.05 level of confidence). Terms relating to differences such as \"greater than\" or \"less than\" indicate that the difference is statistically significant.

Alternatively, relative standard errors for aggregate estimates maybe calculated using the following general formula, where x is the aggregate of interest in thousands, and A and B are the appropriate coefficients from table V. Similarly, relative standard errors for percents may be calculated using the following general formula, where p is the percent of interest and x is the denominator of the percent in thousands, using the appropriate coefficient tlom table V. RSE@)=/~) .1OO p.x Estimates and percents relating to ambulatory surgical procedures have been presented in tables in this report with specific standard errors calculated using SUDAAN software (lO), rather than using the generalized variance curves that approximate relative standard errors for most NAMCS estimates. The decision to provide specific standard errors for these estimates and percents was made following a statistical analysis of the data that resulted from the ambulatory surgery survey item. The analysis percents were calculated from original unrounded figures and do not necessarily agree with percents calculated from rounded data.
