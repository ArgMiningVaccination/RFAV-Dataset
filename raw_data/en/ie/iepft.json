AUGUST 2023 - We all know the benefits that vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, L-ascorbic acid or ascorbate, has on the immune system. In fact, its consumption is usually increased during the winter as it is known to reduce the duration or severity of colds. However, this vitamin can help the body fight many other diseases. According to Breastcancer.org, vitamin C may prevent cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes. It is also important to prevent articular cartilage degeneration (osteoarthritis) and even eye diseases such as cataracts and macular degeneration. He also claims that it may play a role in reducing the risk of certain types of cancer, such as cancer of the lung, digestive tract, and gastrointestinal tract. \"From a structural point of view, vitamin C is very similar to glucose, in that sense the therapeutic logic for cancer is to act as a glucose mimic. This biochemical replacement causes an energy crisis in tumor cells, that is, since glucose does not reach them, they temporarily run out of energy, and this allows the mechanisms of death in cancer cells to start, \"explains Dr. Pablo de la Fuente, a surgeon from the Australian of the University of Chile, a specialist in diagnostic and therapeutic imaging from the University of Concepci\u00f3n, who has been working at the Regional Hospital of Valdivia since 2014 in the field of oncology of digestive system cancer. The specialist also clarifies that \"physiologically, the body has a limited ability to absorb vitamin C orally, and after that side effects occur, such as osmotic diarrhea or problems with the gastrointestinal tract, this absorption pathway is saturated.\" That's one reason cancer treatments have begun to include intravenous administration, which University of Kansas scientists say allows vitamin C to be fully absorbed and can kill cancer cells. \"The advantage of using the intravenous route is the administration of very high concentrations, which cause a reaction in glycodependent cells, such as tumor cells, and such a concentration cannot be achieved orally,\" explains the doctor. NEW TECHNOLOGY: LIPOSOMAL New formats have been developed to bring higher concentration doses closer to humans, such as Liposomal Vitamin C, which is 400% more bioavailable than the regular format (the one you buy at the pharmacy). What does it mean? The nutrient is encapsulated in phospholipids (fatty acids) which allow for more efficient and direct absorption. As a result, more vitamin C enters the blood, which has an active effect on the body without side effects on the digestive system. In this context, the Chilean enterprise BVITAL LIFE, located in the Los Rios region, chose this innovation to present it in our country under the name VIT/C-VITAL LIPOSOMAL, the first and only liposomal vitamin C available in Chile. HealthTech, owned by married couple Pedro Gres and Barbara Leisinger, created the first clean-label Chilean supplements and recently added liposomal vitamin C to its product line. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW The use of concentrated doses of ascorbic acid for cancer treatment began in the 1970s, when chemist Linus Pauling reported that this vitamin, administered intravenously, was effective in treating cancer. The relationship between vitamin C and cancer was documented by Pauling and Abraham Hoffer in the book Vitamin C and Cancer. Since then, several studies have shown that combining standard cancer treatments with high doses of intravenous vitamin C may be beneficial, showing that this route can be a safe and effective cancer treatment. In addition, it was possible to determine that, in combination with chemotherapy, it is possible to reduce the rate of tumor growth. Meanwhile, a study published in the specialized journal Science Translational Medicine in 2014 called for large-scale clinical trials. The big downside to vitamin C being approved as a cancer treatment is that the pharmaceutical industry is unlikely to be interested in testing it. This is due to the fact that, being a natural product, it cannot be patented and therefore is of little economic interest. For this reason, many clinical studies of this vitamin have been discontinued. "}
