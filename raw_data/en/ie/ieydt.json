I was especially moved by her account of being invited toshare a meal by two women inone of the villages she visited. Despite having had to scavenge for wild zucchini and wild grainsduring a time of famine, theywere eager to share what theyhad with someone who to themmust have seemed unimagi-nably prosperous. Who among us would share what we had if we had so little? And who among us will share what we have, since we have so much? Michelle Sanders, M.D.'99 West Westford, Mass.

Johnson, M.D.'03 St. Louis, Mo. Beeson article brings back memories I read with more than passing interest the piece by RichardRapport, m.d. , on Paul Beeson, who was one of my real-life heroes [\"Fever, Internal Medicineand Paul Beeson,\" Yale Medicine , Winter 2007]. In it, he mentionsthe tragic case of the youngwoman who died from an over-dose of intrathecal penicillin. I am certain that from that inci- dent came the study that led to the paper by Elihu Schimmel, m.d .' 5 4 ,hs'61,fw'64, titled \"The Hazards of Hospitalization,\" which appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January 1964. Each of Beeson's chief resi- dents had a yearlong projectthat usually became the subjectof medical grand rounds towardthe end of the academic year.Schimmel's project was titled \"The domp Syndrome,\" the acronym referring to diseases ofmedical progress, perhaps the precursor of the Institute ofMedicine's volume To Err is Human . In-hospital complica- tions of all sorts, including iatro- genic deaths, are front-burner items today. I hesitate to thinkof the reams of regulations thathave been generated hoping to prevent, or at least minimize, these untoward occurrences. As medicine becomes more technology-driven, the pace ofhospital practice quickens andthe severity of illness of thosepatients who are hospitalizedincreases, the health care profes- sionals who battle to reduce in- hospital complications will be working against a considerable gradient. I wish them good luckin this difficult and worthwhileendeavor. I enjoy Yale Medicine and read it regularly. Keep up thegood work! James B.D. Mark, m.d., hs '60 Stanford, Calif. The obituary for Paul Beeson brought back many memories for me, and one of the anec- dotes certainly rang a bell. WhenI started my internship in 1963,I learned that there were more interns than slots for residents and one intern would not bekept on. One of my patients, who had alcoholic hypoglycemia, was chosen to be the subject of grand rounds that summer.Tom Ferris, my chief resident,told me to write the historyand physical examination andthen to come to his office to rehearse. The next day, the auditorium was packed. In the first sentence I extempora-neously described the patientas \"an alcoholic bum.\" Therewas an audible gasp from the audience and I knew I had done something wrong. OnMonday, Tom told me thatBeeson wanted me to knowthat there may have been bumsat Bellevue but there were nobums in New Haven. I imaginedthen that my fate was sealed\u2014 I would be the intern who was cut because I was not enough of a New England gentleman. Fortunately that did not happen.Before the year was out, how-ever, I received a draft notice andwent to see Beeson. He was able to get me reassigned to the Public Health Service at the Communi-cable Disease Center (whichlater became the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention), and he apologized to me for not being able to keep me out of the service altogether! His advice was to make an opportunity out of whatappeared to be adversity. I did,and that began my career in infectious diseases. I subsquently went to visit him in Oxford to ask his advice about where to do a fellowship. We had lunch at apub; he was generous with histime and advice. He was so happyat Oxford, working on the immu-nology of eosinophilia in ratswith trichinosis. He said he had left Yale so that he would have time to do research, rather thandoing only administration for a department that had grown too large for his taste. I only regret not having had more timedirectly under his tutelage. Hewas a great teacher and a terrific role model. Joshua Fierer, m.d., hs '68 San Diego, Calif. Thank you very much for the magnificent article about PaulBeeson's tenure at the School of Medicine. The author, RichardRapport, m.d ., could not possibly express the awe that Dr. Beesoninspired in our entire class. Itis no accident that a majority ofmy classmates chose internalmedicine as their career choice\u2014inspired, of course by the greatphysicians and teachers thatsurrounded Dr. Beeson. We were thunderstruck by the fact that one of our class-mates actually died as a compli-cation of an infectious diseasewhile a patient of Dr. Beeson's atthe Grace-New Haven MedicalCenter! We could not imaginethat Dr. Beeson could permitsuch a tragedy to occur! Palace, m.d . '60, hs'64 Basking Ridge, N.J.Simulation, Chinese herbs and a career studying killers For our cover story this issue we asked writer Jennifer Kaylin to explore the ways in which simulation is used to train physicians. Simulation techniques range from mannequins that talk, breathe and even \"die,\" to sophisticated computer simulators that let residents andstudents test their skills at intubation and colonoscopy, to actors who take on the characters\u2014and ailments\u2014of patients in order to teach interview skills. These techniques have becomestandard training tools in medicine and, as medical education increasingly emphasizes clinical skills, a new way of evaluating students and residents. We also focus on the meeting of mainstream medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Since ancient times and all around the world, humans have found remedies inherbs and plants. As writer John Dillon reports, Yung-Chi Cheng, ph.d ., the Henry Bronson Professor of Pharmacology, has taken the lead at Yale in seeking out Chinese herbal medicinesthat can enhance the effects of chemotherapy while mitigating toxic side effects. Finally, writer Colleen Shaddox takes us into the world of Dorothy O. Lewis, m.d. '63, hs'70, who has spent her career studying killers. Since her childhood Lewis has been driven by a desire to know what makes society's outcasts tick. Although her initial theories fell out-side what was then the psychiatric mainstream, her ideas have become accepted and evencited in Supreme Court decisions. Among those she has studied are serial killer Ted Bundy,John Lennon 's assassin Mark David Chapman and Washington sniper John Muhammad. In all violent offenders she has found three elements that add up to a recipe for violence.

Despite recent advances in molecular medicine, physicians are still in the darkabout many diseases, gleaning clues to a therapy's effectiveness only by study-ing changes in symptoms. Even as doc-tors seek the best treatment, patientsmay deteriorate. At Yale's new PositronEmission Tomography ( pet) Center, researchers hope to bring light intothis darkness by discovering noveldiagnostic tools for otherwise hiddenmolecular abnormalities and speedingdevelopment of new medications. petimaging , said George Mills, m.d., director of the Division of Medical Imaging and RadiopharmaceuticalDrug Products at the Food and DrugAdministration 's Center for DrugEvaluation and Research, is \"the essen-tial foundation \" of the agency's efforts to modernize the process of developingnew medicines. Mills spoke at theJanuary 18 opening ceremony for the new 22,000-square-foot facility,located at 801 Howard Avenue. petis a noninvasive nique that scans for minute amountsof radioactive material\u2014radiotracers\u2014that have been injected into a patient'sbody to bind to specic organ sites,providing images of molecular func-tion. Researchers and clinicians usethis information to study changes inorgan function as a result of disease or in response to treatment. The radiotracer can also label a drug todetermine whether and how much ofthe compound has reached its target. Labeling enables researchers to studythe safety and efcacy of different doselevels and identify biological markersof disease that can aid in diagnosis. \"The work we do here will build the knowledge we need to developdiagnostic imaging agents coupled totherapy,\" said J. James Frost, m.d., ph.d ., professor of diagnostic radiol- ogy and psychiatry, chief of nuclearmedicine at Yale-New Haven Hospi-tal and director of the petCenter. Joining Frost as co-directors are lead physicist Richard E. Carson, ph.d ., professor ph.d ., professor of diagnostic radiology.Completing the senior faculty team is Henry Huang, ph.d ., a radio- chemist and associate professor ofdiagnostic radiology. The development of the center was made possible, in part, by Pzer, thepharmaceutical company, which con-tributed $5 million to establish it andprovides $2 million annually to sup-port petimaging studies of mutual research interest to both parties. Mostresearch at the center will be supportedby federal grants. The company hasalready used the petfacilities to study a small group of patients to determinehow much of a new drug for depres-sion would be required to reach its tar-get in the brain, and how much wouldgenerate unacceptable side effects, saidDiane K. Jorkasky, m.d. , Pzer's vice president of clinical pharmacology. Researchers are usually required to give dosages that escalate over severalmonths to large numbers of patients toestablish the safest and most effective dose of a drug. \"If we are able to avoid the need to do large-scale clinical stud-ies like that, we'll be saving tons of money and time, and most impor-tant, we won 't expose patients need-lessly to a drug that may not have anybenet,\" said Jorkasky. Frost said the center will serve as a core facility for the entire School ofMedicine. Some biomarkers discoveredin the course of research projects with Pzer or other companies will beavailable for faculty research projects. Along with cardiology and oncol- ogy, other major areas of focus areAlzheimer's disease, schizophrenia,depression, obesity, post traumaticstress disorder and other conditionsthat are difcult to diagnose and treat.Frost hopes that the center's researchwill help to identify biomarkers forsubtypes of these diseases, which canhelp determine the best treatment for a given individual. \"Ultimately thiswill benet our patients,\" WortmanRobert Alpern, Diane Jorkasky, Richard Levin and Pfizer ceo Jeffrey Kindler cut the ribbon at a ceremony marking the opening of themedical school's new pet Center.terry dagradi5 Hands-on science program for local students brings town andgown together The students who were asked to iden- tify and explain the function of a muscle in the cadaver they've been workingwith in the School of Medicine's anato-my lab aren 't enrolled at Yale, but theycan take advantage of the school's offer-ings. They are high school students participating in the Anatomy TeachingProgram, one of several ways in whichthe medical school collaborates withHill Regional Career High School, a magnet school located just a stone'sthrow from campus. Ten years ago Yale formalized a partnership with Career High that hasenabled its students to benet from the university's expertise and resources.The magnet school attracts studentsfrom New Haven and its surroundingsuburbs who are interested in a careerin health, business or computer tech-nology. The partnership began infor-mally with the anatomy program in1993 and has expanded to include avariety of offerings. Yale students and faculty instruct and mentor Career High students in a number of settings. In the medicalcareers class, for example, Yale publichealth students come to Career Highto speak about medical career optionsduring the rst semester, while thehigh school students complete aninternship at Yale in the second semes-ter. The Department of Epidemiologyand Public Health donated a research-quality electron microscope to helpCareer students understand molecularstructures; it also recommended thetypes of equipment that would be mostappropriate for a certied nurse's aid room set up to look like a clinic. Anotherlearning opportunity is offered toadvanced biology students who come toYale twice a month after school withtheir teacher, Shirley Neighbors, to workwith medical students who help themwith course material. In the anatomy course, which is also taught by Neighbors, two classesmeet twice each month in Yale's anato-my lab, where rst- and second-yearmed students overseen by William B.Stewart, ph.d ., associate professor of surgery and chief of the Section ofAnatomy and Experimental Surgery,volunteer as instructors. In smallgroups, the students explore such topics as cardiovascular health, energymetabolism and infectious diseases.\"One of the ideas is that these kids willbecome community ambassadors forhealth,\" said Stewart. For the students,it's a rare opportunity to see rsthandthe effects of disease. \"We actually getto touch the [cadavers] and feel whatwe're looking for,\" said Career Highjunior Lorraine Gabriel. In the scholar (Science Collabora- tive for Hands-On Learning andResearch) program, a three-week sum-mer residential science program forstudents entering grades 10 through12, Career students have a chance tobecome fully immersed in campus life. They not only study science sub-jects at the college level and conductresearch under the supervision of Yale faculty, but they also get a taste ofcollege life by living in the dorms. Thestudents normally participate in the scholar program for three years. For Minerva Ruiz, who now works in the Family Support Services section ofthe Yale Child Study Center, the sum-mer program was an eye-opening expe-rience. Attending classes in whichprofessors treated her as a college stu-dent, conducting a study on the waysin which smoking affects the brainand tasting ethnic food at local restau-rants helped make her a more openperson, she said. \"We were able to go off to college and be comfortable with that.\" Like many of her classmates, Ruiz, who graduated from Florida Interna-tional University and plans on gettinga ph.d . in psychology, takes education seriously. More than 96 percent ofCareer graduates went to college in2005 (the college-bound rate for NewHaven students in general is 83 per-cent); for those who participate in the scholar program, the college atten- dance rate is 100 percent. The collaboration between Yale and Career High doesn 't benefit only thehigh school students, however. AsNeighbors watched second-year medstudent Rebecca Bruccoleri explainhow food is converted to energy, sheobserved, \"If they can find time to dothis as a med student, you can imaginewhat kind of doctors they'll be.\" \u2014 Jill Max First-year medical student Terri Huynh leads students from Hill Regional Career HIgh Schoolthrough an exploration of the human body in the Anatomy Teaching Program. joh n cu rtis6 chronicle Training physicians\u2014new ways of teaching in a changingmedical landscape For the past 32 years, Yale faculty from the Department of Internal Medicinehave taught at 10 hospitals throughoutConnecticut through the Yale AfliatedHospitals Program ( yahp) . Begun in 1975, yahp is currently the largest con- sortium of internal medicine trainingprograms in the United States. Its goalhas always been to improve the qualityof medical education throughout thestate. With 446 full-time faculty amongnine residency programs and more than6,500 attending physicians, the pro-gram trains more than 450 residents in internal medicine each year. It alsoprovides opportunities for collaborativeclinical and educational research as well as selected subspecialty clerkshipsat Yale for afliated medical residents.Each year 100 residents from other hospitals take electives at Yale-NewHaven Hospital. Member hospitalsinclude the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven, Bridgeport Hospital,Waterbury Hospital, GreenwichHospital, Norwalk Hospital, GrifnHospital in Derby, St. Mary's Hospitalin Waterbury, Danbury Hospital and Lawrence & Memorial Hospital in New London. \"This is a very robust relationship,\" said Silvio E. Inzucchi, m.d., profes- sor of medicine (endocrinology) anddirector of the program, speaking at yahp' s 30th annual symposium in November. \" After 30 years, the pro-gram is still evolving\u2014it is clearly ofmutual importance to both the depart-ment and our afliates.\" AsgharRastegar, m.d., professor of medicine (nephrology) and associate chair foracademic affairs, called it a \"uniquenetwork.\" Yale's collaboration withsmaller, community-based hospitals,he said, allows them to attract betterfaculty as well as trainees to their pro-grams, enhance training of their resi-dents and maintain academic linksthat serve as a resource. And, notedPeter N. Herbert, m.d. '67, hs '69, vice president and chief of staff at Yale-New Haven Hospital, a vigorouseducational program strengthens theoverall enterprise. \"Training programsare critically important to the retentionof our faculty,\" he said. But all is not well in the training of new doctors. More than a dozenspeakers cited new challenges to medi-cal education, not only in Connecticutbut also in other parts of the country.Among those challenges are youngdoctors' desires for a less stressful anddemanding lifestyle, lack of nancialsupport for education and the shrink-ing emphasis on the hospital as theprimary training setting. As Herbertnoted, patient contact typically takes up an hour or two of a resident's day,while another six to seven hours arespent \"doing largely clerical thingsthat, in a practice setting, would bedone by someone else.\" Dean Robert J. Alpern, m.d., Ensign Professor of Medicine cited inadequatefunding for education as a major prob-lem, observing that tuition covers onlyhalf the cost of a medical education.Clinical practice, which has traditionallybrought in money to ll that gap, isincreasingly under nancial pressureitself. \"The ability of the clinical practiceto subsidize education is going away,\"he said. \"You can 't run a medical schoolwithout a clinical practice, but what isoptimal for education is not necessarilyoptimal for clinical practice.\" Also of concern, said Jack A. Elias, m.d., the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Medicine and chair ofmedicine, is the aging of the physician-scientist population, whose uniqueperspective bridges the lab and thebedside. Ten years ago, he said, 57 per-cent of the physician-scientists whoreceived grants from the NationalInstitutes of Health were 45 or older.\"We are losing ground in this area at a time when translational research is blossoming.\" Panelists also cited the importance of mentorship for medical studentsand young doctors. Mary E. Tinetti, m.d., the Gladys Phillips Crofoot Pro- fessor of Medicine (geriatrics) and professor of epidemiology and publichealth, said that in the past students ofeither gender were linked with experi-enced older men, because the majorityof available mentors were men. Today,however, there are women who canmentor other women and members ofminority groups who can guide othersfrom their respective backgrounds\u2014even from afar\u2014because they are \"peo-ple who share many life experiences.\" Despite their concerns about the future of medical education, speakersalso noted cause for optimism inefforts to address the challenges. Eliascited a one-year master's program inpublic health at Yale that is geared topracticing physicians. Alpern said thatwhile the nancing of medical educa-tion is built on a shaky foundation,\"each school gures out a way to getaround it.\" And Rastegar, in an inter-view after the symposium, said that theeducation at Yale rests on a core beliefshared by faculty. \"Everyone feels that there are sig- nicant structural challenges we arefacing,\" said Rastegar. \" A great deal ofeducation depends on an environmentthat nurtures the trainees. Yale's powerhas always been that.\" \u2014 John Curtis andJohn Dillonyale medicine spring 20077 et cetera NEW GRANT FOR RICKETS STUDY Yale University has received a five-year, $5 million grant from the National Institute ofArthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Dis-eases to form a Center of Research Transla-tion ( cort ), one of four in the country, to provide models of translational research inacademic medical centers. The Yale cort will focus on X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( xlh ), the most common form of inherited rickets in the United States. xlh can lead to deformed bones, fractures and debilitating arthritis. The Yale Center for xlh, directed by Thomas O. Carpenter, m.d. , professor of pedi- atrics, and co-directed by Karl L. Insogna, m.d ., professor of medicine (endocrinology), has as its goals the identification and validationof mediators of skeletal disease in xlh and the development of therapeutics based onthis knowledge. The center will support aneducational program, a pilot projects pro-gram and three scientific studies, as well as a research core. \u2014 J.C. FOUR NAMED AAAS FELLOWS Four Yale faculty members have been elevat- ed to the rank of fellow by the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science. Arthur L. Horwich, m.d. , professor of genetics and pediatrics, was honored for con-tributions to the understanding of the roleof chaperonins in mediating protein folding. John R. Carlson, ph.d ., the Eugene Higgins Professor of Molecular, Cellular andDevelopmental Biology, was cited for contributions to the molecular neurobiologyof olfaction. Oswald J. Schmitz, ph.d ., the Oastler Professor of Population and CommunityEcology in the School of Forestry & Environ-mental Studies, was named a fellow for his contributions to the understanding theemergence and maintenance of ecosystemstructure and functioning, and for relatingecosystem patterns to individual behaviors. Kurt W. Zilm, ph.d ., professor of chem- istry and chemical engineering, was named a fellow for his applications of solid-state nmr spectroscopy to molecular structure and reaction mechanism determination. \u2014J.C.Two decades after its founding, immunobiologybecomes a department Ever since Edward Jenner injected a young English boy with cowpox virus inthe 1790s to prevent smallpox, scientistshave tried to conquer infectious diseasesby understanding and strengthening thehuman body's immune response. Yet asrecently as three decades ago, the mostbasic principles of modern immunologyeluded researchers. All that would change, however, when the medical school decided tocontinue the work of the late RichardGershon, m.d., who had established an immunology group within the pathol-ogy department. In 1988, a visionaryscientist was recruited to create one ofthe rst free-standing immunobiology sections in the world. Almost 20 years later, Richard A. Flavell, ph.d ., Sterling Professor of Immunobiology, remains chair, butin January the section became a full-fledged department in the School ofMedicine. The group that started out asa handful of scientists has grown toinclude 13 world-renowned researchers,whose publications appear regularly in top-ranked scientic journals. \"Westrategized about it and planned verycarefully what we wanted to build, andthat's what we built,\" said Flavell. Representative of the group's far- reaching influence is the discovery ofthe workings of the innate immunesystem in the 1990s. While mostresearchers focused on the adaptiveimmune system, which creates B andT cells that target specic bacterial or viral invaders, the late Charles A.Janeway Jr., m.d., wondered how these immune responders are able to act so effectively and precisely every timethe body is invaded by an infectiousmicrobe. In a scientic tour de force,he ph.d components of the innate systemknown as toll-like receptors provide the adaptive system with the necessaryadvance intelligence to do its job. \"It was like saying there are only four planets in the solar system andthen one day somebody comes alongand says no, there are eight,\" saidDavid G. Schatz, ph.d ., professor of immunobiology. Uncovering the role of toll-like recep- tors in the innate immune system is justone of the advances made by the depart-ment. Flavell's lab has identied mol-ecules that are involved in activating anddifferentiating T cells and that couldhave implications for hiv and cancer. Other areas of research are the simi- larities between allergens and microbesthat jump-start the immune get broken down and then\"presented\" by antigen-presenting cellsthat allow T cells to recognize them;proteins that are involved in antibodyproduction; and a protein that allows toll-like receptors to send signals and is involved in every inflammatory process. The explosive growth of knowledge coming from the department over the last two decades has increased theawareness that the clinical relevance of immunobiology goes far beyondprotection against disease. Immunemechanisms may lie at the root ofnumerous chronic diseases, includingcancer, congestive heart failure andAlzheimer's disease. \u2014 Jill Max Almost 20 years ago Richard Flavell created one of the first freestanding immunobiologysections in the world. Now it is a departmentat the School of Medicine. terry dagradiyale medicine spring 20078 rounds medicine and health at yale Medicare coverage leads to more screening With a change in federal policy, the number of early diagnoses of coloncancer has risen. The expansion of Medicare in 1998 to cover colonoscopies appears to have ledto both an increase in demand for thescreening procedure and a rise in early-stage colon cancer diagnoses, accordingto a study by Yale researchers. \"We found that after the Medicare policy change, the use of colonoscopieswent up and there was a correspondingincrease in the likelihood that patientswith colon cancer would be diagnosedat an early, curable stage,\" said leadinvestigator Cary P. Gross, m.d., associ- ate professor of medicine. His studybetween 1992 and 2002. They adjusted for such factors as the increasing aware-ness of colon cancer screening duringthe study period, given the high-proleefforts of TV anchorwoman Katie Couricto draw attention to the importance ofthe procedure with an on-air colonoscopyin March 2000. (Couric's husband haddied of colon cancer two years earlier.) Gross' team found that the new Medicare policies were associated with asubstantial increase in colonoscopy useamong beneciaries without cancer, aswell as an increased likelihood of earlydiagnosis for patients who developedcancer. Before Medicare started coveringthe screening procedure, 22.5 percent ofMedicare beneciaries who developedcolon cancer were diagnosed at an earlystage. After Medicare began providingcoverage for older at-risk patients, thatnumber rose to 25.5 percent. When cov-erage was expanded again, to include allMedicare recipients over 65, 26.3 per-cent of patients diagnosed with coloncancer were diagnosed at an early stage. \"Our analysis suggests that the new Medicare policy was associatedwith improved health by identifyingmore patients with early-stage disease,\"Gross said. But he was quick to addthat, despite these encouraging signs,nearly three-quarters of all patientsdiagnosed with colon cancer stillreceive the diagnosis after the diseasehas spread beyond the early stage.Although his study suggests that costhad been a barrier for some patients,Gross said it also showed that \"the new reimbursement policy was not a sufcient intervention to alter thedecision process about having acolonoscopy for many older people.\" Noting that colonoscopies can also prevent colon cancer by removingprecancerous lesions, Gross said thenext step is to assess the impact ofMedicare colonoscopy reimbursementon the incidence of colon cancer and to develop strategies to increase theuse of screening colonoscopies at thepopulation level. \u2014 Jennifer Kaylinappeared in the December 20 issue of JAMA : The Journal of the American Medical Association . In 1998 the Medicare reimburse- ment policy was changed to cover theprocedure, which costs roughly $800,for older patients with increased coloncancer risk. The policy was expandedagain in 2001 to cover colonoscopyscreenings for everyone 65 and older. As a general internist at the Primary Care Center at Yale-New Haven Hospital,Gross sees firsthand how reluctantpatients are to undergo a colonoscopy.\"I thought it was important to test the assumption that reimbursementhad been a major barrier to obtaining a colonoscopy,\" he said. The researchers studied patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare-linked database lasse sk arb\u00f6 vik9 et cetera HIGHER RISK FOR CARDIAC PATIENTS About a third of heart attack patients also have an active, noncardiac condition thatcould warrant admission to the hospital,Yale researchers reported in the American Journal of Medicine in October. And patients who have acute conditions such as stroke,kidney failure and pneumonia may havepoorer outcomes, according H. Lichtman, ., assist- ant professor of epidemiology. \"Relatively little is known about the care and outcomesof heart attack patients who arrive at thehospital with an additional, active noncar-diac condition. Lichtman and colleagues studied 1,145 patients with acute myocardial infarctionwho were discharged from Yale-New HavenHospital between January 1997 and June2000, and rated the additional noncardiacconditions in these patients by severity.Life-threatening conditions included activebleeding, major stroke, metastatic cancer,abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, acutepsychosis, major trauma and others. \"More research is needed to describe these complex patients to identify opportu-nities to improve their clinical management,\"said Lichtman. \u2014 John Curtis HIV SCREENING SHOULD BE ROUTINE Voluntary screening for hiv should be rou- tine for all adults, not just those at high risk, according to a study by Yale researchers . The team reports in the December 5 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine that rou- tine hiv screening is cost-effective, even in communities where as few as two in 1,000people have undiagnosed hiv infection. Early identification of hiv leads to better health outcomes and longer life expectan-cies in hiv-infected persons. The study provides strong support for the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionguidelines issued in September 2006 thatrecommend routine hiv screening of all per- sons age 13 to 64 in all health care settings. \"Early identification of hiv saves lives,\" said principal investigator A. David Paltiel, m.p.p.m., ph.d. , professor of public health and management sciences. \u2014J.C.After 10 years of research, a rare skin disease is traced to achemical used in mri s In 1997 investigators in California came across a mysterious skin disease.It often started with redness of the skin and warmth, but as it progressed,the skin swelled, tightened and turnedbrown, becoming almost \"woody.\" The unnamed disease led to disability,reduced mobility of the joints andcould be fatal. After almost 10 years of research, Shawn E. Cowper, m.d., assistant pro- fessor of dermatology and pathology,has provided additional evidence thatthe disorder affects a small number of patients with kidney disease whoundergo magnetic resonance imaging( mri) scans with contrast. The disease that he identied in 2001, with PhilipLeBoit, m.d., of the University of California, San Francisco, is now callednephrogenic systemic brosis ( nsf). Cowper started a registry of the diseasethat now numbers about 235 cases. At rst Cowper thought the disor- der affected only the skin. It turns outthat it is mediated by a cell involved in wound healing that was originallyidentied in 1992 by Richard Bucala, m.d., ph.d ., professor of medicine (rheumatology), pathology and epi-demiology (microbial diseases). While pondering its causes, Cowper noticed that most of the patients in his registry had undergone vascularimaging. Working with investigators in Bridgeport, Conn., he examined the records of 467 patients receiving dialysis. Three developed nsf follow- ing mri, and all three had received the contrast agent gadolinium. Another 84 patients received gadolinium but did not develop the disease. In March,Cowper published a study in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology , linking gadolinium to nsf, which occurs only in patients with advanced kidney disease. Based on Cowper's work and a Danish study, the Food and DrugAdministration issued a public healthadvisory last year warning of the dan-gers to kidney patients who receive acontrast-enhanced mri. \"What's really key now, and what everybody is excitedabout nding, is what makes these 3percent different than the other 97 per-cent who have renal failure and havebeen exposed to gadolinium withoutdeveloping nsf,\" said Cowper. Understanding the mechanism behind nsfmay explain why it occurs. In contrast agents, gadolinium is boundto a chelate, a molecule that keeps itfrom interacting with the body andallows it to be quickly eliminated by thekidneys. But patients with advanced kidney disease can 't efciently rid them-selves of such toxins as gadolinium,which may build up, dissociate from thechelate and do damage. Unfortunately, all contrast agents used for routine mris in the United States contain gadolinium. Kidneypatients who must undergo an mri with contrast are advised to undergo dialysis immediately afterward, but noone is certain that this will decreasethe chances of developing nsf. \"There are a lot of questions that need to beanswered before anyone declares thisdisease gone, or even this techniquesafe,\" said Cowper. \u2014 Jill Maxyale medicine spring 200710 findings from the bench A clear solution to a protein puzzle An enzyme's structure plus oil and water may yield a clue to Alzheimer's disease. Several years ago, when researchers discovered intramembrane proteases\u2014a class of hydrophilic enzymes thatseemed to work despite being sur-rounded by cells' oily membranes\u2014many scientists were perplexed. Somewere downright skeptical. After all, oil and water don 't mix. Ya Ha, ph.d ., assistant professor of pharmacology, and colleagues mayhave revealed the intramembrane pro-teases' recipe for success with theirpublication in October in the journal Nature of the protein 's structure. In addition to providing a solution to aslippery biological mystery, Ha's workcould shed light on the mechanismsunderlying Alzheimer's disease. The chewing up of proteins, a pro- cess known as proteolysis, is the job of proteases. But protein-splittingreactions require water, not normallyfound in the greasy interior of cellmembranes. In 1997, Nobel laureatesJoseph L. Goldstein, ph.d ., and Michael S. Brown, ph.d ., suggested in an article in Cell that a protease involved in regulating cholesterolsomehow did its work within the cellmembrane. This protease must be\"unusual,\" they acknowledged, butthey proposed that gamma-secretase,the enzyme that cleaves amyloid protein into the toxic fragments seen in the brains of Alzheimer'spatients, might also operate in thesame manner.When he came to the School of Medicine from Harvard University veyears ago, structural biologist Ha wasconvinced that gaining structural infor-mation through X-ray crystallographywas the key to understanding intra-membrane proteases. He started withgamma-secretase. But despite his bestefforts, it could not be coaxed intoforming crystals, the rst step in deter-mining a protein 's molecular structureby X-ray crystallography. When a family of bacterial enzymes with similar activity known as rhom-boid proteins was discovered in 2001,Ha seized on those as an alternative.Over the next four years, Ha workedwith , and Yingjiu Zhang, ph.d. to obtain the rst X-ray data of the rhomboidenzyme molecules and created a visu-alization of the structure. At last, they saw how an intramem- brane enzyme is built: in the middle of a sea of fat, the rhomboid proteasecreates a protective bubble to shelterwater molecules (whose source isunknown; they may come from a sur-rounding aqueous solution) in itsactive site. The enzyme is serpentine,crisscrossing the cell membrane sixtimes. Five of these segments bundletogether to create a water-lled cham-ber within the membrane. However improbable this enzyme's mechanics, they are medically impor-tant because the enzyme belongs to thefamily that includes human gamma-secretase. \"Compounds that inhibit theproduction of toxic amyloid peptidesare now believed to be one of the mostpromising approaches to the develop-ment of drugs for Alzheimer's dis-ease,\" says Vincent T. Marchesi, m.d. ,ph.d. , the Anthony N. Brady Professor of Pathology and an expert on both mem-brane protein structure and Alzheimer'sdisease. \"Ha's ndings are an importantcontribution to this effort.\" Ha says that the rhomboid pro- tease is a good model system forintramembrane proteases in general,but he confesses that he still has hiseye on gamma-secretase. \"I wouldlove to see it,\" he says. While the twoenzymes are not related by their pro-tein sequence or by evolution, Habelieves that they share common fea-tures because they face the same challenge of mixing water with oil.\"Once you have a few structures,you'll see a pattern start to emerge,\"Ha explains. \"That will give us a bet-ter understanding of how inhibitorsmight work. And then maybe we candesign better inhibitors, and maybethose inhibitors can be used as drugs.\" \u2014 Pat McCaffrey Structural biologist Ya Ha produced this image of a hydrophilic enzyme that functions in a cell'soily, and hydrophobic, membrane. ya ha11 et cetera Yale scientist finds two genetic anomalies linked tomacular degeneration In late 2004, Josephine J. Hoh, ph.d ., associate professor of epidemiologyand of ophthalmology and visual sci-ence, used new dna chip technology to identify a gene for age-related maculardegeneration ( amd polymorphism ( snp)\u2014 in this case a variant in the codingregion of complement factor H ( cfh) gene on chromosome 1\u2014that is linked to an increased risk of developing bothwet and dry forms of amd . Now, in ndings published in the journal Science in October, Hoh has reported nding an independent snp in a section of chromosome 10that regulates the htra 1gene. The variant appears to increase the expression ofthe protein htra 1in the eyes of homo- zygotes, and people carrying twocopies of the risk allele have a muchhigher risk of wet amd . \"We found that patients with the htra 1snp in both chromosomes were 10 times more likely to have wet amd than those who have it in just one chromosome or no snp,\" said Hoh. \"This may point to possible directionsfor effective treatment of wet amd .\" amd causes light-sensitive cells in the retina to break down, resulting inprogressive loss of central vision. Ofthe two forms of amd , the dry form is more common than the wet form. Wetmacular degeneration can lead rapidlyto blindness, while the dry form of amd progresses more slowly. The discovery marks the rst time that a cross-ethnic approach was used toefciently decipher a complex diseasesuch as amd . Hoh exploited differences in the progression of amd in Caucasian and Chinese patients. In Caucasians,the proliferation of abnormal blood ves-sels is compounded by the developmentof large waste deposits called drusen.Chinese patients, she said, develop littleor no drusen and progress directly towet amd . Using dna samples from Chinese patients with amd, Hoh discovered the disease-causing variant in the controlsection of the htra 1gene. She then hypothesized that this same geneticvariant causes wet amd in Caucasians. \"Finding a gold mine is very much easier if you have a good map showingwhere to dig. The discovery in theHong Kong Chinese samples gave methe map,\" she said. The conrmation of her hypo-thesis that the htra 1vari- ant causes wet amd in Caucasians was done in collaboration with Kang Zhang, m.d., ph.d ., of the University of Utah School of Medicine. These studies demonstrate that each of these two major genes , cfh and htra 1, affects the risk for a distinct component of the amd phenotype: cfh influences the production of drusen associated with dry amd , whereas htra 1influences blood vessel develop- ment, the hallmark of the wet diseasetype. When the two processes are com-bined, they lead to the composite char-acteristics seen in some cases of amd . \"The marker variant we have identi- ed in htra 1is very much associated with amd , but function of the gene that causes wet amd is unknown. We need to conduct further functionalstudies in order to understand the bio-logical mechanisms,\" said Hoh. \u2014 Robin OrwantCANCER MUTATIONS COMMON Cancer gene mutations are found in about 1 percent of the general population, morefrequently than previously thought, accord-ing to Yale researchers. The study published in the December 6 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked for the presence and rate of brca 1 and brca 2 mutations in women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Those muta-tions have been linked to elevated lifetimerisks for breast, ovarian and other cancers. The scientists screened for the most common mutations as well as rare or hard-to-distinguish variants. They then calcu-lated the incidence of those variants in thegeneral population and in individuals withfamily members who have had cancer.The Yale team found that the lifetime risk to age 80 is not the same for all mutations. \"The exact nature of the level of risk for the particular mutations needs to be furtherexplored,\" said lead researcher Harvey A.Risch, m.d., ph.d ., professor of epidemiology. \"This study is an important first step in that direction.\" \u2014 John Curtis A GENE FOR NICOTINE ADDICTION The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1 billion people smoke worldwide, and that smoking causes nearly 5 million premature deaths every year.Growing scientific evidence suggests agenetic link to nicotine addiction. In findings published in the January issue of Biological Psychiatry , Joel E. Gelernter, m.d ., professor of psychiatry, genetics and neurobiology, and colleagues reported on the risk of nicotine dependence in 634 smallnuclear families with members who werealso dependent on cocaine or opioids. In 507 of the African-American or European-American families, at least two memberswere nicotine-dependent. The researchersidentified one significant genome-wide linkage on chromosome 5 for the African-Americans and a strong linkage on chromo-some 7 for the European-Americans.\"Thesedata add to the growing evidence for spe-cific locations for genes that influence riskfor nicotine dependence,\" said Gelernter. \u2014 Amy Chow 12 books &ideas bookshelfyale medicine spring 2007 Bookshelf focuses on books and authors at the School of Medicine.

Chen, m.d. ,hs'98, often recalls the words of the late Yale surgeon C. Elton Cahow, m.d. She once heard him remonstrate with an exhausted resident for thinking he could head home without checking on a certain patient. \"Once you put your hands on a patient,\" Cahow said, \"they're yours.\" Chen liked to think she was keeping close watch over all her patients. But something was still wrong: \" As early asinternship,\" she said, \"when patients were dying, I found itdifcult to go into their rooms, to talk to their families, todiscuss their diagnoses and prognoses.\" She even shunned a dear friend with terminal cancer. And her fellow physicians generally shared her anxiety about death. \"We're all susceptible to this,\" she said in a recent telephone interview from her home near Boston.\"Dying is frightening.\" This fundamental human anxiety, she said, is ratied by medicine's \"hidden curriculum.\" When a patient's death was imminent, Chen often saw attending physicians closethe curtain around the patient and the grieving family, andthen depart. Chen did the same. \"We thought that familymembers wanted to be alone at the end,\" she recalls. \"Itnever occurred to most of us that the actual process mightbe frightening, and that we could alleviate that fear by beingpresent. And perhaps too, some of us\u2014I include myselfhere\u2014did not have the insight to realize that we were alsoleaving them alone because it was easier for us to stay awayfrom the dying altogether.\" \"This deeply rooted angst about death,\" she later wrote, was being passed on by doctors from one generation to thenext \"like some tragic hereditary disease.\" Chen said that physicians recognize their limitations. Almost half the oncologists in one study described them-selves as only \"poor\" or \"fair\" at breaking bad news. Chenherself abandoned a favorite patient to painful and futile end-of-life care because she could not bear to see him diminished by his cancer. In the idiom of her Taiwanese heritage, the young man became a wan ong kuei , a restless soul who haunted her. Five years ago, pregnant with twins, she took time off from her work as a transplant surgeon at ucla to care for her daughters and write about the ways in which physicianscope with death. Her book, Final Exam: A Surgeon 's Reflections on Mortality, was published by Alfred E. Knopf in January. Chen begins Final Exam at the moment when she unveils the cadaver that she will dissect as a medical student.Through anecdotes from medical school at Northwesternand residency at Yale, she traces her growing awareness ofthe extent to which doctors deny death, and tells of themoment midway through residency when an attending sur-geon provided a better model. The surgeon closed the bedcurtain around a dying patient but did not leave. He remainedinside the curtain, sitting with the patient and family dur-ing the nal hour of the patient's life. \"It was a major turn-ing point,\" Chen recalls. \"I realized that I could do morethan just cure. I could be there for my patients and theirfamilies.\" She might offer what the medical anthropologistArthur Kleinman, m.d. , calls \"empathic witnessing.\" \"My greatest hope for the book,\" she said, \"is to get peo- ple to talk about the issue and to share their anxieties.\"Although she recognizes that complex cultural, psychologi-cal and institutional forces determine how we cope withdeath, \"the more awareness there is, the greater the chancethat we'll improve end-of-life care for all of us.\" Chen now works full-time as a writer, lecturer and con- sultant.

Jamieson, m.d. ,ph.d ., professor of cell biology, knew that he had a piece of history in his closet: lantern slidesmade by the pioneering cell biologist George E. Palade, m.d., and colleagues. Those images of cells seen through the elec- tron microscope had laid the groundwork for Palade's 1974Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. \"Palade and his peo-ple really formulated, invented and provided the informa-tion that started the eld of cell biology in the 1940s,\" saidJamieson, who did his doctoral work at Rockefeller Univer-sity with Palade and came with him to Yale. Jamieson knew that his mentor, who was at Yale from 1973 until 1990, wanted the images to be available to studentsand scientists around the world. And so Jamieson cleanedthe 3.25- by 4-inch glass slides, which Palade left at Yale.Jamieson then digitally scanned 191 slides. Arthur R. Belanger, m.s., project manager of academic media and technology, indexed the slides and placed them on the website of theCushing/Whitney Medical Library. The Palade slides are among several digitized collec- tions now available on the website. Other collections includeengravings of historic gures and oil portraits of Chinesepatients with tumors and other deformities from the mid-19th century .The digital collection will expand, said Daniel M. Dollar, m.l.s ., associate director of collection development. Palade's slides helped biologists to relate what they were learning about cell morphology through the electronmicroscope with what was being discovered about cellularbiochemistry through cell fractionation, the process of sepa-rating a cell into its distinct parts with a centrifuge. This holistic understanding of cell function and struc- ture provides the foundation for contemporary understand-ing of disease processes, because, Jamieson said, \"you needto know what's going on in the normal cell before you beginto gure out what's going on in the diseased cell.\" The Medical Digital Library can be accessed at http:// www. med.yale.edu/library/subjects/digital.html.

'76,hs'79, professor of medicine and of epidemiology and public health,and director of the Yale Occupa-tional and Environmental Medi-cine Program at the School ofMedicine, used a photograph toframe a lecture in March at theSchool of Forestry & Environ-mental Studies. Do children inthat house face health risksbecause of toxins from factoriesand lead from peeling paint orbecause they live in an over-crowded, high-crime neighbor-hood with a crummy school andno recreational facilities? Environmental epidemiolo- gists focus on the physical environment, while social epi-demiologists look at patterns of psychological and social stress.Both inquiries, Cullen said, aretoo narrow. \"Neither their agendasin tandem,\" because that's theonly way to get a full under-standing of a population's healthstatus. That knowledge can leadto the creation of such initiativesas more recreational space onthe street or tougher air pollu-tion standards, which will betteraddress health issues. \u2014Jennifer KaylinROBERT STICKGOLD Is sleep no more than a cure for sleepiness? In 1989, when scientists kept rats from sleeping, the ratsstarted to die by the 11th day.By the 32nd day, they were alldead. \"We are still as towhy the rats died,\" said RobertStickgold, ph.d ., associate pro- fessor of psychiatry at HarvardMedical School and an expert onsleep, speaking at internal medi-cine grand rounds in November.\"It happens in rats,\" he con-tinued. \"It happens in humans.\" For 2,000 years we have understood other basic drives,such as hunger and sex, he said,but the need for sleep remains a mystery. Among early candi-dates for its apparent benefits,said Stickgold, were restorationand recovery, energy conserva-tion and you try toparse those out,\" Stickgold said,\"none of those make sense. Youend up back at the point thatsleep is to cure sleepiness.\" Yet more recent studies have confirmed that a good night'ssleep confers numerous bene-fits. Without it, the immune sys-tem produces fewer antibodiesto fight infection. And it is dur-ing sleep that the brain consoli-dates the day's memories andlearning. \"It does matter how much sleep you get,\" Stickgold said. \u2014J.C.MICHAEL LEVY Physician-assisted suicide is the wrong solution At a time when life is devalued, when people are killed overnecklaces or iPods, physician-assisted suicide ill serves patients,physicians and society, saidMichael H.

Dowe really need to kill the patientto kill the pain?\" Levy said physician-assisted suicide violates key tenets of medical ethics; erodes trustin health professionals; anddiminishes what he called \"themiracle of life.\" It also denies apatient's loved ones the chanceto provide care at the end of life. If legitimized, he said, itcould force doctors to provide a service they oppose. And, hecontinued, it could stifle thesearch for alternate ways torelieve suffering. \"I think the risk to society far outweighs the benefits,\"Levy said. \u2014John CurtisSHERWIN NULAND The teachings of Maimonides and a moral imperative The 12th-century physician Maimonides, who lived in Spainand Egypt, achieved fame as arabbi and philosopher yet helpedto establish a moral imperativethat guides medicine to this day:the obligation to make everyeffort to heal the patient. Although best known for his Guide for the Perplexed, which proposed ways to reconcile reli-gion and science, the scholar also proposed an alternative tothe prevailing Christian view of a doctor's role, said Sherwin B.Nuland, m.d . '55,hs'61, clinical professor of surgery and authorof a biography of Maimonides.In a December talk, Nuland toldmembers of the InterdisciplinaryCenter for Bioethics that Mai-monides saw medical care notas a prayer but as \"somethingphysical that needs to be done.\"Healing remained linked to faith,nonetheless, because renewedhealth would allow the patientto resume his study of God. As a physician, Maimonides believed that \"you are to makeany sacrifice other than anotherhuman life to save someone youcan possibly save,\" Nuland said.\"There is no credit to be given toa physician for doing his work.It is an obligation.\" \u2014C.S. 16 capsuleyale medicine spring 2007When police raided a Trumbull Street clinic on November 10, 1961, it cameas no surprise. The Planned Parent-hood League of Connecticut ( pplc ) had opened the clinic days earlier to offerbirth control counseling and to pre-scribe contraceptives\u2014deliberate viola-tions of an 1879 statute prohibiting theuse of \"any drug, medicinal article orinstrument for the purpose of prevent-ing conception.\" Estelle Griswold, the feisty execu- tive director pplc , and C. Lee Buxton, m.d. , the medical director of the clinic and chair of the Departmentof Obstetrics and Gynecology at theSchool of Medicine, were arrested,convicted and ned $100 each. The pplc had spent decades lobbying the Connecticut General Assembly torepeal or amend the statute, one of the \"Comstock laws\" promoted by anti-obscenity crusader AnthonyComstock in the late 19th century. For 21 years the pplc had operated only as a transport service, shuttlingpatients to clinics in Rhode Island andNew York, where contraception waslegal. In Connecticut married womenwith private physicians could oftenobtain birth control information anddevices, but poor women, or womenwithout connections, could not. Twoprevious attempts to challenge thestatute, in 1943 and 1961, had beendismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court, in the first case because the doctorinvolved lacked standing to sue onbehalf of patients, and in the secondcase, also involving Buxton, becausethe plaintiffs had not been threatenedwith prosecution. Police charged Griswold and Buxton with aiding and abetting thecommission of a crime\u2014anyone who prescribed and advised womenabout contraceptives was as culpable as the women who used them.

Their case reached the U.S. Supreme Courtand opened the door to the acceptance of contraception. By Lori Ann Brass17 across the country,\" said Susan Lloyd Yolen, vice president of public affairsand communication for PlannedParenthood of Connecticut. \"The birthcontrol pill came out in 1960, butConnecticut was a holdout on birthcontrol at that point.\" In 1965 the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Thomas Emerson, j.d., dean of the Yale Law School, and Catherine Roraback, j.d. '48, repre- sented the pplc . On 1965, the court ruled 7-2 that the Connecticutlaw violated the constitutional right tomarital privacy. \"It paved the way for the nearly unanimous acceptanceof contraception that now exists in this country,\" said Yolen. \"The ruling meant the police had no right to raid your house to look for contraception,\" said Gary L. Gross, m.d. '65, hs'70, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and the medi-cal director of federally funded familyplanning clinics in Boston. Gross, whoworked with Buxton as a student andresident , said that Buxton believed in women 's rights, the importance of con-traception for all women and providinggood health care free from interference. After Griswold , the pplc opened clinics throughout the state, physiciansno longer feared arrest for dispensingcontraception. It meant, said Gross,that people could decide the numberand spacing of their children. Griswold also laid the groundwork for later reproductive-rights deci-sions. In its 1972 decision in Eisenstadt v. Baird, the U.S. Supreme Court The fight to legalize birth control had a long history in Connecticut. In 1941 supporters of birth control took a lunch break during a legislative hearing in Hartford.extended the right to privacy to indi- viduals, effectively legalizing birthcontrol for unmarried women, saidGross.

By Jennifer Kaylin Photographs by Frank Poole High-fidelity human patient simulators, such as Sim-Man atright, talk, breathe and can even\"die.\" The computerized and programmable polymer figurescan simulate just about any condition in the human body.Their vital signs can change tocreate medical emergencies that allow students to practiceprocedures such as intubationand order X-rays or CT scans.A new curriculum, which beganthis year, requires third-yearmedical students to participatein 24 scenarios over a 12-weeksurgery clerkship.19 n a conference room down the hall from his ofce, Frederick D. Haeseler, m.d., is talk- ing to three visitors about a patient named Noah Savage. \"Noah was short of breath when he exerted himself, so he stopped taking his daily walks. After his feet began toswell, he was given a prescription for a diuretic called Lasix,and the symptoms got better,\" Haeseler says. \"But then an echocardiogram revealed that he had severe idiopathicdilated cardiomyopathy, an uncommon, but not rare, heartcondition. In this case it's progressive. Medication can helprelieve symptoms, but ultimately Noah would need a hearttransplant to survive.\" If Noah, an attractive middle-aged man with a ruddy complexion and bright eyes, appeared remarkably relaxedgiven the seriousness of his diagnosis, it was for good reason.He doesn 't really have a life-threatening heart condition\u2014he's a character being portrayed by an actor named JeffSavage. The three visitors Haeseler was addressing are otheractors preparing to begin work at the School of Medicine as standardized patients\u2014actors trained to assume the livesand symptoms of patients in order to help students take medical histories, conduct physical examinations and hone the interpersonal skills necessary to be effective physicians. Training through simulation\u2014whether by such stand- ardized patients as Savage, by mannequins or by virtualcomputer technology\u2014has become an increasingly acceptedmethodology in medical education. Medical schools, includ-ing Yale, are devoting signicant resources to exposing stu-dents to these training opportunities. In addition to Haeseler'sprogram, Yale now has an array of human-patient simula-tors, or mannequins, for students to \"treat,\" as well as a simulation laboratory equipped with computers that allowstudents to practice everything from suturing techniques to performing a colonoscopy. Instructors say these simulation tools are useful for both teaching and assessment. Students can practice andmake mistakes without harming real patients; these toolscan simulate unusual cases students wouldn 't often see inpractice; and the tools are ideal for comparative evaluationsof clinical skills, because each student faces an identical set of patient challenges. The use of actors is the oldest of these patient- simulation techniques. Yale's program, which was launchedin 1993 with eight actors, was part of the primary care clerkship. The early response from students was resound- ingly positive, says Haeseler, associate clinical professor of medicine and director of the Yale Standardized PatientProgram. \"Their only complaint was that it wasn 't offereduntil the fourth year.\" Today, students begin working withstandardized patients in the second or third week of medi-cal school in the longitudinal communication skills programdirected by Auguste H. Fortin VI, m.d., m.p.h. , associate professor of medicine, and taught by a multidisciplinary fac-ulty. Haeseler has trained 30 actors and written 75 scriptsthat represent a range of medical disorders and psychosocialissues. All are designed for the small-group workshops with standardized patients that occur throughout the four-year medical curriculum. In their rst year students learnbasic interview skills and advance to more challenging interactions in subsequent years. Savage, who's been involved for about a year, is a 1961 Yale College alumnus, antiques dealer and professional actorwho most recently appeared in Our Town at the Thomaston Opera House in Thomaston, Conn. He has played the samepatient about a dozen times, his medical condition growingincreasingly dire with each performance. On the day Haeselerdescribed Noah Savage's illness to the other actors, theywere preparing for a workshop on breaking bad news. Thisscenario required Savage to tackle his most challengingmedical school role to date\u2014getting the news that he needsa heart transplant. \"Breaking bad news is one of the most challenging things physicians need to do. It is important for students tolearn a structured, patient-centered approach that they canpractice without causing discomfort for themselves or theirpatients,\" says Haeseler. The rehearsal began with Haeseler role-playing a stu- dent. Following the model for breaking bad news that Fortinintroduces to students just before their sessions with theactors, Haeseler asked Noah some general questions abouthow he was feeling and what he knew about his illness. Speaking in a slow soothing voice, he gently told Noah that his heart muscle had weakened and that he would likelyneed a heart transplant to survive. The news hardly seemed toregister. \"I've heard of those,\" Noah said quietly, \"but I neverthought it would be something I'd ever need.\" He appeareddazed, as though he needed to go home, talk with his familyand think things through before expressing his feelings.Iyale medicine spring 200720 Afterward, Haeseler said Savage's reaction would provide stu- dents with an opportunity to listen, respond empathically toemotion and offer continuing support. The use of standardized patients, also known as simu- lated patients, programmed patients, surrogate patients, pro-fessional patients and patient instructors, has proven to besuch an effective tool for teaching and assessing medical stu-dents that the United States Medical Licensing Examination( usmle ) has added a clinical-skills assessment that includes standardized patients. The technique has become so widelyaccepted that now almost every medical school in the coun-try uses it. This acceptance could hardly have been predicted, given the early reaction to bringing actors into the classroom.In the early 1960s, when the technique was introduced byHoward S. Barrows, m.d., it was dismissed as maligning the dignity of medical education and being too \"Hollywood.\"Barrows, a neurologist at Monteore Hospital in the Bronx,N.Y ., stumbled onto the technique inadvertently. He used toenlist patients on his floor to be examined by students. Oneday a patient told him that a student had been so unpleasantto him that in order to get back at the offending student, thepatient began inventing symptoms. The incident led to anepiphany for Barrows: why not recruit healthy people to act as patients? Real patients wouldn 't be inconvenienced by gruff or incompetent students; students could be exposed touncommon clinical events; and it would be an ideal assess-ment tool, because every student would get the same case. Barrows' timing was fortuitous. At around the same time, medical schools were looking for more precise and lessarbitrary ways to evaluate students during their clerkships.Until then students generally received satisfactory or betterevaluations, because faculty members almost never directlyobserved them interacting with patients. The first standardized patient was developed by Barrows when he was at the University of Southern California.An artist's model played a patient named Patty Dugger, a paraplegic woman with multiple sclerosis. After creating thecase, Barrows needed to gure out a way to assess students'interactions with her. Rather than using a one-way mirror or peeking through a curtain, he decided to give the actress achecklist to ll out after each encounter. Haeseler trains the actors to respond to students' open-ended questions, reflections, summaries and empathicstatements that they learn from Fortin 's introductory demon-strations. \"Facilitative behaviors such as these build trustthat in turn helps patients to express themselves and tell amore complete story of illness that includes biological, personal and emotional dimensions,\" Haeseler says. Characters are developed using many sources, includ- ing literature, the actors' own life experiences and real cases.During a standardized-patient encounter, a student is observedby one faculty member and two other students. What enhancesthe educational value, Haeseler says, is that students may call a time-out at any time during the session and freeze theaction. This option gives the student a chance to get feed-back and advice, or to get some expert information that mightbe helpful. \"Everyone has a memory of a doctor who didn 't seem to care or who didn 't explain things well,\" says Savage,adding that through his work as a standardized patient, hefeels he's \"helping future doctors acquire skills that areextraordinarily important.\" A mannequin with human ailments Elsewhere on campus, simulated patients of a different sort are being used to help students master other important skills.Last June, Leigh V. Evans, m.d., hs'02, director of health care simulation for the Section of Emergency Medicine in theDepartment of Surgery, launched a program using high-delityhuman patient simulators for third-year medical students during their surgery rotations. The lifelike polymer gures arecomputerized and programmable, so they can simulate justabout any condition that occurs in the human body. The simulators can talk and breathe, their vital signs can change and they can even \"die,\" although Evans, anassistant professor in the Section of Emergency Medicine,says she's never made a simulator do that because she wor-ries it would be too traumatic for the students. The majoradvantage a simulator has over actors is that you can create a medical emergency or practice such procedures as intuba-tion that you wouldn 't perform on a real person. During a recent session, a white male mannequin lay on an examining table surrounded by six students. Evans,who watched through a one-way mirror, used a microphoneand a computer to alter the patient's vital signs and talk tothe students, either as the patient or as an expert consultant.This type of simulation has advanced signicantly, thanks to the work of anesthesiologist David M. Gaba, m.d. '80, at Stanford University. A researcher committed to rening simulator-based teaching techniques, he and his colleagueshave developed a program that creates lifelike situations inclinical settings. Gaba's program has been adopted at Yale,Harvard, Penn State, the University of California, SanFrancisco, and abroad. [See \" A Safer OR,\" Yale Medicine , Summer 2003.] The \"patient\" in Evans' class was a 47-year-old man with severe abdominal pain and bloating. The students' jobwas to gure out what was wrong with him and prescribe a course of treatment. As they began asking him questions,he complained of feeling nauseated; then he vomited. Whenhe told the students that he still felt \"horrible,\" they decidedto insert a nasogastric tube. The students then ordered X-rays, which showed that the patient had a large bowel obstruction. When Evans,assuming the role of a consultant, asked what the rectalSimulated cases, real skills21 exam had revealed, the students realized they'd forgotten to perform one. A CT scan nally revealed the problem: sig-moid volvulus\u2014a twist in the colon that caused everythingmoving through it to back up. Although this condition can sometimes be treated with a rectal decompression, thepatient had already had two similar episodes, so surgery was recommended this time. Simulators can cost between $40,000 and $200,000, says Evans, depending on the sophistication of the software.The current curriculum, which requires third-year studentsto participate in 24 scenarios over a 12-week block, beganthis academic year. \"We're not dependent on what comes through the door, and students can treat much sicker 'patients,'\" saysEvans. The simulators are ideal for clinical decision mak-ing and developing teamwork skills, she says, but are less effective for teaching physical diagnostic skills, becauseregardless of the sophistication of their computer programs,they're still just plastic dolls. Evans' students work in groups of six, with a faculty member overseeing the session. During the exercise, partici-pants can call a consultant, talk to a surgeon, order X-rays orrequest any service that would be available during an emer-gency. The simulations are videotaped so that participantscan review their performances afterward. The Department ofPediatrics now has an infant mannequin, and the Yale NewHaven Center for Emergency Preparedness and DisasterResponse is also using mannequins to teach students. Thenext step, says Evans, is to set up a simulation center with asimulated operating room, an intensive care unit, a traumabed and other hospital settings. \"It's helpful to be able to see serious cases, unstable cases, and think through everything on your own,\" saysKathryn Hogan, m.d., a third-year resident in emergency medicine who led the group that treated the patient with sig-moid volvulus. She says that during the rst few scenarios in which she participated, she and the group forgot to askkey questions as they tried to diagnose the patients. But shesays they've gotten better. \"When you learn by doing, youlearn fast because it feels like you're treating a real patient.It's very dynamic.\" \"See one, do one, teach one\"\u2014virtually Another variation on the simulated-patient model\u2014the computer simulator\u2014is now in wide use at the surgical simulation laboratory run by Andrew Duffy, m.d., assistant professor of surgery, director of the surgical simulation cen-ter and assistant program director of the surgical residency. Launched last March, the surgical simulation center resembles a video arcade without all the flashing lights and electronic noises. Several box trainers designed to helpstudents with such skills as performing endoscopic proce-dures, manipulating remote instruments, developing spatial During her acting career Kris Montgomery had the starring rolein Evita in national and interna- tional touring companies and performed Off Broadway and inmotion pictures with HarrisonFord, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.As a standardized patient at theSchool of Medicine she plays the role of a Manhattan execu-tive whose hip problems stemfrom a high-stress job. Duringinterviews with medical students,she drops clues to her physical and psychological states, hopingthey'll respond with appropri-ate questions.yale medicine spring 200722 Last March the surgical simulation center opened at the medicalschool, with computer simulatorsthat allow students and resi-dents to master such skills as per-forming endoscopic procedures,manipulating remote spatial relationships,hand-eye coordination and Duffy, assistant pro-fessor of surgery, director of thesurgical simulation center andassistant program director of thesurgical residency, demonstrateson a simulator that can replicateboth the inside of an abdomenand a full colonoscopy procedure.\"You can watch yourself zippingaround the colon on the videoscreen. The machine even groans if you've hurt the patient,\" Duffysays. About 100 surgical, ortho-paedic and ob/gyn students and residents use the lab on a regular basis.Simulated cases, real skills23 relationships, hand-eye coordination and suturing are located in a suite of rooms near Yale-New Haven Hospital, so that residents can stop in and practice in between their duties atthe hospital. One trainer replicates the inside of an abdomen. Another is a full colonoscopy procedure simulator. \"Youcan watch yourself zipping around the colon on the video screen. The machine even groans if you've hurt thepatient,\" Duffy says. The surgical simulation laboratory grew out of the need to teach students and residents more skills in less time. \"With an 80-hour limit imposed on surgical residents' train-ing, and so many new laparoscopic procedures, residents haveto learn twice as much in 20 percent less time,\" Duffy says. About 100 surgical, orthopaedic and ob/gyn students and residents use the lab on a regular basis. The machines,which came into use in medical schools about ve years ago, are now so popular that some of the hand pieces haveworn out. \"These machines are essential tools,\" Duffy says.He says the next generation of simulators, which are now in development, will include gall bladder and hernia models. Duffy contrasts this type of training with his own, when the mantra was \"see one, do one, teach one\" and themain way in which residents honed their skills was byobserving experienced doctors at work. \"I vividly rememberhow bad I was and how quickly the surgeon took over,\" he says. \"We want students to learn and practice on ourmachines, so that when the time comes to treat real patients,they'll already be proficient.\" In fact, all residents are now required to complete this training before they assist in laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures on patients. For laparoscopic surgeons, simulators help them learn how to manipulate instruments in a three-dimensional space while looking at a two-dimensional screen. \"Dissec-tion combined with computers helps surgeons look at twodimensions, but 'see' in three,\" says Lawrence J. Rizzolo, ph.d ., associate professor of surgery and of ophthalmology and visual science, and director of medical studies in theanatomy section in the Department of Surgery. Computer software and patient narratives also help build a clinical correlation between patients and the study ofanatomy by transforming the cadaver into a simulated patient.All course activities become centered on clinical problems and procedures. \"The software allows us to see internal organsand rotate the images,\" Rizzolo says. \"In our dissection lab,there's a computer at every table. The idea is to make it so thesoftware can 't be used without the cadaver and the cadavercan 't be used without a computer,\" says Rizzolo. Assessing clinical skills Although it's accepted that clinical skills are central to the practice of medicine, prior to the introduction of standard-ized patients into the usmle there was no national approachfor objectively evaluating students' competency in clinical skills. \"It was always pointed to as a gap in the medicallicensing program,\" says Gerard F. Dillon, ph.d ., associate vice president for the usmle at the National Board of Medical Examiners. That gap was lled in 2004 when stand-ardized patients were introduced as part of the usmle system. \"To introduce it into the examination program was an enormous step forward,\" he added. With this new assessment tool, examiners have been better able to identify students who are decient in clinicalskills. These students, who previously might have flownbeneath the radar, now get feedback, and their schools arenotied so that they can get help to remedy the deciency.The other benet, Dillon says, is that since the usmle has begun assessing clinical skills, medical schools have putmore emphasis on teaching these skills and ensuring thatstudents have mastered them. As the usmle assessment program develops, the hope is that it will expand beyond standardized patients to includesuch other technologies as patient simulators. \"With liveactors, you can 't assess all of the skills that you would like,\"Dillon says. \"Our plan is to introduce some other technol-ogies that will allow an even broader assessment, but rstwe have to make sure that such technologies are reliable andthat their presentations are consistent.\" Money is another consideration. At a cost of $1,000 per assessment, which students pay, Dillon says the usmle program has a responsibility to consider the expense of any additional assessment tools. Still, despite the considerable investment and inevitable growing pains that come with the introduction of a new pro-gram, it's clear that standardized patients, mannequins andincreasingly sophisticated computer trainers are going tobecome a key methodology in medical education. \"I like it very much. It's a great addition to the pre- clinical education. It gives students the chance to develop theskill of eliciting medical histories and physical ndings,\"says Peter N. Herbert, m.d. '67, hs'69, chief of staff and senior vice president for medical affairs at Yale-New HavenHospital. Herbert says that unlike real patients, actors areable to objectively assess the student's technique and offerfeedback, which he says is \"extraordinarily useful.\" For example, if a student makes the common mistake of lapsing into med-speak (\"Is your child febrile?\" ratherthan \"Does your child have a fever?\"), a standardized patientwill quickly point that out. \"I can only say that I wish there had been standard- ized patients when I was a medical student,\" Herbert says.\"It would have saved me and my early patients a lot ofembarrassment.\" YM Jennifer Kaylin is a freelance writer in New Haven.yale medicine spring 200724 25 yale medicine spring 200726 estern physicians, who demand clinical proof of a drug's efcacy, and propo-nents of alternative remedies, who pointto anecdotal evidence that their prod-ucts work, have carved out distinct butneighboring territories in the world of medicine. Although the inhabitants of these territorieshave often regarded each other with suspicion, their bordershave become increasingly porous. According to a 2004 sur-vey by the National Center for Complementary and Alterna-tive Medicine ( nccam ) of the National Institutes of Health (nih), 36 percent of Americans 18 or older have tried an alternative remedy. That survey also found that 26 percent of the respondents used alternative treatments based on arecommendation from a mainstream medical practitioner. This wary and shifting relationship stems in part from differing world views. Practitioners of traditional oralternative medicine take a more holistic view of healingthan their mainstream counterparts. And mainstreamphysicians see a lack of scientific rigor in published evalu-ations of traditional medicines whose recipes have beenhanded down over generations. Furthermore, how does aphysician calculate a reliable dosage of a medicine that'sbrewed in a tea and whose chemical makeup depends onhow much water and how many leaves are used, where the plants were grown, when they were harvested and howmuch it rained that season? Now Yale scientists are attempting to bring traditional Chinese medicine into the mainstream. Working with twocompanies in New Haven and Taiwan, they have broughtprecision and consistency to a traditional Chinese remedyfor headache, fever and gastrointestinal problems. Clinicaltrials have shown that the compound reduces the unpleasanteffects of chemotherapy. Trials will soon begin to evaluatewhether it also enhances the action of the chemotherapy.The researchers' main accomplishment, however, is thedevelopment of a platform technology that combines qualitycontrol, a robust database, clinical trials and herbal resourcesto produce plant-based medicines with a biologically consis-tent result. frontier,\" said Yung-Chi Cheng, ph.d ., the Henry Bronson Professor of Pharmacol- ogy, who is leading efforts at Yale to advance the study of traditional Chinese medicine.Prehistoric origins of herbal medicine Most users of herbal remedies point to anecdotal rather than clinical evidence of efcacy\u2014but that evidence, like thebotanicals themselves, has firm roots in many countriesaround the world. Otzi the Iceman, the 5,300-year-old mummied human discovered in the Italian Alps in 1991, carried his own medi-cine kit, which contained birch fungus, a natural antibiotic.An autopsy showed that Otzi suffered from intestinal para-sites, so the birch may have come in handy to ght the infestation. Birch fungus also could have served as a stypticpencil to close minor cuts. In the Middle Ages, ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other food grains, caused ergot poisoning in people who ate bread made from rye, barley or wheat infested withthe parasite. Characterized by constriction of blood vessels,ergotism often led to gangrene. It was also marked by con-vulsions and hallucinations known as Saint Anthony's re.(The alkaloids in ergot were a key ingredient in the experi-ments performed by a Swiss chemist that led to the synthe-sis of lsd.) Ergot was also used in 16th-century Europe to stop postpartum bleeding and to induce abortions; its rstrecorded use as an oxytocic was 1582. And also in the 16th century, Western explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh were impressed by the way in whichSouth Americans killed prey\u2014and sometimes Europeans\u2014with arrows poisoned with curare. Curare, which is con-cocted from several plants, kills by isolating muscle tissuefrom contact with nerves, eventually paralyzing the victim 'srespiratory muscles. The powers of curare weren 't tameduntil 1942, when two physicians converted it into a musclerelaxant that allowed lifesaving procedures to be performedmore rapidly and effectively. By John Dillon Illustrations by Mark Gagnon From the potion to the pill27 The coca leaf has been a chief target in the war on drugs, but it was woven into the fabric of Andean societythousands of years before its illicit use as the raw material of cocaine. To this day, indigenous people in South Americachew on the leaf as a stimulant and appetite suppressant,helping them get through a day of hard labor on the moun-tainsides. Brewed as a tea, coca combats altitude sicknessand settles the stomach. Since the Enlightenment, the healing ability of botani- cals has been rooted in hard science: the British physicianWilliam Withering, m.d., noted in a seminal 1785 paper that the garden herb foxglove, also known as digitalis, alleviated a deadly accumulation of fluid in the lungs and other bodytissues\u2014a condition then called dropsy\u2014in patients withcongestive heart failure. Humankind has also been wary of medicinal plants. They tend to trigger a bitter taste on the tongue, long recog-nized as a poison detector. They also vary in their potentialto harm as well as heal. As Withering himself acknowledged,the perils of foxglove were well-known. Foxglove has long since been converted into a standard- ized drug known as digoxin, but controversy over its use\u2014including its potential toxicity\u2014continues to this day. But thedisputes are based on numerous studies, something that can 't be said about many other botanicals with supposed heal-ing properties. The longstanding use of herbal preparationsnotwithstanding, they have a hard time getting a seat at thetable dominated by Western pharmaceuticals, which rely heavily on the clinical trial, largely unheard-of until the 1920s. Star anise is a staple in Chinese spice cabinets, in part because of its licorice-like flavor and in part because it helpspromote healthy digestion. Teas made from it have tradition-ally been used to treat colicky babies. However, in 2003 theFood and Drug Administration ( fda) issued an advisory to warn consumers against drinking the tea\u2014Chinese star anisewas sometimes adulterated with Japanese star anise, a toxicspecies of the herb. It also provides the key ingredient for theanti-flu drug oseltamivir phosphate, marketed under the nameTamiflu by Roche. When reports of avian flu hit Asia in 2005,Chinese ofcials reported a run on star anise, both by peoplewho wanted its protective properties and by those who wantedit to flavor their food. Eating the spice offers no protectionagainst flu, however, because the active ingredient, shikimicacid, is obtained only after a laborious extraction process. For over two millennia herbal treatments have been a mainstay of Chinese medicine, whose techniques alsoinclude acupuncture and massage. Among the herbs usedare yarrow, to treat the common cold, colic, indigestion andtoothache; aloe, which has a laxative effect and is also usedto treat wounds and burns; cardamom seeds for infections of the digestive tract as well as nausea and vomiting; anddevil's root, for chronic bronchitis. Traditional Chinese medicines are made of a blend of herbs, usually a principalingredient and three others intended to reinforce the effects of the principal herb, mitigate its side effects or treat a coex-isting disease pattern. Finding a consistent dosage Complementary and mainstream medicine \"have a different type of approach\" to healing, but \"eventually, they're going to meet,\" said Cheng. \"Chinese medicine has been used foryears and is still used today.\" He knows full well that \"main-stream medicine has always been suspicious\" of such methods of healing, even if their popularity has risen inWestern countries. By 1997, according to the nccam , spend- ing on complementary and alternative medicines totaledbetween $36 and $47 billion in the United States alone. Bycomparison, the major pharmaceutical companies registered$251.8 billion in sales in 2005, according to the most recentgures from imsHealth, a consulting rm that tracks the drug industry. In 1999 Yale's Ofce of Cooperative Research worked with Cheng to found PhytoCeutica, a company devoted tomaking cancer drugs out of herbs used in traditional Chinesemedicine. That this project is connected with a leadingresearch institution at all reflects a major shift in attitude, saidJames C. Whorton, ph.d ., professor of medical history and ethics at the University of Washington School of Medicine inSeattle and the author of Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America . \"It would not have happened 25 or 30 years ago,\" he said. \" A faculty member wouldn 't risk havinghis name associated with some group that was doing alterna-tive medicine. It was career suicide.\" Cheng also hopes to advance the acceptance of tradi- tional medicines at the international level. In December2004 he founded the Consortium for the Globalization ofChinese Medicine, which counts as members 61 institutionsaround the world, including seven from industry. Memberinstitutions include the School of Medicine; the Departmentof Intramural Research Affairs at the National Health ResearchInstitutes of the nih; and academic and research institutes in Canada, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Singapore,Taiwan and the United States. The consortium 's goals are todevelop platform technologies for producing Chinese medi-cines, to facilitate collaboration among institutions and todevelop medicines based on Chinese herbal preparations aswell as traditional medicines from other countries. \"Thespirit is to share the technology,\" said Cheng, who chairs theconsortium. \"This is something no company or institutioncan do by itself.\" The key to success for producing Chinese herbal remedies, aside from showing that they work, is getting aconsistent formula to deliver the drug. This concern for consistency is what separates PhytoCeutica from other pur-veyors of Chinese herbs. The alternative treatment landscapeis littered with botanical products that looked like promisingyale medicine spring 200728 cancer therapies but ultimately failed or were deemed dan- gerous. When such products are taken in their herbal formor as unregulated supplements, however, the bath watercomes with the baby. \"With two different preparations, youcome up with a different result,\" Cheng said. \"The chemicalcomposition is going to be different.\" For example, pc-spes , a widely touted herbal concoc- tion for prostate cancer, was removed from the market afterreports that it caused cardiovascular and other problems.\"Different formulations were found to have different impuri-ties,\" said Edward Chu, m.d., deputy director of the Yale Cancer Center. If the impurities had been removed, it mighthave worked, he said. For the past few years PhytoCeutica has been conduct- ing early-stage clinical trials of a traditional Chinese medi-cine formula that goes by the designation phy906 and acts as an adjuvant to chemotherapy for cancer. For competitivereasons, the company, which has a patent for phy906 in the United States and other countries to treat cancer, won 'trelease many details about the herbs used in the compound.Cheng said it is a traditional Chinese medicine derived fromfour different plants whose therapeutic ingredients work better together than each does alone. Unlike other plant-based drugs with a single active molecule, however, phy906 is multipronged. \"Chinese medicine always claims to havemultiple chemicals hitting multiple targets,\" explainedCheng, referring to the traditional practice of blending sev-eral herbs to produce a single remedy. \"There is a possibilitythis could be a shortcut to look for medicines which have a broad spectrum of usage, and also cover most patients.\" The herbs used to make phy906 are typically brewed as a tea or put in a blender, according to Chu, who was bornin the United States, but whose great-grandfather practicedChinese herbal medicine. The plants have been used histori-cally to treat headache, fever, swelling and a host of gastro-intestinal problems. Initial Phase I trials involving 17 patients found that phy906, used in combination with a standard two-drug regimen for colon cancer, caused no adverse effects andappeared to reduce the toxicity of the chemotherapy. Thenext step of the trial, with 29 patients, is to determine whether phy906 will enhance the action of the chemotherapy and shrink tumors as it did in animal models, Cheng said.Another trial tested the compound with capecitabine, mar-keted by Roche under the name Xeloda to treat liver cancer,and again found no adverse effects from phy906. Data are still being gathered to assess the effects of the traditional formula on quality of life, but initial ndings, said Chengand Chu, are encouraging. \"It seemed like the anti-tumor activity of Xeloda was improved upon the addition of the herb,\" said Chu. \"InPhase I, patients seemed to tolerate the combination prettywell, and there are some patients who are continuing toreceive treatment for a lot longer than with chemotherapy alone.\" In Phase II of that trial, the investigators will see\"whether it can cause the tumors to shrink and allow thepatients to be living with their cancer for a longer period oftime,\" Chu said. In addition, a new trial at Yale-New HavenHospital is testing phy906 in combination with Xeloda for treatment of pancreatic cancer. Chu and Cheng still don 't know how phy906 works, but they suspect that it inhibits certain proteins or clears apath to allow cancer drugs to get into cells. \"To be honest, as a patient you don 't really care how the compound works,\"Cheng said. That people have used these herbs for nearlytwo millennia, and still do in the age of pharmaceuticalplenty, makes for a tough-to-ignore case. \" A number of ourfriends who have had cancer and who have taken theseherbs have beneted,\" Chu said. The point of the research,however, is to \"take it out of the mystique and prove in factthat there is real clinical efcacy.\" If proven effective, phy906 could become the rst botanical prescription medicine developed from multipleherbs to be approved for oral administration by the fda, said Cheng. (The fda recently approved an unrelated topical application based on herbal medicine for treatment of geni-tal warts, Cheng said.) While the trial results have looked good so far, this botanical-to-pharmaceutical therapy still faces an uphill battle.\"So far, I have not seen any herb go beyond Phase III,\" saidLixing Lao, m.d., ph.d ., director of traditional Chinese medi- cine research at the University of Maryland School ofMedicine. Another concern endemic to herbal medicines\u2014and one that has ended trials in the past\u2014is getting a consis-tently successful formula. \"We have standards of chemicalidentities,\" said Peter Goldman, m.d., professor emeritus of From the potion to the pill29 pharmacology at Harvard, who has called for stronger research on medicinal herbs. \"How sure are you that what you havefrom a chemical perspective could actually be reproduced?\" heasked. Lao added that the potency of an herb can vary greatlyfrom sample to sample. \"Different elds in different seasonsmay come up with different chemical compositions.\" PhytoCeutica's work on phy906 stems from a col- laboration with SunTen Phytotech, a Taiwanese herbal medicine company that had manufactured the compound in pill form for years. What's new is the application ofPhytoCeutica's platform technology, called Phytomics, andquality control methods to develop a standard consistencyfor the compound. Cheng said PhytoCeutica uses modernbioinformatics, \"including chemical and biological nger-prints,\" to obtain the same formula each time. \"We com-pared our product with the company's product that wasmade previously, not following current good manufacturingpractices,\" Cheng said. \" As far as chemistry and biology areconcerned, they are different. The manufacturing practicesare a critical element to ensure the product's consistency.\" The success of phy906, according to Nature Cures author Whorton, depends on whether \"they've actually iden- tied the compounds present in the crude herbs and isolatedthat in pure form, the way you'd isolate morphine fromopium.\" If that works, then PhytoCeutica and its Taiwanesepartner can separate from the large pack of herbal medicinecompanies. Paul Talalay, m.d. '48, professor of neurology and pharmacology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,said that will be necessary because many products makebogus claims, are dangerous or both. A 1994 federal lawallows sellers of alternative remedies to make health claimswithout adhering to the same strict standards as a pharma-ceutical drug. The law, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ( dshea ), essentially deregulated the industry\u2014the fda can 't remove a product until there is over- whelming evidence that it causes harm\u2014and spurred moreintense interest in readily available products. dshea was \"a disaster\" that \"confuses our ability to handle disease prop-erly,\" Talalay said. Everything should undergo the same standards of testing, he said. The program as developed by Yale may be an excellent model for raising standards, according to Jeanne A. Drisko, m.d., who developed an integrative-medicine program at the University of Kansas and served on an Institute of Medi-cine committee that wrote a report on alternative medicine.\"The only way that we're going to separate those [remedies]that work from those that don't is to do the research,\" shesaid. \" And it has to be done in a partnership between theconventional practitioner and the complementary and alter-native practitioner.\" YM John Dillon is a freelance writer in New Haven.Chinese herbal remedy found to work againstkidney disease in mice The search for a treatment for polycystic kidney disease ( pkd ), a disorder in which genetic muta-tions lead to the formation ofcysts that impair kidney function,has led a Yale team to a Chineseplant-based medicine used forcenturies to treat cancer, inflam-mation and other conditions.\"The active ingredient has beenknown for 30 years, but nobodyknew how it worked,\" said CraigM. Crews, ph.d. , associate pro- fessor of chemistry, of molecular,cellular and developmentalbiology and of pharmacology.\"We wanted to find out how this compound worked.\" Crews and colleagues found that the compound, known astriptolide, binds to a calcium chan-nel encoded by the gene pkd 2 and implicated in polycystic kid-ney disease. Furthermore, thegene that encodes that channelhad been cloned by Stefan Somlo, m.d. ,fw'91, the c.n.h. Long Professor of Medicine and profes-sor of genetics. Triptolide is theactive ingredient in the traditionalChinese medicine Lei Gong Teng , typically brewed as a tea. In March, Crews and his team, in collaboration with Somlo,reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that triptolide reined in the rogue calcium channel in mice and thusappeared to mitigate the symp-toms of in amouse model of this com-mon genetic lethal kidney dis-ease,\" Crews said. pkd , Crews said, is the result of a gene mutation that con-fuses epithelial cells into think-ing they're at an earlier stage of development. As a result theycontinue to generate tubules that turn into fluid-filled cysts in thekidney. \"They accumulate cysts to the point where after 40 or 50years of life the kidneys are sofull of cysts that they lose func-tion,\" he said. More than 12 mil-lion people worldwide sufferfrom the disease. \"The next step with triptolide is that we want to see if this may have an effect in humans,\"Crews said.yale medicine spring 200730 right Lewis' records include writing samples and drawingsfrom the killers she has studied.The style of these records tells her as much as the substance\u2014marked changes in handwritingcan reveal as much as whatis written. above As a child growing up during World War II, Dorothy Lewis wondered what happenedto shape Adolf Hitler's character.As a psychiatrist, she has studied serial killers and murderers, find-ing three elements that occur consistently in the most violentoffenders: brain dysfunction, childabuse and psychotic thinking,particularly paranoia. The threeoccurring simultaneously, shebelieves, are a recipe for violence.31 A fascination with violence Dorothy Lewis has spent her career trying to understand serial killers such as John Allen Muhammad and Ted Bundy. Her theory \u2014that all violent offenders share three traits \u2014was once considered outrageous but now influences Supreme Court decisions. By Colleen Shaddox Photographs by Terry Dagradi Dorothy Otnow Lewis, m.d. '63, hs'70, a clinical professor in the Child Study Center, recalls her childhood in New YorkCity during World War II as painful and awkward. As childrenwere choosing up sides for a game, she remembers praying,\"Please God, let me be picked second to last, not last.\" The little girl who was the object of so much teasing at schoolwould once again see her prayers go unanswered. At home, things were not always easy. She was tangled in an ambiguous relationship with her older sister, who likedto hide in dark closets, jump out and scream, \"The greenwitch will get you!\" But at other times, she helped Dorothywith her French homework, keeping her a week ahead of herclassmates. A serious, often sad, child, Dorothy was urged by her mother to be more social: \"shorten your skirts; be abutterfly.\" But young Dorothy never felt much like a butterfly.She felt like an outsider, and she credits that feeling of isola-tion with her lifelong interest in society's pariahs. Her interest began in kindergarten, when a precocious desire to understand how a human being could be so cruelled her to try to gure out Adolf Hitler. After all, she was hor-ried when she watched her uncle slaughter a chicken ontheir farm in New Jersey. In Lewis' memoir, Guilty by Reason of Insanity: A Psychiatrist Explores the Minds of Killers , she recalls stories of the Nazi dictator hanging over her childhoodas \"a source of fascination and fear.\" She was the only studentin her elementary school \"who did not rejoice upon hearingof Hitler's suicide. Now I could never know what made himtick. ... I was convinced, even as a child, that Hitler could nothave been born that way. Something had to have happened to him. No one could be born that way. I still believe that.\" Lewis has spent her career as a psychiatrist studying murderers and searching for scientic explanations for theirbehavior. Her work would take her away from her family as she flew to reform schools and prisons around the country to research cases or testify for the defense. It would put her in the company of such notorious murderers as Mark DavidChapman, who shot John Lennon; serial killers Ted Bundyand Arthur Shawcross; and in 2005, John Allen Muhammad,the so-called \"Beltway Sniper,\" who examined her ngers andtold her she should drink more water. Lewis' work wouldplace her on the stand as a defense witness where prosecu-tors would do their best to discredit her. It would even put herat odds with the mainstream of her profession as she chal-lenged conventional theories that attribute violent behavior tosocioeconomic deprivation and lax discipline. Her ndings, based on psychiatric and neurological evaluations coupled with reviews of medical records, haveappeared in such publications as the American Journal of Psychiatry and the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry . Three elements, she has found, occur consistently in the most violent offenders: brain dys-function, child abuse and psychotic thinking, particularly para-noia. When all three occur simultaneously, Lewis believes,they become primary ingredients in a recipe for violence. Her theories, once considered outrageous, influenced Supreme Court rulings on capital punishment in 1988 and 2005. The outsider has become the expert and evensomething of a butterfly. \"She's very petite, very feminine.The last person in the world you'd expect to be doing thiswork,\" said Jonathan H. Pincus, m.d., hs'64, her long- time collaborator, now chief of neurology at the VeteransAdministration Medical Center and a member of theCenter for the Brain Basis of Cognition at GeorgetownUniversity in Washington, D.C.yale medicine spring 200732 Lewis believes that child abuse acts in several ways to turn people intoviolent adults. The abuse itself cancause brain damage that leads to a lack of control. Children also learnan unhealthy model of behavior.\"Children do as they see,\" Lewissaid. And the abuse engenders rage that is almost never directedtoward the abuser, but is displacedonto others. A fascination with violence33 In concentrating on violence, Lewis chose, to put it mildly, the road less traveled. Her husband, Melvin Lewis, m.d., hs'59, professor emeritus and senior research sci- entist in the Yale Child Study Center, frequently ribs her,\"Dorothy, with two basic drives why did you have to chooseviolence?\" She has no regrets. \"Violence is probably thesingle most important public health issue anywhere in theworld,\" Lewis said. A murder with no reason She is a master at separating the lurid side of her work from her family life. On a snowy afternoon last winter inher comfortable Tudor home in New Haven, a boom box flooded the house with Mozart. Lewis sat on the sofathumbing through case records. Her records are full of drawings and writing samples from the murderers she has examined. There are sketchesthat they made of their own disjointed conceptions of theirbrains as well as scenes of sexual abuse they rememberedfrom childhood. Lewis often saw as much in the style of theirworks as in the substance. \"See. Here! And here again!\" Shetapped the pages wherever she saw marked changes in hand-writing\u2014clues that the writer may periodically dissociate. Until 1984, when she recognized her rst case of dis- sociative identity disorder ( did), she questioned the phenom- enon 's very existence. It is still regarded with skepticism bysome psychiatrists. Once known as multiple personality disorder, did is marked by two or more personalities coexisting in the same patient. While did has been listed in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders since 1994, the diagnosis remains controversial\u2014some psy- chiatrists believe it is the product of therapist suggestion.Never-theless, Lewis is now asked to lecture about did inter- nationally\u2014evidence, in her view, that the profession is giving the diagnosis more credence. As she pored over records of Lee Anne Jameson, the rst juvenile murderer Lewis ever evaluated, a small boybounded into the room and asked, \"Grandma, do you haveany batteries?\" Her grandson, Noah, held up an action gure.Lewis looked up from the book and grinned. She asked him a bit about his day, then directed him to the batteries. WhenNoah left the room, she returned to the Jameson case withoutmissing a beat. Lee Anne (a pseudonym to protect the girl's identity) was 13 when she killed her best friend with a paring knifewhile waiting for a school bus. No one, least of all Lee Anne,could say why. Lewis got involved in the case because she was running a clinic in New Haven 's juvenile court at thattime. Observing \"normal\" children in a preschool as a childpsychiatry fellow at Yale didn 't interest her; she convinced the faculty that her evenings with her daughter, Gillian, thenfour, gave her ample opportunity to observe normal childdevelopment. She got permission to observe at the juvenile court in New Haven. After witnessing the severe psycho-pathology in children and families coming through the courtand the lack of services available to them, she received a grantfrom the state of Connecticut in 1971 to open the rst courtclinic in the state. With psychologist David A. Balla, ph.d ., a research associate at the Child Study Center, she published Delinquency and Psychopathology in 1976. The book was based on their work with children in the clinic. One of the rst cases Lewis encountered was that of Lee Anne. The girl's medical history was telling. She hadmade more than 30 visits to Yale-New Haven Hospital. Whilepregnant with Lee Anne, her mother suffered from syphilisand untreated hypothyroidism, conditions that limited LeeAnne's intelligence. During a difcult delivery, the soft bonesof the baby's cranium had been squeezed together and herclavicle broken. The ensuing years saw a string of emergencyroom visits\u2014cuts, burns, stomach pains and numerous accidents and injuries. Lee Anne was dismissed as a manipu-lative attention-seeker. No one paid attention to a medical student's note: \"she stared off into space and could not bearoused for several seconds. ... Get eeg.\" Lewis suspected a neurologic problem and consulted Pincus, then also a facultymember at Yale. Pincus found some signs of neurologic problems and ordered an eeg, but it was normal. Never- theless, Lee Anne's symptoms were consistent with complex partial seizures. She also was paranoid and sometimes heard voices that told her what to do. Lee Anne displayed the three traits that Lewis and Pincus would see again and again in murderers: brain injury,psychosis and a history of abuse. Their combined testimonywas less conclusive than Lewis would have liked. But it wasenough to get Lee Anne sent to a treatment center; it was alsothe start of a partnership that would alter the careers of bothdoctors, who often see things very differently. For example, Lewis has long been at odds with the conventional wisdom and often puts more trust in her ownobservations than in the literature. Pincus, however, has adeep respect for the literature. And when they began theirsecond collaboration, in 1977, Pincus observed that thestudy was \"a waste of time.\" Lewis was studying the neuro-psychiatric characteristics of youths in Long Lane School inMiddletown, then Connecticut's detention facility for vio-lent juveniles. The state wanted detailed information aboutthe children who would be housed in a proposed securewing. Pincus did not believe that violence and neuropathol-ogy were linked\u2014he opened one of the classic texts oncrime and psychiatric disorders and read a list of factors notassociated with criminal behavior, including such impairments as schizophrenia and brain damage. Pincusfinally agreed to participate in the study after Lewisexplained that her grant included a stipend for a neurolo-gist\u2014he needed the extra income. What he found was yale medicine spring 200734 staggering. He told Lewis that he had never seen so many neurologically impaired children in one place. Their collaboration continued when Lewis joined the faculty of New York University ( nyu) in 1979 as a professor of psychiatry. She made the move because her Yale appoint-ment as a clinical professor carried no salary. She also main-tained a small private practice in addition to her academicwork. But when Melvin Lewis was diagnosed with angina,she faced the possibility of becoming the sole breadwinnerfor a family that now included two children. \"I wanted to work in New Haven, and Yale was the obvious place to begin my job search,\" Dorothy Lewis wrotein her memoir. \"Yale was not interested. Yale had never in itshistory given a tenured faculty position in psychiatry to awoman psychiatrist; maybe once to a pediatrician, once to anepidemiologist; never to a woman psychiatrist. Yale was notabout to break tradition for me.\" After receiving offers fromColumbia, Cornell and nyu, Lewis joined the faculty at nyu, because it had an inpatient adolescent unit and offered accessto Bellevue Hospital's prison ward. Lewis secured funding tostudy prisoners and again convinced Pincus to become theproject neurologist. An interview four years later on the CBS Morning News brought her to the attention of a Florida public defender. The lawyer saw Lewis' interview with Diane Sawyer on thesubject of children who kill, and thought that the children she described sounded a lot like two of his clients on deathrow. He asked Lewis and Pincus to come to Starke, Fla., toevaluate his entire death row clientele. The only place to eatwas a greasy spoon with an electric sign outside flashing\"Burn Bundy Burn,\" a reference to the serial killer Ted Bundy,due to be executed. Bundy was not on their list of convicts to examine, though Lewis would end up interviewing himmany times before his execution in 1989. Lucky Larson (not his real name) was on their list. Larson was sentenced to die for two separate murders inwhich he'd hacked victims to death in the course of robberies.The death row inmate's demeanor was remarkably cheerful.Larson explained that he'd adopted an optimistic attitude aftera serious car accident he'd had years before the murders.Larson 's smile was lopsided, as was his gait. Tests revealedseveral brain injuries. An mri showed that his frontal lobes had been injured and could not perform their usual job ofcontrolling impulses emanating from the deeper, more primi-tive parts of the brain. Meanwhile Lewis was probing Larson 's history for evidence of abuse. Interviews revealed nothing. He had nomemory of maltreatment of any kind. Displaying a charac-teristic of many brain-damaged individuals, he would gooff on verbal tangents and then ask, \"Where'd I go? Whatwas the question?\" When Larson 's brother, Frank, was arrested for molest- ing his own children, the defense team got important cluesabout Lucky's upbringing. Where, Lewis wondered, had Frank learned such behavior? A private investigator workingfor Lucky Larson 's lawyers found social service records docu-menting that Lucky's mother had begun sexually abusingLucky when he was six years old. His father, jealous of therelationship, was violent toward the boy. Once Lucky scram-bled up a tree to escape his enraged father. The man took an axe and chopped down the tree with Lucky in it. Larson won a new sentencing hearing, but the jury again condemned him to death. On death row, he talkedalmost constantly\u2014happy chatter about very little. He wouldtry to snap his ngers\u2014even though his neurological prob-lems made the task impossible\u2014to illustrate how little it allmattered. \"The only comfort we could nd,\" Lewis wrote, \"wasin our knowledge that the very lesions that separated Lucky'sfrontal lobes from the rest of his brain and caused him to actso ferociously also protected him from appreciating the realityof his situation and kept him in perpetual good spirits.\" A scientific explanation for violence Over the past 25 years Lewis and Pincus have evaluated more than 100 juvenile and adult capital defendants. They are oftenasked to testify for the defense during the sentencing phase.That atmosphere is emotionally charged, and the scrutinythey receive can be intense. One of her best-known adversaries is forensic for the prosecution in the case of the New York serial killer ArthurShawcross, for whom Lewis was a defense witness. In addi-tion to being a frequent prosecution expert witness, Dietz alsoruns Threat Assessment Group, a rm that advises employerson the risk of stalking, product tampering and other forms ofviolence in their workplace. Detailed and harsh in his criticism, Dietz has accused Lewis of interpreting \"ambiguous symptoms\" as psychosis. \"I can 't escape the theory that Dr. Lewis has some position ora zealotry against the death penalty that influences her nd-ings and judgment,\" he said. Lewis, however, insists that she takes no sides on the morality or politics of the death penalty. She offers objectivetestimony on the mental health of accused killers, most ofwhom hide their illnesses and childhood traumas because\"they'd rather be killed than called crazy. ... I just give you thefacts. Then if you decide you want to kill him, you can killhim,\" she said. Of course, her strictly clinical explanation for murder does not answer traditional questions of right and wrong. Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly once asked her in a 2002 interview, \"But Dr. Lewis, what about evil?\" \"Evil is not a scientic term,\" Lewis answered. \"It's a religious term.\" In most cases, Lewis sees the defendant executed despite her testimony. But her work has changed the way theA fascination with violence35 death penalty is applied nationally. Lewis' research on juve- niles condemned to death in Texas became part of the recordin a 1988 Supreme Court ruling that youths under the age of16 could not be executed, and in a 2005 Supreme Court rul-ing that murderers cannot be executed for crimes they com-mitted before the age of 18. (Justice Thurgood Marshall alsocited her work in his 1991 dissent from a Supreme Courtdecision allowing the execution of the brain-damaged RickyRay Rector.) Her research cited in the 2005 case found thesame three factors she had so often observed\u2014a history ofabuse along with psychiatric and neurological problems\u2014and documented how little the courts had considered them. Her most important contribution, according to Pincus, is establishing the link between child abuse and violentbehavior. It would be easy to see how their work togethermight have made Pincus and Lewis anti-death penalty crusaders, but they avoid association with groups trying toban capital punishment. Instead they have become zealousabout preventing child abuse. Preventing child abuse Lewis has retired from nyu but remains a clinical professor in the Department of Psychiatry and in the Child StudyCenter at Yale. She continues to evaluate violent offenders,conduct research on violence, supervise trainees and see pri-vate patients. She is currently studying the moral implica-tions of our knowledge about violence; the origins of theconcept of the sociopath; and ethical issues surrounding the\"lottery\" of life that places some people at greater risk ofbecoming violent. She is also working with Jennifer S. Bard, j.d. '87, m.p.h ., professor of law at Texas Tech University (ttu) School of Law and adjunct associate professor of neuropsychiatry at the ttuSchool of Medicine, on a study of capital defendants who represent themselves. One of Lewis'major interests continues to be the prevention of child abuse. Child abuse, says Lewis, acts in several ways. First, the abuse itself can cause brain damage that leads to a lack of con-trol in individuals. It exposes children to an unhealthy modelof behavior. \"Children do as they see,\" she said. The stressresulting from ongoing physical and verbal abuse changes thestructure of the brain. And nally, she said, \" Abuse engendersrage that is almost never expressed toward the perpetrator ofthe abuse. That rage is displaced onto others. \"I would give my right arm to get funding to do an early identication and prevention project,\" she said. \"Wecould identify kids early whose maladaptive behaviors reflectterrible violence at home.\" The goal would be to offer supportto parents\u2014parenting education and mental health serv-ices\u2014rather than remove children from the troubled home.But she believes that the program would be seen as intrudingon families and therefore be a tough sell. Lewis' childhood curiosity about humanity's dark side launched her on a mission to understand the very people Among the murderers and serial killers Lewis has studied are TedBundy, Mark David Chapman and \"Beltway Sniper\" John AllenMuhammad. The first murderershe evaluated was a 13-year-oldmuch of society would prefer to eliminate. Ted Bundy asked to see Lewis the day before his execution and even kissed her goodbye. \"Everyone else wants to know what I did,\" heexplained. \"You want to know why.\" If violence is the most serious public health problem in the world, Lewis sees understanding killers as the key todevising a cure. The closest that Lewis comes to condemningthe death penalty has less do to with arguments about justiceand compassion than a thirst for answers. \"How is it,\" sheasks in her memoir, \"that we pour millions of dollars intoBundy books and the like, but are nevertheless willing to sac-rice further knowledge about him and his ilk in the interestof doing away with them?\" At 69, and after decades of study, Dorothy Lewis is no less fascinated by our pariahs than she was at age ve.

Eloise D. Austin , a second-year medical student, described the mentalhealth effects of the Rwandan genocideof 1994 on children. She interviewed40 orphans and found that their prob-lems included grief, loneliness and fre-quent memories of traumatic events.According to past studies, \"most children had seen the death of a closefamily member, had witnessed mas-sacres, had been forced to hide, hadseen dead bodies or body parts,\" she said. Her open-ended interviewssuggested that the mental health burden from these traumatic eventswas still considerable. Amy L. Glick , a nursing student, examined perceptions of care bypatients and providers at a new hiv/ aids clinic in Togo, in western Africa. In that region she found stigma to be pervasive. Some patients said thatpeople in certain villages or tribesbelieved that aids was caused by sor- cery, or that discussing sex educationand prevention with young adultswould cause promiscuity. And in somehospitals, patients with aids described poor care, neglect and insults fromstaff. The aed-Lidaw Health Clinic, where the research was conducted, is working to combat these negative experiences and provide a positiveexperience for patients with hiv/aids . Other research topics included sand fly-vectored diseases in Peru, atti-tudes toward female condom use inBotswana and the willingness of medi-cal and nursing students to treat hiv-positive patients in Sierra Leone. \u2014John CurtisHunger and Homelessness Auction $36,000 forcommunity Hunger and Home- lessness Auction raised $36,313 inNovember for seven community agen-cies in New Haven, an increase of$5,000 over the previous year.

Goldman thentook his programming textbook to thebeach over Labor Day weekend andcame back ready to crunch numbers inthe giant computers of the day. As theanalysis came together, he was hooked.\"I ended up publishing ve papers out of my thesis,\" he said, \"and kind of got the bug.\" He soon began to apply his new- found statistical and programmingsavvy to studies of cardiac risk. Afteran internship and residency at ucsf and a second residency at Massachu- setts General Hospital, Goldmanbecame a cardiology fellow at Yale. Ashis fellowship ended, Goldman said,his interest in epidemiology propelledhim toward nontraditional applicationsof cardiology. \"Cardiology divisionsweren 't really interested in me, and I didn 't really want to run an echo[cardiogram] lab,\" he said. In the division of general internal medicine at Harvard's Peter BentBrigham (now Brigham and Women 's)Hospital, where he stayed for almosttwo decades, Goldman continued tofocus on combining epidemiology with clinical care in cardiology. \"Mostof my work used the same kinds of methods an epidemiologist used, but applied it to patients we actuallytouched,\" he said, describing hisefforts to determine risk factors forheart attacks after surgery and amongpatients who came to emergencyrooms with chest pain. \"There were Blending the clinical and the statistical Early in his career, Lee Goldman saw the value of applying epidemiology toclinical practice. For more than two decades physicians have carried in their pocket copies of the Goldman Index, a list of factorsto determine whether a patient under-going surgery for noncardiac reasonsis at risk of a heart attack or anothermajor cardiac complication. The indexis named for Lee Goldman , m.d. '73, m.p.h . '73, fw'78, who developed it during his medical residency and published it during his cardiology fellowship at Yale by applying tech-niques derived from epidemiology and clinical practice. In recent years Goldman has also achieved renown for his leadership of the department of medicine at theUniversity of California, San Francisco( ucsf), which he joined in 1995. In July 2006 Goldman moved to Colum-bia University's College of Physiciansand Surgeons as executive vice presi-dent for health and biomedical sciencesand dean of the faculties of health sci-ences and medicine. Goldman traces his interest in sta- tistics to a class he took during his rstsemester at the School of Medicinewith John D. Thompson, r.n., m.s ., the legendary director of the programin hospital administration at theDepartment of Epidemiology andPublic Health. That course convincedGoldman to enroll in Yale's master of public health program, and a studyhe undertook there cemented his loveof numbers and other data. In 1971,so many factors to consider that clinicians did not have a way of deter-mining which ones were the best predictors of a patient's risk,\" he said.\"The concept was always to gathercomprehensive data and to whittle itdown to what might be important.\" One of Goldman 's most enduring contributions was the Goldman Index.\"It was the rst systematic approach to that question,\" said Lawrence S.Cohen, m.d. ,hs'65, special advisor to the dean. \"It has remained a bench-mark for the care of patients that are undergoing noncardiac surgery,and it has stood the test of time overthree decades.\" Goldman and his colleagues also started one of the first chest painevaluation units at Harvard. Today,these are common at many hos-pitals nationwide. And Goldmandeveloped the Coronary Heart DiseasePolicy Model, which sets prioritiesfor preventing and treating heart disease. At Harvard, he also co-developed the Program in ClinicalEffectiveness, which has trained Lee Goldman, executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences atColumbia University's College of Physi-cians and Surgeons, is known for his work in combining epidemiology with clinical care in cardiology. charles m anley41 From sleepless nights and a study of narcolepsy to chairinga leading program When most lights in the dormitory went out, David Kupfer 's stayed on. A history and economics major at YaleCollege, Kupfer, m.d. '65, couldn 't understand why his peers needed somuch sleep. At the time, he didn 't real-ize sleep would influence his career\u2014that he would become a leader insleep, depression and bipolar disorderresearch\u2014and that observing two cases of narcolepsy would set him onthis path. While in medical school and still undecided about a specialty, Kupfersaw two patients at Yale-New HavenHospital ( ynhh ) who suffered from an extreme exhaustion called cataplexythat results in a complete loss of mus-cle control. Both were also diagnosedwith narcolepsy. Seeing these two patients solidied Kupfer's decision to study sleep, buttwo encounters with a Yale professormolded his career. As a second-yearstudent he met Thomas Detre, m.d., then chief of psychiatry at ynhh , whose interests included recurrentdepression, violence and aggression inchildren, biologic aspects of mentaldisorders and the budding elds ofpsychobiology and psychopharmacol-ogy. At a time when there was littleunderstanding of mental diseases,Detre felt that understanding the bodycould lead to better treatment of men-tal illness. During Kupfer's third year, a last- minute trade with a classmate led to a chance reunion with Detre andsolidied Kupfer's decision to pursue psychiatry. The night before beginning his psychiatry rotation at the VA hos-pital in West Haven, Kupfer agreed toswitch rotations with a classmate whowanted to work at the VA. Kupfer wasback at ynhh with Detre. They soon realized they had a lot in common\u2014both were high-energy and stayed uplate. Detre expected diligence andKupfer delivered. \"Some people have considered [Detre] a tough taskmaster because hewas so persistent. I found him loyaland supportive and clever. He gave mefreedom,\" Kupfer said. After medical school, Kupfer trained at the National Institute of MentalHealth ( nimh ), then returned to Yale in 1969 as an nimh investigator and assistant professor of psychiatry.Kupfer's career was blossoming at Yale, but Detre asked him to join himat the University of Pittsburgh and its Western Psychiatric Institute andClinic ( wpic ), which Detre felt he could transform to better treat patientswith mental illness. In 1973, Kupferwent to Pitt as an associate profes-over 1,000 young physicians in the basics of clinical research . \"He really has been a pioneer,\" said Harlan M. Krumholz, m.d. ,m.sc ., the Harold J. Hines Jr. Professor of Medi-cine and professor of epidemiology andpublic health, and of investigative medi-cine, one of Goldman 's advisees at Yale.\"He was one of the rst people todevelop large observational studies thatdrew knowledge from the real worldand could be fed back into practice.\" After becoming the chair of medi- cine at ucsf , Goldman and his col- league Robert M. Wachter , m.d. , in 1996 coined the term hospitalist for inpatient physicians, a concept thatquickly produced a major movementin medicine. (Goldman and Wachterstarted the rst hospitalist program inthe country at ucsf. ) With inpatient care changing rapidly, they argued,ofce-based doctors simply do not havetime to monitor their hospital patientsthe necessary three or four times a day.Establishing a separate specialty ofhospital medicine, they argued, wouldincrease hospital efciency and benetpatients. \"The board is about to recog-nize it as a distinct discipline,\" he said,referring to the American Board ofInternal Medicine, which certies sub-specialties in internal medicine. \"Columbia is fortunate,\" said his former advisee Krumholz, recalling hismentor's seemingly limitless capacityto inspire students and colleagues.\"When he walked into a room, theenergy would just increase, the qualityof conversation would go up. I think awhole generation of people was drawnto research because of their associationwith him.\" \u2014 Alla Katsnelson David Kupfer's meeting with a mentor in his second year of medical school set him on a path toward his career in psychiatry. university of pi ttsbu rgh me dical ce nteryale medicine spring 200742 alumni faces A rebel with \"medicine in his veins\" becomes a scientificresearcher in India When Manohar V.N.

When he learned that hisgrandmother had died of cervical can-cer, Shirodkar was hooked. How didshe get sick? Why would she have can-cer when others do not? Today, themedical community knows that sometypes of the human papilloma viruscan cause cervical cancer, but at thattime the young man simply knew thatone way to understand illness was tostudy oncogenic viruses. To his father's delight, Shirodkar begged to study medicine in theUnited States. After he completed hisundergraduate work at Johns HopkinsUniversity, he headed to the YaleSchool of Medicine in 1950. His clini-cal studies were interrupted whenShirodkar learned his wife was preg-nant. The couple returned to Mumbai,where their daughters, Ren\u00e9e andDiane, were born. With a growingfamily, Shirodkar didn 't have the fundsto complete medical school. Heaccepted a position at Johns Hopkins'school of public health, which gavehim a stipend to pursue an sc.d.books and book chapters. His latest book, written for a general audiencewith Helena Chmura Kraemer, ph.d ., and Karen Kraemer Lowe, m.s., is titled To Your Health: How to Understand What Research Tells Us About Risk , and stresses the importance, throughoutmedicine, of designing more rigorousclinical trials and clearly dening theresults. As a case in point Kupfer citesmedia reports of studies that appearedto show a high risk of suicide amongyoung children on antidepressants.According to Kupfer, many of the stud-ies poorly dened the risk. Kupfer hopes that someday more physicians will value the relationshipbetween mental and physical illnesses.Research has shown that depression,for example, makes people more sus-ceptible to other illnesses, like dia-betes. Kupfer feels that many doctorstreat the diabetes rather than exploringthe link between the depression anddiabetes. He hopes this paradigmchanges soon\u2014patients who receivepoor mental health treatment face serious health risks, just like patientswho receive the wrong medical care. It might keep Kupfer up at night, but that's when he does his best work. \u2014Meghan Holohansor of psychiatry and director of research.

In 1994, furthercementing the connection betweenthese remarkable colleagues, Kupferwas named the first Thomas DetreProfessor of Psychiatry. Finally retired from his 23-year career as vice chancellor, Detre nowserves as a professor emeritus of psychiatry and is teaching a course toresidents on psychiatric diagnosis. He sits on the boards of two software companies in Pittsburgh and is also on the scientic advisory board ofPsychoGenics, a New York-based com-pany that tests neurological drugs. At Pitt, Kupfer stressed the impor- tance of determining the biologicalunderpinnings of psychiatric diseaseand led a research revolution by earn-ing a number of nimh grants for research on sleep disturbances, depres-sion and bipolar disorder. The numberof faculty and beds increased, along with the reputation of Pitt's psychiatryprogram. \"From 1983 to 1993 thedepartment went from Number 4 toNumber 1 in federal research funding,\"Detre explained.

In 1976,Shirodkar and his Sudha, foundedthe Dr. V.N. Shirodkar MemorialResearch Foundation, an organizationthat embodies the dreams of bothShirodkar and his father. The organiza-tion screens underprivileged womenfor cervical cancer and investigatesnovel antiviral biological agents to treatvirus diseases. \u2014M.H.His detour from a traditional medi- cal education gave Shirodkar theopportunity he wanted. (He nishedhis m.b.b.s. in 1970 at the Seth G.S. Medical College in Mumbai.) Andthroughout a career lled with manytwists and turns, his drive to under-stand viruses remains constant. As a graduate student at Hopkins in 1958, Shirodkar began investigat-ing the Rous sarcoma virus in chickens,the rst virus discovered to cause asolid cancer. His research took himfrom Hopkins to the Virus ResearchCenter of the Rockefeller Foundationin Pune, India, where he completedhis doctoral thesis. In 1978 he foundthat West Nile virus, and later, rabies,blocked the Rous-produced sarcoma,and that the underlying mediator wasnot interferon, but his newly discov-ered anti-sarcoma, antiviral protein,called plasma factor. His research nd-ings appeared in The Journal of Immunology in December 1965, the Journal of General Virology in 1973, The Indian Journal of Medical Research in 1978 and the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology in October 2006.

Lifton, m.d., ph.d ., chair of genetics, Mani sought a genetic component to heart disease. He also believed that genetic mutations wouldbe more prevalent in families where relatives intermarried. Although their initial research focused on patent ductus arteriosis ( pda ), in March the journal Science published Mani and Lifton's research on metabolic disease, also involving coro-nary and carotid arteries. They identified a rare defect in a sin-gle gene that causes metabolic syndrome\u2014a cluster of riskfactors that include high ldl cholesterol, low hdl cholesterol, high triglycerides, hypertension and diabetes\u2014and early heartdisease. The paper relied on a study of an Iranian family withhigh rates of coronary artery disease ( cad ). Among 58 blood relatives, 28 were diagnosed with early cad \u2014before the age of 50 for men and 55 for women\u2014and 23 of the 28 died at youngages. Relatives without cad died at an average age of 81. Mani and Lifton traced the mutation to a section of chromosome 12. There they found a mutation in a gene called lrp6. One change in an amino acid altered the activity of the protein encoded by the gene, which acts in the Wnt signalingpathway, a network of proteins that is involved in develop-ment and is altered in certain malignant tumors. \"The main finding is the role of Wnt signaling in devel- opment of metabolic syndrome and cad ; that is where science has to focus on now to understand the basic molecularmechanism of the disease,\" Mani said. \"We expect that studies of the Wnt signaling pathway in patients with early cad and metabolic syndrome will pro- vide new insight into the basic biology of disease causationand allow new approaches to disease prevention,\" Lifton said. medicine spring 200748 follow- up 25years ago New Integrated Course in Basic Neurology \u2014Alumni Bulletin October 1957 \"The extensive growth of knowl- edge concerning the nervous system resulting from work in thefields of anatomy, physiology,psychology, biochemistry and pharmacology in recent years iscausing many medical schools tore-evaluate the organization ofbasic science courses related to thenervous system.

The journal cited genomic studies of age-related macular degeneration amd ) led by Josephine J. Hoh, ph.d. , associate professor of epidemiology and of ophthalmology and visual sci-ence, along with other studies as representing significant progressagainst the disease, the most common cause of blindness in people over the age of 50. In 2005, Hoh and colleagues linked avariant of a gene on chromosome 1 with the milder dry form of amd . Last year a group led by Hoh identified a single change in a gene on chromosome 10 that leads to a much greater risk of developing the more aggressive wet form of the disease. [See\"Yale Scientist Finds Two Genetic Anomalies Linked to MacularDegeneration,\" page 11.] Haifan Lin, ph.d. , professor of cell biology and director of the Yale Stem Cell Center, was one of four scientists who con-tributed to breakthroughs in the understanding of small rna mol- ecules known as Piwi-interacting rna s, or pi rna s. Lin's lab first discovered Piwi/Argonaute genes, which are essential for the self-renewal of stem cells, in 1998. But it was not understood whatrole these genes play in stem cell division until last year, whenLin's group showed that Piwi/Argonaute proteins bind to pi rna s. Alumnus Jonathan Rothberg, ph.d. '91, founded and chairs 454 Life Sciences, a Branford, Conn., company that createdtechnology for the rapid sequencing of genomes. Two of the labson the top 10 list used this technology, and Lin is using it in hiswork. Rothberg and collaborators in Europe analyzed dna from a 38,000-year-old Neanderthal fossil and found that the differencebetween the human and Neanderthal genomes is just one basepair in 2,000. \u2014 Jill Max The journal Science cited two Yale medical school faculty members and a Yale alumnusamong the scientists behind thetop 10 breakthroughs of 2006.end noteyalemedicine 300 george street, suite 773, new haven ct 06511 yalemedicine.yale.edu spring 2007Non-Profit Org.
