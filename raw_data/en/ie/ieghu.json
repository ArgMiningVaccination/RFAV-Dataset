Community 4Baylor Scott & White Health mission Our commitment to the communities we serve As the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in T exas and one of the largest in the United States, Baylor Scott & White Health was born from the 2013 combination of Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Healthcare. T oday, Baylor Scott & White includes 51 hospitals, 1,100 access points, more than 7,300 active physicians, and over 49,000 employees and the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan. Baylor Scott & White Health is a leading T exas healthcare provider with a proven commitment to patient and community health. Baylor Scott & White Health demonstrates this commitment through periodic community health needs assessments, then addresses those needs with a wide range of outreach initiatives. These Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) activities also satisfy federal and state community benefit requirements outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the T exas Health and Safety Code. Baylor Scott & White Health conducts a thorough periodic examination of public health indicators and a benchmark analysis comparing communities it serves to an overall state of T exas value. In this way, it can determine where deficiencies lie and the opportunities for improvement are greatest. Through interviews, focus groups and surveys, the organization gains a clearer understanding of community needs from the perspective of the members of each community. This helps it identify the most pressing needs a community is facing and develop implementation plans to focus on those prioritized needs. The process includes input from a wide range of knowledgeable people who represent the myriad interests of the community in compliance with 501 (r)(3) regulations. The CHNA process overview can be found in Appendix A. The CHNAs serve as the foundation for community health improvement planning efforts over the next three years, while the implementation plans will be evaluated annually.Health Experience Affordability Alignment GrowthFounded as a Christian ministry of healing, Baylor Scott & White Health promotes the well-being of all individuals, families and communities.

In the prioritization session, hospital leadership voted diabetes as the top prioritized need but did not provide any commentary. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 10Priority 2: Access to Healthcare The following data indicates greater need for access for the population to one primary care provider and access for the population to one non-physician primary care provider. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Access to care Population to one primary care physician Population to one non-physician primary care provider Limited providers Difficult to access primary care providers The population to one primary care physician indicator is defined as the number of individuals served by one physician in a county if the population was equally distributed across physicians and is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps and Area Health Resource File/American Medical Association.

Participants stated there is a high demand for mental health and dental care providers, leading to difficulty accessing care. Participants from Denton County cited that limited access to providers is a problem regardless of insurance coverage. Language barriers also prevent access to medical care. In addition to limited providers, there is no publicly funded hospital in Denton County, forcing some patients to go to Dallas County to seek care. In the prioritization session, the hospital leadership agreed that even though telemedicine has improved access to care, it is still difficult for the uninsured and underinsured. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 11Priority 3: Depression/Social Isolation The following data indicates a greater need in the area of depression. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Mental health Medicare population: depression Social isolation and loneliness caused increased depression and mental health needs The Medicare population: depression measure is defined as the prevalence of depression across all Medicare beneficiaries.

In the prioritization session, hospital leadership discussed evaluating depression only for the Medicare population and concluded that as a result of the pandemic, many younger people need mental health services, and all populations should be considered. They also noted that with more people working from home, social isolation increases, and depression among residents is exacerbated. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 13Priority 4: Emergency Department Utilization Although the data did not indicate a greater need, the key informants identified a need in the area of emergency department utilization. Category Data shows less need or no data Key informants indicate greater need Utilization Medicare population: emergency department use rate Emergency utilization is high The Medicare population: emergency department use rate indicator is defined as the unique patients having an emergency department visit divided by the total beneficiaries and is based on data from CMS Outpatient 100% Standard Analytical File (SAF) and CMS Standard Analytical Files (SAF) Denominator File.

The hospital and community leaders agreed that the overuse of the emergency department is an issue. They hypothesized that residents struggle to take time away from work to get help from health professionals, or they simply have nowhere else to go for care, so they either forego the services they need or obtain them in the emergency departments. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 14Priority 5: Mentally Unhealthy Days/Coping Mechanisms The following data indicates greater need in the area of mentally unhealthy days. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Mental health Mentally unhealthy days Social isolation and loneliness caused increased depression and mental health needs The mentally unhealthy days indicator is defined as the average number of mentally unhealthy days reported in past 30 days (age-adjusted) and is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps; The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Counties are listed in alphabetical order within NTX-Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community. LEFT PANEL: Indicator Values horizontal bar and label shows the county score.

The aging population is experiencing increased cases of dementia and altered mental health. In addition to the increase of cases, many providers fail to recognize mental health issues, which translates to patients failing to receive early interventions. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders noted that many who are mentally unhealthy are affected by drugs and alcohol, and the community lacks resources for those patients to seek help. They acknowledged that there are many high-functioning addicts who have developed coping strategies. This is a community need that should be prioritized. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 15Priority 6: Income Inequality Although the data did not indicate a greater need, the key informants identified a need around income inequality. Category Data shows lesser need Key informants indicate greater need Population & income Income inequality Cost of living too high Lack of living wage The income inequality indicator is defined as the ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to income at the 20th percentile. Absolute equality is when the value is equal to 1.0. A higher ratio indicates greater inequality. The indicator is based on data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps; American Community Survey (ACS), Five-Year Estimates (United States Census Bureau). Counties are listed in alphabetical order within NTX-Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community. LEFT PANEL: Indicator Values horizontal bar and label shows the county score.

They noted, however, that there are a large number of low-wage earners living in the community who barely earn incomes above the poverty level. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders were in agreement that the affordability of housing, food and healthcare is worsening and needs to be addressed.

The resulting Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) report must include descriptions of the following: The community served and how the community was determined; The process and methods used to conduct the assessment, including sources and dates of the data and other information as well as the analytical methods applied to identify significant community health needs; How the organization used input from persons representing the broad interests of the community served by the hospital, including a description of when and how the hospital consulted with these persons or the organizations they represent; The prioritized significant health needs identified through the CHNA as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing the identified significant needs; The existing healthcare facilities, organizations and other resources within the community available to meet the significant community health needs; and An evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospitals' most recent CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in that report. \u00b0 Hospitals also must adopt an implementation strategy to address prioritized community health needs identified through the assessment. CHNA process BSWH began the 2022 CHNA process in April of 2021. The following is an overview of the timeline and major milestones: Define the community Assess the community Identify \"significant needs\" and \"prioritize\" Document in written report CHNA board approvals Make CHNA widely available on website Written implementation strategy Implementation strategy board approval Make implementation strategy widely available on website Act on strategy, measure and report Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 19Consultant qualifications IBM Watson Health delivers analytic tools, benchmarks and strategic consulting services to the healthcare industry, combining rich data analytics in demographics, including the Community Needs Index, planning and disease prevalence estimates, with experienced strategic consultants to deliver comprehensive and actionable Community Health Needs Assessments. Health needs assessment process overview T o identify the health needs of the community, the hospitals established a comprehensive method using all available relevant data including community input. They used the qualitative and quantitative data obtained when assessing the community to identify its community health needs. Surveyors conducted interviews and focus groups with individuals representing public health, community leaders/groups, public organizations and other providers. In addition, data collected from public sources compared to the state benchmark indicated the level of severity. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. These data are available to the community via an interactive dashboard at BSWHealth.com/ CommunityNeeds. Data gathering: quantitative assessment of health needs - methodology and data sources The IBM team used quantitative data collection and analysis garnered from public health indicators to assess community health needs. This included over 100 data elements grouped into over 11 categories evaluated for the counties where data was available. Recently, indicators expanded to include new categories addressing mental health, healthcare costs, opioids and social determinants of health. A table depicting the categories and indicators and a list of sources are in Appendix B. A benchmark analysis of each indicator determined which public health indicators demonstrated a community health need. Benchmark health indicators included overall US values, state of T exas values and other goal-setting benchmarks, such as Healthy People 2020. According to America's Health Rankings 2021 Annual Report, T exas ranks 22nd out of the 50 states in the area of Health Outcomes (which includes behavioral health, mortality and physical health) and 50th in the area of Clinical Care (which includes avoiding care due to cost, providers per 100,000 population and preventive services). When the health status of T exas was compared to other states, the team identified many opportunities to impact community health. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 20The quantitative analysis of the health community used the following methodology: The team set benchmarks for each health community using state value for comparison. They identified community indicators not meeting state benchmarks. From this, they determined a need differential analysis of the indicators, which helped them understand the community's relative severity of need. Using the need differentials, they established a standardized way to evaluate the degree that each indicator differed from its benchmark. This quantitative analysis showed which health community indicators were above the 25th percentile in order of severity\u2014and which health indicators needed their focus. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. Information gaps In some areas of T exas, the small population size has an impact on reporting and statistical significance. The team has attempted to understand the most significant health needs of the entire community. It is understood that there is variation of need within the community, and BSWH may not be able to impact all of the population who truly need the service. Community input: qualitative health needs assessment - approach T o obtain a qualitative assessment of the health community, the team: Assembled a focus group representing the broad interests of the community served; Conducted interviews and surveys with key informants\u2014leaders and representatives who serve the community and have insight into its needs; and Held prioritization sessions with hospital clinical leadership and community leaders to review collection results and identify the most significant healthcare needs based on information gleaned from the focus groups and key informants. Focus groups helped identify barriers and social factors influencing the community's health needs. Key informant interviews gave the team even more understanding and insight about the general health status of the community and the various drivers that contributed to health issues. Multiple governmental public health department individuals were asked to contribute their knowledge, information and expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Individuals or organizations who served and/or represented the interests of medically underserved, low-income and minority populations in the community also took part in the process. NOTE: In some cases, public health officials were unavailable due to obligations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitals also considered written input received on their most recently conducted CHNA and subsequent implementation strategies if provided. The assessment is available for public comment or feedback on the report findings by going to the BSWH website (BSWHealth.com/CommunityNeeds) or by emailing CommunityHealth@BSWHealth.org. Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 21Approach to prioritizing significant health needs On January 13, 2022, a session was conducted with key leadership members from Baylor Scott & White along with community leaders to review the qualitative and quantitative data findings of the CHNA to date, discuss at length the significant needs identified, and complete prioritization exercises to rank the community needs. Prioritizing health needs was a two-step process. The two-step process allowed participants to consider the quantitative needs and qualitative needs as defined by the indicator dataset and focus group/interview/survey participant input. In the first step, participants reviewed the top health needs for their community using associated data-driven criteria. The criteria included health indicator value(s) for the community and how the indicator compared to the state benchmark. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and high qualitative: The community indicators that showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark and were identified as a greater need by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and low qualitative: The community indicators showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were not identified as a greater need or not specifically identified by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATALow/no data and high qualitative: The community indicators showed less need or had no data available in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were identified as a greater need by the key informants. Participants held a group discussion about which needs were most significant, using the professional experience and community knowledge of the group. A virtual voting method was invoked for individuals to provide independent opinions. This process helped the group define and identify the community's significant health needs. Participants voted individually for the needs they considered the most significant for this community. When the votes were tallied, the top identified needs emerged and were ranked based on the number of votes. High data/Low qualitative High data/High qualitative Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude BUT T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude AND T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude AND T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude BUT T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Low data/Low qualitative Low/no data/High qualitative High data = Indicators worse than state benchmark by greater magnitude High qualitative = Frequency of topic in interviews and focus groupsQualitative QualitativeData Data Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 22Prioritization of significant needs In the second step, participants ranked the significant health needs based on prioritization criteria recommended by the focus group conducted for this community: Severity (outcome if ignored): The problem results in disability or premature death or creates burdens on the community, economically or socially. Community capacity or strengths: The community may or may not have the capacity to act on the issue with regard to economic, social, cultural or political consideration. It should be considered whether current initiatives exist to help address the health issue that can be built upon to bolster existing resources. Social justice: The problem is more concentrated to a specific vulnerable population. Does addressing this issue lead to unfair social benefit? Are we equitable to all vulnerable populations in our approach? The group rated each of the six significant health needs on each of the three identified criteria, using a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high). The criteria score sums for each need created an overall score. They prioritized the list of significant health needs based on the overall scores. The outcome of this process was the list of prioritized health needs for this community. Priority Need Category of need 1 Diabetes Conditions/diseases 2 Access to healthcare Access to care 3 Depression/social isolation Mental health Environment 4 Emergency department utilization Utilization 5 Mentally unhealthy days/coping mechanisms Mental health 6 Income inequality Population & income Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community 23Appendix B: key public health indicators IBM Watson Health collected and analyzed fifty-nine (59) public health indicators to assess and evaluate community health needs. For each health indicator, a comparison between the most recently available community data and benchmarks for the same/similar indicator was made. The basis of benchmarks was available data for the US and the state of T exas.

The CNI takes into account vital socio- economic factors, including income, culture, education, insurance and housing, about a community to generate a CNI score for every population ZIP code in the US. The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services. Not-for-profit and community-based hospitals, for whom community need is central to the mission of service, are often challenged to prioritize and effectively distribute hospital resources. The CNI can be used to help them identify specific initiatives best designed to address the health disparities of a given community. The CNI score by ZIP code shows specific areas within a community where healthcare needs may be greater. Grapevine/Trophy Club Region Health Community The overall CNI score for the Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community was 3.75. The difference in the numbers indicates both a strong link to community healthcare needs and a community's demand for various healthcare services. In portions of the community, the CNI score was greater than 4.5, indicating more significant health needs among the population. Composite CNI score 3.75 T exas CNI score 3.85 US composite CNI score 3.00 Barrier State US Income 3.0 3.0 Culture 4.7 3.0 Education 3.5 3.0 Insurance 4.3 3.0 Housing 3.9 3.0Composite CNI: high scores indicate high need. ZIP map where color shows the 2020 Community Need Index on a scale of 1 to 5. Orange color indicates high need areas (CNI = 4 or 5); blue color indicates low need (CNI = 1 or 2). Gray colors have needs at the national average (CNI = 3). 1.000 proprietary community data IBM Watson Health supplemented the publicly available data with estimates of localized inpatient demand discharges, outpatient procedures, emergency department visits, heart disease, as well as cancer incidence estimates. Social determinants of health are the structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. All of which can greatly impact healthcare utilization and play a major role in the shifting healthcare landscape. Social determinants, such as education, income and race, are factored into inpatient demand estimates and outpatient procedure estimates utilization rate creation methodologies. Inpatient demand estimates Inpatient demand estimates provide the total volume of annual acute care admissions by ZIP code and DRG Product Line for every market in the United States. IBM uses all-payor state discharge data for publicly available states and Medicare (MEDPAR) data for the entire US. These rates are applied to demographic projections by ZIP code to estimate inpatient utilization for 2020 through 2030. The following summary is reflective of the inpatient utilization trends for Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community. T otal discharges in the community are expected to grow by over 9% by 2030, with pulmonary medical, general medicine and cardiovascular diseases projecting the largest growth.

Procedures are defined and reported by procedure codes and are further grouped into clinical service lines. The Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community outpatient procedures are expected to increase by over 34% by 2030 with the largest growth in the categories of labs, general & internal medicine, physical & occupational therapy and psychiatry.

IBM uses an extensive supply of proprietary claims, public claims and federal surveys to construct population-based use rates for all payors by age and sex. These use rates are then applied to demographic and insurance coverage projections by ZIP code to estimate ED utilization for 2020 through 2030. Visits are broken out into emergent and non-emergent ambulatory visits to identify the volume of visits that could be seen in a less-acute setting, for example, a fast-track ED or an urgent care facility. In addition, visits that result in an inpatient admission are broken out into a third, separate category. In the Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community, ED visits are expected to grow by almost 14% by 2025.

IBM uses public and private claims data as well as epidemiological data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) to build local estimates of heart disease prevalence for the current population. County-level models by age and sex are applied to the underlying demographics of specific geographies to estimate the number of patients with specific types of heart disease. In Grapevine/Trophy Club Health Community, the most common heart disease is hypertension at 73.4% of all heart disease cases.Disease type 2020 prevalence 2020 % prevalence Arrhythmia incidence2025 incidence2020 - 2025 change2020 - 2025 % change 983 1,168 185 131 16.3% Other 3,154 3,691 17.0% 556 60 12.1% Thyroid 822 943 120 14.6% Uterine Cervical 203 206 3 1.5% Uterine 119 17.1% TOTAL 11.5%Cancer estimates IBM Watson Health builds county-level cancer incidence models that are applied to the underlying demographics of specific geographies to estimate incidence (i.e., the number of new cancer cases annually) of all cancer patients.
