Have you ever thought about which foods really give you energy and stamina to last through the day and some part of the night as well? 24/7 and then 365 days a year? Because the truth is that many of us go about the day looking listless and energy-sapped. So, if there was one magic potion we would all like to conjure up and drink as we go about running all through the day, (in our battle for sustenance as it were), it would have to be the ENERGY potion. If you are short of energy, you have probably neglected what you intake in your high-stakes life. This has led to an unhealthy lifestyle that actually does not support the activities you strive to slot in your day-to-day life. So, it is time to eat with some discretion to properly fuel your system. Who needs high energy? It is not only people who do hard, physical labor or athletes and sportspersons who need high energy and stamina. Even homemakers with gruelling schedules, and students with their heavy workloads as well as professionals who have to work long hours in mentally draining jobs need to keep an eye on the sort of food they are eating to keep their [energy levels high](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/lifestyle/well-being/how-to-stop-feeling-tired-all-the-time). Are there some foods that give us more energy than others? What are these special energy-giving foods? Does your prakruti or constitution warrant a special/unique diet? If so, what are they? We will explore all this in this article, which will enable you to perform all your activities with renewed vigor and energy. 10 Foods that can increase your energy and stamina 1. Bananas - You would have seen sportspersons take a few bites of a banana during their breaks. So, bananas, as a source of energy, don't really need an introduction. They are sources of complex carbs, potassium, and Vitamin B6 - all of these help [increase your energy levels](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/lifestyle/well-being/keep-your-energy-level-up). For building stamina, complex carbs are essential. They also have Vitamin C, an essential immunity-booster in Covid times. Note: It would be best to avoid bananas if you have a cold or cough. 2. Brown rice - This is another great source of complex carbs. It is rich in fiber and Vitamin B complex. It does not have as much starch as white rice, so it is easier to digest while keeping you feeling full and energized the whole day. 3. Lentils - They are great sources of protein, iron, manganese, and folate, which helps reduce fatigue. It helps the cells of the body to break down food for energy. In particular, green gram (moong dal) is safe to take every day. 4. Beetroot juice - Sportspersons would be familiar with the ABC drink - apple, beetroot, and carrot juice. Beetroot juice is filled with iron, manganese, magnesium, sodium, zinc, and many other nutrients vital for your packed day. This power drink energizes you while keeping you feeling fresh and light on your feet all day. Nutrients essential for high energy and stamina - Complex carbohydrates - Fiber - Iron - Vitamin C 5.

You can take this detoxifying drink in the morning - it helps in digestion as well as in energizing you. Amla is also a good addition to the diet of meditators. 6. Sweet potatoes - If you are looking for that extra boost in your day, sweet potatoes are a great way to go.

Words of wisdom by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar about the food you eat: - Make a conscious choice about the food that goes into your system every day. - Respect the food on your plate - as you would life. It is what helps you function. This is one of the most basic lessons of our life. Remember that the food on your plate was life. - Eat food that makes you feel alive. If you feel dull after eating it, it is not good for you. And your body is telling you that. Tip: During the hot summer months, herbal teas and light juices like lemon juice can help cool the system and make you feel refreshed and energetic. When to eat high energy-giving foods Since all these high energy-giving foods are complex carbohydrates, they are heavy foods that need time to digest. So, it is advisable to eat them in the morning to keep you going all day long. And your body has time to digest them during the most active time of your day. Foods to avoid - There are some instant energy giving foods such as caffeinated foods - coffee, tea, and some energy drinks. But it would be best to avoid them as they have other side effects. - Also, avoid deep fried and oily foods. While fat is a source of energy, this will just make you feel sluggish and lethargic. - As always, refined sugar and processed foods also promise high energy content but skip them for these tastier amd healthier substitutes. What else can you do to boost energy? - Eat heavy foods earlier in the day - Spread your meals, to have small portions at regular intervals - Drink plenty of water - Get adequate sleep at night time Energy-giving food chart for different constitutions Making the right choice of foods is about aligning a healthy diet with your body's needs, its constitution, and your food preferences.
