The College establishes an environment demonstrating the expression of University core values; to embody Vitalism, nurture the standard to live an exceptional life of Integrity and be of service to the world. The combination of sciences, philosophy, practice management and real-world clinical applications in Life University's Doctor of Chiropractic program gives students an engaged curriculum that one could only describe as exceptional. Life University's Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree is a rigorous, 14-quarter program that typically takes students four years to complete. Students begin their chiropractic studies learning the foundational aspects upon which the profession is built - the history, philosophy and science of Chiropractic. As they progress beyond the first two quarters, students study the basic sciences while also beginning to learn about chiropractic analysis, techniques and examinations. Once students reach the Eighth Quarter of the program, they enter the clinical phase of study and apply their lessons to real-world situations. Students nearing graduation take practice management courses and clinical application, working in outpatient settings.
