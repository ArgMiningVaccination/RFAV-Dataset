Four large [health maintenance organizations](/en/Health_maintenance_organization), including [Kaiser Permanente](/en/Kaiser_Permanente), were initially recruited to provide the CDC with medical data on [vaccination](/en/Vaccination) histories, health outcomes, and subject characteristics. The VSD database contains data compiled from [surveillance](/en/Surveillance) on more than seven million people in the United States, including about 500,000 children from birth through age six years (2% of the U.S. population in this age group).

The data sharing guidelines have been revised to include comments from interested groups as well as recommendations from the [Institute of Medicine](/en/Institute_of_Medicine) (IOM). The [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](/en/Vaccine_Adverse_Event_Reporting_System) (VAERS), the VSD, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network are tools by which the CDC and FDA [measure](/en/Measurement) vaccine safety [[2]](#cite_note-CDC_Vaccine_Safety-2) to fulfill their duty as [regulatory agencies](/en/Regulatory_agency) charged with protecting the public. Data from the VSD Project have been used to address a number of vaccine safety concerns; examples include a study clarifying the risk of [anaphylaxis](/en/Anaphylaxis) after vaccine administration [[3]](#cite_note-3) and several studies examining the rejected hypothesis of a [link between "}
