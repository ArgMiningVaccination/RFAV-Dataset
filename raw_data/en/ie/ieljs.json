Our goal has been to di scover a language from emirical data, to find out a new l anguage that models human activity. To learn a new language, we need to understand its honology, mor hology, syntax and semantics. The Human Activity Language (HAL) that we develoed in this roject, consists of kinetology, morphology, and syntax . Kinetology, the honology of human movement, finds basic rimitives for human motion (segmentation) and associates them with symbols (symbolization). T he inut is measurements of human movement in 3D (signals), as for examle roduced by motion catur e systems (a temoral evolution of joint angles). T his way, kinetology rovides a non-arbitrary grounded s ymbolic reresentation for human movement that allows synthesis, analysis, and symbolic maniulati on. The morhology of a human action is related to the inference of essential arts of the movement ( morpho-kinetology ) and its structure ( morpho-syntax ). In order to learn the morhemes and their structure, w e resent a grammatical inference methodology and introduce a arallel learning algorithm to induce a grammar system reresenting a single action. In r actice, morhology is concerned with the construction of a vocabulary of actions or a praxicon. The syntax of human activities involves the construction of sente nces using action morhemes. A sentence may range from a single action morheme (nuclear syntax) to a sequence of sets of morhemes. A single morheme i s decomosed into analogs of lexical categories: noun adjectives, verbs, adverbs. The sets of morhemes reresent simultaneous actions (arallel syntax) and a sequence of movements is related to t he concatenation of activities (sequential syntax). Nu clear syntax, esecially adverbs, is related to the motion interolation roblem (or the style roblem), aral lel syntax addresses the slicing roblem, and seque ntial syntax is roosed as an alternative method to the transitioning roblem. The framework has consequenc es to surveillance, automatic video annotation, humano id robotics and Cognitive Science. The availability of a grammatical structure reresenting different action s suggests a new imlementation of a sensori-motor theory of meaning. At the same time it suggests se cific solutions to many roblems in human comuter interaction and in general in human-centered comut ing. Challenges and Opportunities: There is a trade-off between the comlexity of the \"honemes\" and the comlexity of the grammars. The simler the honeme s, the more comlicated the grammars and vice versa. It is a challenge to understand this trade o ff. At the same time, it has become clear that unde rstanding an action can haen at various levels of detail. F or examle, one may need to recognize an action, which means to remember what he has seen before. Beyond t his, one may need to imitate an action, or one may need, given an action, to predict what will haen next. Last, one may need to utiliz e action for grounding spoken language . Recognition, imitation, rediction and grounding do not necessarily require the same reresentations. It is a challenge to build differe nt grammatical frameworks for handling the above mentioned four cognitive abilities. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 3 The PI has recently obtained funding from the Euro ean Union for research on these questions, articul arly on the roject POETICON, addressed by a consortium of Universities including the University of Maryland, the Max-Planck Institute for Biological C ybernetics in Germany, the Universities of Genoa an d Ferrara in Italy, the University of Slovenia and th e Institute for Seech and Language in Athens Greec e. The abstract of the POETICON roject follows: POETICON: Reroducing an act with sensorimotor means and usin g fine natural language for communicating the intentionality behind the act is what Aristotle cal led \"Poetics\". POETICON exlores the \"oetics of everyday life\", i.e. the synthesis of sensorimotor representations and n atural language in everyday human interaction . This is related to an old roblem in Artificial I ntelligence on how meaning emerges , which is aroached here in a new way. POETICON fol lows an emirical aroach for reresentations nces in sychology neuroscience, it eml oys cutting-edge equiment and established cognitiv e rotocols for collecting face and body movement mea surements, visual object information and associated linguistic descritions from interacting human subj ects, with a two-fold objective: The creation reresentations and is enriched with information on atterns among these reresentations for forming concetual structures. b) The exloration of the association of symbolic a nd sensorimotor reresentations through cognitive a nd neurohysiological exeriments and with a humanoid robot as driving forces and imlementation tools for the develoment of the PRA XICON, resectively. POETICON views a cognitive system as a set of diffe rent languages (the soken, the motor, the vision language and so on) and rovides a set of tools for arsing, generating and translating among them. Through inter-discilinary research, it contributes to the exloration of what integration in human cognition is and how it can be reroduced by intelligent agents. This is an ambitious first ste for revealing and conquering the \"oetics of everyday life\".

Develo a ublicly available, searchable databas e containing information regarding institutional an d biohysical characteristics of more than 200 cases of social ecological systems including fisheries, community forests, and irrigation systems. 2. Develo a body of theory and associated analytic al tools based on dynamical systems and robust cont rol techniques to study robustness-vulnerability trade -offs inherent for different institutional and biohysical configurations that aear in the data base. 3. Conduct a series of human subject exeriments to characterize the effect of uncertainty and environmental variation on the caacity of grous of resource users to solve common-ool resource dilemmas. Thematic Areas: 1. Cultural, and societal adatation to environment al change 2. Robust control, management of raid change, and decision-making in the face of changing risks and uncertainty. 3. Social change as a rocess mediated by robustnes s-vulnerability trade-offs. Methodologies: This roject combines qualitative analysis of case studies of social ecological systems based on the I AD framework, data from human subject exeriments to d evelo stylized models of social-ecological systems . Models are analyzed using techniques from robust co ntrol, dynamical systems, and bifurcation theory. Recent Research Findings: Based on the analysis of the classical renewable re source model, fundamental sensitivity-erformance trade-offs have been established. Secifically, ol icies sensitivity-erformance roerties for one grou of arameters (which we re fer to as stock and rate of return arameters) necessarily result in worse sensitivity-erformance roerties for another grou (which we refer to as harvest and revenue arameters). Further, we have established exlicit relationshis between aramete r sensitivities - e.g. if a control law reduces sensi tivity to rice uncertainty by X%, sensitivity to u ncertainty about the carrying caacity will increase by Y%.

To instantiate a major database of geosatially- referenced information about existing languages, integrated with a database of all genetic relation shis among languages, already under construction. 2. To create a user-friendly online interface which organizes the linguistic, geograhic, and social s ciences information into customizable ma layers and conte xt-sensitive attribute dislays. 3. To develo flexible tools for querying, annotati ng, discussing, and collecting geo-referenced langu age data. Thematic Areas: 1. Geosatial linguistics 2. Language and culture 3 Data aggregation via web services Methodologies: The rimary facility created by the roject is an o nline GIS installation showing the satial location of languages and digital language resources (e.g., gra mmars, lexicons, audiotaes). The system will host a comrehensive set of language distribution mas, al ong with rich language information, as well as hys ical, cultural and demograhic data. It also incororates a \"Scholar's Workbench,\" an area of the site desig ned to facilitate additional data collection and data anal ysis by scholars (see below). Three methods of data collection are being imlemen ted: a) artnering organizations are roviding acce ss data; b) sources are being harveste d; and c) non-digital mas are b eing digitized and rovided with annotations based on re view of relevant scholarly research. The non-linguistic data made available in the LL-MA P roject is aggregated from ublic sources, which emloy OenGIS rotocols. The linguistic data is be ing gleaned from a number of different rojects (e. g., Ethnologue, WALS, LingMa), as well as from individ ual scholars. the \"Scholars' Workbench,\" linguists are invited to inut geo-referenced data drawn from their own linguistic research; this data can be combined with data already existing on the LL-MAP s ite in order to roduce new mas, which can then be stored on the LL-MAP site or saved and rinted on t he scholar's local machine. Two interfaces are available for viewing the data: an easy-to-use Google Mas interface designed for t he Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 7 general ublic and an ESRI interface which suorts data querying and analysis. Recent Research LL-MAP is an infrastructure roject, without resear ch 'findings' in the usual sense. In addition to develoing both a Google and an ESRI interface for dislaying language data, in the second year of the roject, we have focused on the following tasks: Interface for Harvesting WMS Layers : This interface allows an LL-MAP user to tye in t he URI of a WMS GetCaabilities file and choose ma layers to b e aggregated by the LL-MAP roject. KML Upload Facility : Using the Keyhole Marku Language develoed by Go ogle, we have develod a way to dislay olygons and centroid oints on th e Google ma interface. Development of Core Metadata : we have determined a core set of descritive meta data for the LL- MAP roject. In addition to this, we have determin ed how this metadata will be maed to the elements of the OLAC metadata set Workshop : we held a successful worksho in which roject a rticiants agreed to develo guidelines for the roduction of high quality mas. Challenges and Opportunities: In the second year of the roject, the LL-MAP team has encountered the following challenges: No good model for a linguistic GIS interface exists : numerous tools and services rototyed by ESRI and Google have thus had to re-engineered and exan ded. An aroriate interface has been hard to build. Th e main community of users is not familiar with GIS technology, and the information they seek is very c omlex. The scoe of the roject is greater than that of mo st GIS rojects: it covers the whole world and all its languages, not just henomena within a secific are a. Language mas that already exist were created with different goals than ours (e.g., census data and fieldwork data). Integration has roven difficult. There is no internationally recognized geosatial s tandard for linguistic data. Language data at a sufficient level of granularity is hard to come by. Thus far, we have only been abl e to harvest some data from the U.S census.

Gyimah-Boadi Onyegbula [Nigeria] - UN Mission for Ethioia and Eritrea (As mara, Eritrea) and Paul James-Allen [Sierra Leone] - International Center for Transitio nal Justice Partners: Ghana Center a); Center for Democracy & Develoment (Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria) and Sierra L eone Court Monitoring Program moderators, s, facilitators and student research assistants. Research Goals: This roject examines the consequences of the choic es societies make about how to address ast violati ons of human rights during the course of transitions fr om eriods of violent conflict (e.g., state reress ion, war, genocide), which have been a revalent henomenon a round the world over the last several decades. A k ey contribution is to assess the efficacy of these dec isions about 'transitional justice' from the distin ctive vantage oint of the victims of abuses, whose ers ective is underreresented in related academic and olicy discussions and rarely the subject of intens ive rimary emirical research. As a result, the l atent question of whether or not they accet the measures that are imlemented for the uroses of conflict resolution and democratization remains largely unan swered, though members of the roject team and othe rs have reviously conducted relevant research in Sout h Africa and elsewhere. Our study extends that rior work and seeks to eval uate a wide range of common theoretical roosition s and olicy rescritions by exloring the reciroca l relationshis among (1) transitional justice roc esses, with articular attention aid to recent truth comm issions\u2014designed around the South African model\u2014tha t emhasize articiation by victims; (2) the attitud es and behaviors of victims that are central to the ir agency in the new disensation; and (3) trajectories of o litical and social develoment. The research focus es on four ost-conflict societies in West Africa: Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. These cases af ford a useful cross-section of historical legacies (milita ry regimes, civil war, ethnic conflict) and transit ional justice measures (rosecutions, truth commissions, rearations, institutional reform, amnesty) that ar e closely linked in ractice. The resulting analysis will constitute the first multi-country study in t his field to be based rincially on rimary data collected from victims of human rights violations. In addition, the Liberia comonent will involve unrecedented longit udinal analysis (to assess changes over time) and research in the diasora (to gauge variation by con text). The study design also ermits novel insight s Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 9 concerning the interactions among local, national, regional and international forms of ost-conflict accountability and democracy romotion. Thematic Areas: Political Science Human Rights Conflict Resolution African Studies Law Sociology Psychology Public Health Methodologies: Our basic research framework focuses on collecting extensive rimary data using multile comlementary techniques. The initial ste is to conduct sets of focus grous with key segments of the victim oul ation. (e.g., war wounded, amutees, women, child soldiers ). These moderated discussions (tae recorded for later transcrition and review) delve into the circ umstances of ast conflict and exosures to violenc e, otions for transitional justice, and the nature of attitudes about local and national olitics. The insights from the discussions (and official documents ertai ning to transitional justice institutions) then inf orm the develoment of a survey questionnaire, comrised of a large core of items that is common to all four countries in order to facilitate cross-national com arisons, lus select items added and/or tailored t o reflect individual country contexts. The next ste (follow ing training of fieldworkers, including a ilot tes t of the questionnaire) is to administer the survey to a bro adly reresentative samle of victims. (The Liberia study differs in that small numbers of resondents were r ecruited from the general oulation as well as the diasora, to rovide further bases of intra-case co marison.) The resonses are entered (from electro nic files generated by scanning the comleted questionn aires on site) to allow statistical and content ana lyses. The final ste is to conduct oen-ended interviews with a small sub-set of the survey resondents, to investigate issues in greater deth and (together w ith the material from the focus grous) rovide exlanations and illustrations that enrich the quan titative results. In addition, a second wave of da ta collection will be comleted in Liberia\u2014using a an el aroach\u2014after the truth commission has conclude d its activities, rojected for late-2008 or early-20 09. Recent Research Findings: Since the roject is in its first year and data col lection remains ongoing, no analytical results are available to summarize at this stage. We can, however, reor t significant rogress: 1. Focus Groups : four 1-3 hour sessions, consisting of 6-15 artic iants aiece, conducted in Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (Ghana was omitted because collaborators had reviously engaged in substantia l research concerning the National Reconciliation Com mission rocess). 2. Questionnaire : large roster of items develoed, translated from English into 16 English as a verification check, and comiled into bilingual (English +) versions.

Data Processing : double entry nearly comleted for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana surveys, to be followed by reconciliation and cleaning; coding of qualitative material currently being arranged. Challenges and Opportunities: We have faced several major hurdles in organizing a nd imlementing the roject. One is the difficulty of undertaking large-scale fieldwork in multile count ries, where a crucial consideration is the coordina tion of the substantive research agendas (to ermit rigorou s and meaningful comarisons) and the schedules of roject activities (to use time and resources as ef ficiently as ossible, under constraints of availab ility, travel arameters, weather, olitical events, etc.) . Finalizing the many translations and comiling c ontact lists of victims roved to be esecially demanding tasks. Another is the comlications resented by t hese articular countries, including oor infrastructure (electricity, technology, communications, roads, e tc.), a lack of exerience with survey research, and limite d availability of necessary information. Access ha s been a modest (but surmountable) issue in some locations . Local cultural ractices have also intervened, w ith the most notable instance being an incident where t hree fieldworkers thought they had been attacked by a devil. In addition, the relationshis with certain of the country and organizational artners have no t always been smooth, resulting in unanticiated delays, occ asional distress and financial disutes. Desite the roblems that have arisen, we feel that we managed to accomlish a remarkable amount in a relatively short eriod, even exanding the volume (increasing the number of resondents) and scoe (adding the Liberia diasora comonent) of data col lection well beyond what we envisioned at the roo sal stage, which we exect will enhance the utility of the final roducts. In the rocess, we have devise d research rotocols and instruments, as well as form ulated oerational strategies, that can be alied in other settings. We have also caitalized uon this roje ct to develo close(r) relationshis with many of t he collaborators and to invest in meaningful caacity building at an individual, organizational and inter - organizational level that we believe will have long -term value. Interactions among this network and i n the course of the fieldwork have highlighted the rose cts for broader imacts in areas such as olicy des ign and evaluation, research methodology and ethics, an d edadogy.

Networked Stanford/UCSB virtual classroom. In what we believe to be the first use of networked immersive virtual reality studying virtual classroo ms across long distances, we have demonstrated that virtual classrooms offer affordances that face-to-f ace grou instruction settings do not. Our study featured two students from searate universities wh o saw networked virtual avatars of one another and a recording of a virtual teacher giving a lesson. V ia retesting, we determined a 'good sot' (close t o the teacher) and a 'bad sot' (far from the teacher) wi thin the virtual classroom, and demonstrated about a 15 ercentage oint swing in exam scores based on l earning material between the two sots. Our exeriment transformed virtual sace such that both students exerienced the room from the 'good sot' simultaneously while thinking the other student was is in the 'bad sot'. We showed that as a dyad, students liked the teacher more and were more influ enced by course materials in this transformed condition than in various controls. Moreover, on t he technological side, the accomlishments involved in getting a networked virtual classroom functionin g between Stanford and UCSB were substantial. 2. The Proteus Effect. Cybersace grants us great con trol over our self-reresentations. At the click of a button, we can alter our gender, age, attractivenes s, and skin tone. But as we choose our avatars onli ne, do our avatars change us in turn? In a series of st udies, we've exlored how utting eole in avatars of different attractiveness or height change how they behave in a virtual environment. We have demonstrated that when subjects look in a virtual m irror and see themselves as attractive, they behave more socially inside VR and then also have more con fidence in dating tasks later on outside of VR than various control conditions. Similar effects occur with avatar height and negotiation tasks. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 12 Challenges and Opportunities One of the biggest challenges is exanding our rese arch from laboratory studies to larger scale oortunities. The ast year has demonstrated a hu ge increase in the amount of time eole are sendi ng in social worlds such as Second Life. Extending ou r work to these online arenas in which eole use avatars naturalistically resents an amazing social science research oortunity. Our research demons trates the imlications of using any digital environment\u2014 eole can transform their own avatars in terms of aearance, behavior, and location. By doing so, t hey can gain large amounts of social influence and other advantages. Consequently it is crucial to understa nd how large these effects are, and how often they are occurring in the \"natural\" world of social networki ng websites, online dating, networked video games, and virtual worlds.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 13 Project Title: Integrating Socio-ecological Sciences Through a Com munity Modeling Framework Proposal #: 0623162 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead PI: C. Michael Barton, Arizona State University Co-PIs: 1, University of Alaska, Anchorage Marco Janssen, Arizona State University Collaborators: Sander van der Leeuw, Arizona State University Steven Lansing, University of Arizona Sean Bergin, Arizona State University (Graduate Re search Assistant) Allen Lee, Arizona State University (Technician, rogrammer) Research Goals: Agent based models (ABMs) have recently emerged as a romising category of research tools to study the dynamics of comlex human and biological systems, i ntegrating individual ercetions and behaviors in the contexts behavioral ecology, game theory of dec ision-making, and geosatial reresentations of the world. While ABMs are much discussed and are raid ly becoming erceived as a requirement for cutting- edge research centering on human- environmental int eraction, most social and natural scientists still have a limited awareness of their otential, and the exer imental nature of most ABM latforms revents them from being readily accessible to researchers. Furth ermore, a lack of standards has inhibited the excha nge of modeling exertise and cumulative model building am ong different research teams, and there has been little effort at systematically addressing roblems of validation and verification in modeling algorit hms and results. Recent Research Activities: We roose to address these issues and accelerate t he regular integration of ABMs for research in soci al- natural dynamics by initiating a broad, community-w ide agenda involving active researchers ranging fro m content exerts in the social sciences, ecology, co nservation biology and GIS, to comuter scientists and mathematicians. This initiative was launched by a lanning worksho in March 2006, that brought togeth er leading ractitioners from across the USA.

Constructal Theory 2. Social Dynamics Recent Research Findings: The community of scholars took shae in the first y ear, when we attracted an international grou of seakers and articiants at the first worksho on Constructal Theory of Social Dynamics (CTSD) held a t Duke in Aril 2006. We doubled the articiation i n the second CTSD worksho, which we ran at Duke on 23-24 Aril 2007. The major themes of the works ho were organization in nature, animal behavior, a nd many social atterns of organization such as migrat ion, war, conflict, human-environment equilibria, cororate sustainability, resilience, eidemics, et c. The main finding is that this aradigm touches a li ve nerve in the scientific community. The interest is great and growing. Many of the articiants in the 2007 CTSD worksho came from the grou of resenters gathered at the NSF HSD review meeting h eld in Setember 2006 in Washington. It was there that we found that many of the HSD-sonsored rojec ts are united by the search for deterministic exlanations and redictions of social design, and that constructal theory offers a common table of discussion. We, the Duke CTSD team are so encouraged by the gro wth of the constructal theory community that we lan to continue this activity of exanding the the ory in human social dynamics, beyond 2007. The rogress made by our roject forms the subject of the new book \"Constructal Theory of Social Dynamics\", A. Bejan and G.W. Merkx, eds, Sringer, New York, 2007.

We are interested in: 1 ) the degree to which the region's changing socio-dem ograhic character will lead to changes in what is valued and roduced as CPR; 2) how individuals orga nize to effect change in the olicies and regulatio ns that guide CPR roduction; and 3) the ability of l ace-based decision-making to match the demand for w ith the suly of CPR through time. To understand how s ociety manages common ool resources we must understand how: 1. different tyes of stakeholders value alternativ e CPR and ecosystem services. 2. land use/land cover olicy is formulated and im lemented, 3. individuals mange land use/land cover to maximiz e individual utility given constraints associated w ith olicies and regulations, economics, and socio-dem ograhic context, and 4. individuals organize to effect change in these c onstraints and, thus, effect change in what and how CPR are roduced and sustained. To hel exlore the dynamic and comlex set of inte ractions among decision-makers and between decision - makers and the environment we will develo a model of land use olicy, land use/land cover change, and the management of common ool resources.

Conduct interviews with local stakeholders to bette r understand: a) local olitical and administrative rocesses; b) what ecosystem services are imortant to local inhabitants; c) the affect of socio- demograhic factors on decision-making; and d) the role of lace, coalition-based decision-making, and social networks in land use/land cover decisions. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 16 2. Conduct surveys to further elucidate what is imort ant to stakeholders and quantify the relative value of ecosystem services. In our roosal we outlined a two hased aroach; 1) a scoing survey would be develoed to build on knowledge gained from relimi nary interviews and; 2), building on the interviews and scoing survey, a choice exeriment would be conducted to quantify relative ecosystem value. While a choice exeriment remains a viable aroach, knowledge gained suggests that hedonic modeling might roduce data that is more alicable to our study. A final decision on methodology will be made this fall. 3. Oen-ended interviews and Q-methodology will be use d to evaluate whether and to what degree interest grous, decision-makers, and olicy imlementers co here and organize around common themes or coalitions as they organize and innovate to control the roduction and flow of valued ecosystem services. 4. Intensive survey of all subdivision alications fo r the three study counties over the last 25 years w ill be conducted and subjected to coding for levels of reg ulation and forms of mitigation for quantitative analysis of changes in the rate and tye of growth controls in the study area. 5. A reconstruction of levels and tyes of articiati on in the lanning rocess will be conducted with results subjected to tyological coding to assess t he changing tyes of agents active in land use lan ning in the region and their role in, and effect uon, t he regulatory rocess. 6. An agent-based model will be develoed to cature t he dynamic nature of land use/land cover decision making and the roduction of CPR. Recent Research Findings: We are in the first year of our study and, thus, ha ve not yet roduced conclusive research findings. We can, however, reort significant rogress on meetin g the goals of this roject. Accomlishments to da te include the: 1. Comletion of interviews with local administrators and oliticians designed to: 1) better understand t he decision-making rocesses of ublic sector decision -makers; 2) identify influential individuals within the communities; 3) get reliminary information on issues of concern to stakeholders (articularly ecosystem services). Note these interviews and oth ers associated with, for examle, social networks a re an ongoing element of our work. 2. Develoment of a scoing survey based on interviews and the literature to more formally assess what is imortant to area inhabitants. We assessed the for mat and content of this survey through two focus grou meetings and adjusted the survey accordingly. This survey has been sent out to 1200 households within the study area. 3. Develoment and organization of satial and asatia l databases needed to suort research and modeling efforts. 4. Develoment of the agent-based modeling framework f or land use olicy, land use/land cover change, and the management of common ool resources. Much of this early work has focused on develoing a modeling framework designed to hel researchers ver ify, validate, and exlore ABMs of comlex adative satial systems (CASS), like the one under investigation. This framework is being imlemented using a simlified version of our event ual ABM of CPR management. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 17 5. Results of archival analysis of subdivision records , couled with oral histories of changes in the lanning rocess reveal: a) that the makeu of stak eholders in this shifting regulatory environment ha s shifted from interests reresenting local agricultu ral financial institutions to those reresenting ou t-of- state develoment interests; and b) that desite mo mentum towards growth control, existing regulatory frameworks (secured under revious economic regimes ) force lanning officials and boards towards tacit and indirect growth mitigation efforts, which deend heavily on informal social networks. Dissemination of research findings 1. Concets associated with the ABM-CASS framework have been resented in a lenary session at the Workshop on Agent-based Modeling of Complex Spatial Systems held in Santa Barbara, CA (Bennett, D.A., 2007. \"Reresentation and \"Mobile Aware In telligent Agents\" (Bennett and Tang forthcoming) in Understanding Dynamics of Geographic Domains , edited by M. Yuan and K. Stewart. CRC Press/Taylor & Francis. 2. Results roduced from the archival analysis of s ubdivision records will be reviewed in a research aer under develoment for the journal Land Use Policy with an anticiated comletion date of December 2007. 3. A review aer on old west/new west transformati on rocesses is under develoment for the Social Science Journal with an anticiated comletion date of December 20 07. 4. Over the next six months we also anticiate that journal articles will be develoed from the result s of our work on verifying, validating and exloring AB M for CASS and the scoing survey. Challenges and Opportunities: 1. Winning the confidence and cooeration of local decision-makers roved challenging. Focus grou discussions, in articular, brought to light conce rns that some stakeholders had about our intentions and objectives. Once identified, this rovided an o ortunity for oen and honest debate that allowed u s to identify articular terms and hrases used in the draft survey that rovoked concern. We believe th at this rocess resulted in an imroved final survey and hel to build a stronger working relation with local stakeholders. 2. From discussions with international researchers conducting similar work, it is aarent that the rocesses that drive change in our study area are similar to those in high amenity regions worldwide. We see oortunities for cross-cultural comarativ e studies on the management of common ool resources. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 18 Project Title: Creating Dynamic Social Network Models from Senso r Data Proposal #: 0433637 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics of Human Behavior Bilmes, University of Washington Co-PIs: Tanzeem Choudhury, Intel Research; James Kitts, Columbia University of Washington; Henry Kautz, Unive rsity of Rochester Research Goals: Social networks are widely recognized as crucial fo r understanding social dynamics, including the sre ad of diseases, the dissemination of beneficial health r actices, and the mobilization of terrorist cells. A lthough we know that social networks are imortant for conveyi ng information and changes in behavior, we know rel atively little about the way social networks themselves evo lve over time. The goals of this roject are to: 1. Develo tools for making direct automated measur ements of face-to-face interaction network over tim e. Cature the structures of social interaction over t ime using wearable sensors that collect streaming d ata on research articiants' hysical location, seech, a nd motion. 2. Develoing comutational models to infer structu res of social interaction from these data. 3. Validate our methods and communicate to the soci al science research community by emloying conventional survey and observation designs in tand em with sensor-based tools. Our team includes exerts from both Comuter Scienc e and Sociology, integrates tools from both fields, and addresses questions that would be intractable witho ut this interdiscilinary lens. Methodologies: Develoment of Instruments In the first hase of this roject, we develoed a new wearable sensing latform for collecting multi- modal data from interactions, activities and location. The har dware included a small sensor board and an iPAQ oc ket PC and is accomanied by software that we develoed fo r synchronizing and rocessing the various data str eams (audio, acceleration, light, temerature, signal st rength from WiFi access oints, etc.). This year we revised our hardware data collection latform to suort more e xtensive embedded rocessing of sensor streams whic h allows us to rocess sensory streams in real-time a nd erform simle inference tasks (e.g. detect when someone is seaking, walking etc.). The new sensor latform is self-contained and more comact than the revio us version and does not require an iPAQ for data roce ssing and storage. Data collection We have comleted the second year (2006-07) of data collection using the new sensor latform. The firs t year of data collection was done during the 2005-6 academic year. In order to model the formation and evolutio n of a social network from a natural initial state, we foc used on caturing the interactions between the stud ents in a moderately-sized graduate rogram. We recruited 17 incoming students in a graduate rogram in the al ied sciences at the University of Washington. Data coll ection began with a 're-survey' administered by e- mail in late summer, before students arrived at the school. Sensor data collection began during the first week of class, in late Setember. We have now comleted 10 consecutive months of data collection. In each month, we collected one week of time-stamed wearable sensor data and also adminis tered a survey with standard sociometric measures. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 19 Probabilistic Models of Interactions and Activities An imortant focus of the research is to develo al gorithms that can cature various roerties of fac e-to-face interactions and build comutational models of soci al dynamics using sensors and robabilistic learnin g techniques. The first ste in modeling face-to-face communication is to detect the individual interact ions between our research subjects. This year we develo ed a new robabilistic technique for detecting conv ersations involving more than two individuals which erforms significantly better than our reviously develoed model. The new model can handle the resence of other indi viduals who are not wearing sensors (e.g. eole wh o are not subjects in our study) but who articiate in c onversations with our subjects. We have also devel oed robabilistic models for inferring location from we arable sensor data. We are currently develoing alg orithms for inferring social network grahs based on the de tected conversations and with the aim of otimizing the network structure for a given temoral granularity. We will also extract additional conversational ro erties (e.g. duration, turn-taking etc.) and investigate a roaches to cluster the interactions into grous t hat corresond to social roles. Recent Research Findings: We have develoed highly accurate rivacy-sensitive methods for (1) automatically finding multi-erson conversations in sontaneous, situated seech data and (2) segmenting those conversations into seaker turns. The methods rotect rivacy through a feature set t hat is rich enough to cature conversational styles and dynamics, but not sufficient for reconstructing int elligible seech. The conversation finding method o uterforms earlier aroaches and the seaker segmentation met hod is a significant imrovement over the only othe r known rivacy-sensitive method for seaker segmentation. The conversation segmentation algorithm is then a lied to the aligned streams to automatically segmen t conversations and seakers from the data streams co llected throughout multile days and weeks. Based o n the results, mas of social networks atterns are creat ed (we currently build a static network grah for a week given the conversation data - this will be relaced by th e robabilistic method we are develoing to infer n etwork structure which will be dynamic and able to handle different temoral resolutions). We have rocessed several weeks of survey resonses and comuted grah agreement metrics between the survey and conversation data. Our agreements are si gnificantly better than the agreement between the s urvey grah and random grahs with exected densities equ al to the observed grahs. However, the survey and sensor- based network are not identical but the difference we see is consistent with earlier results. We will try other similarity metrics used in social network analysis next ---starting with the degree distributions and clustering coefficients.

Each sublot deicts one day's conversation attern, where x-axis is time and y-axis is the subject IDs. The color-coding in the lots grous multile indi viduals articiating in a given conversation day and Thursday multile eole are groued togeth er when they attend a class in the morning). Seaker segmen tation (not shown here) isolates time chunks within a conversation when a given user seaks. Challenges and Opportunities: We encountered several roblems during the data re -rocessing stage which delayed the analysis of the data. The survey resonses had error that had need carefu l insection before filtering out or correcting a r esonse (e.g. an incorrect class entry was checked against ublis hed class schedule and resonse to other survey que stions). Furthermore, some subjects failed to synchronize th eir devices with the central time server, which res ulted in time misaligned streams where the offset was not kn own. We evaluated different techniques to align our data (e.g. multile sequence alignment, normalized cross -correlation technique) - the normalized cross-corr elation technique rovided the best erformance in a develo ment dataset and was used to align the larger data set. We have collected several thousand hours of data ab out individual's conversations, locations, and acti vities - the largest data set of its kind, which will allow us to models network dynamics at various temoral r esolutions that wouldn't be ossible otherwise. This rich data set rovides a unique oortunity to understand and investigate how social networks form and evolve ove r time - we are excited to continue our current wor k on develoing richer models of dynamic social networks in the coming year.

Establish an intellectual agenda 2. dentify a community of researchers 3. Develo a research rogram on the design of soci o-technical infrastructures enabling forgetting and exclusion 4. Establish groundwork for submission of a full re search roosal to the Human and Social Dynamics rogram in 2007. 5. Hosting of an invitational interdiscilinary two -day worksho where researchers discuss and delineate the contours of future resea rch, theoretical, methodological, and emirical, in this area. Thematic Areas: 1. Current climates and forgetting: Why now? 2. Case studies and examles of forgetting 3. Embedding forgetting and exclusion within the d esign rocess Methodologies: Our aroach consists of synthesizing forgetting among the in o ur Aril worksho, cul tural geograhy, comuter science, information syst ems design, archives and electronic records, social tec hnology studies, film and video, art criticism and theory, information science, anthroology, and organization al studies. From this diverse range of discilines, we have develoed a two by two matrix to formulate var ious aroaches to forgetting. Along one axis, we have distinguished between descritive and normativ e aroaches, while along the other axis we have distinguished between concetual and emirical orie nted research. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 22 Examles of 2 concetual work include: consideratio ns for active forgetting, develoing a descritive tyology of forgetting that examines the current ra nge of forgetting ractices, or formulating an information olicy latform that establishes the no rms for forgetting. Examles of emirical work incl ude an imact assessment of articiatory systems on ex ectations of rivacy and forgetting among diverse user oulations, an exloratory look at the ways i n which individuals are subverting ubiquitous data cature and the motivations to do so, a historical aroach of forgetting that looks at olicies of da ta retention among a varied states and organizations. The full develoment of this matrix is still in ro gress and will be finalized to hel inform a future full research roosal to the Human and Social Dynamics rogram in 2007. Recent Research Findings: Our objective for the worksho was to articulate an d rioritize a set of comelling ideas related to s ocial and cultural asects of forgetting, and to develo and sharen an agenda for subsequent research, scholarshi, design, and creative work in this emer ging area of inquiry. Our worksho roduced a number of descritive and n ormative investigations into ractices, technologie s and behaviors that might influence social forgettin g. While we are still in the rocess of fully artic ulating our findings, roosals for theoretical, methodolog ical and emirical aroaches to forgetting and exclusion will be develoed for roosals to be ot entially submitted to NSF rograms such as the Scie nce and Society (S&S), Cyber Trust solicitation, and In formation and Intelligent Systems solicitations. Challenges and Opportunities: Our current work rovides for amle oortunities t o begin considering emirical cases. More secifica lly, the overall consensus from our worksho articiant s was the need to look in-deth at various modes of forgetting in the current data landscae. In additi on, our current work has established the initial fo undations for the develoment of a network of scholars that c an exlicitly shae the current discourse on ubiqui tous comuting along several dimension including ethics, olicy, design. Conversely, as storage technologies have gained in racticality and droed in rice, the shift to an electronic medium has changed the default osition from one of forgetfulness to one of remembering. Th is larger cultural shift imoses great challenges to o ur research as it becomes increasingly difficult to create demands and incentives for forgetting and rivacy. As such, challenges to our roject consist of ident ifying sites and cases that exlicitly consider forgetting , rather than its counteroint, remembering. Furthe r challenges include the develoment of system of eva luation and metrics to evaluate forgetting, which b y definition does not leave tangible traces. Addition ally, given the interdiscilinary nature of this r oject, further challenges also include identifying a commo n framework that fully reresents the range of ersectives on this toic.

HSD Area: Dynamics of Human Behavior Lead PI: Steven Boker, University of Virginia Co-PIs: Jeffrey Cohn, Simon Matthews, Barry Brick, Lala Ambadar, Michael Villano, Kathleen Ashenfelter, Si mon Baker Research Goals: 1. Evaluate the contributions of timing and amlitu de modulation of nonverbal cues on the dyadic conversation by indeendently modulating the timin g and extent of head movements, facial exressions, and vocal itch. 2. Evaluate effects of gender on conversational coo rdination by relacing the image used to reconstruc t an avatar with the image of a erson of oosite gend er and by modifying vocal formants to be those of a erson of oosite gender. 3. Build a combined differential equations and com utational model for coordinated head motion and evaluate this model from ratings of ``naturalness' ' and by testing the extent to which comuter anima ted motions generated by the model in real time roduc e aroriate feedback resonse in the human conversants. Thematic Areas: 1. Coordination dynamics, social cues, and exressi on of affect during conversation. 2. Automated tracking and real-time video synthesis of facial exressions. Methodologies: Two articiants seak with one another over closed circuit video. The video is back-rojected and a miniature video camera is arranged so that conversa nts see each other life size aroximately 1.5m fro m each other and eye gaze is correct within 5 degrees of visual angle. One conversant is a confederate and motion tracked and the face that the other (naive) conversant sees has been maniulated and resynthesi zed and the voice that they hear has been rocessed. M aniulations include timing delays, reduced affect (both in facial exression and in vocal inflection), and erson/gender substitution. In the reduced affect and erson substitution conditions, new algorithms were develoed as art of the roject. Person substitu tion tracks the facial exressions and head motions of t he confederate and alies these to Active Aearan ce Models (AAMs) constructed from reviously recorded video of another erson. When there is a change in gender of the aarent conversant, the vocal charac teristics are rocessed using formant algorithms to itch shift the voice to an aroriate register. This novel methodology is, to our knowledge, unique and is transformative in that it allows a broad ra nge of sychological questions to be addressed that re viously were not racticable. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 24 Recent Research Findings: We found evidence of comensatory mechanisms in am litude and velocity of head movements during conversation such that when amlitude of head movem ents, facial movements, or vocal inflections were reduced in the avatar or when the avatar was delaye d, naive conversants roduced more animated head movements. Confederates were blind to when these m aniulations were resent or not resent. The comensatory increase in animation may be linked to a ercetion by the naive conversant of deressed affect in the confederate. Mild deression is ofte n associated with reduced and/or delayed facial aff ect and vocal inflection and can elicit comensatory reson ses in conversational artners. In the erson substitution exeriment each of two c onfederates ``wore the face'' of three different e rsons, him or her self, someone of the same sex and someon e of the oosite sex. Vocal rocessing was always in effect and vocal register was shifted to be gend er aroriate. Confederates were blind as to whic h erson they aeared to be. Preliminary analyses s that male-female, and female-fema le dyads followed reviously observed atterns when ge nder had not been substituted and followed the dynamics of the confederates movements and not the aearance of the face when gender had been substituted. Challenges and Opportunities: This methodology oens u broad new areas of inquir y in which hysical aearance can be erson in an aarently face-to-face convers ation. The next challenge will be to roduce a redictive cognitive model of head and facial movem ents that can be substituted in a believable way fo r the actual movements and exressions of the confederate . This model will take us a large ste closer to understanding the dynamics of nonverbal exression.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 25 Project Title: A Longitudinal Analysis of the Social Dynamics of E nvironmental Equity in Baltimore Proposal #: 0624159 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of Change Lead PI: Christoher G. Boone, Arizona State University Co-PIs: Geoffrey Buckley, J. Morgan Grove, Charles Lord, Austin Troy Research Goals: 1. Analyze how the satial atterns of environmenta l equity\u2014defined by access to environmental amenities and disamenities\u2014have changed over time and whether or not such atterns satially correlate more with race/ethnicity or socioeconomi c status. 2. Identify the social and institutional rocesses that drive atterns of amenities and disamenities. 3. Determine if the atterns of oulation charact eristics shift at certain threshold densities of amenities and disamenities and if oulation characteristics resond to raid rates of change in amenity and disamenity densities. Thematic Areas: 1. Environmental justice 2. Social and institutional dynamics 3. Land use dynamics and decision-making Methodologies: The roject melds GIS, satial statistics, historic al, and legal inquiry to examine the dynamics of environmental justice atterns and rocesses in Bal timore over the long term, from 1880 to the resent . For attern analysis of environmental disamenities, we use data from the EPA Toxic Releases Inventory for the eriod 1990 to 2000. For the eriod from 1960 to 19 80, we use the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Regional Directories to extract location data for heavy manu facturing (SIC divisions 20-29), electric utilities wholesalers (SIC 5169), and etroleum terminals (SIC 5171), which match th e SIC categories for TRI sites. This dataset is sul emented with Baltimore City Directories, Commercial Directories, and Hokins and Sanborn atlases to det ermine the location of ower generating stations, chemicals wholesalers, a nd etroleum terminals for the eriod 1880 to 1950. For social data, we use the census, including a histori cal GIS of census data already generated by the gro u. Manuscrit census data is being samled by enumerat ion district for the re-1940 eriod in order to imrove satial resolution of the data. Where resid ential land classes are available, we reaortion c ensus data using daysmetric techniques. For the analysis of the atterns over time, we use the Cumulative Hazardous Density Index develoed by Bolin et al. ( 2002) to measure the concentration of olluting or likely olluting industry, and also emloy Geograh ically Weighted Regression, to assess the satial nonstationarity of the relationshis between ollut ing industry and social characteristics of neighbor hoods (Mennis and Jordan 2005). For rocess analysis, we examine historical decisions in the courts and othe r institutions that imact the distribution of social grous and industry. A grou of legal students, fo r instance, is examining the variances ermitted to s ee if any clear satial atterns emerge and whether they corresond to neighborhoods of the least advantaged oulations. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 26 For the analysis of amenities, we chose to examine the distribution of arks and recreation saces to measure accessibility versus social characteristics . We define accessibility as within walking distanc e from a ark, using the common standard of 400 meters (1/ 4 mile). Using the dasyemtric layers, we examine th e social characteristics of those living within and b eyond a 400-meter buffer of the arks. GWR is also used to examine nonstationarity in the relationshis. Fo r the rocess analysis, we examine historical documentation, including ark commission reorts, t o exlain decision making regarding the lacement o f arks. For both the amenity and disamenity analyse s, we will analyze the longitudinal data to test fo r resonse or lag characteristics between environment al equity atterns and socioeconomic atterns. Recent Research Findings: The team recently comleted a aer that examines t he distribution of arks in the Baltimore Metrooli tan Region in relation to the residential atterns of d ifferent socioeconomic grous. We find that a highe r roortion of African Americans have access to ark s within walking distance, defined as 400 meters or less, than whites, but whites have access to more a creage of arks within walking distance than blacks . Similarly, more low income census block grous tend to be closer to arks, but have walking access to fewer acres er caita than high income census bloc k grous. A needs-based assessment shows that areas with the highest need have the best access to arks but also have access to less acreage of arks com ared to low-need areas. The greater accessibility to ar ks for blacks than whites is in site of a long his tory of neglecting and ignoring recreational needs of black Baltimoreans. The dynamics of metroolitan growth, fueled in art by racism and fear, led to white fli ght from the city and black inheritance of much of Baltimore's sace, including its arks. We argue th at a combination of outcome and rocess analyses ca n imrove understanding of environmental justice dyna mics. Challenges and Opportunities: The team has been working on methodologies for data sharing, given the distributed nature of the resea rch team, and the variety of data sources it uses. To a ddress the satial comonents of the roject and secifically the question of how satial atterns o f environmental equity change over time we have bee n comiling an extensive collection of historical dat a in a geodatabase. Much of the effort has been foc used on the \"geo-enabling\" of historical data; that is t aking data that is satial in nature but contains n o georeferencing information and associating the data with a location or area on the earth's surface (e. g. scanned mas). Realizing that this information has considerable value to the ublic that is increasing ly aware of geosatial technology due to the revalenc e of freely available virtual globe software such a s Google Earth we have develoed techniques for makin g this data available in the Keyhole Marku Language (KML). This will rovide the ublic with a mechanism to view the data comiled as art of thi s roject in a format that is interactive and suort s the integration of other satial datasets. The da ta sharing challenge will likely evolve into an excellent oo rtunity for the Baltimore Ecosystem Study and its artners, within and beyond the LTER network, to de velo new, user-friendly data sharing methods.

Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 28 Project Title: The Uninformed Traders' View Of Particiation In Fi nancial Markets With Insiders: A Game Against Nature Or Against An Intentional Agen t? Proposal #: SES-0527491 HSD Emphasis Area: Decision Making, Risk and Uncertainty (DRU) Lead PI: Peter Bossaerts, California Institute of Technology and Swiss Finance Institute Co-PIs: Steven Quartz, California Institute of Technology John Ledyard, California Institute of Technology Other: Antoine Bruguier, California Institute of Technolo gy Research Goals: 1. Discover how humans make inference about financi al markets 2. Locate where this inference takes lace in the b rain 3. Find what makes a good trader Thematic Areas: 1. Financial Markets with Insiders 2. Theory of Mind (ToM) 3. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) Methodologies: How do eole understand stock markets? Finance sug gests that they use an aroach based on statistica l modeling. Here, we hyothesize instead that success ful traders use Theory of Mind (ToM). In its classi cal definition, ToM is the ability to attribute to othe r eole beliefs and intentions different from one' s own. Humans use ToM to redict other eole's behavior a nd act in accordance with these redictions. Our hyothesis is more general however: we osit that h umans use ToM to understand a comlex, anonymous social structure. If true, such result would have w ide imlications, both in theory and in ractice. We devised three exeriments. In the first one, we recruited 20 subjects to trade on an electronic lab oratory stock exchange. In this carefully controlled setu, we let subjects anonymously trade one stock and on e bond. At the end of the exeriment, we rewarded the subjects according to erformance. During this exeriment, we resented two tyes of trading sessi ons. In the first tye of sessions (test sessions), some of the subjects (\"insiders\") had suerior knowledge of the ayout of the stock while others (\"outsider\") did not. In the second tye of session (control session ), all the subjects were outsiders. With this labor atory design, we recorded realistic trading data while at the same time controlling for the diffusion of information. During the second exeriment, we used fMRI to colle ct brain data. We relayed the reviously recorded trading in front of new subjects and analyzed their brain activity by contrasting the two tyes of ses sions. Subjects did not make any financial decisions; inde ed, we focused exclusively on the ercetion of a market. This design has the crucial advantage that decision-making rocesses do not interfere with our data analysis. However, subjects were exosed to risk in the following way. They could lace a \"blind bet\" (i.e. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 29 there was no strategy involved) and were aid accor ding to the original bet. According to our hyothes is, we redict that brain regions known to articiate in ToM (and not mathematics) will activate. We then erformed a behavioral exeriment that cons isted of four tests. The first test measured the ab ility to redict rice changes in a financial market. Two other tests measured ToM abilities on a continuous scale. Finally, we added a test that measured mathe matical abilities. We based this test on tyical qu estions asked to job seekers in the finance industry. Accor ding to our hyothesis, we redicted that financial abilities would correlate with both ToM tests and n ot with the mathematical tests. Conversely, if trad ers do not use ToM, we exect financial skills to correlat e only with the mathematical test. Recent Research Findings : Previous findings had demonstrated that ToM areas o f the brain (Paracingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala) were activated in the case where insiders were resent. Our study is the first, however, to find these regions activated when we subjects are confro nted with an anonymous social structures. Indeed, e very revious study comared the ercetion of one human against a non-human baseline. In our case, we involve the same amount of human interaction in bot h treatments; therefore, the activations we see are only due to the market itself. Behavioral results strongly corroborated fMRI resul ts. We observed ositive and significant correlatio ns between the two ToM tests and the financial atitud es (=0.048 and =0.023). There was no correlation with the mathematical test (>0.20). These results contradict finance theory. Indeed, in the tradition al view, finance treats markets as mechanical structures and models them with a robabilistic aroach. Here we rove that, on the contrary, they are erceived and better redicted when we take a ToM-based aroach . Our results also challenge traditional recruitment techniques; it may be more efficient to select trad ers by measuring their ToM atitudes. Challenges and Opportunities : An oen question comes from the lack of recise def inition of \"Theory of Mind.\" One surrising result is that the two ToM tests do not correlate. This sugge sts that ToM is not a one-dimensional set of abilit ies, as reviously though. These results extend our underst anding of ToM but make clear the need for a recise definition. Psychologists will need to define this currently loosely defined term in order to comrehe nd it fully. These results oen a second avenue of investigation . While the use of ToM may be beneficial for some traders, it remains unclear whether over-use of ToM is resonsible for wild stock market fluctuations, such as bubbles and crashes. Our results suggest that fi nancial regulatory bodies should base their rules o n a ToM-based aroach instead of mathematical models, as it is currently the case. The need for better regulation was made esecially evident by the heavy losses quantitative hedge funds recently suffered. Finally, we would like to investigate in the future the abilities of autistic atients to understand s tock markets. Peole with Aserger's syndrome (AS) or hi gh-functioning autism (HFA) are able to seak and understand the mechanics of a stock market. However , will they erform as well as control subjects? Wh ile it is still debated that autism is an imairment of ToM, a carefully controlled exeriment should allo w us to test whether autism imairs the understanding of a market. Traditional finance theory redicts that it is not the case, but we redict that the abilities of HFA/ AS atients will be significantly lower than the on e of a oulation matched on other cognitive measures (suc h as intelligence or education level).

Recent Research Findings: We have develoed grounded understandings of social and organizational comlexity resent in roducing shared scientific information infrastructure while investigating three interoerability aroaches: me tadata standards, ontologies, and references see htt://interoerability.ucsd.edu. Information infr astructure has been reviewed (Bowker et al, forthco ming); modes of engagement identified (Ribes and Baker, 20 interoerability strategies described (Ribes a nd Bowker, forthcoming; Millerand and Bowker, forthcom ing) and community interventions elaborated (Baker and Millerand 2005, 2006; Millerand and Bake r, forthcoming; Karasti et al, 2006, forthcoming). Our findings foreground the long-term and heterchro nic features of collaborative work and information infrastructure design.

Collaborators: Los Angeles Police Deartment, Long Beach Police D eartment Research Goals: The rimary goals of the roject DHB: Mathematical and Simulation Modeling of Crime are: (1) develo comutational and analytical models of crime atter n formation; (2) assess the degree to which crime atterns are redictable based on these satial mod els; and (3) test model crime systems against recen t crime data. Our discrete comutational models have focused on s o-called agent- or individual-based simulations bui lt at the emirical scale of criminal behavior. Analy tical models focus on the continuum limits of the d iscrete cases, which lead to advection-reaction-diffusion t ye artial differential equation (PDE) models. Te sting of both the discrete and analytical models has conc entrated on satio-temoral atterns of crime in Lo s Angeles and Long Beach, CA. Thematic Areas: 1. Crime atterns formation. 2. Agent-based modeling. 3. PDE modeling. Methodologies: The core remise underlying the discrete models is that crimes occur when motivated offenders and otential targets/victims convergence in time and s ace in the absence of any security measures. Usin g this ersective the routine movement of offenders, vict ims and security, within variously structured environments, is deemed to be the major cause of em ergent crime atterns. Our work to oerationalize this view of crime has concentrated on develoment of bo th discrete comutation models of crime and corresonding PDE models. Discrete comutational models have been develoed i n two hases. Phase 1 involved develoment of small-scale \"toy models\" in one and two dimensions to investigate some of the basic dynamics of crime attern formation, concentrating on the burglary as simlest crime system involving mobile criminal offenders and stationary targets (i.e., houses). P hase 2 models are scaled-u versions of the toy mod els. We have also sought to arallelize the discrete com utational code to allow very large satial models to run on Beowulf-tye clusters. Our working discrete models investigate feedback be tween burglary events and the robability that a gi ven site is re-victimized. Simulated offenders bias the ir motion within an environment towards locations t hat have high victimization robabilities. If burglari es do not occur reeatedly at a location then the robability Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 32 of burglary decays towards some environmental const ant. These models generate rich atterning with significant oints of comarison with both null ex ectations and real crime data from Los Angeles and Long Beach. Analytical work has concentrated on derivation of c ontinuous artial differential equation models (PDE ) based on the assumtions of the discrete models. We have conducted reliminary stability analyses to assess what arameter conditions are sufficient dis rut equilibrium crime distributions and generate stationary non-equilibrium atterns. Recent Research Findings: Our most significant finding to-date concerns the t emoral distribution of reeat burglaries at indivi dual houses. It is well known that if a house is burglar ized that there is a much higher robability that i t will be re-victimized and that this reeat event is most li kely to occur within a short interval of time. Our initial small-scale models tested the null hyotheses that such reeat victimization atterns could be generat ed by (1) simle combinatorial constraints of the time sa mles and (2) the \"satial friction\" associated wit h simle two-dimensional random walks, the connection here is between reeat burglaries and the return times of simle random walks. Comarisons with real data from Long Beach show that there are significa nt deviations between the real temoral atterns of re eat victimizations and the null models. In articu lar, there are more reeat burglaries over short time in tervals than would be exected on the basis of combinatorial constraints alone and that there are fewer than would be exected simly on the basis of \"satial friction\". Our discrete models go on to hy othesize that there were \"attractive\" and \"reulsi ve\" forces that combined to bring burglars back to sec ific houses for re-victimizations over different ti me horizons. Our simulations generate deviations that match the emirical evidence. It was also clear from exloratory simulations of t he baseline models that attractive and reulsive fo rces were sufficient to generate comlex, satially clus tered atterns burglary attern). Our scaled-u discrete and anal ytical some insights into how satia l crime atterns may emerge out of relatively simly agent dynamics. In articular, our work to-date has shown that the discrete model dynamics can be accur ately described as a continuous reaction-advection- diffusion system and that there are with characteri stic length scales to this system (Figure 1). Prel iminary indications are that this is a linearly stable syst em. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 33 Figure 1. Discrete (left) and continuous (right) models of residential burglary. Both models assume that successful burglaries enhance the robability of th at offender will return to a site creating a feedba ck that is amlified into burglary. Statistical comarison of the models is currently underway. Challenges and Opportunities: This roject has generated research oortunities a t all levels of the UCLA system. A new ostdoc, Martin Short (PhD Arizona), joined t he roject in 2006. Martin is a secialist in PDE models of reaction-diffusion systems and swarms. H is work has been instrumental in ushing forward th e analytical comonents of the roject. A new graduate student Paul Jones (Math, UCLA) has joined the roject in 2007 and has started to devel o a PhD thesis centered on the imact of different o lice atrol atterns of crime attern formation. P aul has a background in robability and comutational math. Eight REU students, funded through the UCLA Math De artment, worked on the \"crime roject\" during Summer 2007. One grou worked on arallelization o f the discrete comutational model. Two other grous worked on simulating the time dynamics of re sidential burglary and the effects of satial const raints on offender mobility, resectively. This NSF funded roject was also central to a works ho, Crime Hotsots: Behavioral, Comutational and Analytical Modeling, held at the Institute of Pure and Alied Mathematics, UCLA, between 29 Jan-2 Feb 2007. The worksho involved 25 invited seakers fro m local, national and international research institutions. An additional 50 registered artici ants joined the worksho reresenting students, res earchers and the law enforcement community. This worksho r ovided an ideal environment to showcase the theoretical and methodological aroaches of the cu rrent roject.

(Bell, et al, 2007) The duration of function words introducing objec t hrases after dative alternation verbs is longer if the construction used is not the more redictable o ne (Tily, et al, 2007) Changes in the ronunciation of vowels in New Ze aland English are sensitive to subtle asects of the meanings of the words in which they aear (Hay & Bresnan, 2006) With some interesting differences, Gahl & Garns & Jaeger, in re). Toward goal 3, we have the following results: Children show increasing mastery of irregular l ural forms simly by roducing erroneous over- regularized (Ramscar Yarlett, in ress) By maniulating the timing and sequencing of col or adjectives (ronominal vs. ostnominal) we have shown how their robabilistic atterns of acqu isition in English can be exlained and redicted b basic learning mechanisms (Ramscar, Thore & Denny, 2007; Ramscar & Yarlett, in submission), and how the different constraints affecting child and adult learners are affected by refrontal develoment (R amscar & Gitcho, 2007). The dative alternation in child language is exhi bits similarities to as well as interesting differe nces from its attern in adult language (de Marneffe, et al, 2007) Challenges and Opportunities: Our grant did not begin until the middle of the as t academic year. A few months into it, Stanford ho sted the Linguistic Society of America's Institute. Bre snan, Gahl, Jurafsky, and Wasow all taught courses in the Institute, and were heavily engaged with other Inst itute activities. In articular, Jurafsky was on t he Institute organizing committee, and Bresnan deliver ed one of the major invited addresses. Many of the graduate students involved in the roject were serv ing as teaching assistants in the Institute, and to ok courses as well. As a result, very little research on this roject took lace during the month of Jul y, normally one of the most roductive times of year f or academic researchers. We hasten to add that the challenge resented by the cometing time demands o f the Institute was comensated for by the oortunity for stimulating interactions with lingu ists from around the world who came to Stanford for that month. Given the late start and the interrution during Ju ly, much has already been accomlished. Moreover, numerous studies are in rogress, including investi gations into the role of riming in construction ch oice and an extension of our work on rediction and sequ encing in color adjectives to number set terms. We are also beginning to use head-mounted eye-trackers in our work. A lanned study will see whether verb biases will induce anticiatory eye movements to i ctures of what is the more likely next noun.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 36 Project Title: Collaborative Research: DRU Choice #: SBE-0624269 HSD Emphasis Area: Decision Making, Risk And Uncertainty Lead PI: Marco Castillo, Georgia Institute of Technology Co-PIs: Laurie Garrow, Pinar Keskinocak & Julie Swann - GA Collaborators: Wedad Elmaghraby - University of Maryland Research Goals: 1. Validate theories of human behavior by develoing r eal-world exeriments and by examining naturally occurring exeriments in three industries. 2. Incororate individuals' strategic behavior into fi rm decision-making and understand the interactions and linkages between the strategic behavior of ind ividuals and firms. 3. Extend flexible discrete choice models to incorora te individuals' strategic behavior without imosing strong identification assumtions. Thematic Areas: 1. Decision making, risk, and uncertainty 2. Integration of individuals' strategic behavior i nto firm decision-making Methodologies: A wide range of methodologies are being used and ex lored for this study including game theory, dynami c rogramming, dynamic discrete choice models, behavi oral and exerimental economics. The methodologies incororate ideas develoed in fields sanning groundwater flow, transortation, marketi ng science, and behavioral economics. Recent Research Findings: During the first six months of the roject, we deve loed a model of search and urchasing behavior tha t is flexible enough to incororate heterogeneous tastes over alternatives together with when and how inten sely to search for alternatives. The model is flexible enough to include issues of cognitive difficulties, inconsistency on time references, heterogeneous ex ectations and myoia. The model develoment is being suorted by several synergetic research activities and data collection efforts with researchers from Euroe, the Boeing Co many, and Sabre Solutions/Travelocity (indeendent from this NSF-funded research). The data will be u sed to develo more realistic baseline assumtions (such as the distribution of rices in the market) and to emirically validate model results. For exam le, the data shows that in some markets rices rise close t o dearture date while in other markets rices fall . Challenges and Opportunities: This model is imortant because it extends search m odels to the case were the distribution of alternat ives is not stationary, i.e., airline ticket rices vary wi th time. The context of non-stationary rices is i mortant because it will rovide additional sources of ident ification of behavioral rules that have not been ex lored in other contexts, such as job search models.

Anderson, University of Caliifornia-Riverside Patterns of exanding state formation constitute a long-term evolutionary trend that may eventually re sult in the emergence of a single world state. The very nat ure of the exansion of olitical integration has i tself evolved because new institutions that facilitate an d organize regional integration, cooeration and co nflict have emerged. Military conquest and the long-term interaction between sedentary agrarian emires and confederations of astoral nomads came eventually t o be relaced by a rocess of geoolitical and economic cometition among states in a world that h as increasingly been integrated by market exchange. In the last 200 years international governmental and t ransnational non-governmental organizations have emerged that constitute the first beginnings of wor ld state formation, and the national states have be en artially reconfigured as instruments of an increas ingly integrated global elite. World state formatio n may be desirable because the roblems created by human technological and social change are increasingly global in scoe. But a world state will need to be legitimated in the eyes of a majority of the human oulation of the Earth and this means that democra cy must be constructed on a global scale. This roosed roject will allow us to examine several robable future trajectories of global olitical int egration based on models of growth, decline and systemic tra nsformation that are develoed by studying atterns of olitical integration in several regions over the ast 4000 years. The main urose of this roject is to exlain grow th of cities and states since the Bronze Age. In th e nineteenth and twentieth centuries exansion and in tensification of intercontinental interactions has been called globalization. But earlier regional systems also exhibited similar waves of \"globalization,\" al beit on a smaller satial scale, and these waves of network e xansion and contraction, unctuated by occasional huge jums in the scale of networks, eventually led to t he formation of the modern global social system. Ou r first task is to develo an inventory of \"uward swees\" in which the quantitative scale of the largest citi es and emires in regions doubled. These are the cases of great exansion that must be exlained in order to understand the long-term growth trend. Examles are the rise of the neo-Assyrian emire, and the Persi an Achaemenid dynasty. These emires were quantitative ly much larger in terms of territorial size that ea rlier olities had been. The overall icture of uward sw ees in three world regions will be resented at th e NSF-HSD PI Meeting in 2007.

The differential imact of a h azard event couled with the underlying social vulnerabilities of communities work in tandem to in fluence the rate and extent of disaster recovery. T his roject uses Hurricane Katrina and its imact on Mi ssissii's Gulf Coast to understand those factors that influence the rate of recovery in the region, but m ore imortantly, the otential inequalities in the rocess. Two rimary areas of focus include: 1. Does the social transformation of the landscae (ost-disaster) follow the same socioeconomic trajectory (re-disaster) or is the trend offset b y the extreme event and a new trajectory is charted ? What factors of lace-based vulnerability hinder o r hel recovery from disasters? 2. How will Hurricane Katrina change the demograhi c face of the Mississii Gulf Coast? Will revious socio-geograhic atterns be maintained or will th e large-scale evacuation and rebuilding efforts lea d to a new demograhic rofile and satial footrint wi th subsequent changes in and equality? Areas: disasters research, below. 1. Establish Pre-Katrina Baseline on Social, Built Environment and Hazard Vulnerability Using statistical data from the 2000 Census and an y udates, a baseline year for social, built environment and natural hazard vulnerability (re- Katrina) is underway. The social vulnerability inde x has been comuted for each of the three counties. Following similar rocedures, a built environment index has also been constructed. Utilizing data de rived from SLOSH modeling, maing of damages by FEMA, and in situ observations, we have develoed a fairly accurate reresentation of the natural system vulnerability immediately rior to and afte r the storm. 2. Develo Historical Narrative on Antecedent Condi tions and Punctuated Trajectories A historical narrative is being roduced that exam ines the transformation of the Mississii coast fr om a rather ristine natural barrier island habitat t o the modern tourist and gambling center that domin ated the region in 2005. The rincial methodology eml oyed for the historical comonent of this roject i s emirical documentary research. An extensive secon dary literature search concerning the history of hurricanes secifically and natural disasters gene rally for southern Mississii was conducted. Ongoi ng work seeks to a) identify the rincial disasters and hurricanes that imacted the region; b) identif y Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 41 rimary sources ertaining to each event; and c) c onstruct micro-histories of the imact of each even t. Newsaer accounts, diaries, letters, and ersonal reminiscences have yielded some information; official reorts by governmental agencies as well as congressional reorts yielded a great deal of relevant information, esecially for Hurricane Cam ille. 3. Determine Social Trajectory and Changes using Be nchmark Analyses A benchmark aroach will be used to assess histor ical rates of disaster recovery and to forecast the ability of a locality or the region to recover fro m an adverse event such as this. A hindcast risk m odel will be built using annual oulation data, buildi ng ermits, and historical data. These data establi sh a benchmark risk rofile of the region rior to 2005 and are used to estimate how long it may take to reoulate or economically rebuild the region to re-Hurricane Katrina levels. 4. Forecast Satial and Temoral Change Reeat site visits to monitor recovery rogress wi ll be made at 6-month intervals for the duration of the roject. Satellite imagery and ancillary data will be used to monitor built environment changes on th e landscae. This will be sulemented with an in si tu hotograhic record of change that began in the initial ost-imact eriod. Acquisition of demogra hic data through local municialities (if availabl e) or through surrogate indicators, or in situ observati ons will be used to gauge changes in the demograhi c comosition of the case study communities during t he study eriod. 5. Decision-making and the Role of Inequalities in Shaing the Recovery Process and Future Trajectory The community-based, qualitative research comonen t is in a foundational hase in anticiation of identifying the secific communities to be examine d. During this hase we have been develoing interview rotocols for key leaders and community members, seeking IRB aroval, gathering contact information, reading and gathering information on the olitical, economic, and social structures alon g the coast. Recent Research Findings: (by Method #) 1. In rogress; we are currently comaring our surg e outut with that of other teams along the coast. 2. The research indicates that the imact of Hurric ane Camille will lend itself most readily to comar ison with Katrina. Perhas the most imortant finding t o date concerns the ways in which federal disaster relief in the wake of Camille for southern Mississ ii was braided with imortant questions concernin g civil rights, esecially school desegregation. The second main finding concerns the resective roles of rivate enterrise and the role of the state in s onsoring and facilitating recovery after Camille. S tate and federal aid outweighed rivate assistance in t he immediate aftermath of Camille but the role of rivate enterrise in amelioration after Katrina s uggests a definite shift in the imortance of riva te comanies and industries in disaster mitigation. 3, 4, 5. None to reort. Challenges and Opportunities: (By Method #) 1. 3, 4. None 2. Trying to understand the imact of hurricanes o n the region and its oulations rior to 1860 has roven challenging simly because the source material is stingy and terse. More recent events are better documented and rovide the best historical oortu nities for comarison with Katrina. 5. Several oortunities for collaboration with ot her social science researchers and evacuees have ar isen. We have consulted with Shirley Laska and Pam Jenki ns (University of New Orleans) on long-term community studies they are conducting in Louisiana .

Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 42 Project Title: Temoral Dynamics of #: Bob McMurray, Univ. of Iowa Research Goals: 1. To determine how listeners adat to systematic v ariation in seech signals by taking advantage of regularities at multile levels of analysis. 2. To determine how infant language learners use th e information available to them at their secific develomental level in order to acquire new knowle dge of language sound structure. 3. To determine how information in the seech signa l is interreted over time, as it is heard, by infa nt and adult listeners. Thematic Areas: 1. Seech ercetion and interretation. 2. Learning and adatation. How information availa ble to the learner is integrated into existing knowledge. 3. Dynamic cognitive rocessing. How both infants and adults change in how they interret information (seech, in our studies) over time, evaluated over several timescales. Methodologies: Eye-tracking during language comrehension; Teaching children and adults new words or sets of w ords to evaluate how learning roceeds; Percetual adatation to distorted or otherwise mod ified seech signals. Recent Research Findings: A number of new studies conducted with HSD funding have examined listeners' adatation to seech signals altered in some systematic way. These stud ies hel us to understand not only the adatation rocess itself, but also basic rocesses of language unders tanding. One set of exeriments tested interretati on of accented words, where in a certain honological env ironment (before the \"g\" sound) the vowel was changed (an accent that exists in arts of the nort hern US). Listeners exosed to this accent raidly otimized their interretation of the talker. For examle, uon hearing the vowel of \"back\", listener s raidly ruled out that the talker might be saying \" bag\", imlicitly (robably unconsciously) realizing that if she had said \"bag\", the vowel would have been diffe rent. These studies show for the first time that interreting accents is not simly a matter of \"cor recting\" the talker's seech to match our own diale ct. Rather, interreting accents requires a systematic reconfiguration of our exectations about how a wor d would sound if the talker said it -- ossibly using a kind of mental simulation rocess. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 43 One of the tasks children face in learning language is to gras the sound structure of language. In s ome languages, such as Dutch, an acoustic feature that is easy to hear (like very long vowels, or large i tch changes) might secify which word is meant; in othe r languages, such as English, the same feature migh t say which word is being emhasized; in still others , it might say whether the whole utterances is a qu estion or statement. How do children learn to assign these features the aroriate linguistic function? We have comleted a series of exeriments asking this quest ion using vowel duration, which works differently i n different languages. We found that Dutch one-year- olds reliably consider vowel duration to signal dif ferent words (for a Dutch baby, a tam is not the same thin g as a taaam), whereas American-English one-year-ol ds do not (a tam is a taaam). Similarly, Dutch toddle rs find a word like \"aard\" (horse) hard to underst and if we shorten the vowel (\"ard\"), while English toddle rs are indifferent to such changes. These studies are the first to examine the question of how it is that ver y young children begin to interret acoustic featur es that are easy to erceive, but that signal very differen t kinds of linguistic structure in different langua ges. When learners are taught a set of items (words, obj ect categories, arbitrary shaes), learning is usua lly more difficult when the items are similar to one another , because of interference in memory. We have disco vered that in word learning, interference effects deend on the temoral structure of the similarity among i tems. Thus, for examle, learning \"baf\" and \"bav\" results in confusion, while learning \"vid\" and \"fid\" does not, or much less. This aears to be a consequence of lis teners' on-line interretation of the words: while hearing, for examle, \"baf\", the listener thinks of both \"ba f\" and \"bav\", resulting in greater confusion in mem ory. While hearing \"vid\", the early incomatibility with \"fid\" recludes cometition. We have found relate d effects in the interretation of familiar words: af ter hearing a word like \"carriage\", listeners still reveal effects of thinking \"carrot\" -- because of the earl y temoral overla of these words. These results s how that consideration of the temorally extended nature of seech is imortant in understanding which words ar e most easily learned and comrehended. In seech, w ords are not erceived as static objects, and human s do not recover from early interretation errors otima lly. Challenges and Opportunities: Our work has heled set the agenda for future resea rch on ercetual learning and adatation in seech . Now that we know that adatation requires more than simle adjustment of a talker's seech, it is imo rtant to determine the full scoe of listeners' abilities : under what conditions is adatation ossible? Ho w much generalization is ossible given a certain set of e xeriences with an accented or distorted seech sam le? In the case of children, how does the language that children hear in infancy rovide the \"raw material s\" for their effective categorization and interretation o f seech? To hel answer these questions, we are roceeding on with infants and toddlers; and testing adult learning of novel sound-based categories and regula rities using both seech and non-seech signals.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 44 Project Title: Understanding Linkages Among Governance Factors of Linked Social and Ecological Systems Proposal #: 0527304 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of Change Lead PI: Tracey Dalton, Marine Affairs, University of Rhode Island Co-PIs: Graham Forrester, Natural Resources Science, Univer sity of Rhode Island Richard Pollnac, Anthroology and Marine Affairs , University of Rhode Island Pamela Rubinoff, RI Coastal Resources Center Bette Erickson, Instructional Develoment Progra m, University of Rhode Island Research Goals: (1) Understand how governance factors related to c omlex, dynamic marine ecosystems are linked to effective resource allocation; (2) Identify natural science and social science fa ctors that influence success of marine reserves; (3) Exlain why some reserves are more successful than others in enhancing environmental quality and institutional sustainability; (4) Build sustainable working relationshis among researchers in traditionally distinct discilines a nd enhance interdiscilinary research skills; and (5) Share key success factors with managers reson sible for designing and monitoring marine reserves. Thematic Areas: Research that integrates across discilines is crit ical to understanding the comlex relationshis amo ng elements of linked social and ecological systems. Through an interdiscilinary analysis of marine res erves in the Caribbean, our research identifies factors c ritical to successful governance of couled social and ecological systems, exlores relationshis among th ese factors, and examines how factors that oerate at different satial and temoral scales affect the e rformance of marine reserves. In this study, an in tegrated team consisting of a marine olicy scientist, an ec ologist, and an anthroologist together with severa l research assistants is conducting a systematic surv ey of governance factors at marine reserves in the wider Caribbean. We are examining the relationshis amon g formal and informal governing arrangements linking humans and natural resources (i.e. caacity , stakeholder involvement, comliance, adative management, articiatory monitoring, alternative i ncome rojects), the social and ecological context within which these arrangements are embedded (i.e. level of tourism in community, habitat quality, oth ers), and the imacts of these arrangements (i.e. marine reserve erformance). Methodologies: For each marine reserve and its associated communit ies, we use well-established research techniques develoed in the fields of cultural anthroology an d marine ecology to conduct a raid araisal of th e social, institutional, organizational, and biologic al conditions of the area. To date, we have visite d nineteen marine reserves and 33 communities associated with the reserves. We sent about 5-8 days at each mari ne reserve site. At each site, we collected relevant reorts and statistics from regional and local gove rnment offices. We examined the legislation or local ordi nance establishing the reserve and other relevant legislation and management documents. We conducted over 125 semi-structured interviews with key Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 45 informants to elicit their ercetions and insights about the reserve. We also conducted over 1100 structured surveys with local community members who are familiar with the marine reserve. SCUBA divers measured ecological variables using we ll-established methods for surveying coral reef habitats. The secific rotocols used either follo w exactly, or are slight modifications of, rotocol s used by two major reef monitoring rograms in the Caribbean , the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity rogram (CARICOMP) and the Atlantic and Gulf Raid Reef Ass essment rogram (AGRRA). Use of survey methods similar to those in use by CARICOMP and AGG RA ensures that our data will be comarable to these large, re-existing, regional databases and re-existing ecological data from some marine reserv es. At each site, we erformed surveys at two locations , inside the marine reserve and at a nearby control location outside the marine reserve. To date, we h ave conducted over 350 benthic and coral transect surveys, over 130 roving fish counts, and over 650 fish transect surveys. We lan to visit an additional ten marine reserves and their associated communities within the next ye ar. Recent Research Findings: Preliminary analyses have focused on one articular governing arrangement, stakeholder articiation i n reserve lanning and management. Using data from o ver 500 structured interviews with individuals in Belize and Honduras who live in communities associa ted with marine reserves, we examined how stakeholder articiation relates to reserve erfor mance. We found no difference in ercetions of ov erall reserve success between those who articiated and those who did not, but there were differences in ercetions of more secific measures of success. For examle, those who articiated were more likel y to think that the reserve brings financial benefits to the local community. Analyses of resonses from o nly those individuals who had articiated in reserve lanning and management indicated that secific feat ures of the rocess were related to different ercetion s of erformance. For examle, articiants who th ought that it was clear how decisions were made during re serve lanning and management were more likely to think that conflict in the community had declined s ince the reserve was established. Our results high light the comlex nature of stakeholder articiation in reserve management. Challenges and Opportunities: There are research challenges: (1) Avoiding comart mentalizing the research so that each team member attends only to the comonents related to his/her s ecialty; (2) Becoming conversant enough with our colleagues' discilines to engage in intelligent di alogue; and (3) Coordinating biological and social data collection for each site when some reserve sites ar e associated with more than one community and some reserve sites are located off-shore. There are also oortunities: (1) Observing how dat a is collected in other discilines; (2) Gaining a better understanding of our colleagues' discilines; (3) C onducting multivariate statistical analyses that in tegrate data from all discilines involved in the research; and (4) Producing future leaders in systematic, interdiscilinary research-based resource managemen t.

De\u00e1k, University of California, San Rebecc a Goals: 1. Test theoretical model of how comlex social ski lls (attention-sharing) emerge in human infancy. 2. Investigate cognitive, ercetual, and social-ec ological factors in develoment of attention-sharin g skills, in a mixed longitudinal/cross-sectional de sing 3.

Thematic Areas: 1. Develomental Psychology 2. Social Cognitive Science 3. Comutational Modelling/Machine Learning Methodologies: 1. Infant sychohysics: screenings; OenCV); Findings: 1. An ethnograhic study of infant-arent interaction at home has been exloring how social interaction, articularly attention-sharing develo in the first year. Attention-sharing is critical for social lea rning and language develoment. The resulting data set in cludes over 16,000 coded events from 35 infant- arent dyads. To exlore how dyads shared attention we conducted sequential analysis of dyadic atterns of attention and action receding eisode s of shared attention. The analyses of show that adults usually watched their infant, or their own h ands as they maniulated objects. Infants seldom looked at arents' faces, but watched arents' hand s as they maniulated objects. This tendency to watch object use has not reviously been reorted i n studies of infant social develoment. Its discove ry required laborious rocessing and coding of large a mounts (> 1.5 Tb) of digital video of naturalistic interaction. This was done with greater temoral an d satial resolution than revious studies. Parents ' secific behaviors were also coded and analyzed to determine which actions tended to attract and re- direct infants' attention. This analysis confirmed that infants did not follow arents' gaze, but watc hed Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 47 them maniulate objects. Further analysis showed th at infants' interest in caregivers' hands could rovide infants with sufficient inut to learn to f ollow arents' gaze even when arents are not using their hands. This can exlain why controlled exeri mental studies of gaze-following show the emergence of gaze-following ability between 9 and 1 2 months of age. It also rovides the first inductive test of a lausible theoretical account o f the emergence of comlex social routines and skil ls in the first year of infancy. 2. In a recent cross-sectional study to suort a larg er ongoing longitudinal study, n = 15 infants were tested at 6 and 7 months of age to examine individu al differences in distribution of visual attention during a otentially mildly stressful social intera ction. This study, by UCSD graduate student Kaya de Barbaro, found dramatic individual differences in l ooking-behaviors. These individual differences were redicted by animal models in behavioral neuroscien ce, but have not been incororated in theories or studies of infant attention. de Barbaro used an inn ovative coding scheme redicted to distinguish vigilant from non-vigilant infants. Extensive analy sis of infants' behaviors (during an orientation h ase of a new oerant social looking rocedure) confirme d that three out of four behavioral indices redict ed from rodent and monkey studies were highly coherent across individual infants. Most infants showed redominantly high- or low-vigilance behavior acros s these measures; at least one other looking measure was also related in a coherent way to the v igilance measures. Current work is examining how individual differences in visual vigilance relate t o other social behaviors and resonses. 3. Comutational simulations (by former UCSD graduate student Hector Jasso, PhD, and Jochen Triesch) have tested numerous theoretical and emirical red ictions of the theory of infant attention-sharing develoment. Among the behavioral findings that hav e been confirmed: infants develo late the ability to follow gaze or oints to targets behind them, an d that infants are sometimes \"thrown off\" or distracted by more roximal, distracting visual tar gets. Among the theoretical redictions made, our simulations find oulations of units within in \"in fant\" agent's \"brain\" that learn to resond both a \"caregiver\" look towards a articular loca tion, and to the infant-agent itself lanning to lo ok at that location. These units therefore have the reso nse roerties of so-called \"mirror rogram the Temoral Dynamics Learning Center (August, 2007). 2. Oortunity: Longitudinal cohort is a unique samle that is roviding dense and hard-to-obtain data on individual infants and caregivers. The MESA roject has already leveraged NSF-suorted rogress to exlore further data collection. For examle, we ha ve started collaborating with Andrea Chiba (Det. o f Cognitive Science, UCSD) to collect saliva samles before and after some monthly home visits and lab testing sessions. These samles will ermit assays of catecholamine metabolites that have been shown to modulate (in infants and caregivers) with social stress, and to vary across individual infants and children. Other oortunities will be exlored in t he coming year. 3. Challenge: Financial, ersonnel, and time demands o f innovative equiment and infrastructure develoment. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 48 Project Title: Rumor Proagation: Modeling & Testing Dynamic So cial Influence Mechanisms Proposal #: BCS-0527371 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead Nicholas DiFonzo, Rochester Institute of Technology Co-PIs: Prashant Bordia, University of Southern Australia; Martin J. Bourgeois, University of Wyoming; Bernard P. Brooks, David S. Ross, Christo her Homan, Rochester Institute of Technology; Jerry M. Suls, University of Iowa Collaborators: Jason Beckstead, University of South Florida Research Goal: To model and understand how rumors roagate over t ime and across social sace. Thematic Areas: 1. Rumor 2. Dynamic Social Imact Theory 3. Math Modeling Methodologies : Two main methodologies are being emloyed: math mod eling and comuter-assisted social network exeriments in the laboratory. 1. Math Modeling on Social Networks Dialogue Model. Based on research on rumor transmission and belief, a mathematical model of rumor transmission was develoed that emhasized erson-t o-erson dialogue occurring in rumor eisodes; we dubbed this the \"Dialogue Model\" of rumor transmiss ion. We used this model in a reliminary exloratio n of rumor roagation and belief atterns over time in artificial and actual social networks. Belief-Repetition Study. Our modeling activities also led us to conduct an e xeriment to understand the relation between hearing a rumor reeatedly and bel ief. Seven different rumors were embedded between zero and six times in narratives that 140 articia nts read. Particiants then rated how believable th ey found each rumor to be. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 49 Figure 1: Family, Torus, & Ribbon Configurations 2. Computer-Assisted Social Network Experiments Data from 27 16-erson grous were collected at Roc hester Institute of Technology, University of Wyoming, and the University of South Australia. Eac h grou read several ambiguous scenarios and communic ated via a comuter terminal with four other individuals . During each scenario, articiants were resented with fou r alternative statements (rumors) that made sense of the scenario and were asked to discuss which alternativ e made the most sense. Discussion roceeded over four roun ds of communication. For examle, articiants read a sce nario in which a rofessor was found dead from a gunshot wou nd. Alternative A stated that the rofessor was killed by an angry student, B that he committed suicide, C that he accidentally shot himself, and D that he was killed in a robbery attemt gone awry. After reading these alte rnatives, articiants indicated rivately which of four rumor s made the most sense to them and how much confidence they had in that alternative; then they sent and received a message from each of their four neighbors. After ea ch round of messages had been received, they again registered their rumor choice and confidence. Rumor choice and confidence was thus measured four times for each scenario. The tye of social network configuration was varied within-grous. During each scenario the grou was configured and ribbon networks are diagrammed in Figure 1. Each fa ce here reresents an individual and connections ar e indicated by connecting lines. In the torus network deicted, each individual has four \"neighbors\"\u2014nor th, south, east, and west\u2014in a two-dimensionally unifor m distribution. The ribbon configuration shows how an individual may be connected to four neighbors align ed as on a street\u2014two across the street and one on either side. The family configuration deicted shows how t he majority of one's social interactions may be wit h one's \"family\" or local cluster of contacts. Each of the receding configurations differs in \"cluminess\" (segmentation) in that the chances of interacting w ith some neighbors, as oosed to others, differs dramatically. Families, for examle, are the most c lumy. Random configurations, as the name imlies, are arranged so that the robability of connections bet ween individuals is random. In addition, in our ran dom configuration, articiants were reconnected to fou r randomly selected ersons each round; the effect mimicked what one would exerience at a crowded arty where the set of eole you converse with changes eriodi cally. Random configurations are the least clumy. Recent Research Findings: 1. Math Modeling on Social Networks Dialogue Model. The reliminary exloration offered some suort fo r the validity of our model: rumors that were negative about a rival grou sread more quickly and were believed more strongly among one's own grou than in a rival grou; results dovetailed nicely with emirical research in the area of soci al identity. This reliminary exloration also highlig hted the imortance of what we have dubbed the \"novelty\" factor in rumor roagation: The degree a nd manner in which the rumor remains \"fresh\" has a strong imact on the extent and attern of rumor r oagation. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 50 Belief-Repetition Study. Using hierarchical linear modeling techniques, we f ound that belief in a rumor is logistically related to the number of times the rum or is heard (the rate of belief increase er times heard diminished over times heard). An extension of this study is in rearation that will extend the number of times heard and rule out an alternative relationshi . 2. Computer-Assisted Social Network Experiments We anticiated cluminess would redict diversity o f rumor choice over time. Rumor choice atterns artially accorded with this rediction. The clumi est configuration, family, did indeed retain divers ity over rounds, but all other configurations lost dive rsity. That is, the family configuration rotected against the emergence of rumor majorities and none of the o ther configurations did so. As a consequence, majorities tended to emerge more when the configura tion was not family. The greater segmentation that categorizes the family configuration served to shie ld articiants most from exosure to anticiated that cluminess would redict greate r confidence in rumor choice. Rumor confidence atterns accorded with this idea. Rumor confidence increased from round 1 to 4 in all grous, but more in torus, ribbon, and family configurations as comare d to random. The greater \"mixing\"\u2014less segmentation\u2014afforded by our random network maniul ation aeared to damen confidence increases. Rumor clustering is the extent to which homogenous ockets of rumor choice emerge from round 1 to 4; we anticiated that cluminess would redict rumor clustering. Results accorded with this rediction; clustering occurred for torus, ribbon, and family, but not for random configurations. These reliminary analyses indicated how different \"shared realities\" arising from rumors may emerge more among more segmented tyes of social structure s and may remain less suscetible to alteration. Challenges and Opportunities: The rogramming and debugging to roduce a rogram the Comuter Assisted Social Network Exeriment were more diffic ult than anticiated. This challenge led to comosi ng an even more interdiscilinary team that included c omuter scientists.

Secific research goals within these aims include: 1. To establish satial deendencies and interactions between socio-demograhic and environmental variables in order to determine which socio-demogr ahic factors (such as socioeconomic status or atterns of human settlements, etc.) and environme ntal characteristics (for examle distance to coast , sloe, asect, elevation) are related to the degre e of and/or tyes of risk humans face in the contex t of different tyes of natural disasters. 2. To determine which socio-demograhic and environmen tal variables show the most significant deendencies and correlations (among those identif ied in Aim 1) and to assess the relationshi betwee n socio-demograhic and environmental characteristic s in relation to vulnerability in different tyes o f natural disasters. 3. To estimate satial and analytical uncertainties in an integrated environmental and socio-demograhic model and their resective influence on rediction and maing of vulnerability. 4. To evaluate how models of re-disaster vulnerabilit y, in articular estimates of oulations at risk, can be incororated into ost-disaster assessments in order to derive less biased estimates of disaster i mact. Thematic Areas: 1. Public Heath 2. Physical science and geograhy 3. Natural disasters and humanitarian resonse Methodologies: The roosed research will be conducted in two has es: 1) an exloratory hase focuses on develoing aroriate environmental and satial risk models a nd samling strategies using information from rior disasters, and 2) an imlementation hase that woul d occur during future disasters where models would be refined and alied, and assessments of the disaste r-affected oulations would be conducted. Current ly in the exloratory hase, a literature and historical event review is ongoing, and existing hazard and vulnerability models and techniques from a variety of sources will be exlored. The key element of the roosed research is the int egration of hysical and GIS based modeling using ost- oulation surveys and re-dis aster satially distributed demograhic data. The innovative element of the roosed research is that it will allow for the evaluation of vulnerability models Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 52 based on field survey data from disaster-affected oulations. When integrated with modified survey an d samle design methodologies, this information can e nable ost-disaster assessments to be carried out w ith both re- and ost-disaster oulation data so that differences in the resulting samles can be comar ed and overall imact can be characterized with greater ac curacy. Survey data that will then be overlaid on hysical and GIS based mas and will result in disa ster risk models and satial distributions of the d isaster affected oulations and select characteristics of vulnerability. These models and findings will rov ide information to resonders that will allow for the i dentification of grous that need to be targeted in the disaster resonse by a variety of characteristics s uch as age, sex, and location. Modeling and ost-d isaster surveys will be conducted in years two and three (2 008 & 2009) of the award. Recent Research Findings: We are currently in the exloratory hase of the r oject which includes a literature review and histor ical event review of five tyes of raid on-set natural disasters including earthquakes, troical cyclones, floods, tsunamis, and volcanoes. For the historical event review, a summary of the data sources and event cri teria is summarized in the table below. Searate data fi les for each event tye are currently being comlie d and will be analyzed in this hase. Primary outcomes o f focus will include satial and temoral trends, environmental and event characteristics, and redic tors of imact in terms of mortality, injury, and dislacement.

We do not yet know how homogenous our different focus study sites are (we are starting data collection Fall 2007) and the imlications of this otential heterogeneity for interactions between de cision- makers. We are emloying a data collection design that will enable us to assess these interactions, b ut have not started this datat collection yet. We believe the combination of our emirical data analysis and agent- based modeling will allow us to clearly articulate this dynamic. From an emirical ersective, we need to document historical land cover change at multiple s patial scales and because of the timeline focus of our studies w e will need to emloy multile satellite roducts. This is a relativley straightforward challenge, but the solutions are otentially time consuming (labo r intensive rocessing of aerial hotograhy, error a ssessments of satellite imagery). Our roject includes study sites in Indiana and S\u00e3o Paulo and we will need to comare findings from th ese two locations to address the theoretical basis for our research (legal contexts that imose constraint s on adatation and innovation related to land managemen t). Our research grou (CIPEC - Indiana University ) has conducted considerable research along these lin es and so we believe we are aware of the itfalls b ut exect we will face some unique challenges to clear ly relate our emirical findings and modeling work to land-use theory. Lastly, we hoe that we will be able to translate the findings from this research into info rmation that will be useful for policy makers . We are addressing our research from the ersect ive of comlex systems analysis and will be making use of agent-based mode ls. At this time we do not intend to develo grah ical user interfaces for our models that would ackage t he model for non-secialist users. However, this m ay be something we exlore in the 3 rd year of our roject if we have time. However, our roject will involve decision-makers at various levels: municial govern ments, NGO's, land trusts, households. While articiatory aroaches were not art of our origi nal study design, we hoe to ackage the results fr om our research for stakeholders in both Indiana and S\u00e3o P aulo.

Doyne Farmer, Santa Fe Institute Co-PIs: Andrew Lo (MIT), Rosario Mantegna (U. of Palermo) , Jon Wilkins (SFI) Collaborators: David Michayluk (University of Technology, Sydney ), Michelle Girvan (U. of Maryland), Fabrizio Lillo (U. of Palermo), John Ge anakolos (Yale), Blake LeBaron (Brandeis), Jenni fer Dunne (SFI) Research Goals: 1. Use records of financial trading that contain id entity of articiants as a laboratory to study soc ial evolution of financial trading strategies. 2. Classify trading strategies and measure their ec ological interactions, i.e. classify them as to whe ther they are cometitive, redator-rey, or symbiotic. 3. Track the factors that drive strategy selection through evolutionary time. Does diversity affect roerties of rice formation, e.g. rice volatili ty? Thematic Areas: 1. Social evolution. 2. Contextual asects of decision making. 3. Nonequilibrium models of financial economics. Methodologies: This study makes use of a data set in which we have a record of trades that are made as well as who ma de them. We classify strategies using clustering meth ods, as well as other statistical and machine learn ing methods. Ecological interactions are deduced makin g use of low-level interaction rules (e.g. if a gi ven agent buys a given quantity, how much does this mov e the rice, and how does affect the rofits or los ses of all the other agents?). Recent Research Findings: This roject is still in its early stages. We have obtained a data set from the Taiwan Stock Exchange in which we have identities of all trading orders that are laced, with the broker, the account, and the individual making the trade, over a twelve year er iod. We have done some reliminary analysis and demonstrated that we can classify strategies at sta tistically significant levels, yielding a taxonomy with hierarchical structure. Challenges and Opportunities: This is a highly comlex data set, and simly using it is not at all trivial. Our first challenge is to iece the entire data set together and make it usable. Our n ext challenge is to classify the strategies and und erstand what the resulting classification means. The goal is to see how the oulation of strategies evolves in evolutionary time, and what factors drive the chang e. This is a unique oortunity to study social evolution (involving the descent, variation and sel ection of decision-making strategies) in a setting where it is ossible to draw quantitative conclusions. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 57 Project Title: The Dynamics of Affective Learning Proposal #: 0527267 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics of Human Behavior, Psychology (Social) Lead PI: Lisa Feldman Barrett (Boston College) Co-PIs: Jon Horvitz (Boston College), Christoher I. Wright (Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hosital) Collaborators: Eliza Bliss-Moreau (Boston College), Peter Balsam (Columbia University) Research Goals: 1. Document systematic individual variation in the rocess by which individuals learn that stimuli in the environment are threatening or rewarding (i.e., af fective learning). 2. Investigate individual variation in the extent to which eole use context to discern the affectiv e value of a stimulus. 3. Link individual variation in affective learning to re-existing individual differences in affective reactivity. Thematic Areas: 1. Affective value and 3. reactivity Methodologies: Associative affective learning roceeds when a neut ral stimulus is aired with a stimulus of known val ue and over time, and many airings, the neutral stimu lus comes to acquire affectively valued roerties. In the context of this grant, we use a \"classical cond itioning\" aradigm to investigate individual differ ences in associative affective learning. Study 1 Study 1 concluded in August of 2006 (N=94). Study 1 utilized a classical conditioning aradigm using 2 neutral CS stimuli (ictures of white Euroean fema le faces) and one aversive auditory US stimulus(a l oud (95 dB) buzzing noise). The exerimental aradigm included two hases as roosed in the original stu dy design\u2014an acquisition hase (60 trials) and an exti nction hase (50 trials). Study 1 used self-reort individual dif ferences\u2014standard ersonality and affect questionna ires used extensively in the literature. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 58 Study 2 Given the findings from Study 1 which suggested tha t the CS was not secifically acquiring value by be ing aired with a loud aversive noise (although see new results detailed below), we decided that it was necessary to change the unconditioned stimulus used in Study 2. We selected a wrist shock as the new unconditioned stimulus. Study 2 investigated not only individual difference s in the acquisition and extinction of affective value, but also in the renewal of affe ctive value. Renewal occurs when articiants are laced back into the original lear ning context following extinction, and the acquired affective value of the CS reemerge s. To investigate renewal, articiants comleted acquisition in one exerimen tal context (A), extinction in a second exerimental context (B) and renewal in the original learning context (A). (See Figure 1). In addition to self-reort measure s of sensitivity to value, articiants also comleted a behavioral/ercetual measure. In this task, articiants view a series of movies that deict ne utral faces and gradually morh (in 1% increments) into a vivid facial deiction of emotion. Particiants are instructed to advance a cursor until they see the o nset of a facial exression and then to advance to the next trial. Earlier detection of the facial exressions, therefore, is indexes grea ter ercetual sensitivity to Findings: ) is used as deendent variable in most associative affective learning aradigms in humans. The standard for cod ing EDA in the literature is to identify discrete resonses (called hasic resonses) which have a cl ear trough and eak and subtract the EDA for the tr ough from the EDA for the eak. (See Figure 2) As such, the resultant value reflects the amlitude of the hasic EDA resonse. Phasic resonses must onset after th e stimulus onset and be greater than .02 micro-Siem ens in order to be considered stimulus secific. Phasic resonding of this nature results from a discrete stimulus-driven symathetic nervous system resonse. In cases where there is no hasic resonse, or the resonse does not meet the criteria described above, the data from that trial is scored as 0 (no learning, or non- usable data). The roblem with this coding scheme is that only some articiants demonstrate hasic EDA resonses (Figure 3, artici ant 1). Some never manifest hasic resonses but instead show an increased mean EDA resonse across the entire trial (Figure 3, ar ticiant 2); and even those articiants who do generate some hasic resonses also show this mean increase (Figure 3, articiant 3). Most articiants demonstrate this gradual increase in EDA across the course of the CS and US analysis eriod, suggesting that they hav e a global symathetic nervous system reactivity or regulation as a result of the stimulus resentation. We believed that it was theoretically roblematic t o discard data from articiants whom aeared to b e generating affective resonses, even if those reso nses are not hasic in nature. We derived a new me thod of coding EDA to account for variation in resonse attern. Rather than scoring discrete resonses, w e take measure the mean EDA resonse for a given analysis eriod. By taking the mean of the EDA across a Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 59 given analysis eriod, we cature not only the has ic resonses, but also global changes in symatheti c reactivity. Identifying individual differences tha t redict these different resonse atterns is a go al of future work. Study 1 Our new analyses (using the coding scheme detailed above) reveal that neutral stimuli did acquire affective value over the course of acquisition and attenuate that affective value over the course of extinction, although there were no individual differences in th e learning rocess. Study 2 Study 2 demonstrated that neutral stimuli acquired value during acquisition, that value was attenuated during extinction, and that value was brought back online during renewal. Particiants were significa ntly more hysiologically reactive in resonse to the fa ce which was aired with the shock as comared to t he face which was not aired with the shock, over the course of the entire exeriment. Individual differences in affective learning were r elated to variation in sensitivity to affective val ue. Individuals who showed a ercetual sensitivity to affective value also showed clear atterns of acqui sition and extinction. This suggests that in order for as sociative affective learning to roceed, individual s must be ercetually sensitive to the affective roerties in their environment. Self-reorted sensitivity to affective value (as indexed by Neuroticism and Extraversion) did not redict the attern of results for acquisit ion or extinction. Self reorted, but not behavioral, sensitivity to a ffective value redicted the extent of renewal. In dividuals who were low in Extraversion (and therefore high in Introversion which is consistently linked to self- reorts of sensitivity to negative information and threat) demonstrated clear renewal effects. In c ontrast, articiants high in Extraversion and thus low in I ntroversion did not demonstrate renewal effects. Neuroticism did not redict renewal effects. Renew al effects cature the extent to which context infl uences affective learning because renewed learning occurs when articiants are returned to the original lear ning context. As such, this finding suggests that self- reorted sensitivities, and thus sensitivities to w hich the articiants in necessarily consciously aware, red ict contextual influences on affective learning. Challenges and Opportunities: Our ongoing rogram of work continues to investigat e individual differences in other affective learnin g henomena including reinstatement and generalizatio n. In order to more fully exlain variation in aff ective learning, we are constantly trying new measures of individual differences in value sensitivity. This year we will add a measure of interocetive sensitivity (i. e., sensitivity to one's hysiological state) to al l of our studies. Additionally, we hoe to identify individ ual differences that redict the variation in EDA r esonse atterns that are detailed above.

To identify dynamic atterns of affective roce sses in dyadic interactions 3. To whether atterns of affectiv e rocesses are redictive of relationshi quality and instability over time Thematic Areas: 1. Statistical Methodology 2. Dyadic Interactions 3. Emotion Methodologies: Data collection methodology involves daily self-re ort data, questionnaires, and hysiological measure s (i.e., blood ressure, heart rate variability, ime dance, resiration, galvanic skin resonse). Data a nalysis methodology involves time series analysis, dynamic factor analysis, differential equation modeling, exloratory non-arametric aroaches, small-world network modeling, and survival analysis. Methodological Findings: We have conducted a number of analyses aimed at dev eloing methods for examining dyadic interactions. We have investigated the use of state-sace modelin g (SSM) techniques for fitting dynamic factor analy sis models directly to raw data. We have used the Kalma n smoother via the Exectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood arameter es timates. In articular, using Monte Carlo studies w e have investigated the finite samle roerties of t he estimates in SSM when common factors are involve d. Our results indicate that the factor loading estima tes (i.e., relationshi of the factors to the obser ved variables), transition matrix (i.e., reresenting t he dynamics), and unique variances are asymtotical ly normal, accurate, recise, and robust, esecially f or moderate and long time series. The estimates of state residual variances show a ositive bias for shorter time series but become accurate and recise with l ong series. We have also examined the use of dynamic factor ana lysis for estimating dyadic interactions with multi le dyads. We have used simle ordinal least squares as the estimation method. Our findings are ositive a bout the use of such methods but rely on strong statisti cal assumtions that are rarely met with emirical data. Our current analyses deal with these very issues of stationarity, factorial invariance (both over time and across dyads, arameter estimates and standard erro rs, missing data and subsequent samle selection, a nd external variables). We have also studied the use of exloratory non-ar ametric aroaches based on comutational modeling alied to each coule. These methods rovide with intuitive information about the dynamics for each erson and dyad and serve as an initial ste for bu ilding a model of dyadic interactions. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 61 Findings about Dyadic Interactions: One of our goals in the first set of analyses has b een to reresent intra-individual and dyadic roces ses. We have investigated the variability in affective exe rience of individuals in dyads, examining fluctuati ons over time in affect for each dyad, as well as exami ning differences in such relationshis across dyads . For this, we fitted a number of exloratory and confirm atory models to data from all dyads and searately to each dyad searately. Our main objective here was t o generate samle results based on information from each dyad. We found that the daily fluctuations in emotional e xeriences show a clear, strong and consistent stru cture with a robust discrimination between ositive and n egative affect (general and secific-domain) and between the two individuals in the dyad. This was t rue for both the aggregate analyses and the individ ual dyad analyses. When fitting our PFA models, we used an exloratory aroach in which we secified the exected number of factors and a target matrix guid ing rotation to simle structure. The results indic ate that the data are very much in line with such a secific ation, with very small cross-loadings of manifest variables on unintended factors. With regard to the time series art of the model, o ur results suggest that most of the dynamics in the factors (i.e., ositive and negative affect) are not redic ted by the trait-like autoregressive art of the mo del that reresents stability of affective exeriences from one day to the next, but rather are the result of r andom shocks to the system that varied from day to day. M oreover, the dynamics aear to be moderate in magnitude and due almost solely to autoregressive i nfluences of each factor at one time to the same fa ctor at the next time, with a virtual absence of cross-l agged influences among factors within or between th e individuals comrising a dyad. Based on these estim ates, one would conclude that ositive affect and negative affect have little in the way of mutual in fluences and that males and females within dyads ha ve affective exeriences that have little interconnect ion. When the model is fitted to each dyad searately, h owever, the results reveal substantial variability in such dynamics across dyads. That is, although some dyads reveal little rediction in dynamics over time, ot her dyads exhibit very strong and systematic dynamics. When looking at the differences across dyads, imortant atterns are aarent. For certain dyads, lagged influences between factors over time are ve ry large, suggesting that ositive and negative affect have clear effects on each other, both within ers ons and, imortantly, between ersons comrising a dyad. The se results confirm everyday henomenology, in which our affective states seem to influence one an other and we engage in interactions with those clos e to us that roduce affective reactions in both artner s to the interaction. Overall, these results suggest that modeling dynami cs for all dyads - or, in general, all individuals - aears to be an unreasonable aroach, one that is likely to mask inter-individual differences across dyads in affective dynamics. The aggregate aroach assum es a riori that all dyads have a similar attern o f variability and dynamics and, moreover, cannot adeq uately reresent the dynamics for any articular dy ad if the dyad dearts from the norm or average. Becau se of this failure, it seems more reasonable to us to start from the information from each individual dyad and build u to generate results that aly to the sam le and, hence, to the oulation, with results based o n the uniqueness of each erson's and each dyad's information.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 62 Project Title: Transferring to Regulatory Economics the Risk-Ana lysis Aroaches to Inter-individual #: 0624218 HSD Emphasis Area: Decision Making, Risk And Uncertainty Lead PI: Adam M. Finkel, University of Pennsylvania Law Sc hool Collaborators: Winston Harrington, Sandra Hoffmann, Elena Safirova (Resources for the Future) Eldar Shafir (Princeton University) Scott Ferson, W. Troy Tucker (Alied Consultants: Dale Hattis (Clark University), Carl Cranor (Unive rsity of California, Riverside) Research Goals: 1. To assess the tyical and leading-edge treatment by regulatory economists of several imortant asects of how the costs of environmental, health, and saf ety regulatory rograms are estimated - notably uncertainty in total cost, inter-individual variab ility in the distribution of cost, and the treatmen t of \"de minimus\" and second-order effects. 2. To comare goals set and methods used on the \"cost side\" of the cost-benefit ledger with goals set and methods used by risk scientists to treat uncertain ty (etc.) on the risk side of the ledger; formulate and test hyotheses as to why the goals and methods ma y differ across the two fields. 3. To estimate the distribution of costs, across tyes of roducers, consumers, and households, of two recently-enacted environmental regulatory rograms , by building a general-equilibrium model of the intervention and collecting data on exenditures, rices, emloyment, and other relevant inuts. 4. To exlore the effects of uncertainty and variabili ty in cost on the ercetion of layeole and exer ts about the virtues rograms. Areas: 1. Cost-benefit decision-making requires commensura ble and nuanced information about both the benefits (risks reduced) and the costs of decision otions. 2. Demands (by decision makers and citizens) for i mroved information about benefits or costs may deend on their awareness of the availability and value of such information. 3. Natural scientists and economists can benefit fr om a better understanding of how and why each field construes the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and variability. Methodologies: 1. Literature review of recent Regulatory Imact Analy ses (RIAs) conducted by federal environmental, health, and safety agencies, and close analysis of cutting-edge RIAs recommended by key ersonnel in those agencies. 2. Focused interviews with leading regulatory economis ts, both in federal regulatory agencies and academia, to exlore hyotheses about why they tre at uncertainty and variability in cost in the way(s ) they do. 3. Construction of a comutable general-equilibrium mo del for each of two recent regulatory interventions. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 63 4. Surveys of layeole and exerts gauging their reac tion to hyothetical regulatory rograms, with and without information rovided on the uncertainty an d variability in the cost of the interventions. Recent Research Findings: The commencement of this work was delayed during FY 07 as the PI changed his rimary academic affiliation. Methods for quantifying uncertainty a nd variability in health risk continue to imrove ( the PI currently serves on an NAS/NRC committee evaluating imrovements in quantitative risk assessment at th e U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). During 2007 , there has been a large increase in the scholarly and oular literature about the likely costs of contro lling greenhouse gas emissions over the next severa l decades; anecdotally, it aears that most analysis and commentary on this issue imlicitly treats the se costs as known with certainty and as uniformly dist ributed across the oulation (though erhas not a cross the oulations of different nations). Challenges and Opportunities: 1. Economists tend to use different (and multile) def initions of \"cost\" in the regulatory context\u2014our referred definition for this roject (\"cost is th e sum of effects due to a regulatory intervention, both ositive and negative, on goods that are traded in markets \") may require careful elaboration. 2. It may be difficult to tease out deficiencies in co st analysis due to lack of data from those due to l ack of interest or facility on the art of analysts. 3. The roject will imrove the analytic basis for mak ing cost-benefit decisions that are better informed by realistic estimates about costs and risks, and tha t are more resonsive to ublic values and erceti ons. The roject will also serve as a roving ground fo r collaborative research among risk scientists and regulatory economists, two grous who work on the same roblems but generally do so without direct collaboration. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 64 Project Title: Integrating Risk Analysis and Risk Communication Proposal #: SES-0433152 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead PI: Baruch Fischhoff, Carnegie Mellon Co-PIs: Julie S. Downs, Keith and Elizabeth Casma n, Carnegie Mellon Collaborators: W\u00e4ndi Bruine de Bruin, Carnegie Mellon Research Goals: 1. Build integrated assessments of three domains o f risk 2. Identify new roblems and solutions, based on e xert models 3. Educate other research teams in using the metho dology Thematic Areas: 1. Radiological emergencies 2. Adolescent safety and violence 3. Animal vectors of disease and bioterror Methodologies: This roject develos and alies the emerging meth odology of integrated assessment to using the social, behavioral, and economic sciences in addressing com lex social roblems. The aroach recognizes that formal models rovide a unique form of insight into comlex, unfamiliar settings. In order to be trustworthy guides, such models must be \"behavioral ly realistic.\" They must reflect current science ab out the focal behaviors and cature the substance and e xtent of exert judgment. If they achieve such real ism, these models can then serve as temlates for target ed risk communication instruments. Recent Research Findings: On radiological emergencies, we examined three crit ical decisions: (a) whether to rovision a shelter, according to Deartment of Homeland Security guidel ines; (b) whether to travel immediately after an attack; and (c) how long to stay in a shelter. In rincile, shelters can rovide valuable rotection after an event disersing radioactive fallout. For that to h aen, however, those shelters need to be roerly reared and used. The exected value of rearatio ns deends on the chances of being able to use a sh elter and of its rovisions being sufficient. The acceta bility of risks from traveling before fallout arriv es deends on the benefits that such travel rovides ( e.g., getting one to a good shelter). The results of our analysis inform decisions about rearation, immediate resonse, and ultimate evacuation. The cost of the rovisions on DHS's lis t would be trivial for many individuals, rohibitiv e for others. Authorities who count on citizen rearedne ss should reanalyze that exectation and see if the y can make things better, with good communication and mat erial suort, for those who cannot act on their ow n. After an attack, authorities will have limited abil ity to collect, analyze, and disseminate informatio n. They may only be able to identify the blast location, th en communicate simle advice for eole in broad ar eas. Investments in finer characterizations (e.g., lume models) may have little ractical value, eseciall y comared with investments in heling individuals to gras and aly these simle rules (e.g., understa nding Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 65 the risks of traveling in fallout to be with loved ones). Plausible ranges of shielding effectiveness and egress time lead to a wide range of otimal eriods for st aying in a shelter, in terms of minimizing radiatio n exosure. Other considerations (Fig. 1) might justi fy incurring the extra radiation exosure from evac uating earlier. Those ressures might be reduced by well-g uided shelter rearations and lans for meeting th e needs that imel eole to travel (e.g., assured ca re for loved ones). Emirically evaluated messages are needed to ensure that individuals have the best os sible chance of understanding what they are u agai nst, so that they may make sound choices. We also comleted a worksho to exlore following s imilar methodologies in addressing other risks. In collaboration with colleagues at Tsinghua Universit y's Center for Crisis Management Research in Beijin g, a team of 4 senior and 3 junior scholars from Carne gie Mellon engaged in a week-long set of activities in Beijing from 11-15 June 2007, the goal of which was to assess the status of risk analysis and risk communication in China as it relates to ractical n eeds of Chinese government and industry, to test a coherent series of lectures intended to serve as a guide for risk managers on integrated risk analysis and risk communication, and to develo a strategy for ongoin g collaborative research between Tsinghua and Carnegie Mellon. Our activities included a 2-day wo rksho at Tsinghua and visits with officials from several government and non-government organizations to give talks or conduct interviews on risk analysis/communication needs. A worksho on integra ted risk analysis and risk communication, held on 14-15 June 2007, brought the Carnegie Mellon team t ogether with two dozen Chinese engaged in various asects of risk management. The worksho was co-fun ded by NSF-China. These activities come on the heels of a recent initiative by China's State Counc il to formulate emergency lans throughout the government (including government-owned industry), b oth across sectors and across levels (national, rovincial, county, and local). The need for such lans was laid bare by the 2003 SARS eidemic in whi ch key government agencies were slow to ublicize and act on evidence that the disease was sreading, resulting in significant loss of life and economic activity. As a result of this State Council action, government agencies are keen to learn about risk ma nagement science and ractice. Challenges and Opportunities: The Tsinghua worksho resented many challenges in risk communication in China, and a number of oortunities for continuing collaboration, includi ng conducting a series of case studies worked to t o bottom. Possible toics for which collaborations ar e ready include consumer electronics recycling, foo d and drug safety, and ublic health. Additionally, we have the oortunity to conduct a risk ranking across a diverse set of risks. At the worksho, we discussed alternative motivations for doing risk ranking, including mere enlightenment fo r the risk management community, allocating research attention, and allocating investment in risk interventions. For the last, we discussed the ros ects of ranking solutions vs. ranking risks. That i s, if you want to maximize the utility of risk management inv estment, you really want a ranking of interventions by cost effectiveness, across a range of risks. The su ggestion was made to see if the Beijing municial government would be interested in sonsoring a rank ing exercise for local ublic health risks.

To use an environmental entitlements aroach to inform economic, demograhic, institutional, and cultural data collection at household, district, rovincial, national, and international scales on fa ctors affecting land-cover and land-use change in the re gion. 2. To link economic, demograhic, institutional an d cultural data to a comrehensive, high-resolution satial database of land cover in MMSEA develoed in a roject funded by NASA. 3. To develo cellular automata and agent-based mo dels that utilize the narratives of economic, demograhic, institutional, and cultural change wi thin the satial framework to address \"what if\" questions concerning hyothesized changes in socia l and biohysical variables and to increase our understanding beyond the available emirical data. Thematic Areas: 1. How do interventions lanned and executed by nat ional and international develoment agents affect land-use ractices in ways both lanned and not l anned? 2. How do forces of change affect diversity and equ ality or inequality among individuals, grous, and nations? 3. How can satial tools, data resources, and model ing aroaches be used to advance our understanding of human/environmental interactions? Methodologies: This roject built a multidiscilinary team to coll ect and analyze economic, demograhic, institutiona l and cultural data; and to combine these data with a mul ti-temoral high-resolution satial database to dev elo a narrative of land-cover and land-use change in the region. We are using cellular automata and agent-ba sed modeling to address \"what if\" questions concerning hyothesized changes in social and biohysical variables and to increase our understanding beyond the available emirical data. The study is geograh ically tiered, with some broad analysis carried out for th e region as a whole and other more intensive and co mlex analyses conducted for selected subareas. Recent Research Findings: In MMSEA shifting cultivation is raidly giving way to commercial agriculture driven by demand, money and labor. To understand this change the research t eam adoted a concetual model of landscae change based on two scenarios: a lantation economy with e xtensive monocroing of cash cros such rubber; and a agroecosystem with smallholders rodu cing a variety of cros for consumtion and sale. I n Xishuangbanna, China, both state farms (recently se mi-rivatized) and minority farmers conform to the Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 67 lantation economy model\u2014monocroing of rubber. On e interesting finding is that small ethnic minority farmers aear to be better able to adat to changi ng conditions for growing rubber and contracting resources for future roduction than the cumbersome ex-state farm comanies. In northern Thailand, the landscae conforms more to the diverse agroecosyste m model roducing a variety of cros. Rural eole in Thailand, however, are becoming increasingly divorc ed from farming, and education and consumerism aear to be creating a context where rural eole will disintensify, even abandon their land, in favo r of non-farm ursuits. In Laos, entrereneurs have cont racted farmers to grow corn, bananas and sugar cane for the Chinese markets. In order to meet the booming d emand for rubber, highlanders, usually ethnic minorities, are lanting rubber trees on family lo ts, and turning to relatives in China for advice an d to merchants for seeds, grafts, and taing tools. Challenges and Opportunities: Our greatest challenge has been to understand (and model) not only the olicies and markets that drive land- use change, but also the ideologies of ethnicity, e conomic develoment, modernity, and scientific rati onality that almost always underlie state olicies and land allocations. Our greatest oortunity has been the ability to build a foundation for a long-term longitudinal study of land cover change in a region undergoing dramatic social, economic, olitical, and landscae change.

James P. Sillane, Northwestern University Brian Rowan, University of Michigan Gary Sykes, Michigan State University Research Goals: The rimary goal of this research study is to study change rocesses linked to new institutional ress ures on schools brought about by the threat of sanctions under the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). In articular, the research seeks to develo and test models that integrate accounts of individual and organizational change in resonse to NCLB. In this study, our rincial question is \"How do so cial rocesses and structures formed during the imlementation of revious reforms and innovations enable and constrain teachers' resonses to new institutional forces?\" This question calls for atte ntion to organizational level factors that affect i nteractions, the formation of interactions in resonse instituti onal ressure and how those interactions affect tea chers' behaviors. Therefore, we ask: How do formal oortunities for shared decision-mak ing and informal oortunities for collaboration carry over or shift as a wave of res sure begins to take hold? How do interactions teachers draw on to resond to new institutional forces emerge from interactions regarding revious reforms? Which interactions, exeriences and attributes that emerged through rior reforms are most strongly related to teachers' resonses to new institutional forces? Thematic Areas: Linking individual and organizational change Institutional theory Network change Educational reform Methodologies: The study team is collecting longitudinal data on t eachers' classroom teaching ractices, rincial an d other administrative leadershi behaviors, and on t eachers' social networks using questionnaires and interviews. We are using a combination of case ana lyses of schools' leadershi ractice's effects on Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 69 organizational functioning, social network analyses to model selection of ties and change in networks over time, and multi-level models to test the influence of network ties and individual characteristics on t eacher change. Recent Research Findings: How do formal opportunities for shared decision-mak ing and informal opportunities for collaboration carry over or shift as a wave of pressure begins to take hold? /head2right Organizational forms that emerged from an earlier s chool restructuring movement in the 1980s and 1990s are being used now to discuss NCLB-related co ncerns, including how to raise test scores of low-erforming students. Beginning in the 1980s, schools develoed organizat ional structures designed to reduce the isolation o f teachers and romote greater teacher involvement in school-level decision-making. Desite the fact the se efforts had limited imacts on teaching and learnin g, these forms have ersisted. They include the cre ation of grade-level and \"vertical\" teams that meet regul arly to discuss curricular matters, the creation of common lanning eriods for teachers, and rotocols and rocesses for structuring collaboration. Today , schools have aroriated these organizational form s to discuss strategies for imroving the achieveme nt of low-erforming students, including underreresen ted grous in the school. /head2right Relative to earlier reforms studied for schools in the samle, interactions concerning reading and math are less frequent. The average teacher received hel from 0.6 others c oncerning imlementation of the reform whereas the average teacher received hel from 0.32 others to i ncrease STAR reading test scores and 0.35 others to imlement STAR math test scores. Thus, in sum, the re is as much interaction concerning STAR testing f or both reading and math as there was about the reform . We also note that the differences could be a fun ction of our instrument: school rosters were used to elic it names concerning hel with the reform whereas resonses to hel regarding the STAR test were base d on free recall. The differences in amount of hel received for STAR testing for reading and math were not statistically different, although many of the interactions concerning reading and math were betwe en the same teachers. Teachers received hel from about 0.5 colleagues for a total of about 36 days i n the school year for each subject. Which interactions, experiences and attributes that emerged through prior reforms are most strongly related to teachers' responses to new institutional forces? /head2right Perceived ressure to change is linked to receit o f federal funds. Teachers in the aggregate erceive less ressure when they teach in schools not receiv ing Title I funds. Princials and teachers in more economically advant aged schools reorted little to know influence of NCLB on their individual or organizational behavior , relative to schools that received Title I funding for serving low-income children. This fact is not surr ising, since the sanctions of NCLB aly only to Ti tle I schools. Nonetheless, it is imortant, because NCLB is art of a larger set of institutional forces re lated to accountability in education, to which all schools a re subject. /head2right Many teachers and rincials do not distinguish NCL B ressures from state and local ressures associated with a larger set of institutional force s: accountability-based reforms. Even secific Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 70 requirements regarding teacher quality, which osten sibly affect their job status, are not distinguishe d by teachers. This finding was surrising in that NCLB was \"new\" in its demand that schools be held accountable for erformance of all subgrous and that all teachers hold a degree in the subject matter they taught. Be fore NCLB, California did not hold its schools accountab le for high levels of achievement for each subgrou in a school. At the same time, accountability ressure s on schools had been mounting for several years r ior to assage of NCLB. Teachers had already adjusted i n some ways to a tighter couling between their classroom ractice and organizational ractice. Challenges and Opportunities: /head2right A key challenge in struggling schools is high teach er turnover. This challenge creates ractical roblems for schools but also methodological ones, when studying network change. At least some asects of network change are a function of levels of turnover, not resonses to institutional ressur e. This has imlications for building school caacity and teacher induction. Aroximately 35% of the eole on our rosters in 2 005 were not on our rosters in 2007, and aroximately 28% of the eole on our rosters in 2 007 were not on our rosters in 2005. This suggests about a 33% turnover in 2 years. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 71 Project Title: Social and Economic Effects of a Natural Disaster Project #: CMS-0527762 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of On December 26, 2004 the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake struck in the Indian Ocean, creating a tsunami that slammed into the nearby island of Sumatra some 45 minutes later, resulting in unaralleled devast ation. The tsunami ultimately wreaked havoc on 10 countrie s and some 4500 kilometers of coastline throughout the region. Estimates suggest that worldwide casual ties likely number over a quarter of a million eo le. The vast majority of deaths occurred in Indonesia, where some communities were almost comletely wied out. Less than a year later, Hurricane Katrina deva stated the Gulf Coast of the United States and the city of New Orleans in articular. The costs of these disasters have been huge and hav e underscored our limited knowledge of how eole coe in the aftermath of such catastrohes. Drawing on the discilines of demograhy, economics, geograhy, ublic health, and sociology, in this r oject we rovide scientific evidence on the magnitu de of the shock associated with the tsunami, on the ace and shae of the recovery rocess, and the roles th at institutions lay in heling or hindering that reco very rocess in both the short and the longer term. Thematic Areas: The thematic areas that this roject encomasses in clude the costs of disasters and the distribution o f their imacts, the effectiveness of recovery strategies i mlemented by individuals and by assistance agencie s. Methodologies: Focusing on Indonesia, the country most affected by the tsunami, we are assembling, collecting and analyzing uniquely rich longitudinal survey data an d combining it with satellite-based measures of destruction caused by the tsunami. Baseline data a re rovided by a broad-urose household survey conducted by Statistics Indonesia in early 2004 in tsunami-affected areas, and in comarable areas tha t were not directly affected by the tsunami (N=39,000 ). We have designed and fielded a longitudinal sur vey, the Study of the Tsumami Aftermath and Recovery sur vey (STAR) which locates and, if alive, re- interviews the same resondents. The first two fol low u waves of STAR were conducted in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, and the third follow-u wave is curr ently in the field. We use remotely-sensed data to quantify damage within the communities as well as t he ace of recovery. Recent Research Findings: We have exlored the imact of the tsunami on morta lity and on mental health for survivors. With res ect to mortality, the tsunami exacted a far higher toll on women, children, and the elderly than on rime age males. The differential effect on rime age women versus rime age men reflects several factors. Wom en were less likely to be able to swim, they were less likely to be at sea on fishing boats (which was a safe lace to be), and they were more likely to be at ho me with small children or elderly relatives in thei r care. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 72 With resect to mental health, we document a clear dose-resonse relationshi between ost traumatic stress disorder and degree of exosure to tsunami-r elated trauma. Levels of PTSD in areas outside the direct imact of the tsunami are non-trivial, sugge sting that the mental health imlications of a larg e-scale natural disaster are widesread. Exosure to traum a is more strongly related to PTSD than are demograhic factors, and socioeconomic standing bef ore the tsunami has almost no rotective imact. Challenges and Opportunities This roject resents a number of challenges and o ortunities: how to track individual resondents i n the uheavel that follows a major disaster, what to ri oritize in terms of measurments, and how to transti on from a focus on short term costs to medium- and lon ger-term recovery strategies. One interesting oortunity is the exloration of links between ex osure to trauma, develoment of ost-traumatic stre ss disorder, and subsequent hysical health.

Social/cultural dynamics: internal social roles , norms, ractices and trust, that is, a socially d ynamic team culture, are necessary for IDR teams to becom e established and to thrive. 2. Organizational dynamics: evolution of social ne tworks, as collaborations attemt to form (some nev er do) and mature, social exectations, rocesses, an d roles of members are transformed as the organizational life course of IDR teams rogress ( regress) over time. Methodologies: Subjects are academic researchers at University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB) and Kansas State University (K- State) who reviously or currently collaborate with at least two researchers outside their disciline to seek research funding suort and/or to ublish research findings as a roduct of IDR collaboration. IDR researchers were recruited through outreach worksho s (K-State in fall 2006, UB in sring 2007) and li sts generated using advice from knowledgeable faculty c olleagues and administrators (e.g., the Office of t he Vice-President for Research). We included (i) scien tists who had tried IDR but the team failed to gel, (ii) researchers who are members of new or established I DR teams and (iii) those who are members of IDR teams that are winding down or inactive. We also be gan intensive ethnograhic research on an 'IDR grou in formation' at KState (summer 2007) from its ince tion and are in the rocess of staging a UB counterart. We are using multile Delhi rounds of online surve y data collection (Phase 1 oen-ended exloratory survey rate at UB) to develo and refine standardized data collection instruments, in tensive interviews with IDR investigators, and ethnograhic observation of IDR teams in various or ganizational life course stages. Recent Research Findings: Oen-ended resonses from the Phase 1 online survey have been oen coded using grounded theory techniques for the analysis of qualitative data. Am ong the social, organizational, and cultural conce ts central to this exloratory work include key social relations, structural elements of the team social milieu and social dynamics relating to ower structures, n orms of grou behavior, and role exectations. The demograhic characteristics of IDR teams (size and comosition in terms of rank, gender, discilinary background among others), the ower structures iml ied by grou dynamics and institutional relations, and Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 74 the differences among teams in formation versus est ablished or dying (active and inactive) teams were toics identified as imortant by resondents to th e first round survey. Some subjects defined the key to successful IDR tea ms in terms of rocess and the quality of social interactions, including mutual resect, equivalent efforts, trust, and satisfaction. Other researchers emhasized roducts, including funding, conference aers and ublications, and scientific breakthroughs/new discoveries imossible within a s ingle disciline. Themes relating to social dynamic s of successful teams included mutual resect, oen-mind to work together, shared humor, good communication, and assion. Themes relating to the social dynamic s that undermine team success include overbearing ind ividuals, data/credit hogs, arrogance/large egos, l ack of resect based on status/discilines, teams and suression of dissent. In terms of IDR t eam social dynamics that affect individuals ositively, themes emerging from analysis of subject resonses include oortunities for networking, generosity of individuals teaching about other discilines, res ect and encouragement, others valuing contribution, colleag ues who share work and credit, mentorshi and friendshi. Asects of IDR team social dynamics aff individuals negatively include erceived sta tus hierarchies (discilines/ranks), cometitiveness, l ack of clear exectations, bullying, slackers, fear and hostility between ranks/discilines, turf wars, cri tics who don't contribute, domineering individuals and weak leaders. These and other dimensions of social dynamics are being refined and exlicated for use i n a standardized closed-ended survey in Phase 2 (beginn ing 11/07). Rolling recruitment for Phase 2 (acceting all elig ible volunteers) will generate the highest ossible articiation rates for the next online survey aski ng resondents to rank order the imortance of key concetual categories taing the social, cultural and organizational dynamics of IDR teams. Continuin g exansion and refinement of lists of eligible resea rchers will maximize variation on key subject attri butes (e.g., rank, tenure, gender). Beyond demograhic di versity, future recruitment will also focus on maximizing the variation among \"tyes\" and \"roles\" of individual IDR team members (leadershi, alliances, disciline, roles on rojects). While th e Phase 2 online survey is in the field, UB researc hers will conduct interviews at UB and travel to KState for i ntensive interviews with IDR scientists there. With regard to Research Goal 3, two Graduate Assist ants have been hired. They are engaged with both survey data collection as well as observational res earch of the 'IDR grou in formation,' and have ur sued other interdiscilinary activities including rear ing new curriculum materials for the graduate cours e Multidiscilinary Thought and Presentation (K-State ). Challenges and Opportunities: Challenges: Persuading busy academic researchers to resond to online surveys and identifying sufficie nt researchers for the samle who have attemted to la unch IDR teams but failed to do so. Oortunities: On both camuses, researchers have been able to identi fy and will have oortunities to observe 'new' IDR teams in formation, using ethnograhic techniques f or data collection. Observation of new team has beg un at K-State (08/07) and will begin in Buffalo (10/07 ). In resonse to the recruitment workshos held at Kansas State and University at Buffalo, and their e xosure to the first round of data collection, a nu mber of researchers have volunteered for in-deth interview s, which will be started in fall 2007.

Cox, Georgia State University; James So hrer, IBM Almaden Research Center; and Daniel Zeng, University of Arizona. Collaborators: Nirvikar Singh and Ryan Orea, University Huazhong rsity of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Research Goal: To identify the market formats and agent behaviors that are most effective in realistic IT environment s. We consider both one-sided markets (auctions) and two- sided, and study humans and automated agents who articiate in markets asynchronously. Thematic Areas: The research falls mainly in the Agents of Change ( AOC) area of emhasis but also has imlications for the Dynamics of Human Behavior (DHB) and the Decision M aking, Risk and Uncertainty (DRU) areas. Proerly incororating the new information technolo gy into the economy, transforming markets and services, is a key to economic growth and greater s ocial equity. The transformation itself is largely in the hands of business eole and olicy makers, and the ir work will be greatly aided by science. The IT sc ience is solid but the economic science lags. Our fundame ntal research will hel close the ga. Markets once were mainly local, but now increasingly coordinate and control human activities on a national and glob al scale, echoing themes of the DHB area of emhasis. And innovations in market strategies certainly refl ect the main DRU themes at both the individual and grou level. Methodologies: We develo new theoretical models for IT-enabled ma rkets, and test and refine them (and revious model s) in comuter simulations and in laboratory exerimen ts with human subjects and automated agents. Recent Research Findings: \"Markus in Double Auction Markets,\" by Wenjie Zhan and Daniel Friedman, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 31:9, 2984-3005 (Setember 2007) studies the continuous double auction market with simulated traders using various marku rules. A higher marku trades off increased rofitability against reduced robability of a transaction. The t radeoff in Nash equilibrium turns out to be remarka bly close to the most efficient tradeoff. This may art ially exlain the \"mysterious\" efficiency of double auction markets. \"A Laboratory Investigation of Deferral Otions,\" b y Ryan Orea, Daniel Friedman and Steven T. Anderson, UCSC Working Paer #635, March 2007 consi ders an irreversible investment oortunity has value $V$ governed by Brownian motion with uward d rift and random exiration. Human subjects choose Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 76 in continuous time when to invest. If she invests b efore exiration, the subject receives $V - C$: the final value $V$ less a given avoidable cost $C$. The oti mal olicy is to invest when $V$ first crosses a threshold $V^* = (1+w^*)C$, where the otion remiu m secific function of the Brownian arameters reresenting drift, volatility and disco unt (or exiration hazard) rate. We ran 80 eriods each for 69 subjects. Subjects in the Low $w^*$ treatment on average invested at values quite close to otimum. Subjects in the two Medium treatments and the High $w^*$ invested at values below otimum, but with th e redicted ordering, and values aroached the otim um by the last block of 20 eriods. Behavior was mo st heterogeneous in the High treatment. Subjects under resond to differences in both the volatility and exiriation hazard arameters. A directional learni ng model suggests that subjects react reliably to e x-ost losses due to early investment, and react much more heterogeneously (and on average more strongly) to missed investment oortunities. Simulations show t hat this learning rocess converges on a nearly ot imal steady state. \"Financial Engineering and Rationality: Exerimenta l Evidence Based on the Monty Hall Problem,\" with Brian Kluger, July 2006, is circulated as a Univers ity of Siena working aer. Financial engineering o ften involves redefining existing financial assets to cr eate new financial roducts. This aer investigate s whether financial engineering can alter the environ ment so that irrational agents can quickly learn to be rational. The secific environment we investigate i s based on the Monty Hall roblem, a well-studied choice anomaly. Our results show that, by the end o f the exeriment, the majority of subjects understa nd the Monty Hall anomaly. Average valuation of the ex erimental asset is very close to the exected valu e based on the true robabilities. In their research roject on \"Dutch Auctions and Ce ntiede Games,\" James C. Cox and Duncan James construct several new real-time auctions and comar e their erformance in exeriments to generalized forms of centiede games. The central objective of the research is to attain a deeer understanding o f inconsistencies between theoretical redictions and data such as the emirical failure of the redicte d isomorhism of Dutch of lay for the standard ce ntiede game. Imlementation of the new variants o f Dutch auctions and centiede games has involved dev eloment of new exerimental software. The new Dutch auction formats are of otential interest in e-commerce alications. In their aer titled, \"Is There a Plausible Theory for Risky Decisions?\" (Exerimental Economics Cent er Working Paer 2007-05, Georgia State University), J ames C. Cox, Vjollca Sadiraj, Bodo Vogt, and Utteeyo Dasguta reort an extension the small-s takes risk aversion calibration critique of theorie s of risk aversion. They extend the calibration critiqu e to decision theories that reresent risk aversion solely with transformation of robabilities. Testable cali bration roositions are derived that aly theories: exected utility theory, cumulative rosect theory, rank-deendent exected utility theory, and dual exected utility theory. Heretofore, calibration critiques of theori es of risk aversion have been based solely on thought exerime nts. This aer reorts real exeriments that rovi de data on the relevance of the calibration critiques to evaluating the lausibility of theories of risk aversion. The aer also discusses imlications of the data f or (original) rosect theory with editing of refer ence ayoffs and for the new dual-self model of imulse control. In addition, the aer reorts an exerime nt with a truncated St. Petersburg bet that adds to da ta inconsistent with risk neutrality. The content of this aer has wide imlications for theory develoment in economics and finance, most clearly for auction theory. In their aer titled \"Risky Decisions in the Large and in the Small: Theory and Exeriment\" (forthcom ing in J.C. Cox and G.W. Harrison (eds.), Research in Experimental Economics, Vol. 12: Risk A version in Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 77 Experiments,JAI Press), James C. Cox and Vjollca Sadiraj examin e a class of decision theories that contains exected value theory, exected utility th eory, rosect theory, rank deendent exected util ity theory, and dual exected utility theory, and exla in the fundamental roblems inherent in all of them . The aer focuses on two generic tyes of roblems that are common to theories of risky decisions: (a) St. Petersburg-tye aradoxes; and (2) imlications of imlausible risk aversion. The aer also discusses the generalization of the small-stakes risk aversion ca libration literature, away from its revious focus on imlications of decreasing marginal utility of mone y, to include imlications of robability transform ations. The aer exlains why, in order to avoid imlausib le imlications, theories of risky decisions must b e develoed for bounded domains. But such theoretical reformulation leads to testable hyotheses that fo llow from finite St. Petersburg games and calibrations o f the large-stakes risk aversion imlications of for risky decision theorie s on bounded domains are discussed in the third art of our essay. The content of this aer has wide imlications for theory develoment in economics an d finance, most clearly for auction theory. In their aer titled \"Revealed Altruism,\" forthcom ing in Econometrica , James C. Cox, Daniel Friedman, and Vjollca Sadiraj extend Neoclassical reference theory to encomass social references. It introduc es \"more altruistic than\" (MAT), a artial ordering ov er references, and interret it with known aramet ric models. The aer also introduces and illustrates \" more generous than\" (MGT), a artial ordering over oortunity sets. Several recent studies focus on t wo layer extensive form games of comlete informat ion in which the first mover (FM) chooses a more or les s generous oortunity set for the second mover (SM ). Here recirocity can be formalized as the assertion that an MGT choice by the FM will elicit MAT references in the SM. A further assertion is that the effect on references is stronger for acts of commission by FM than for acts of omission. The a er states and roves several roositions on the observable consequences of these assertions. Finall y, emirical suort for the roositions is found in existing data from Investment and Dictator games, t he Carrot and Stick game, and the Stackelberg duoo ly game and in new data from Stackelberg mini-games. In their aer titled \"Trust in Private and Common Proerty Exeriments\" (resented at the anel on \"Fairness Economics and Political Economy\" at the 1 03 rd American Political Science Association Annual Meetings, Chicago, Illinois, August 30-Setember 2, 2007), James C. Cox, Elinor Ostrom, and James M. Walker reort the results from a series of exerime nts designed to investigate behavior in two setting s that are frequently osited in the olicy literature as generating different outcomes: rivate roerty an d common roerty. The exerimental arallel earlier exerimental studies of the inves tment or trust game. The rimary research question relate s to the effect of the initial allocation of roer ty rights on the level of trust that subjects will extend to others with whom they are linked. We find that ini tial endowments as common roerty lead to marginally gr eater cooeration or trust than when the initial endowment is fully owned by the first layer as ri vate roerty. Subjects' decisions are also shown to be correlated with attitudes toward trust and fairness measured in ost-exeriment questionnaires. Challenges and Opportunities: So far we have focused mainly on existing formats f or one and two sided markets. We hoe to begin running arallel markets in more than one format, t o consider new hybrid formats, and to construct a greater variety of automated agents. It is always a challenge to coordinate the efforts of three very different labs, but it also creates unique oortunities.

Reresent household decision making in three areas on three continents using an agent-based model. 2. Assess olicy or management questions using sce nario analyses with linked ecosystem and household models. 3. Identify attributes of livestock-owning househo lds that rovide resilience to environmental change . Thematic Areas: 1. Decision-making and risk 2. Resilience of the human-environment system 3. Human well-being and ecosystem services 4. Agent based models linked to ecosystem models Methodologies: We have constructed a satially-exlicit model call ed DECUMA that reresent livestock-owning households as agents. Exerts in astoral systems have worked with us to arameterize DECUMA to reresent household decision making, and new field work has suorted that effort. The agent-based mo del has been tightly linked with a comrehensive ecosys tem model called SAVANNA, and is now being linked to a second ecosystem model called DayCent. We are using the linked models to conduct scenario analyses, where the resonses of households to envi ronmental change and the resilience of their liveli hoods are assessed. Recent Research Findings: In early 2007, field work was conducted in Kajiado , Kenya to generate information on social networks and decision making, to hel derive rules for DECUMA. One of the key questions being asked of DECUMA for Kajiado is the value of movement atterns to hu man well-being and the ecosystem. Accordingly, a questionnaire was designed and tested to collect in formation on the different tyes of movement that Maasai astoralists undertake, and how movement dec isions are made. Thirty-six households were samled. The field work was carried out under the suervision of Claire Bedelian at the International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi. At this time last year we were in the midst of lan ning the structure for DECUMA, which did not exist. Now, after a busy year of develoment, we have esse ntially a comlete model that reresents decision making by astoralists in Kajiado District, Kenya. Jacob Jawson added a grahical interface that allo ws the user to set the number of households to model, the suite of household files to use as initializing tem lates, and outut characteristics. The interface includes behind-the-scenes calls to SAVANNA, so that a clic k on Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 81 a button in user interface starts the ecosystem sim ulation. As the simulation rogresses, the suitabi lity to livestock of cells used to reresent the grided lan dscae are dislayed on a ma, along with the locat ions of households and livestock. Our ast modeling of livestock was oulation based . In contrast, in DECUMA houses have an exlicit lace in sace, and households own a given number o f livestock and graze those animals in laces household members select. We rogrammed a livestoc k oulation dynamics module aroriate for individual households and herds. Animal condition indices influenced birth rates and death rates, yie lding a oulation model sensitive to changes in forage ava ilability. Other effects on death rates are includ ed, such as disease and redation. After we confirmed reaso nable resonses of this module using simulated household data, we merged the module with DECUMA. Households in the DECUMA model were required to tra ck energy balances, livestock holdings, exenditures and incomes, to raise and harvest cro s, and to seek relief when needed. We translated existing oulation-based code in FORTRAN into Java , and made extensive modifications to yield an agent-based model of household dynamics aroriate for DECUMA. Phili Thornton came to Colorado State University for a five-day working session on the DREAMAR roject, and during that time reviewed the imlementation of the module to be used for DEC UMA and made suggestions. After we confirmed reasonable oututs from this module, we merged the module into DECUMA. DREAMER team members sought to have household heads in our model change their mix of livelihoods as they aged. Using survey data, Shauna BurnSilver ha d defined households as having a given attern of diversification (i.e., the household racticed some combination of 10 livelihood athways). For exam le, as a household head ages, his or her likelihood of being involved in etty trade declines, but the ot ential to be a leader increases. BurnSilver used her data to assigned robabilities that household heads in age grous would select each of the 10 diversification methods , and assigned modifiers that alter the robabiliti es that a household in a given location will select a given athway based on reciitation, wealth, and schoolin g. We used these data in a very simle agent-based mod el that had household heads aging. In essence, the static diversity athways BurnSilver found in her h ousehold surveys were made dynamic. The result is now being merged with DECUMA. We are adating the SAVANNA model to the Mongolian study area (8500 km 2). The study area modeled is Bayan-Ovoo and Jinst Sums, lus a western ortio n of Olzitt Sum, all in Bayankhongor Aimag. The si te sans from desert and desert stee to high mountai n meadows, and in elevation from 1249 to 3951 m. Maria Fern\u00e1ndez-Gim\u00e9nez rovided results from house hold surveys that she conducted in 1995, and reeated in 1999 and 2006, which will be used in DE CUMA. Efforts to date have focused on utting in lace satial data used by SAVANNA or in arameteri zing the model. Challenges and Opportunities: An oortunity to leverage ongoing work at the Nati onal Resource Ecology Laboratory on a system linkin g hundreds of DayCent simulations (DayCentIRC) with o ur agent-based modeling resented itself. We are now linking the DECUMA model with DayCent through D ayCentIRC. Our challenges have been those tyical of modeling and software develoment. We m ust balance our desire for more detail in the agent - based model versus its comlexity and the time for software develoment, and our wish to conduct analy ses and build broader imacts.

Barry (University of Colorado at Boulder ); Henry Huntington (Huntington Consulting) Collaborators: Andy Mahoney (University of Colorado at Boulder); tt (Barrow); Nancy Leavitt (Barrow). Research Goals: 1. Characterize sea ice and its use by humans at ea ch location (e.g., seasonal atterns of use, use of secific features and zones, role of thickness in various activities, etc.); 2. Document changes to sea ice, with articular at tention to the features most crucial for human uses (e.g., seasonality, shorefast ice formation, roughness, e tc.); 3. Document change in human use atterns over time (e.g., effects of modernization in recent decades, effects of hunting regulations, effects of climate change, etc.); 4. Recent human resonses to changes in sea ice (e .g., acquisition of new knowledge, changes in hunti ng atterns, changes in equiment, etc.); 5. Document imacts from sea ice changes and human resonses (e.g., reduced role for elders as old knowledge becomes less relevant, changes in harves t atterns, increased risk, greater reliance on regional government, etc.); 6. Understand imlications for future changes, im acts, and adatations (e.g., shifts in hunting att erns, reliance on new technology, changes in regulatory regime, etc.). Also: 1. Establish a working research team of interdisci linary scientists, and Inuit, Inughuit, and I\u00f1uia t hunters to work together to study sea ice, bringing indige nous and scientific knowledge and ersectives together. 2. Establish methods and aroaches to link indige nous knowledge and scientific measurements to characterize sea ice and assess sea ice changes. 3. Produce creative research roducts, in articul ar, a sea ice encycloedia documenting sea ice terminology and knowledge from 4 cultures/language s: Canadian Inuit, I\u00f1uiat, Inughuit, and science/English. Methodologies: Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 83 Our methodology has a three-ronged aroach. Thes e methods collect information in different ways, bu t all comlement one another and hel to build a more comlete icture of local-scale sea ice conditions and usage as well as changes in both of these: 1. Knowledge exchanges : Three reresentatives from each articiating Arc tic community involved, along with roject scientists, form a unique research tea m of eole with different backgrounds, exertise, and exerience. As a team, we travel to each of the th ree communities where we meet with local exerts an d learn about local sea ice conditions and sea ice us e. The emhasis is time sent on the ice, learning about and engaging in local activities. 2. Sea ice data collection : U to four sea ice measurement stations are oer ating (during the sea ice season) at each community location. The stations a re used to measure the thickness and temerature of sea ice and snow on a weekly basis. These measurements hel quantify the sea ice regime at each community in terms of ice growth and melt, snow accumulation, and the timing of the annual cycle. We have trai ned local eole in each community how to install these stations and take the measurements. 3. Traditional knowledge interviews : Interviews with local sea ice exerts are on-goi ng in each of the study communities. Local eole conduct these inte rviews (both individual and grou interviews) and translators hel to comile English transcrits for analysis and to combine with information collected by the other methods. Recent Research Findings: Sea ice in all three communities has changed during the lifetime of the current eldest generation and is continuing to do so. The changes have resulted in changes to sea ice use. For examle: o Barrow: /square4 Landfast sea ice forms later and breaks u earlier, leading to greater suscetibility to coastal erosion from autumn storms /square4 Landfast ice is less stable and redictable and the re has been a rise in the number of hunters stranded on drifting ice in recent years o Qaanaaq: /square4 Fjord sea ice is thinner and less stable. This has made travel on sea ice more hazardous and has revented access to some hunting grounds for first time in living memory /square4 Dynamics and freeze u in Baffin Bay and Smith Soun d has changed. Lack of multi-year sea ice means southern Smith Sound no longer gets choke d with ice, which means more ice asses through instead of forming a continuous ice cover o Clyde River: /square4 Knowledge exchange at Clyde scheduled for Aril, 20 08 /square4 Initial research shows that sea ice forms later and breaks u earlier by about 2-3 weeks each. That's over a month lost in the sea ice season /square4 Sea ice itself is softer than usual, the quality (a s judged through traditional methods) and texture is not the same A comarison of ice growth data between Qaanaaq and Clyde River reveals a significant difference in the ice regimes. A simle energy budget estimate ba sed uon ice growth, snow cover, and air temeratur e suggests that ocean heat flux is significant near Q aanaaq, where it retards ice growth during the wint er and increases bottom-melt in sring. The data from Clyd e River suggest ocean heat is a less imortant Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 84 comonent of the energy budget. Identifying differe nces like these in the sea ice regime will hel us to understand the different ways in which the sea ice is changing at each community. Challenges and Opportunities: Logistics of knowledge exchange tris are very co mlicated and work intensive. However, both tris held so far (Qaanaaq and Barrow) were very successful an d all tri objectives were achieved. We had tremendous logistics hel from VECO. Language barriers exist (there are 4 working lang uages), however, the roject team has been communicating well using English as the common lang uage. The different languages are actually a benef it in many ways as everyone is taking a great interest in learning the similarities and differences in th e different Inuit dialects.

Communication and social network research as it intersects with new aroaches to diffusion theory in online organizational systems 2. Relationshi between technology and the human a nd social dynamics of change 3. Dynamic dislay of diffusion atterns, associat ed social networks, and message networks Methodologies : The study will advance the ractice of organization al change and hel accelerate the diffusion of innovations in global networked organizations by in vestigating, documenting and validating a new methodology using existing information technology n etwork infrastructure, and by develoing techniques to dynamically lan, monitor and manage the diffusion of innovations and organizational change in real ti me. Simle, clear and reusable indicators for a \"digita l diffusion dashboard\" will oen a new frontier for both scholars and ractitioners alike. Primary methodol ogies include: Collecting email from innovation team members in re al time and dislaying the dynamic communication networks and the central content of m essages about the innovation as it occurs, measuring the roerties of diffusion curves, netwo rk structure and changes in message content. Crawling the intranet and internet (including web ortals, team collaboration centers, blogs and wikis) to dislay web-based diffusion network struc ture and content. Conducting ethnograhic research, including intervi ews and observation of interactions among innovation team members, to validate and sulement data gathered using automated means Recent Research Findings : Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 86 The roject team is just beginning to analyze data. Our initial findings from analysis of a global in novation include: 1. Significant diffusion events in the comany are reflected in the content and structure of the emai l communication networks about the innovation. For examle, the merging of innovation teams in Euroe and the U.S. can be seen in the changes in frequency of word airs that emerge in comaring emails generated at two different oints in time. 2. There are indications of cultural differences i n reference for face-to-face and email corresonde nce among members of the innovation diffusion team. T his initial finding will be exlored further as dat a collection and analysis continue. 3. Grou betweenness centrality rovides a marker for change in grou and indicates aror iate time sans for more in-deth analysis. Challenges and Opportunities : Challenges encountered by the research team are rel ated to the comlexity and seed of change in the g lobal automotive industry. The team has faced and is ove rcoming the following major challenges to data collection and creation of the \"digital diffusion d ashboard.\" The office of the general counsel in each artner c omany has had to review and arove the research and data collection rocedures to ensure rotection of rorietary and confidential information as ell as to rotect the rivacy and ersonal rights of emlo yees. Confidential Disclosure Agreements have been develoed through collaboration of legal staffs in the comanies and at Wayne State University and University of Illinois at Chicago. Technology transfer offices at both Wayne State Uni versity and University of Illinois at Chicago also have worked with legal offices at the comanies to rotect rights to commercialization of software develoed by the research team as well as to enable use of the software in the IT environments within each cororation Data collection has been slowed by the comlexity o f the IT infrastructure and by resource constraints in each cororation with whom we are collaborating. T he research team has had to send considerable time and effort develoing workarounds and rogramm ing software to overcome the limitations. The individual who served as major sonsors of the research in each cororation have all been relaced due to cororate reorganizations, cutbacks, mergers and acquisitions. The research team has had to \"r e- sell\" the roject several times to retain the coro rate artners and maintain access to innovation diffusion data. New cororate artners are also be ing sought to sulement the original cororate collaborators who may not be ably to suly all the data necessary to achieve roject goals. The oortunities for the roject research team hav e been created by new IT technologies to enhance research on social networks and on new collaboratio ns in the research community: The research team has discovered, develoed and im lemented several new technologies to enhance data collection: 1. Condor, a dynamic social network visualizer that dislays both structure and message content in diffusion networks, develoed by Peter Gloor and co llaborators at MIT 2. Multinet/Negopy , to analyze and dislay naturally occurring grous and structural and attribute data together, develoed by Bill Richards and Andrew Sea ry at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC. Our research team has worked with the develoe rs to merge these two rograms and to modify the software to analyze large data sets and alter arameters for data dislay. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 87 3. Wordlink (develoed by Dr. Danowski) has been enhanced to handle large data sets. The team is using this software to analyze message content and test differences in content at various oints in time. The research team has become art of a collaboratio n innovation network (COIN), involving researchers in several locations around the world who are all s tudying innovation in social networks globally and share ideas, tools, research results and challenges in a monthly online meeting. Our research team is incororating learning from this network into the roject as well as sharing results of our own work w ith other researchers New oortunities for research collaboration have o ened u at other cororations such as Visteon and EDS that the team is ursuing for data collection. The research team has also been asked to articiat e in the NIH Clinical and Translational S A at Wayn e State University, which is an oortunity to extend the new research methodologies and further test diffusion hyotheses in the health care domain.

Goldstein, Case Western Reserve Univers ity Co-PI: Geoff Childs, Washington University in Saint Louis Research Goal: This roject is investigating how raid change and develoment in the Third World imacts intergenerational relations and the suort network s of the elderly in rural settings. In articular, the roject is examining how rural Tibetans and their f amilies at three different stages of develoment ar e adating to raid socio-economic change. Thematic Areas: 1. comlexities of change 2. dynamics of human social and social behavior 3. managing raid change Methodologies: The roject is using a mix of methods including sur veys, direct measurement (e.g., blood ressure), articiant observation, in-deth interviews and a rticiant observation. It is also utilizing a natur al exerimental research design that has selected thre e rural farming villages in the Tibetan Autonomous Region in China that differ with resect to the ext ent of economic develoment they have exerienced b ut otherwise share the same language, culture, religio n and social organization. This design is allowing us to examine the issues at question at an inciient stag e of develomental change, an intermediate stage, a nd a later stage. Recent Research Findings: The study has found that a major aradigm shift has occurred with rural farmers moving from a redominately farming society to a system in which non-farm income lays a major role. In all three research sites, between 60-70% of all village males age 20-40 go out to earn income and about 70% of t otal village income now derives from non-farm sources. A decade ago such income comrised only about 25%. However, while all three farming sites are de ely engaged in non-farm work, the extent and succe ss of the changes differs substantially. For examle, the er caita income in the richest village is alm ost 3 times that of the oorest. These changes have had (and are still having) a sig nificant imact on household strategies and in art icular on intergeneration relations. Based on reliminary analysis of the data, it aears as if the well-bei ng of the elderly in the richer, more develoed, village, is better than that in the middle-level village, which in turn exceeds that of the oorest research site. In other words, rather than modernization decreasing the st atus of the elderly as is commonly stated in the literature , we are finding that it has increased it in comle x ways. More data will be collected on this issue during th e fieldwork that will take lace in Tibet in YR 03.

Contribute to understanding two basic mechanism s of Dynamic Decision Making: Hyothesis Generation and Feedback. 2. Investigate Learning in Dynamic Decision Making : What makes learning difficult? How to imrove learning? 3. How are hyotheses generated while cues of a si tuation evolve over time? And how feedback changes human learning. 4. To develo realistic medical content for a case resentation diagnosis and management domain, for the simulation tool, MEDIC rogram. Thematic Areas: 1. Performance of dynamic decision making tasks. T he context used in this research is medical diagnos is. 2. Hyothesis Generation and Testing 3. Instance-Based Learning. Learning to manage at ients with diseases modeled as dynamic medical systems (in which one can both request information and erform actions which affect the state of the system, and in which the state of the system can c hange sontaneously reflecting intrinsic disease rocesses) - descritive models, identification of normative shortcomings, learning. Methodologies: We conduct this investigation using two main aroa ches: 1) laboratory studies with the suort of comuter simulations and learning tools and 2) com utational cognitive modeling using two architecture s reviously develoed by our team: HyGene (Thomas an d Dougherty, 2005) and cogIBLT based on ACT-R (Gonzalez, Lerch, Lebiere, 2003). Recent Research Findings: Humans have great difficulty understanding and inte rreting the basic building blocks of dynamic systems (stocks, flows, feedback loos). We have fo und that large majorities of highly educated indivi duals are unable to redict and interret the behavior of a stock due to the rate of change of flows, a hen omenon we denote stock-flow failure . Individuals have shown difficulty of learning in a dynamic medical diagnosis task (MEDIC). Outcome feedback is only helful with ambiguous robabiliti es and outcome feedback becomes counter-roductive when it is not needed in unambiguous environments. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 90 We argue there is a natural tendency for decision m akers to search for information contingent on their currently held hyotheses - a rocess we refer to a s hypothesis-guided search . If only one hyothesis is maintained in WM, then hyothesis guided search nec essarily follows a ositive-testing strategy. Howev er, if more than one hyothesis is being maintained in WM, then the decision maker can search for informat ion that differentiates amongst the hyotheses under co nsideration. We argue that cuing alternative hyoth eses so that they are maintained alongside the focal hy othesis in WM enables decision makers to select diagnostic information. Two emirical studies cond ucted this year suort the rincile of hyothesis - guided search. Tutorials can increase student erformance (from r e test to ost test, using case diagnosis test questions) by focusing attention to a diagnosis's rototye and/or to the features that distinguish be tween cometing diagnoses. These increases are comarable , and larger than the effect of reading textbook extracts alone. Challenges and Opportunities: Getting research articiants who have sufficient m edical training resents a challenge. Medical schoo l laces great demands on student time.

Investigate the origins of sociality. 2. Create new methodologies that combines behavior al observational data with GIS data 3. Develo comuter simulations (agent-based model s) of grou formation in children Thematic Areas: 1. Sociality 2. Comutational Social Science 3. GIS Methodologies: We are collecting observational data of young child ren in a reschool setting. These data consist of individual and eer behaviors. Collection is occur ring using handheld Tablet PCs; this allows us to m a the reschool, thus roviding a mechanism for recor ding time-stamed geo-satial information. Recent Research Findings: Our first year ilot (based on about 15,000 coded o bservations) showed that we were successful at reli ably acquiring individual and grou behavior as it chang es over a school year. We also develoed a GUI interface for the Tablet PCs. This GUI contains ma s of the reschool area, thus allowing coders to i nsert a time-stamed geo-satial reference with each obse rved behavior. We also orted the author written agent-based based model of lay grou formation (Pl ayMate) to a standard ABM latform (Reast). Challenges and Opportunities: The major behavior observation roblems have been r esolved, however other two substantial hurdles remain. First, the large amount of data being acqu ired is forcing us to send a lot of time develoin g database tools. Second, we are being forced to dev elo joint behavior and time-sace theoretical mode ls. Integrating geo-satial information with behavior i s not difficult - but utting it into an agent base d model is requiring us to ostulate the ossible links bet ween individual grou characteristics, lay roens ities, lay location, and timing.

Early Career Research Oortunities Methodologies: This roject builds on a symosium series that bega n in Shanghai and has created a growing set of international collaborations in the area of distrib uted learning and collaboration. Symosia are task oriented and roduce action lans so that most of t he work of the roject occurs outside of the actual symosium meeting sace. Additionally, the roject relies on the use of a small number of minigrants to early career Recent Research Findings: Collaborations that have arisen to date affected a major initiative in e-learning in Mexico; joint a ers and research in the area of modeling and interactive di gital media, in Singaore and in Uganda, new resear ch rojects in tutorial dialog systems. The series ha s attracted co-funding from other US and overseas organizations, and the articular symosium in this HSD grant also benefits from a grant by the Austra lian Research Council and ending grants from Germany's scientific research funding agency (DFG). Challenges and Opportunities The roject is redicated on the conjecture that in ternational collaborations in the area of learning technologies and future learning environments can s timulate rogress that is not readily ossible when Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 93 conducted on a national level only. There have bee n numerous examles of this henomenon of mutual benefit. These examles have the romise to contri bute materially not only to research advances but t o future high erformance learning environments that rovide more meaningful, customized, enjoyable and rigorous exeriences to students. One challenge in research community develoment is to find arori ate blends of time and funding devoted to such collabor ations. This is a challenge for researchers more generally. In the context of this grant, another s ignificant challenge is to treat the evolving resea rch community as a virtual organization and to determin e ways it can be most roductive to its members. What are the common research themes that draw arti ciants? In what ways can the community leverage its organizational strength in the service of the b roader research issues that are of interest interna tionally? How can the community define oortunities that all ow researchers easy entry onto and exit from formal network collaborations and thus be an agile force? Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 94 Project Title: The Dynamics of Decetion in Comuter Mediated En vironments Proposal #: 0624267 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics of Human Behavior Lead PI: Jeff Hancock, Cornell University Co-PIs: Claire Cardie, Cornell University and Mats Rooth , Cornell University Research Goals: 1. The first research goal is to understand how co muter-mediated environments affect the roduction and ractices of decetion. Research questions addresse d under this goal include 1), Do eole lie most frequently face-to-face, on the telehone, or by em ail? 2) Do eole use different media to lie for di fferent reasons, about different tyes of things, to differ ent tyes of eole? How do social and technologica l factors constrain and shae the roerties of lies told online? 2. The second research goal is concerned with dece tion detection in comuter-mediated environments A re humans worse at detecting a lie in a comuter-media ted environments that remove nonverbal cues than we are in more cue-rich face-to-face environments? Rec ent research suggests that most nonverbal cues are not reliable for human detectors. If this is the case, is there any cost at all in losing these cues? Or, is it ossible that the reduced trust observed in text-based inter actions lead reductions in the truth-bias, in which eole tend to believe that their artner is telling the t ruth? If the truth-bias is reduced in comuter-medi ated environments, does this lead to a aradoxical imro vement in decetion detection? 3. The third research goal seeks to emloy advance d comutational and natural language rocessing (NL P) techniques to analyze and identify decetive and tr uthful messages. We have begun to determine how NLP techniques can be used to enhance our understanding the language of decetion. If this is ossible, th e ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to develo s ystems that can assist in real-time decetion detec tion in mediated communication, including email, instant me ssaging, chat rooms, and blogs. To this end, we are develoing the Decetive Message Corus, a large-sc ale, ublicly Thematic Areas: Our rimary thematic area is the dynamics of human behavior . In articular, this roject focuses on the dynamical nature of decetion within the context of comuter-mediated environments. Methodologies: The research roject involves four methods, three o f which are rooted in the social sciences, while th e fourth is rooted in comutational linguistics. The first is a diary method adated from DePaulo et al (1996) and Hancock et al (2004). In this method, articia nts are asked to record in a PDA all of their socia l interactions and lies for seven days. For each inte raction, the PDA requests information about the ty e of decetion, whether the decetion was self or other oriented, and the nature of the relationshi with t he decetion target. The second method is a cross-validation technique. In this rocedure, articiants that engage in onli ne dating are asked to come into the lab. Before they come to the lab we download their online dating ro file. Once they arrive in the lab, we measure several as ects of their self-resentation, including their he ight, Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 95 weight, age, and income (among others). The informa tion from the laboratory measurements are comared against the information resented in their online rofile, which allow for discreancy calculations. The third method is standard exerimental rocedure , in which articiants come to the lab and are randomly assigned to medium condition (text-based o r face-to-face), susicion condition (susicious vs . not susicious) and to role (liar vs. artner). The fourth method involves comutational linguistic s and corus develoment. In this method, language roduced in the roject are entered into a corus i n which they are identified as decetive or not dec etive. The corus is then analyzed using NLP an comutatio nal linguistic techniques to examine whether decetive messages differ from non-decetive messag es. Recent Research Findings: We have data from two comleted studies. The first examined how frequently decetion took lace across different media. Seventy-six articiants were aske d to record all of their social interactions and li es for seven days. The results revealed that eole lied a roximately 1.6 times a day (26% of interactions). Lies were most frequently observed in telehone conversa tions (37.7%), while the least lies were observed i n email (16.2%) and instant messaging (18.3%); face-t o-face had a moderate amount of decetion (22.3%). Technology also aeared to affect the content of d ecetion. Lies about actions were most likely to oc cur on the telehone, while lies that rovided an exla nation were most likely to occur in email. Lies abo ut one's feelings were least likely to occur in email. The second study examined self-resentation in onli ne dating rofiles using a novel cross-validation technique for establishing accuracy. Eighty online daters first rated the accuracy of their online sel f- resentation. Particiants' hysical attributes wer e then measured (height, weight and age). A comari son of their online self-resentation and observed attr ibutes revealed that deviations tended to be ubiqui tous but small in magnitude. Men lied more about their heigh t, while women lied more about their weight, with articiants farther from the mean lying more. Part iciants' self-ratings of accuracy were significant ly correlated with observed accuracy, suggesting that inaccuracies were intentional rather than self-dece tive. Overall, articiants reorted being the least accu rate about their hotograhs and the most accurate about their relationshi information. Decetion atterns suggest that when lying, articiants strategically balanced the decetive oortunities resented by o nline self-resentation (e.g., the editability of rofiles) with the social constraints of establishing romanti c relationshis (e.g., the anticiation of future i nteraction). Challenges and Opportunities: The largest challenge to date has been develoing t he Decetive Message Corus. One challenge here involves the nature of comuter-mediated communicat ion, which tends to not be very grammatically well- formed. As such, current arsers and taggers have s ome difficulty dealing with some of language. We ha ve just recently develoed a relatively robust re-ro cessor that cleans the texts in a way that ermits more efficient tagging and arsing. A second challenge i s that other researchers have been reluctant to sha re their own data. We hoe to address this question at the H SD meeting and seek advice.

To obtain and use feedback from elders, family caregivers of elders, and rofessionals who serve e lders about the otential benefits and challenges of som e comuter-based assistive technologies for elders; 2. To enable such feedback to affect the design of a reconfigurable exerimental system, or \"Sandbox system\", based on existing comonent technologies; 3. To understand the influence of recursive feedba ck from exloratory focus grous, imlementation of an integrated system of technologies in a senior cent er, and interdiscilinary collaboration between comuter scientists and behavioral scientists on t he design of technologies; 4. To assess the exerience of elders with these t echnologies and their otential to contribute to en hanced functioning in elders; 5. To reare current and future ractitioners in comuter science and social work for collaborative research efforts which are based on an areciatio n of elders' ersectives and riorities, and which integrate an understanding of human behavior with an understanding of various alications of assistive technology. Thematic Areas: 1. Use by comuter-based assistive techn ology; 2. Adatation and reconfiguration of technologies that would make them more functional for use by elders; 3. Learning and training issues affecting elders' cometence with these technologies; 4. Percetions of caacity of technologies for enh ancing quality of life, increasing sense of mastery and control, and rolonging ability to remain living a t home; 5. Exectations of variations in utility for elder s with different cognitive and hysical caacities and imairments; 6. Cross-discilinary collaboration and integratio n of ersectives from behavioral and comuter sciences; 7. Issues in education for cross-discilinary rese arch and ractice. Methodologies: Behavioral science: Design of research methods has been influenced by an Advisory Grou of elder citizens committed to the roject in collaboration with the Research Team. The first hase of research has used focus grou methodology, a semi-structured int erview design, audio recording of interviews and verbatim transcrition of data, interview notes fro m comuter science research team members, qualitati ve Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 97 data analysis with three levels of thematic coding by three members of the research team, and indeend ent review of data by four other members of the team. T he second hase of research involves imlementation of designated \"Sandbox\" technologies, now named ASS IST, into a senior center with elder subjects. A mi x of quantitative and qualitative measures will be em loyed. Comuter science: The comuter science team rovi suorting field tests designed to rovide emirical data that can be used as dynamic feedback to the behavioral science team. This develoment cycle links technolo gical innovation with rinciled methods for testin g and evaluating the technology, which in turn drives further develoment. The comuter science team has develoed: 1. a distributed sensor network infrastructure embedde d in a small smart sace for research, develoment and testing; 2. the ASSIST user system according to interface reco mmendations for elderly users. The system is comosed of the five alications described below, an oerating interface for the system, as well an email system, an internet ortal, and access to gam es for the elderly; 3. five technology demonstrations as art of ASSIST, including: a. a daily event lanning calendar that reminds users of imortant events, such as aointments and medication times; b. an address book containing information about friend s, relatives and caregivers; c. an easy to use videohone alication for face-to-f ace communication with family and friends; d. a fall detection system based on a distributed sens or network within the home; e. a system for finding secific \"lost\" objects such a s keys, cell hones, coffee cus, and remote controls. The ASSIST system will now be imlemented in the Am herst Senior Center. Recent Research Findings: Focus grou findings: Elders, family caregivers, an d rofessionals who serve elders reorted that the y erceive great otential for comuterized, assistiv e technology and the articular alications being develoed by the Comuter Science team to emower e lders and contribute to their well-being. At the same time, their enthusiasm is temered by some sig nificant ambivalence about the increasing imortanc e of technology in every area of their lives. Though focus grou articiants are for the most art eage r to see the technologies that were resented become availab le to them, they would like to see their concerns recognized and considered in choices about design a nd alication of technology. The ositive resonses to technologies, in descendi ng order of significance, included: 1. Potential for imroved family and other long distan ce relationshis through enriched (video) communication; 2. Potential uses in health care through increased mon itoring of health status and communication with health care roviders through video communication; 3. Enhanced management of multile tasks, access to in formation, and oortunities for leisure; 4. Increased communication about falls and other threa ts to safety; 5. Increased sense of cometence and ower when techni cal skills are mastered; 6. Reduced caregivers' burdens, enabling alternative m eans of monitoring safety. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 98 The concerns about the technologies, in descending order of significance, included: 1. Comromised rivacy; 2. Potential for augmenting negative family and other long distance interactions with increased visual information; 3. Comromised quality of health care, substituting r eferred \"face to face\" interactions with health care roviders with communication \"through machines \"; \"high tech over high touch\"; 4. Potential for increasing social divisions, between those who are comuter literate, have access to high seed communication caacity, and can afford t o kee ugrading technical caability, and those who cannot; exerience of shame, of being \"le ft behind\" without this caacity. Suggestions to influence design and imlementation of technologies for elders: 1. Attend to sensory needs of elders, including reduce d visual and auditory abilities and adat interface technology to a range of caacities; 2. Comare the roosed technologies to those already available and imlement easiest to use and most cost effective; 3. Consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of RFID and comuter-based technologies at different stages of elders' life cycle and with dif ferent degrees of imairment; 4. Recognize the tensions between rivacy and safety a nd develo balanced solutions for a range of roblems; 5. Attend to the learning styles of elders in training and need for relationally based, ongoing suort t o acquire and maintain these skills; 6. Increase social networking, by elders for elders, a nd cross-generationally, around these technologies; 7. Make these technologies available as quickly as os sible!

Harrison, University of Central Florida Co-PIs: Steven Fiore, Charles Hughes, Eduardo Salas Senior Weishamel IDV Cororation Research Goals: 1.

Secifically, does VR visualiz ation lead to a convergence of the decisions made between exerts and non-exerts? 2. Assess the exerience of users as they interact wit h the virtual environment (i.e., resence), and how that may attenuate the decision making rocesses 3. Investigate the use of virtual environments as an e ffective tool to serve both laboratory and field-ce ntric scientists. Secifically, does VR rovide a settin g that includes naturalistic cues of field studies and retains the controls innate to laboratory exerime nts? Thematic Areas: 1. Naturalistic decision making 2. Visualization of forest fires 3. Percetions of resence Methodologies: 1. We conducted ilot exeriments to demonstrate the f easibility of Virtual Exeriments, as alied to th e choice of whether or not to ay for a rescribed bu rn to rotect roerty from wildfire damage. The ke y issue was whether this environment assisted artici ants in identifying the true, underlying robabili ties that they roerty would be damaged. After controll ing for the risk attitudes of subjects, we see some tendency for decisions to move towards those redic ted with true beliefs, although we stress that thes e are ilot exeriments with a small samle. This tendenc y suggests that the VR exerience did have some eff ect on shifting beliefs towards the true risks that the roerty would burn. We also find that those subje cts who had some rior exerience with video games had the least roblems with the VR environment, as exected . A reliminary of this aears et al., 2007] 2. We develo the concet of virtual exeriments, comb ining insights from virtual reality in comuter science, naturalistic decision-making from sycholo gy, and field exeriments from economics. The methodological objective of virtual exeriments is to bridge the ga between the artefactual controls of laboratory exeriments and the naturalistic domain of field exeriments or direct field studies. The l ab environment enhances internal validity when used co rrectly, but often suffers from external validity because the task and resentation are not the same as subjects encounter in their natural environment. But running exeriments in natural environments, while maximizing external validity, runs the risk of incl uding otential confounds that cannot be controlled by th e investigator. Our virtual exeriments should allo w a Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 100 continuum of tasks and environments that sans thes e two extremes and ermits the effect of naturalist ic settings to be systematically studied. This should rovide tools for olicy analysis that combine the inferential ents with the natural \"look and feel\" of a field do main. 3. We develoed the visualization using FARSITE to sim ulate the rogression of the fire based on moisture, fuel load, tree and brush density, tree a nd brush tyes, crown height, etc,. The outut from FARSITE is then inut to our visualization rogram that rovides an interface through which artician ts can fly over and into the chosen forest, before, du ring and after a burn. The rendering is done in the context of SeedTree, a commercial roduct for rendering tr ees. We have extended the SeedTree renderer to add integration with FARSITE data and the visual effect s of fire and smoke. 4. In order to conduct reliminary assessment of the u ser exerience within the virtual environment we collected subjective data on ercetions of presence . Survey questions were administered to artician ts to evaluate their subjective sense of Involvement, Ada tation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Recent Research Findings: 1. Irradiance caching offers a simle, straightforward method for increasing rendering efficiency without adding significant algorithmic comlexity or an add itional rendering ass. A current limitation of irr adiance caching is that it has yet to be extended to render ing articiating media (smoke, fire, fog, mist, et c.) In contrast, ath tracing offers a more comlete solut ion to the rendering roblem, including articiati ng media, but lacks comutational efficiency. We have develoed a caching technique within a ath tracing framework that combines the erformance of caching with the generality of ath tracing, resulting in a renderer that efficiently suorts articiating me dia. [Johnson et al., 2. Grahics resentations of smoke and sarks are comm only handled by rocesses called article systems. Particle systems use some fixed number of articles er frame, where article information is samled from emitters reresented by locations, and a range of otential initial article arameters, such as origin, size, etc. For some comlicated effects, es ecially where there are many otential emitters, w here the location of the emitter is not well-defined, or when article origins or other arameters cannot b e easily defined by an analytic boundary, the roblem of gen erating new article samles becomes difficult. One concrete examle of such a scenario comes in the fo rm of a large-scale detailed forest fire simulation , where each leaf (or ortion of leaf) that is burnin g is an emitter of flame articles, and there are otentially thousands of leaves visible at any given time. We roose a method for using visible ixels as otenti al article emitters and erforming samling in image- sace. This allows for a simultaneous samling of a ll article emitters. Using only on-screen ixels as e mitters is sufficient if one assumes that the simul ation of off-screen articles is unnecessary. This is reason able if the rimary urose of the article effect is visual. Our method is simle, works well with normal artic le systems, and creates otentially new ways of generating article effects, such as emitting arti cles based on image or animation data. [Konttinen, Pattanaik & Hughes, 2007] 3. We have develoed scene and level of detail managem ent (LOD) techniques for achieving interactive frame rates for a forest walk-through. The framewo rk selects the LOD based on object visibility, in addition to rojected size. Moreover, visibility is calculated at run-time so we can suort dynamic s cene modification, such as interactively altered trees d ue to wind, exlosions or fire. We also introduce an inertial level of detail model to minimize oing artifacts - rather than instantly switching the LOD s, discrete LODs are smoothly blended over a number of frames.

Comuter-mediated communication and its effects on society 2. Psychology of relationshi formation and erson ality 3. Comutational Linguistics Methodologies: Method 1: Large-scale survey administration to members of a large online ersonals website. The intention is to cature relationshi formation at its early s tages by tracking communicating dyads before they m eet in erson, through their face-to-face meeting, and on to the establishment of a relationshi. Our goal i s to have access to their ercetions of each other thro ughout the crucial but ambiguous rocess of relatio nshi formation. By taking an initial samle in the hund reds of thousands, we should be assured of a large set of articiants who rogress to a full-fledged relatio nshi. The roosed work is an interdiscilinary combinati on of methods from the fields of social sychology, human-comuter interaction, and quantitative sociol ogy. We use questionnaire techniques from ersonal ity studies, the results of which we lan to analyze wi th statistical methods and comutational linguistic s analysis. This will be followed by a new round of questionnaires and analysis to determine the effect s of the intervention as well as a longitudinal analysis of relationshi retention. Method 2 : Small-scale controlled exeriments. Recent Research Findings: Before users of online ersonals communicate or mee t, they view one another's rofiles. In order to b etter understand the role these rofiles lay in the init iation of contact, we conducted a controlled exeri ment in which we asked 65 articiants to rate different a rts of 50 randomly samled existing online rofiles . Particiants variously saw just the hotograh, jus t the free text ortion, just the fixed-answer or tion, or Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 103 the entire rofile, and they rated them using 5-oi nt Likert scales along 8 dimensions (attractive, genuine/trustworthy, masculine, feminine, warm, sel f-esteem, extroverted, self-centered). Among other findings, we were able to show that cer tain ortions of the rofiles redicted attractiven ess ratings of the entire rofile. Not surrisingly, w e found that the attractiveness of the hotograh redicted whole-rofile attractiveness. Less redictably, we also found that the free text resonse was also a strong redictor of whole rofile attractiveness. Furtherm ore, even when the hotograh is rated attractive, if the other two comonents are unattractive, the entire rofile will be seen as unattractive. When examinin g the relationshi between the other dimensions and the a ttractiveness dimension, we found that for female rofiles, the only redictor of overall attractiven ess was the \"extraverted\" dimension. Males also ra ted female rofiles as marginally more attractive when they were less masculine. For the male rofiles, t he only significant redictor of overall attractivenes s was \"masculine\". For the female rofiles, the wh ole rofiles were seen as more attractive to the degree that the female hotograhs were rated as having h igher \"self-esteem\" and were seen as relatively more \"fem inine\" (both with only marginal significance). Re sults were also analyzed (comaring dimensions other than attractiveness) assigned to the hotograhs to who le rofiles dimensions. Male rofiles were seen as sig nificantly more attractive overall when the hotogr ahs were rated as being more \"genuine/trustworthy\" and only if the hotograhs were also rated relatively less \"warm/kind\" (note that the correlations between \"wa rm/kind\" and \"feminine\" were high for the male hotograhs). Female rofiles' hotograhs were ra ted as significantly more attractive when they were seen as relatively less masculine, and marginally m ore attractive when they were more feminine. Male hotograhs were rated as significantly more attrac tive when they were rated as \"extraverted,\" \"genuin e /trustworthy,\" and less attractive when the hotos were seen as \"warm/kind.\" Interestingly, there was a positive relationshi between \"feminine\" and attractiveness for the male hotograhs. In the free text ratings for the male rofiles, there were significa nt ositive relationshis between attractiveness \"extraversion,\" \"genuineness /trustworthyness,\" and \"femininity\". These results arallel what was see n for male hotograhs. We intend to investigate furthe r the differences between whole-rofile resonse ra tings and these individual ieces' ratings. Challenges and Opportunities: Unfortunately, the commercial artner for this rese arch has been exeriencing difficulties in rovided access us with to the user ool. Working with eo le at the comany, we have develoed survey softwar e that resides on a machine within their remises. T his software has been in lace for at least 1.5 yea rs (since the time we submitted the grant roosal), but we h ave not received the go-ahead to start running the study. Reresentatives from the comany continue to reassu re us that they want to run the studies with us, an d that they continue to work through their internal roadbl ocks. We remain otimistic that the data will be gathered, but we also have reason to worry that the re will be no end to the roadblocks, and we are considering other alternatives.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 104 Project Title: Facilitating Change in Higher Education: A Multidi scilinary Effort to Bridge the Individual Actor and System Persectives Proposal #: 0623009 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead PI: Charles Henderson, Western Michigan University Co-PIs: Andrea Beach, Western Michigan University Noah Finkelstein, University of Colorado at Bould er R.

Research Goals: Our goal is to investigate the factors contributing to the organizational effectiveness-or relative ineffectiveness-of transnational non-governmental o rganizations (TANGOs). Secifically, we aim to: ( 1) better understand their organizational structures, communication and coordination strategies, and how governance and leadershi choices influence their e ffectiveness as agents of change; (2) create indica tors and baseline data for scholars and the NGO communit y; and (3) develo materials for training graduate and doctoral students as well as rofessional develome nt courses for TANGO leaders. Thematic Areas: We are focusing on TANGOs in four sectors: (1) envi ronment; (2) human rights; (3) conflict resolution; and (4) develoment (sub-divided as humanitarian re lief and sustainable develoment). The roject is develoing indicators to exlain the evolution of T ANGOs, their funding strategies, their networks and artnershis, how they erceive issues of transare ncy and accountability, how they evaluate their own imact, and the challenges and oortunities of wor king with governments and the rivate sector. Methodologies: The roject is a large-scale, systematic, elite int erview study of the senior leadershi of transnatio nal NGOs. A reresentative samle of 180 TANGOs registe red in the US and classified according to their fiscal effectiveness, caacity, size, and the secto r in which they oerate, was drawn randomly from th e Charity Navigator database. In order to accommodate the geograhically distributed nature of the roje ct team, a web-based collaboratory environment was cre ated to suort the data collection, analysis, and roject administration. Primary data come from 2-3 hour interviews conducte d with senior leadershi of the samle. A structure d interview rotocol was develoed and ilot tested o n senior TANGO leaders associated with the Moynihan Institute's Transnational NGO Initiative. Doctoral students in the Maxwell School and School of Information Studies were trained by the PIs on the interview rotocol and in the use of the collaborat ory for remote data storage and virtual meetings. Researche rs conducted digitally recorded interviews in the f ield, and uloaded the files into the collaboratory. Thes e interviews were downloaded, transcribed and then Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 106 loaded into a comuter-assisted qualitative data an alysis software (CAQDAS) alication called Atlas.t i. Our codebook has 412 codes, which allows us to code and analyze the data qualitatively, and exort the dataset for quantitative analysis in SPSS. Status: We have comleted 110 out of 180 interviews. Forty- three interviews have now been coded and forty serv e as the base for the findings resented here (as of Setember 2007). The distribution of the samle is as follows: environment (n=8), human rights (n=6), hum relief (n=4), sustainable develoment (n=19), and conflict resolution (n=3). A cross tab ulation of sector and organizational efficiency is as follows: Efficiency Sector High Low Environment 5 3 Human rights 4 2 Humanitarian relief 4 0 Sustainable develoment 14 5 Conflict resolution 1 2 Preliminary Research Findings: An analysis of the reliminary data reveals that, n ot surrisingly, those organizations with budgets i n the billions of dollars were the most effective and gen erally these organizations were engaged in humanita rian relief or sustainable develoment activities on the ground. Those TANGOs focused on conflict resoluti on and human rights were the least fiscally effective and maintained the smallest reserve caacity for fu ture oerations. Humanitarian relief NGOs find themselve s having to engage in both advocacy and service more often than transnational NGOs from other sectors. Indeed, environmental, human rights, and conflict resolution NGOs are engaged in advocacy over 60% of the time while those working on sustainable develoment are rimarily engaged in the delivery o f services (68% of the time). Interestingly, transnational NGOs with articular agendas tend to co-locate their headquarters in articular arts of the United States (e.g., environmental NGOs on the West Coast, and conflict resolution and human rights in NYC and DC. Challenges and Opportunities: Interdisciplinary and Logistical Our discilines range from olitical science and u blic administration to sychology and information sciences. We have worked to integrate our various ersectives, and through weekly meetings our team h as designed the roject, its instruments, and coordina ted our work. The administrative and research team was geograhically distributed, with researchers conduc ting interviews around the country and abroad. Our collaboratory infrastructure heled us to overcome these challenges, by creating oortunities for the team to access roject documents from any location with Internet access. We used webconferencing to hold regular administrative and research meetings with t he team. Another challenge has been scheduling interviews with busy CEOs. However, once we begin a n interview with a CEO, he or she generally becomes intrigued and gives us much more time than requested. Moreover, they generally ask to remain involved with the study and to articiate in our rofessional engagement activities. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 107 Methodological and Analytical: Integrating Qualitat ive and Quantitative Approaches Atlas.ti was designed rimarily for qualitative res earch, but we have adated its caabilities to gene rate more quantitative outut. As a result, we are now s imultaneously roducing two datasets, one qualitati ve and one quantitative. The qualitative method allows for the recording of several, ossibly even contradictory statements on a given variable. While this can be valuable for a qualitative researcher, it would undermine the quantitative data set. To addre ss this, we develoed a rocess of forcing the code rs to select one single value from the qualitative codes. While this rocedure somewhat limits the richness of qualitative analysis, it allows us to use the data across multile methodological traditions.

Determine hazard, communication, organizational, an d demograhic features that may imact material convergence and suly needs 3. Provide robust estimates of the dynamic resource re quirements (immediate and short term) following an extreme event (e.g., the amount of blood and water that is needed), i.e., what is needed . 4. Estimate the amount of critical resources available on site / in adjacent areas, i.e., what is availab le . 5. Estimate otimal re-ositioning strategy (in the case of anticiated extreme events). 6.

Estimation of immediate resource requirements The research team conducted an emirical estimation of immediate resource requirement needs after a disaster. This was done by means of statistical ana lyses of the requests made by the State of Louisian a to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) usin g the Action Request Forms (ARFs). The analyses rovide insight into the resource requirem ents after a disaster, their temoral evolution, an d the key tyes of commodities requested, as well as thei r relative imortance. Autoregressive integrated mo ving average (ARIMA) models were estimated for the reque sts of key commodities (i.e. electrical equiment, transortation equiment and machinery, water and i ce, medical sulies, food). It was found that, alt hough qualitatively, the temoral atterns of requests se em similar (a eak of requests during the first wee k and then raidly declining over the following weeks), t he different commodity grous follow structurally different ARIMA rocesses. Taken together this info rmation rovides crucial information for emergency lanning as it will hel emergency agencies to deve lo aroriate contingency lans. 2. Operational planning for handling resources In order to develo otimal re-ositioning and inv entory management strategies for critical sulies the research team introduces a cost minimization multi- commodity, multile sulier, two echelon, multi- eriod stochastic inventory model for disaster lan ning of fixed lifetime commodities. Initial results show the effect of considering lifetime of goods when se lecting inventory managing strategies, as they will affect re-ositioned and safety stock levels. It was foun d that shiment size and frequency are key lanning factors that lay an imortant role in the continuo us rovision of critical sulies during an extreme event. 3. Factors in convergence management The research team conducted a qualitative analysis of in-deth interviews with key actors involved wit h the Katrina disaster resonse. Community/organizational social caacity/vulnerability, assets and suly network visibility, and communication social and te chnical systems were among the factors than can im act suly chain rocesses. Findings oint to the need to account for secific caacities/vulnerabilities in model develoment. Moreover, models should incororate th e generation of dynamic organizational network outut to better familiarize those in the emergent multi-organizational network. Technologies would st ill deend on timely inut into the system, successful communication of information, continuity of infrastructure that suorts these technologies, an d user-friendly aroaches. Pre-disaster and real-t ime identification of bridge organizations may rove us eful to emergency resonders immersed in a catastrohic resonse. 4. Catastrophic events The research team identified ways in which the cata strohic disaster events resent unique challenges to emergency suly chain rocesses, setting the conte xt for organizational and systemic arrangements distinct from disaster events. Findings oint to th e need to consider the otential differences that m ay lay out in emergency, disaster, and catastrohe events. Challenges and Opportunities: There are a number of challenges that deserve seci fic mention: Data acquisition : Obtaining the data about immediate resource requi rements (IRR) has required numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, and a consider able amount of human resources to transfer aer records into electronic formats. In site of this c hallenge, the team has been able to collect the dat a, and conduct one of the first comrehensive studies of t he dynamic IRRs. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 110 Analytical complexity : This roject seeks to integrate social science st ate of the art thinking into analytical formulations that account for material convergence and emergency logistics. This is in itself a challe nging roosition because of the huge comlexity of the s ubject matter. In site of the acknowledged constraints and challe nges, the team has already roduced imortant contributions. First, it has been roven that it is indeed ossible to estimate analytical models to rovide estimates of IRRs. Although these models have been estimated with data from Katrina only, the exerien ce suggests that it may be indeed ossible to estimate more general models, once the data are available. Second, the effective integration of material conve rgence and emergency logistics offers the otential of significantly imroving the efficiency of the logis tical resonse, and to close the ga between resour ce requirements and suly.

Methodologies: Data have been collected using a mix of quantitativ e and qualitative methods. For the quantitative comonent, data collection is subdivided into two m ain hases of bulk data acquisition (hase I and h ase II). Phase I collected data on the intention format ion (motivators and factors that mediate the relati onshi with intentions) asects of the model. Phase II dat a collection in Setember-October 2007 will examine the relationshi between intentions and rearedness (i ncluding assessment of the role of roosed moderators). We collected the survey data from adul t residents of 6 U.S. communities, Coronado, California, Kauai County, Hawaii; Seaside, Oregon, Ocean Shores, Washington, New Hanover County, North Carolina, and Kodiak, Alaska. There are a to tal of 2800 articiants in the study. Recent Research Findings: Phase 1 has revealed considerable diversity amongst the 6 communities, suggesting that there is no uni que single aroach that could be alied at this stage to all of the communities. For examle, Kodiak, Oc ean Shores, Seaside and Kauai have acceted that tsunam is will occur in their communities and understand t he downstream risk and imact on their community. Cor onado and New Hanover, on the other hand, have yet to be convinced of any secific danger and feel tha t the risk has been exaggerated and does not imact their community. In Coronado and New Hanover, eole are uncertain as to whether a warning system exists and also do not know what action they should take d uring a tsunami evacuation. In contrast, there is g ood knowledge of warning systems in Kodiak, Ocean Shore s and Seaside. Challenges and Opportunities : Researchers in this study are sread over three cou ntries, 7 institutions and 8 time zones. There are also significant contrasts in exectations and culture w hich both enrich and comlicate. We have also encountered roblems of literacy challenges in some communities that we ideally would have hoed to survey.

These challenges have also been oortunities. The oortunity to wo rk with middle school rincials, staff and students h as been enlightening and enriching. We have develo ed Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 114 good relationshis with a number of schools geogra hically distributed throughout lower Michigan.

It focuses on several im ortant nations -- Egyt, Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, and Turkey -- during the 1990s, a articularly contentious decade. These locations make it ossib le to examine the rocess of transformational chang e and the imlications of cultural variation for conf lict. Research goals of the roject include: (1) the dev eloment of research models that include dynamic an d interactive rocesses in socioolitical systems aff ected by extensive and often violent dissent and reression; (2) the creation of a database that int egrates data from both qualitative and quantitative sources; (3) interdiscilinary and international artnershi s involving senior and junior faculty; (4) rofessi onal training of and collaborative work with graduate an d undergraduate students; (5) demonstration of the ower of interdiscilinary, multi-method social sci ence research. Using multile research methods to study the dissen t/reression nexus in the Middle East (event analys is, field research, and social surveys), this research goes beyond most revious research which utilized a single nation and/or a single methodology. It also conside rs more concetual refinements of dissent and reression, a theoretical lack in existing research . Finally, it takes seriously the social, olitica l and cultural contexts surrounding contentious activities in each nation, features which are often overlooked. Re search questions include: How do dissent and reression influence one another and over what time eriod - e.g., quarterly, annually? What kinds of reression roduce what kinds of diss ent and vice versa? What are the social, olitical and cultural context s that surround contentious activities? What consistencies and inconsistencies exist in the region regarding the nature of dissent, its source s, and its contexts? Thematic Areas: The importance of context: The team has just comleted the roject's second ye ar. The research integrated data from in-deth surveys in the six co untries with survey and event data and content anal ysis of newswire and newsaer data. A conference at Me rshon Center, highlighting the team's work was held on July 31 st, following a five week worksho of intensive study . Essential to that was the work of graduate and undergraduate students who each worked in deth on one country, focusing on the mechanisms and exlanatory theories of reression and dissent in t he 1990s. From the country case studies, four Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 116 overarching themes emerged that are critical to und erstanding atterns of reression and dissent acros s the region: The imortance of rentier status, both oil and for eign aid, that creates internationally deendent st ates The size and out-migration of Palestinian and Kurdi sh oulations creating highly mobilized diasora communities The significance of the 1990-1991 Gulf War, which t ransformed olitical oortunities and transnational networks among activists The central role of technological and social networ ks that accomany globalization The distinctiveness of issues: Although comarisons among the nations studied coul d be drawn, unique issues fueled conflict in each location. For exam le, in Turkey, regime changes during the 1990s were a trigger for state action, and civil dissent was fue led by the mobilization of resources within central ized grous, e.g., PKK and Dev Sol. In Israel/Palestine , state action was fragmented and iece-meal with frequent changes in leadershi. A attern of romis es and broken romises was notable routinely sawne d violent conflict between local tribal and informal grous as well as by larger bureaucratic organizati ons. In Kuwait, struggles at the times of arliamentary ele ctions among secularists, Islamists and the ruling elite made transarent ersistent cleavages within the Ku waiti social system. Dissent eruted over the right s of women, foreign workers, the ress, and stateless e ole. The utility of multiple methodologies: The roject utilizes multile methodologies and sou rces of data. The latter include: (1) World Handbook of Political Indicators IV (htt://www.sociology.ohio- state.edu/faculty/jcj.h), which rovides event da ta from Reuters on relevant territories and is gene rated and utilized at The Ohio State University (OSU); (2 ) Kansas Event Data System (KEDS), which rovides event data from Agence Francaise Presse; it resides at University of Kansas (KU); (3) Euroa World Online Reorts, Keesing, and Lexis-Nexus dissent an d reression news stories, which have been consolidated at OSU; (4) Field work data which has been collected by American University in Cairo, KU, OSU, Trinity University, University of Maryland); ( 5) Kuwait General Social Surveys for the 1990s, country-secific demograhic data and World Values Survey data merged at OSU; and the (6) Religion and State Data Set from Fox, 2006, merged at OSU. U sing data from these sources in combination with each other has yielded a richly textured icture of contentious activity. Challenges and Opportunities: The roject is relete with challenges and oortun ities related to research goals 1 - 5 above. We men tion three: /xrhombus Attention to detailed atterns of state violence, s tate sanctions, and civil violence and rotest in e ach country using multile methods of data collection rovided an oortunity to examine the utility of theories of reression and dissent for exlaining c onflict in the Middle East and a challenge to corre ct and modify models deriving from such theories. (res earch goals 1, 2, and 5.) /xrhombus Attention to the social, olitical and cultural con texts of each nation using multile methods made it ossible to extract characteristics common to natio ns in the region, a significant move beyond generalizations based on case studies. (research g oals 1, 2, and 5.) /xrhombus The nature of the work and its social and olitical imortance has facilitated cross-discilinary and international oortunities for graduate and underg raduate students as well as faculty.

Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 117 Project Title: DRU Learning and Social Efficiency in Large Games Proposal #: 0734780 HSD Emphasis Area: Decision Making, Risk and Uncertainty Lead PI: Adam Kalai, Georgia Institute of Technology Co-PIs: Ehud Kalai, Northwestern University & Andrew Post lewaite, University of Pennsylvania Research Goals: 1. To introduce equilibrium concets based on comu ter science concets. 2. To study learning in large games. 3. To design mechanisms for laying large games. Thematic Areas: 1. Bounded rationality 2. Learning 3. Large games Methodologies: We are combining different aroaches from game the ory, economics and comuter science. Recent Research Findings: 1. Many interactions in comlex environments, e.g., chess, are affected by comutational limitations. An extreme examle is the factoring game, where the fi rst layer chooses a large number and sends it to t he second layer who then attemts to factor it. Ignor ing comutational considerations, the second layer can factor any number and win, but with comutational c onsiderations the game seems to favor the first layer. This well-known issue in game-theory falls und er the term bounded rationality, yet there is no ge neral model of laying games with comutational limitatio ns. We roose an extremely simle model of a game with additional costs (comutational or otherw ise) for each strategy. We illustrate that this mod el fits nicely into existing concets in game theory such a s zero-sum games, otential games, and submodular games, showing that natural learning dynamics conti nue to converge to equilibrium. 2. Bayesian-Nash equilibria that fail to be ex-ost stable are a oor modeling tool for many real life alications. Consider, for examle, a simultaneo us location choice game in which relocation costs are relatively low. No equilibrium is really stabl e if the locations observed after the formal lay o f the game are not comatible with individual incentives. Earlier literature has shown that in large (ma ny layers) games the equilibria are ex-ost stable rovided that several conditions hold. In articular (1) th e number of ossible layers' and bounded, a nd (2) the ayoff function of every layer is conti nuous Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 118 and treats the oonents as if they are anonymous. These restrictions severely limit the alicabili ty of this earlier literature. We show that ex-ost stability is obtained in more general classes of large games, ones that rela x the anonymity and finiteness restrictions above. In the class of game introduced here, layers can influence each other asymmetrically, but each laye r's unilateral influence on any of her rivals is bo unded. We show that this limited individual imact conditi on, together with a regularity condition on the ay off functions, guarantees aroximate ex-ost stability of Bayesian Nash equilibria in large games, even w hen we allow a continuum of tyes and actions. 3. Many imortant strategic roblems are character ized by reeated interactions among agents. There i s a large literature in game theory and economics illus trating how considerations of future interactions c an rovide incentives for cooeration that would not b e ossible in one-shot interactions. Much of the wo rk in reeated games assumes ublic monitoring, that is, that layers observe recisely the same thing at ea ch stage of the game. It is well-understood that even slight deviations from ublic monitoring increase dramatically the difficulty the roblems layers fa ce in coordinating their actions. Reeated games wi th rivate monitoring incororate the idea that there tyically may be slight differences in what layers observe about each transaction. Equilibria in reea ted games with rivate monitoring often seem unrealistic; the equilibrium strategies are highly comlex and very sensitive to the fine details of t he stochastic relationshi between layers' actions and observations. Furtherm ore, there is no realistic story about how layers would arrive at their equilibrium strategies. We roose an alternative aroach to understa nding how eole cooerate. Players restrict attent ion to a relatively small set of simle strategies. As a f irst ste we secify sets of strategies that have t he following desirable roerties: (i) the number of strategies in the set should be small enough that layers migh t ultimately learn which erform well; (ii) the strat egies should be simle in an intuitive sense; (iii) the sets should allow agents to cooerate when cooeration i s roductive. Using this framework, we investigate how the ossibility of cooeration changes as the n umber of agents gets large. Challenges and Opportunities: The oortunity is great to discover novel aradig ms for learning, mechanism design, and equilibrium concets. Natural concets such as bounded rationa lity in games seems esecially m comuter science regarding comutational comlexity . The difficulty is that many comlexity notions from comuter science are based on worst-case coml exity, which is not aroriate in many alication s. Similarly, another ossible oortunity would be to discover some alternatives to worst-case comutati onal comlexity that may arise from studying alternative models used in game theory and economics. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 119 Project Title: Studying Dynamic Patterns of Husband-To-Wife Abu se Proposal #: 0525026 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics of Human Behavior Lead PI: David Katerndahl, Deartment of Family and Commun ity Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Collaborators: David Katerndahl, Sandra Burge, Robert Ferrer Research Goals : To reare for a large-scale longitudinal study of dynamics of husband-to-wife abuse, this exloratory research study evaluated the feasibility of innovat ive methodology designed to distinguish between thr ee theories on the dynamics of husband-to-wife violenc e. The objectives for this exloratory study were to: 1. Conduct reliminary testing of cyclic atterns o f behavior in abusive relationshis and whether the level of daily abuse is associated with redictors reor ted in the day(s) rior to the abuse 2. Exlore the feasibility of conducting a large-sc ale longitudinal study of daily husband-to-wife vio lence and redictors. Thematic Areas : 1. Domestic Violence 2. Comlexity Science Methodologies : This study recruited 20 adult Hisanic and non-His anic White women from a rimary care clinic. Women were eligible if they reorted abuse by their artners within the ast month, but had never exerienced serious injuries and were not afraid of their artners. Subjects confidentially reorted d aily into a telehone recorder on the level of violence, argu ments, hassles, distress, marital harmony, life eve nts, and husband's alcohol intake during the revious day fo r a 2-month eriod. Weekly telehone discussions w ith subjects and an end-of-study interview assessed the women's sense of safety during the study. To ensu re safety, all subjects were escorted to a violence in tervention center and connected to aroriate comm unity resources. Analyses assessed whether changes in l evel of violence were cyclic and identified trigger s of violent events from the revious day(s) measures as well as roviding reliminary data needed to rea re for a larger, longitudinal study. Missing violence data was imuted using TISEAN software to maintain nonlinear characteristics. Each subject's data was analyzed using vector autoregression and chaos dat a analyzer. Resultant individual subject arameters were combined using statistical techniques of meta- analysis. Key innovative features included the day -to-day assessment of violent events and triggers, the assessment of day-to-day dynamics of abuse, the a lication of analyses never used before in violence research, and the alication of comlexity science to the study of domestic violence. Recent Research Findings : Of the 20 subjects enrolled, 4 (20%) withdrew rior to comleting data collection. The remaining 16 women rovided information concerning 586 days of w hich 225 (38%) included incidents of abuse. Unexectedly, seven (35%) women left their abusive husbands after comleting this study. Using cross-Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 120 correlation analysis, violence tended to occur on d ays in which arguments (r s= .54) and stress (r s= .36) were increased and sense of closeness was decreased (r s= -.37). Vector autoregression suggested that rio r violence, hassles, arguments, stress, closeness, an d life events significantly accounted for current v iolence. However, only two variables (arguments and life eve nts) redicted the following day's violence. Nonli near measures were also erformed. Mean LZ and Grassber ger entroies (measures of the amount of information needed to describe the time series) wer e .977 and .139, resectively, with a mean Lyaunov exonent (measure of how sensitive the series is to initial values) of .054, a mean aroximate entro y (measure of lack of regularity) of .535, and mean c orrelation time (measure of redictability) was .86 3. Based uon Lyaunov exonents and saturation of ca acity dimension (suggesting the resence of an attractor), 3 (25%) of the 12 subjects with enough data demonstrated eriodic dynamics, while 4 (33%) had chaotic and 5 (42%) had random dynamics. These res ults confirm that abusive relationshis demonstrate nonlinear dynamics with redictability over the sho rt-term at best. In addition, the nonlinear measur es were associated with differences in abuse characteristic s. While durations of the relationshi and marriag e were inversely related to LZ entroy (r s = -.49 and -.51, resectively), duration of abuse was inversely related to correlation time (r s = -.59). These results suggest that, the longer t he duration of relationshi, the more linear are the dynamics, but that the longer the ab use, the shorter the timeframe over which it is re dictable. Frequency of threats was associated with the Lyaun ov exonent (r s = .64). Thus, the use of threats and insults may be imortant in sustaining this sensiti vity to small changes. has sles were ositively correlated with aroximate entroy (rs = .51), but inversely related to Grassberger entro y (rs = -.48). Finally, rior-day redictors of c orrelated with (r s = -.50 for arguments), Lyaunov exonents (r s = .66 for arguments), and correlation time (r s = .75 for violence). These correlations suggest a comlex relationshi between same-day and rior-day redictors and nonlinearity . Challenges and Opportunities : This study demonstrated that sufficient daily info rmation can be obtained without increased risk from women in abusive relationshis to enable nonli near analyses to be conducted and combined. However, qualitative interviews raised the need to assess drug use and, because women in extremely abusive relationshis were excluded from articiat ion, the results of this study are not alicable t o the most violent relationshis. Finally, with 35% of w omen leaving their husbands, this study demonstrate d the otential of research rotocols to serve as int erventions. This exloratory work will reare for a larger st udy that will advance our knowledge and understanding about the dynamics of husband-to-wife abuse by identifying detailed atterns of dynamics and testing them against the roosed theories. De signed with the challenges of daily data collection and subject safety in mind, this exloratory study rov ided reliminary results needed for a full investig ation of these dynamics. This study demonstrates the otentially transforma tive nature of this work. It is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing the dynami cs of domestic violence and its correlates in realt ime without causing an escalation in that abuse. This could emower researchers to study violence \"as it haens\" rather than limiting their investigation t o osthoc and otentially-biased recall of events. In addition, the resultant sense of suort and emowe rment exressed by articiants demonstrates the otential for such research to, not only imrove ou r understanding of violence as a henomenon, but to simultaneously serve a ositive role within the liv es of subjects.

Add ersonality, age, gender, grouing and cult ural factors into the HMFV Social Forces Model. 2. Determine imortant characteristic factors, and what individual movements should be associated wit h given factors. 3. Add overla elimination routine to HMFV model t o rovide more realism. 4. Otical flow analysis for extracting informatio n on crowd dynamics from real world video. 5. Develo techniques and measures for comaring i nformation from otical flow analysis with simulati on outut. 6. Develo quantitative aroaches to measure when a simulation is a valid reresentation of a given crowd scenario and to differentiate among various crowd dynamics. Methodologies: Collect real world video footage of crowds in diver se non-emergency situations such as sorts, concert s, schools, malls, and church events. Use this video footage to validate simulation models by statistica lly comaring the results of the models against relevan t outut acquired from real world footage. One met hod of comarison is tracking the flux of individuals m oving through a discrete grid suerimosed on both a video and the corresonding simulation. Tracking t his flux (using the Lucas-Kinade otical flow algorithm) across the grid through time allows com arison between edestrian movements in the simulati on and observed movements on the video. A quantitative test is roosed to test whether one simulation is similar to or different from another simulation or video. This analytical aroach util izes a invariant under linear transforma tions of the data which include rotations, reflections, and rescaling. The benefit of the rotatability of the d ata is that it generates the same conclusions whether gathered from the original data or the rincial comonents of the analysis (PCA). PCA is alied to statistics collected from a historic dataset of out uts from different simulations over multile runs using Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 122 different seeds but with the same arameter values. The simlicial deth of these rincial comonents is calculated. A second simulation with different ar ameter values (or a video of crowd footage) is then run and the data deth of the statistics collected is c omuted. From this, a nonarametric control chart b ased on the ranks of the data deths is created. Plotting t hese ranks allows us to detect otential outliers. Outliers would indicate that the original simulation and the new simulation (with different arameters) (or the crowd videos) were not statistically the same. The HMFV model is based on each edestrian being th e effect of two kinds of forces, \"social\" and hysical. The forces acting on individuals in the HMFV model are: 1. Physical reulsive contact force of wall on indi vidual, 2. Physical frictional contact force of wall on ind ividual, 3. Social force of wall on individual, 4. Physical reulsive contact force of individual o n individual, 5. Physical frictional contact force of individual on individual, 6. Social force of individual on individual, 7. Self roelling social force arising from any at traction oint, 8. Small random forces included for variations. The arameters in these forces can be adjusted to m odel age differences, among other things. Characteristics to be used are the \"sense\" of erso nal sace (how close an individual is willing to be in relation to obstacles or other individuals), seed (how fast an individual moves), and randomness (how random are an individual's motion). These character istics are sufficiently distinct to resent noticea ble differences in their resective movements. To intr oduce ersonality factors into the HMFV equations w e introduced a vector weighted to reflect five erson ality traits for individuals. Multile simulations were run to determine aroriate ranges for the five erson ality traits and aroriate numerical factors for age grous. In order to better model high density crow ds in the HMFV model, we have introduced a density deendent magnitude to the social force of any crow d which surrounds a edestrian. Recent Research Findings: Addition of density deendent magnitude arameters to the HMFV model was observed to increase room exit times over that reorted by Helbing (creator o f the HMFV model). We also have shown that individu al characteristics (such as age) can be incororated i nto social forces by modifying the force arameters . These modifications can now be done on a grou leve l, in that all individuals of a grou will oerate with the same arameters (which define how the individua ls in that grou tend to react to the environmental factors). Using our comarison aroach, we can quantitativel y differentiate between two room exiting simulation s with different densities, while sets of simulation data which differ only by seed number aear quantitatively similar. This shows romise for the analytically validating simulations of a articula r crowd scenario, and in articular for determining the ot imum arameters for simulations containing individu als of different ages, ethnicities, etc. Challenges and Opportunities: We need to gain more exerience in how characterist ic grouings can be used and how such grous might interact. Individuals could even be members of sev eral different characteristic grous (such as age a nd sex Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 123 or ethnicity). Questions that need to be addressed include how to handle multile modifications on a s ingle force, whether or not these modifications remain so me constant value, or how they should be allowed to be modified by events occurring in the environment. Additional fine tuning needs to be done on our quan titative aroach towards validating and comaring simulations and videos. Secifically, we need to o timize the number of rincile comonents used and the number of outliers exected.

Recent Research Findings: Our first study showed that eole's sna judgments about the ersonality traits of a nice or imolite online robot health interviewer matched their judgments of the traits of a human health interviewer, and were made equally raidly. However, when eole thought more reflectively about these questions, they resonded that a robot interviewer would not osses s human ersonality traits, moods and desires. The results suggest that eole make anthroomorhic ju dgments of robots that are inconsistent with their abstract knowledge, and that they are aarently no t aware of this inconsistency. The reaction time re sults suggest that neither guessing or uncertainty about robots does not exlain the results. Challenges and Opportunities: One intellectual challenge is to find the cause of anthroomorhism, since it does not aear to be du e to misunderstanding. One ractical is develoing affor dable robots that can convincingly emulate asects of human behavior such as eye gaze, facial exressions , and body movement.

Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 127 Recent Research Findings: 1. There is a \"sweet sot\" for dryland agriculture in Hawai'i where the combination of substrate age, rainfall and elevation roduce otimal locations f or fixed field or sustained farming, most likely fo r sweet otato; 2. The develoment of dryland agriculture in Hawai'i t akes off in the 16 th century AD and is mostly abandoned by the mid-19 th century after the arrival Euroeans and oulation collase; 3. Both exansion and intensification can be identifie d in Hawaiian dryland agriculture and the extent of each can vary according to environmental and socia l factors; 4. The exansion of dryland agriculture led to exansi on of oulations along the leeward (more arid) zones of Maui and Hawai'i islands; 5. Poulation growth and agricultural intensification were inter-linked with increased socio-olitical cometition among chiefs, articularly involving t hose whose olities were centered in more arid zone s and which were more affected by droughts and rodu ction constraints; and 6. Evidence for the consolidation of ower into fewer but more cometitive chiefdoms in Hawai'i is concentrated in the 17 th century, articularly on Maui. Challenges and Opportunities: 1. We have discovered, as have many other researchers, that to conduct meaningful research on human dynamics requires larger satial scales than tradi tionally is the case. And with this comes issues of coverage, samling, and the creation of large data bases. 2. With multile inter-institutional researchers come issues of consistent and reliable measurement and classification, articularly for archaeological ma terials. 3. This research has roduced valuable and rovocative natural and cultural (including archaeological) databases that have been used to create redictive models. 4. This work has generally benefited from areas that h ave excellent reservation of archaeological and historical roerties, including large agricultura l comlexes and systems. However, many undeveloed areas in Hawai'i are under ressure to develo eco nomically. 5. The large satial scale of this research has requir ed us to focus on relatively non-invasive nature archaeological research, including remote sensing and maing, emloying excavation strategically. 6. The oortunity to link archaeological remains with Hawaiian oral traditions and early historic Euroean accounts rovides finer chronological con trol and rich detail on motivations and ractices. 7. Building models uward from articular biological, geohysical, and archaeological observations to large scale comlex systems requires linkages betw een levels of organization not usually attemted by archaeologists.

Kitts, Columbia University Co-PIs: Martina Morris, University of Washington Michael W. Macy, Cornell University Collaborators: Tanzeem Choudhury, Intel Research, Dartmouth Colleg e Research Goals: The social world that we observe reflects a web of interdeendent rocesses, with macro-level structur es of organizations, communities, and societies both emer ging from and constraining the micro-level interact ions of individuals. Most social science research has fo cused on finding statistical relationshis in cross - sectional data - such as correlations of individual s' age with olitical attitudes, the demograhic comosition of ersonnel organizational erfor mance, or law enforcement olicies with municial crime rates - while assuming that the objects of st udy are indeendent. This focus may describe tyica l static atterns, but gives us limited insight into the underlying generative rocesses or the dynamic consequences of statistical relationshis. Furtherm ore, many social henomena are inherently time vary ing and deend on interactions among entities within a social system, such as in the sread of eidemics, the rise of olitical insurgency, or the dissolution of formal organizations. Understanding the link between micro-level interact ions and macro-level dynamics could have rofound imact on the ways we engage basic social science r esearch. Toward this end, an increasing number of scientists are using mathematical and comutational models to elucidate theoretical roblems in social dynamics, often by alying general theories or met hods from the natural sciences. For examle, models from statistical hysics have been used to study he althcare organizations, oulation ecology models h ave been alied to the study of the evolution of indus tries, and neural networks have been used to model the origins of religious beliefs. Although these links are romising, their imact is limited by conventional discilinary institutions that fail to romote broad diffusion of ideas and methods. Wi thin the social sciences, the audience for comutational modeling remains largely confined to a small community of modelers. Although a handful o f interdiscilinary centers advance these tools, few discilinary social science rograms currently offe r training in comutational modeling. Most B.A. and P h.D. students graduate without learning to be criti cal consumers of research using these innovative tools, let alone use the tools in their own research. Unsurrisingly, most social science journals have oorly-develoed standards for evaluating research emloying comutational models. This roject aims t o make research in social dynamics both more rigorous and more accessible by offering training r esources in comutational modeling and by facilitat ing exchanges of models and methods among scholars from a variety of discilines. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 129 Project Progress for 2006-2007 An imortant focus of our efforts in the third year of the roject has been the advancement of comuta tional modeling among established researchers, including r esources for faculty develoment and retraining. Th e investigators and graduate students working under t his grant are ublishing research aers that exem lify some best ractices in comutational modeling of so cial dynamics. (One of the PI's recent articles won the American Sociological Association's 2007 Best Paer award in Mathematical Sociology and his graduate student research assistant won the corresonding Be st Graduate Student Paer award for a different a er.) More directly, the PI develoed a seminar on comut ational modeling of social dynamics for academic an d government researchers, delivering the first two se minars in February of 2007 at Victoria University o f Wellington and Auckland University in New Zealand. He also articiated in an exert anel on comutational modeling of organizational behavior a t the annual meeting of the Academy of Management in August, 2007. In October of 2006, the PI collaborated with comut er scientist Tanzeem Choudhury to organize an interdiscilinary meeting on theoretical modeling o f social dynamics. This meeting aimed to foster intellectual exchange among mathematicians, natural and hysical scientists (including biologists, hysicists, comuter scientists, and engineers), an d social and behavioral scientists with a common in terest in the alication of mathematical and comutationa l methods to roblems of social dynamics. The meeting served three uroses: (i) to facilitate in terdiscilinary conversations among diverse exerts and give rise to future collaborative rojects of high imact in areas of social dynamics, such as the evo lution of social networks, evolutionary and ecological models of social behavior, oulation dynamics and demograhy, and organizational dynamics, (ii) to en courage and enable alications of these models to real-world roblems such as eidemics or cascading failures due to natural disasters, and finally (iii ) to hel NSF identify and nurture emerging research agendas as art of the Human and Social Dynamics riority area. The worksho yielded a formal reort, which i s being distributed to researchers, educators, and other interested arties on the World Wide Web. Broader Impacts In develoing and disseminating materials for learn ing and curriculum develoment, we aimed to imrove training in dynamics within traditional social scie nce discilines. This year we have moved beyond for mal learning contexts, offering a worksho reort and s eminars at rofessional meetings to assist faculty in integrating dynamic modeling into their own researc h rograms. All of these efforts aim to increase th e rominence and integrity of dynamic modeling racti ces in the social sciences, ultimately enriching ou r understanding of social dynamics.

Klein, Colorado State University Co-PIs: Emily T. Yeh, University of Colorado; Kathleen A. Galvin, Randall B. Boone. Dennis S. Ojima, Colorado State University Collaborators: Xin-Quan Zhao, Northwest Institute of Plateau Bio logy, Chinese Academy of Sciences Research Goals: The main objective of this roject is to investigat e Tibetan astoralists' vulnerability to extreme s ring snowstorms, and to examine the short and longer ter m social and ecological imlications of the snowsto rms and of state restocking rograms. We examine these issues in anticiation that these storms may becom e more frequent in the future. Thematic Areas: 1. global environmental change (extreme weather ev ents) 2. couled human-environmental systems 3. astoral human and ecological resilience/vulner ability to environmental change Methodologies: This work entails three main comonents. First, we will investigate how socio-economic status, ecolog ical range condition, and the resence/absence of state restocking rograms affect herder well-being and vulnerability to severe sring snowstorms. This in vestigation will be based on an evaluation of the e ffects of the 1998 storm, using re- and immediate ost-st orm data as well as data gathered on the current st atus of the couled human-environment system. This will involve a suite of methods, including structured a nd semi-structured interviews, articiant observation , ecological field observations, remote sensing, an d historic climate analyses. We will also conduct an exerimental maniulation of snow timing and amount , both in the resence and absence of restocking, to assess the ecological effects of sring snowstorms. Detailed, socio-economic studies will also reveal h ow decisions are made at the household level, how astures and livestock are managed, and what factor s influence strategies for recovering from snowstor ms. In articular, the historical comonent will examin e how strategies affecting resistance and resilienc e to sring snowstorms have changed over time within the larger olitical economic context, including chang es in roerty rights, markets, and imlementation of various develoment schemes. Second, we will utili ze the information gained from the first set of activi ties to modify and arameterize a couled agent-bas ed and ecosystem model to reflect the interactions of clim ate, extreme weather events, ecological conditions, astoral management atterns, state olicies, and s ocio-economic conditions on the Tibetan Plateau. T hird, we will make redictions of future herder well-bein g and vulnerability to future extreme sring snowst orms under a suite of snowstorm frequency and intensitie s, management ractices, and state olicies. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 131 Recent Research Findings: Our first big field season will occur during the su mmer of 2008. Therefore, all of our findings to da te consist of background information obtained to fine tune our research questions and study aroaches. For examle, recent interviews we conducted revealed th at while larger scale government restocking rogram s occurred in resonse to snowstorms in Nagchu Prefec ture in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), the restocking that occurred in other areas, such as Yu shu Prefecture in Qinghai Province, was conducted rimarily by non-governmental organizations on a mu ch smaller scale. Based on this information, we ar e modifying our questions regarding the restocking r ograms. We also recently learned how snowstorms relate to other grassland issues deemed imortant t o astoralists. For examle, in Yushu Prefecture, villagers say the 1985 snowstorm killed lots of liv estock, but that afterwards the grass never recover ed. This is an imortant marker for eole about when the gr ass condition got worse. Moreover, we learned that there may be a connection between snowstorms and th e government's new resettlement rogram. Our researchers have met with two different families wh o were relocated under this new governmental olicy who said that they chose to take art in the resett lement rogram because they lost most of their live stock in the blizzard of 1995 and did not recover their live stock numbers. We are further modifying our resear ch questions to address how the snowstorms interact wi th these issues of concern to local astoralists, s uch as grassland degradation and the government's grasslan ds resettlement olicy. We have obtained detailed information about snowsto rms, livestock losses, and restocking rograms from the late 1980's to the resent from one of our stud y areas in Nagchu Prefecture, TAR. We have also identified 12 sites for the observational samling comonent of this roject. These 12 sites san a reciitation gradient, from 250 mm to 750 mm of me an annual reciitation. We are comiling climate data for each of these 12 sites from the Chinese Me teorological Association (CMA), the World Meteorological Association (WMO), and the Climate R esearch Unit (CRU). Our aim is to calibrate the CMA and WMO data (station data) with the CRU data ( gridded and interolated) so that we can conduct temerature and reciitation trend analyses by sit e from 1901 to the resent. A researcher from our team has visited virtually all of these 12 sites and gat hered data regarding snowstorm atterns, restocking , resettlement and other government grassland olicie s. She has also met with local officials to obtain ermission and work out logistics for our more deta iled research investigations. We are working with remote sensing data to examine longer term snow anomaly trends (based on assive microwave sensors), to examine satial atterns of snowstorms across the Tibetan Plateau (based on AVHRR data), and to examine re- and ost-snowstorm vegetation atterns. These results are still ending. Our field camaigns will commence in summ er 2008. Challenges and Opportunities: Challenges: One of the rimary challenges we face i s identifying a site that meets all of the criteria for both the ecological exeriment and the detailed socio-ec onomic-olitical investigations. After much resear ch we have concluded that no site can meet all of our cri teria; therefore, we are in the rocess of rioriti zing our criteria in order to select the best site. Oortunities: Through the rocess of investigating all otential sites for the ecological exeriment and the detailed socio-economic-olitical study, we have ex tended our connections to academic institutions and olitical jurisdications beyond those which were in cluded in our original roosal. Our network of otential collaborators has grown and will serve to only strengthen this roject.

Research Goals: 1. To examine the imact of out-migration on the healt h and well-being of the left-behind through three channels: a) remittances and income, b) social netw orks/caital, c) inter-generational relationshis a nd d) cultural value change. 2. To test the validity of using the recently develoe d \"Day Reconstruction Method\" to measure well- being in a rural oulation. Thematic Areas : 1. Internal migration 2. Well-being/hainess Methodologies: integration of ethnograhic studies and household s urveys. Our emirical work consists of three stes: re- survey ethnograhic studies to inform the study on hyothesis formulation and design of culturally and socially sensitive survey instruments; household su rveys to collect quantitative data; and ost-survey ethnograhy to resolve \"uzzling\" survey findings a nd rovide rich qualitative information for interr eting survey results. Recent Research Findings : In July-August, 2006, we collected survey data from a samle of 1,810 households (and 7,712 individual s) in four counties in rural China: Anyue, in Sichuan rovince; Linquan, in rovince. Forty-eight ercent of the households in the samle have at least one household member who is a migrant worker. Ethnograhic studies were also carried in the same site. We have the following reliminary findings: 1. Migration is highly related to the local economic c onditions. The oorer the area, the higher the out- migration rate. 2. Key characteristics of migrants: migrants are tyic ally young (between 15 and 35 years old; for women, 60% are between 15 and 24 years old); have c omleted junior high school education (9 years); and from households with lower income. Seve nty-seven ercent of our migrant samles work in cities outside their home rovince and most of them are away from home all year round. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 133 3. The rimary reasons for migration: earn more money to subsidize the family's exenses for day to day living necessities and to imrove the family's living standard in general. About 12% also exressed that the main reason to work as migrant w orker is to \"exand their horizons\". 4. Relationshi between out-migration and economic con ditions of the left-behind: The median annual earning was 9,600 RMB in 2005 (mean=11,000RMB). Mea nwhile, the median and mean annual amount they sent home were aroximately 1,000 RMB and 2,300 RMB, resectively. This suggests that the majority of earnings are retained by the migrants, to ay for exenses in the city. About forty-five of the migrant samles worked at laces that did not rovide food and housing. Although the money that the migrants sent home rer esent only a small share of their total earnings, it has significant imact on the economic well-bein g of their left-behind households. Remittances reresent about 50% of total household consumtion exenditure for households with migrants and there is much variation across the four counties, w hich we are currently examining what the lausible exlanations are. Excluding remittances, migrant households' consumtion exenditure are 30% lower than those of migrant households. Aft er remittances, migrant households' consumtion exenditures are almost the same as non -migrant households. 5. Ethnograhic findings further suggest that the left -behind in general found the rimary ositive imact of migration are economics ones. However, th e interviewed also exressed concerns that while migration offers unaralleled oortunities f or individual economic gains, its effect on the village as a whole is unclear. Migration seems to b e thought of as a last resort, something only undertaken if absolutely necessary. One resondent ut it this way: if he could earn an income of 1000 RMB if he migrated or 600 RMB if he stayed hom e, he would stay home, because of the additional burden migration uts on the left-behind and the extra exenses associated with living away from home. 6. DRM data showed similar sychometric roerties as those collected in the US and Euroe from urban and more educated samles. 7. Elderlies whose children have migrated are less lik ely to receive social suort and send more time laboring in the field and/or looking after grandchi ldren. Our reliminary findings show that these adversely affect the elderlies' well-being. Challenges and Opportunities : Although our data showed strong and ositive relati onshi between social caital/network and different measures of health and well-being, we did not find any relationshi between out-migration and social caital/network in the sending community, irresect ive of whether social caital/network is measured a t the individual or aggregate level; based on the communi tarian or the network aroach. Thus, at resent, w e are not able to establish the linkage between out-m igration and the health and well-being of the left- behind through the social caital/network channel. A lanned follow u survey for the same households/ individuals in 2008 may hel us understand the reason.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 134 Project Title: Exerimental Analysis of Long-Term Effects on Human Behavior from Changes in Residential Neighborhood Environment Proposal # : SES-0527615 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead PI: Jeffrey Kling, The Brookings Institution Co-PIs: Greg Duncan, Northwestern University Larry Katz, Harvard University Ronald Kessler, Harvard University Jens Ludwig, University of Chicago Lisa Gennetian, The Brookings Institution Lisa Sanbonmatsu, National Bureau of Economic Rese arch Research Goals: 1. To examine the long-term effects of neighborhood s on behavior, and how they evolve over time. 2. To assess if effects of a housing mobility exer iment on mental health ersist over the long-term a nd if there are effects on clinically significant sychi atric disorders 3. To examine whether effects of a housing mobility exeriment differ for suboulations including gender, age and history of youth roblem behavior 4. To better understand the social rocesses by whi ch neighborhood environments influence behavior Thematic Areas : 1. This roject is not thematically related to HSD' s area Agents of Change , as it is designed as micro-data collection of low-income families who articiated in a housing mobility in five U.S. cities. 2. With the aim of informing whether a housing mobi lity exeriment can have long term effects on menta l health rocesses and of understanding how the long -term effects of neighborhoods on behavior evolve over time, this roject is thematically related to HSD's area Dynamics of human behavior. 3. As described in recent research in the behaviora l economics literature, environmental factors such as neighborhood conditions may influence decision mak ing. Because moves to lower-crime, lower- overty neighborhoods could change future orientat ion, resonses to risk, and even altruism by reducing exosure to neighborhood stressors and te mtations, this roject contributes to HSD's thematic area Decision-making and risk. Methodologies: Data from a randomized housing voucher exeriment k nown as Moving to Oortunity (MTO) will be used to identify the long-term effects of changes in nei ghborhood environment on the behavior of low-income , mostly minority families who were originally living in high-overty ublic housing rojects. By lotte ry, families were assigned to one of three grous: a T raditional Voucher grou, a Low Poverty Voucher Gro u and a control grou. Outcomes of the Low overty V oucher or Traditional voucher grous will be comared to outcomes of the Control grou on a wide range of outcomes. The random-assignment design of the demonstration means that differential outcom es for the treatment grous relative to the Control grou (occurring after rogram entry) can be interreted as estimates of treatment effects of eligibility fo r these rograms (commonly known as intention-to-treat effe cts). Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 135 Recent Research Findings: Data collected during 2002 suggest that moving to a less disadvantaged area through MTO roduces a variety of beneficial changes for female youth (15- 20 years old when interviewed, and so 8-16 at the t ime of random assignment) with resect to risky and cri minal behaviors as well as mental health. However MTO moves had little effect on outcomes for female adults beyond mental health, and on balance had detrimental effects on the risky and criminal behav ior of males. Further, MTO had no detectable effec ts on youth math and reading achievement. Challenges and Opportunities: This study is an oortunity to assess MTO's long-t erm effects (9 to 12 years after random assignment) for 6800 youth ages 10 to 20, all of whom were 11 or yo unger at the start of MTO, as well as 4600 househol d heads, across a wide range of outcomes measured fro m survey data on education, emloyment, delinquency, and mental and hysical health; readin g and math achievement tests; and administrative da ta on arrests, emloyment, welfare receit and school outcomes. This research exands the range of rior MTO work to eidemiology and sychiatry by focusing more intensively on the effects of neighborhoods on clinically significant emotional roblems. Furth er, we will better understand the behavioral mechan isms behind neighborhood effects, articularly on those mechanisms that influence gender differences in you th resonses to neighborhood change. There are no challenges to reort to date. Analysi s of the earlier qualitative data is ongoing. The MTO long term survey data collection will begin in May of 2008. Preliminary results of the data will be a vailable the fall of 2009. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 136 Project Title: Economic Growth, Social Inequality, and Environm ental Change in Thailand and Cambodia Proposal #: 0433787 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of Change Lead PI: Alan L. Kolata, University of Chicago Co-PIs: Robert Townsend, University of Chicago and Michael Binford, University of Florida Collaborators: Jane Southworth, Peter Waylen, University of Florid a; Collaborating Institutions: Thai Family Research Center, Center for Khmer Studies Research Goals: The rincial research goal of the roject is a com arative analysis of social inequality, economic gr owth and environmental change in the rural sectors of Th ailand and Cambodia. The major contribution to the discilines is an integrated analysis of detailed, longitudinal ecological, social and economic data s ets to develo concetual and formal models that relate ec onomic growth, social inequality and environmental change, articularly with resect to land cover and land use change. Methodologies: The roject deloys a methodology that integrates q uantitative and qualitative based methods to unders tand the trajectories of economic growth and environment al change over the ast 25-50 years in selected stu dy areas of Thailand and Cambodia. We have conducted two years of field socio-economic surveys and biohysical studies with satellite remote sensing a nd ground data collection methods in NW Cambodia to relicate annual surveys in Thailand. The roject G IS contains nearly every aroriate dataset availa ble for the study areas, and many at the national or Me kong River basin scale, from government agencies an d NGOs in both Thailand and Cambodia and a satially and temorally comrehensive selection of Landsat TM and ETM+ data covering the study areas in both c ountries. Recent Research Findings: Several results, both substantive/emirical and met hodological, have been identified to date: 1) Land uses in Thailand and Cambodia emerging in different land scae ositions vary significantly, and are control led by different hysical and social factors at differe nt scales; 2) rural villages have distinctive sati al characteristics in Cambodia and Thailand, and may b e the results of variable forms of social organizat ion and adatation to environmental and infrastructural factors; 3) the dominant, recent land-cover/land-u se changes were forest conversion in Cambodia vs. infr astructure develoment in Thailand; and 4) combinin g Systems theory of social-ecologica l systems with Land-Use/Land-Cover Change analysis rovides a context-indeendent set of char acteristics by which to examine landscae dynamics because land use, land cover, and their change over time are the tangible exressions of the activitie s of the social-ecological system. This may allow generaliza tions about human and social dynamics that can be alied to secific systems in secific laces. In the first result, seasonally flooded forests aro und Tonle Sa are influenced by annual and inter-an nual atterns of lake-level changes, which in turn are c ontrolled by climate variation in the entire Mekong river basin extending into south-central China. In contra st, uland environments deend on local reciitati on and have been transformed in resonse to local, reg ional, and global socio-economic drivers. Secifica lly, Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 137 uland deforestation in the imortant temle comlex of Angkor accelerated dramatically between 1995 and 20 05, after Angkor was named a UNESCO World Heritage site. The floodlain zone was a mosaic of multile change trajectories but the largest ercen t of change occurred from non-forest to forest since 200 2. Floodlain dynamics are controlled more by regio nal hydrologic rocesses of the larger Mekong basin tha n by anthroogenic factors in the drainage basin. In the second research finding, most rural, agricul tural villages in the study rovinces in Thailand a re clustered and their inhabitants farm multile lots around the villages. These villages have existed f or many generations and have grown as densely clustered hou seholds because the land outside the villages is mo re valuable as addy fields. They also have dense soci al networks with surrounding villages and towns and ossess multile civic associations that organize c ollective social life. Villages in the Cambodian r ovinces tend to be aligned along roads or waterways. Some v illages formed after the Khmer Rouge era and Vietnamese occuation, both of which caused massive oulation dislocation. Others formed or reformed since olitical stability began in 1998. Peole io neering or reoulating a region build houses along roads to facilitate transortation. Also, minefield clear ing is roceeding but roadsides were the first area s cleared. The social organization of these emergent or re-col onized villages differs from the Thai villages. The re are few autonomous civic organizations or institutions for collective social interactions, and ties of soc ial solidarity are weakly develoed. In the third result, reliminary analysis of multi- temoral Landsat data indicates that much forest cl earing in northwestern Cambodia is done lot-by-lot by gradu al thinning, leading first to sarse forest and the n to scrub, robably by small holders and mostly along r oads. There is a second attern of clearing in whic h large blocks of forest are cleared and roads are bu ilt to the cut areas, resumably to remove logged t imber. These clearings are robably created by larger orga nizations, and may be the roduct of illegal loggin g. In Northeast Thailand, agricultural intensification, s read of rubber, teak, and eucalytus lantations, and new reservoirs have been the major landscae changes. The Northeast Thai landscae is dotted with reservo irs and canals, many of which were built in the ast 15 years, but the Cambodian landscae to the south ha s only two reservoirs and almost no large-scale irrig ation develoment. The Thai data indicate that ther e is more income inequality across villages in areas tha t are develoing quickly, though this attern has lessened over time as national markets develoed an d the wage rate for unskilled labor increased. Stru ctural economic models under develoment identify key vari ables driving growth in er caita income and inequality, including education, access to formal f inancial system, and occuation, but there is more inequality within grous than this set of models ca n exlain. The work in Cambodia suggests that villa ges are sociologically and structurally different from their Thai counterarts, e.g. households have a muc h greater tendency to be risk averse than in Thailand . The unique historical circumstances of Cambodia o ver the ast 30-40 years, a eriod marked by conflict, civil war, genocide and slow social and economic recovery, are significant contributing factors to t his difference. In the fourth result, work on the cross-boundary ar ea of two rovinces, one each in Thailand and Cambo dia, has led to a new theoretical ersective on the use of Comlex Adative Systems (CAS) theory to examin e the social-ecological systems (SES) that drive land -use/land-cover change. A major challenge to the emergence of land-use land-cover change (LULCC) res earch as a science has been the ability to develo a theoretical framework that is not restricted to se cific case studies or tyes of human-environment interactions. In art, our research tests whether t he concet of Land-use land-cover (LULC) diversity, as embedded in the framework of CAS, allows researcher s to generalize across a range of different SESs. We focus on the satial and temoral atterns, as w ell as the frequency distributions, of two measures of LULC diversity in the adjacent, but different lands caes of Sisaket rovince, Thailand, and Otdar Meanchey rovince, Cambodia, to assess the utility of LULC diversity as a concet for cross-site Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 138 comarison. Our results suggest that LULC diversit y reflects the dynamic comlexity of the human- dominated landscae. As such, it rovides a measura ble means of abstracting landscaes so that comarisons can be made between areas that would ot herwise be context-deendent. Challenges and Opportunities A major challenge of the roject remains effective integration of large-scale data sets deloying both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 139 Project Title: Democratic Eistemics in Lab-Based Processes Proposal #: 0622477 HSD Emphasis Area: Risk Uncertainty Roger Kol, Fairleigh Dickinson University Co-PIs: Robert Kurzban, University of Pennsylvania; Lawre nce Kobilinsky, John Jay College of Criminal Justice Research Goals: How can we build error-reducing mechanisms in the o rganization of forensic science and other lab-based social rocesses? Might a kind of democracy in dec ision-making counteract the effects of bias, arochialism, and undetected flaws in rotocol? Su ch \"democracy\" would consist in randomized redundancy, for examle random redundant testing of forensic evidence. We ask: 1. Everything else equal, will eole transmit false i nformation to a decision-maker if they have an incentive to do so? 2. Can a simle institutional mechanism, \"democratic e istemics,\" be imlemented to reduce or eliminate the distorting effects of the bias in (1)? 3. How do factors such as the size of a bias (1) inter act with a mechanism as in (2)? Answering question 2 means testing democratic eis temics as an institutional mechanism, tying together the research question with the exeriment al method. Question 3 addresses its robustness. Thematic Areas: 1. error detection and correction 2. organization of science 3. social eistemology Methodologies: In this exeriment, Senders reresent forensic labs and Receivers reresent a judge or jury. There ar e N Senders and one Receiver, each describable, in the behavioral game theory tradition, as having a set o f information, a set of decisions, and ayoffs associ ated with all ossible outcomes. In each round, a randomizing device chooses a \"correct\" Object from a set of 3 Objects: circle, triangle, square. This information is known to Senders but not the Receive rs. Senders send a message consisting of one of the Objects to Receivers, who then must submit a decisi on about what they believe the correct Object to be . (In the context of forensic science, this message c orresonds to a lab indicating \"match,\" \"no match,\" or \"inconclusive.\") The Receivers' information consis ts only of the communications they will receive fro m Senders, their own ayoffs for correct versus incor rect guesses, and limited information about Senders ' ayoffs (see below). Senders get a ayment if the Receiver indicates the correct Object. Senders, however, also get an addi tional ayment deending on which Object the Receiver choo ses independent of the correct Object . This ayment corresonds to the bias on the art of the lab ersonnel. This ayoff information is rivate (i.e., unknown to the Receivers). In the Baseline condition, there was one Sender and one Receiver. Senders received a ayment of $3 for leading the Receiver to the correct Object (a \"hit\" ) if the Sender sent the correct Object and the Rec eiver Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 140 chose this Object. Senders received an additional ayment, deending on the treatment, of either $1.0 0 or $5.00 for a \"sulemental\" Object. This ayment in duced a bias in the references of Senders. The Se nder received this ayment as a function of the Object c hosen by the Receiver indeendent of what the corre ct Object was. Thus, if the correct Object was square and the sulemental Object was circle, and the Receiver choose circle, the Sender got a ayoff of $5. A Sender with a $5 sulemental ayoff thus ha d an incentive to reort the sulemental Object (circle in our examle) regardless of what the correct Obj ect was. This incentive is the Sender's bias. Further exerimental treatments were run with 2, 3, 4, and 5 Senders er Receiver. Everything was identical, including the High and Low Bias treatmen ts, excet that there were multile (2, 3, 4, or 5) Senders er Receiver. Each Sender was told that the Receiver would have access to the information (sha e) sent by each of the other Senders, and then would g uess the correct shae based on this information. In each round all three Senders had the same bias leve l, but they did not necessarily have the sulement ary shae. Crucially, Senders were not informed of the biases of the other Senders. We call the one-Send er treatment \"monooly eistemics\" and the multile-Se nder treatments \"democratic eistemics.\" Recent Research Findings: Results collected so far show that 1) exerimental articiants can be induced to send accurate inform ation when the induced bias is small; 2) articiants can be induced to send inaccurate information when the induced bias is large; and 4) democratic epistemics can improve system performanc e in the sense of lowering Receiver error rates. The benefits of dem ocratic eistemics derive not from making the exer ts in the system better, but from the structural redundan cy that lowers Receiver error rates. Our results show that it is not necessary to imrov e the reliability of the individual units with the system (Senders) in order to imrove system erformance. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link; a net(work), by contrast, is stronger than it's indiv idual knots (nodes). Showing that imroving the re liability of individual crime labs does not require imroving the reliability of individual crime is imortant f or olicy and institutional design. Challenges and Opportunities: Our research rogram suorts the design of institu tions for the governance of lab-based social roces ses. We can reroduce alternative network structures in the exerimental economics laboratory and comare their eistemic roerties. This digm resents many opportunities for alication to roblems not only in forensics, but all lab-based s ocial rocesses including medical testing and resea rch science. Thus, it may have the otential to be hel ful in the formulation of science olicy. The challenge in each such alication is to construct an integra ted series of exerimental designs that begins wit h a clean test of a well-defined theoretical roblem an d rogressively increases ecological validity until olicy imlications or \"real world\" institutional designs can be formed.

Understand the factors shaing firm decisions to offshore knowledge activities. 2. Identify the imacts of offshoring for firm erf ormance. 3. Assess the broader societal imlications of offs horing for trade, economic growth and emloyment. Thematic Areas: 1. Globalization of new roduct develoment (NPD) i n electronics hardware and of software develoment. 2. Relative imortance of economic and relational f actors and ICT in offshoring decisions. 3. Imacts on firm erformance Methodologies: Field interviews with US multinational firms in the comuter hardware and software sector, case studie s of these firms, interviews with offshore firms rovidi ng develoment services, national survey of 400 fir ms in electronics manufacturing and software and services . Recent Research Findings: Although we continue to work on offshoring of new roduct develoment in relation to hardware, we focused this year on offshoring of software develo ment, including ackaged software, custom software and software services. The goals was to determine w hether trends in software were significantly differ ent from what we discovered earlier in new roduct deve loment for hardware. 1. Our earlier finding was that offshoring of manufact uring is ulling more routine knowledge work in NPD offshore. Now it is also ulling higher-value design activities and even some R&D offshore as well, although those are driven mainly by cost and availability of skilled scientists and engineers, o r by the need to be close to customers that have moved o ffshore (e.g., test equiment suliers for motherboard roduction lines). Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 142 2. Findings in manufacturing are now reinforced by fin dings in new roduct develoment for software. Production work such as software coding and testing is now ulling design work offshore. The result i s that often only the system requirements and imleme ntation activities remain on shore. 3. Proximity requirements are a key underlying factor that affects location, but oerates different for hardware than for software. For hardware, roximit y tends to ull other activities offshore whereas f or software, roximity so far tends to kee activities onshore. For hardware, roximity requirements are dictated b y the fact that so much manufacturing has been outsourced and moved offshore. In turn, the suly base and sources of innovation have clustered arou nd these manufacturing facilities. In some cases, the se clusters have involved hundreds and even thousan ds of firms with caabilities that no longer exist in the U.S. These existence of these caabilities has th e effect of ulling some higher level develoment activities such as rototying to the manufacturing sites to take advantage of exensive hysical modeling and testin g equiment, facilities for roduction engineering and so on. These caabilities are also ulling some de sign activities to the roduction location as the n eed for oversight of contractors and faster roblem resolut ion to ensure seed to market means that designers must be close to develoment and manufacturing. On the other hand, in many cases we find that design can b e searated geograhically from develoment and rodu ction, and remains mostly in the U.S.. For software, roximity may be required to the onsh ore customer or end user, to high-cost firm secifi c assets that would be too exensive to dulicate off shore (e.g.,ATM network), or to mission critical oerations which cannot be interruted to switch th em offshore. As major offshore locations such as I ndia and China become imortant software markets themsel ves, such caabilities will likely develo in roximity to those markets. Challenges and Opportunities: The challenge we face in the next year is to develo and successfully field a questionnaire to about 4 00 firms so we can determine the extent to which the henomena we discover in our fieldwork can be generalized to a broader oulation of firms. An oortunity that has arisen is the rosect of g aining access secondary data on offshoring, which w ould exand our caabilities for data analysis. We are in discussions about this rosect with a research team at another university. If this oortunity comes to f ruition, we will need to request sulemental fundi ng.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 143 Project Title: Anthroological Modeling of Social Structure, Genet ics and Language Seciation in Indonesia Proposal #: 0725470 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of Change Lead PI: J. Stehen Lansing, University of Arizona Co-PIs: Michael Hammer, Karafet, Joseh Watkins. Un iversity of Arizona Collaborators: Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Ministry o f Public Health, National Language Institute, Indonesia Research Goals: The Indonesian archielago encomasses great cultur al, genetic and linguistic diversity, from atriloc al wet-rice farmers in Java and Bali to matrilocal com munities in the mountains of Flores, and hunter- gatherers in the forests of Borneo and West Paua. Taking advantage of this broad diversity, this roj ect's research goal is to build and test anthroological models to exlain observed atterns of genetic and linguistic variation at the levels at which they or iginate. Thematic Areas: Until now, most studies of genetic and linguistic e volution and differentiation have focused on large- scale regional or continental atterns, characterized fro m a hylogenetic ersective. Yet all such atterns arise from rocesses that begin at the community level. O ur aroach is to gather information at the communi ty level to address community based, island based and region based questions. Methodologies: In collaboration with Indonesian researchers and u blic health teams, our research team has been colle cting genetic, linguistic, demograhic, environmental, me dical and ethnograhic data from villages throughou t the archielago. A combination of modeling and inferential aroache s is necessary to investigate the rocesses under study. Thus, we are develoing our own genetic and linguistic models aroriate for the satiotemor al scales under study, designing inferential strategie s, creating software to imlement the models and to make inference, and working with develoers to extend th eir own highly regarded software ackages. Recent Research Findings: We tested our aroach of examining linguistic and genetic variation by beginning with the contact zon e eastern Indonesian island of Sumba, where Neolithic Austronesian farming communities settled and began interacting with aboriginal foraging societies ~3,50 0 years ago. Using historical linguistics, we reconstructed the hylogeny of the languages of Sum ba based on a 200-word Swadesh list samled from 29 localities. Thus reconstruction suorts the hy othesis that Sumbanese languages derive from a sing le ancestral Austronesian language. However, the roo rtion of cognates (words with a common origin) traceable to Proto-Austronesian varies among langua ge sub-grous distributed across the island. When w e combine these results with genetic data, we found a ositive correlation between the ercentage of Y Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 144 chromosome lineages that derive from Austronesian ( as oosed to aboriginal) ancestors and the retenti on of Proto-Austronesian cognates. We also found a st riking correlation between the ercentage of Proto- Austronesian cognates and geograhic distance from the site where many Sumbanese believe that their ancestors arrived on the island. Thus, indeed, lang uage-gene-geograhy correlations can be established on a fine scale. Consequently, historical atterns of social interaction between exanding farmers and re sident hunter-gatherers largely exlain community-level la nguage evolution on Sumba. A second roject begins in noting that many studies have argued that reroductive skew biased towards dominant or high-ranking men is very common in huma n communities. Indeed, demograhic statistics collected over short time scales suort these clai ms. If this attern ersists, then reroductive ske w should roduce a genetic signal. As an illustration of a m odeling roject examining communities on a regional scale, our research grou osed the question: Are t hese differences are heritable and otentially subj ect to cultural selection? However, using our community ge netics based samling strategy and some new inferential techniques, we found that only 5 of 41 Indonesian communities showed any statistically significant dearture from neutrality. Thus, male d ominance seldom translates into increased fertility over dee timescales, and reroductive skew rarely has e volutionary significance. The discovery that neutral rocesses exlain most h alotye distributions in these communities aralle ls earlier results from the develoment of neutral the ory in genetics and ecology. In anthroology, the availability of community-level data enables us to distinguish both genetic and cultural selection fro m neutral demograhic rocesses. This first test of t he neutral theory in anthroology suggests that, as in genetics and ecology, the aroriate null model is neutrality. Challenges and Opportunities: Discreancies between genetic and linguistic differ entiation can arise through a number of rocesses: genetic admixture can occur without language change , languages can be transmitted horizontally without significant genetic change, and/or genetic and ling uistic evolution may roceed at heterogeneous rates . The challenge and the oortunity is to emloy an effec tive combination of aroaches to investigate the rocesses by which larger atterns such as human so ciality, language atterning and disease suscetibi lity emerge.

Ickes, Penn State University and Edward Parson, University of Michigan Research Goals: Economics rovides an excellent understanding of th e efficiency-enhancing otential of markets, but th e introduction of markets often also leads to a trans formation of a society's values, incentives, and institutions. We call this a market-induced transfo rmation. This roject aims to study how market-indu ced transformation can be included in and used to imro ve olicy analysis and the olicies it informs. Secifically, this roject seeks to: 1. Integrate and advance the understanding of market-i nduced transformations. We will examine how the otential for such transformations can lead to diff erent outcomes (some beneficial some erhas less so) than might be exected when considering only th e most narrowly defined efficiency-enhancing otential of markets. 2. Exloit this understanding by develoing a set of olicy analytic tools to comare and assess the effe cts of alternative olicies that seek to achieve their goals by fostering market-induced transformations. In articular, we will examine how consideration of ma rket-induced transformation might affect the aroriate design of olicies to reduce emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases. Thematic Areas: 1. In climate olicy otimal regulatory interventions are tyically back-loaded so that the costs of adjustment are minimized. Gradual regulation, howev er, introduces a time-inconsistency roblem - current olicymakers cannot bind their successors, and in subsequent eriods the argument for gradual adjustment will be renewed. We will study how marke t-induced transformations may alter the olicy environment. 2. There is currently vigorous debate over the aror iate design of olicy interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, the roer balance of standards, taxes, and trading systems. We will study how the consideration of market-induc ed transformations may affect the assessment of such olicy designs. Methodologies: This roject will address these questions with thre e interlaced research tasks: 1) examine case studie s of market-induced transformations initiated by ast o licies; 2) evaluate and modify as necessary several theoretical frameworks and their corresonding math ematical models that aim to cature the key feature s of such transformations; and 3) calibrate these mod els against the henomenology exressed in the case studies and use them to establish a decision tool s et for assessing and comaring olicies using marke t transformations against other ossible olicy aro aches.

Research Goals: 1. To examine how households in southern Chad reso nd to changes in roerty regimes, articularly the transition from communal land trusts and collectiv e ownershi to individual and rivate holding in th e context of a major oil and ieline roject. We ar e articularly interested in the imlications of changing land tenure systems for agricultural rod uction ractices and soil systems and are tracking soil quality; the introduction and use of fertiliz ers, esticides, and other technologies; the tyes of cros lanted and cro rotation; the amount of land farm ed; the length of fallow eriods; the distance of f ields from households; the distribution of land by tye of cro; and the gendered and age-related distribut ion of agricultural land and labor in the household. 2. To investigate how the loss of land and changes in agricultural roduction ractices and soil syste ms imact household food security. 3. To examine how food security in the context of c hanges in systems of land tenure and agricultural roduction ractices is related to atterns of hou sehold food consumtion and to the nutritional and health status of household members. 4. To rovide interdiscilinary training to young r esearchers from the US and Chad and to contribute t o the develoment of research caacity in Chad. Methodologies: At the core of the study are 120 households (comri sed of roughly 1,200 individuals) in three differen t localities that we have been following since 2001. The localities include a small village and a sub-re gional center in the oilfield region as well as a eri-urb an locality that has recently been annexed to the c aital city of N'Djamena. The localities were selected to allow for comarisons across settings that vary in terms of roximity to the oil and ieline roject; forms of household livelihood and levels of integration int o the cash economy; and access to health care facilities and institutions of governance. Throughout the year , fieldworkers are in regular contact with the househ olds and conduct household surveys on different to ics, including: 1. Cases of illness and household decision-making a round care 2. Household revenues and exenditures 3. Food security and coing strategies 4. Dietary diversity 5. Agricultural roduction ractices Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 148 6. Land loss and comensation received for the loss of roerty, its uses and management In addition to these household surveys, we use a di verse set of data collection methods that includes the anthroological techniques of articiant observati on and ethnograhic interviewing; and maing land use atterns; and anthro ometry. For instance, we interview local authoriti es about social transformations, conflicts, and the ev olution of custom and jurisrudence on family, ro erty, and entitlements through discussion of land claims brought to them. We have also maed and measured the land claimed by the households we follow and we are tracking soil fertility along with other information related to soil quality and conservatio n ractices in a sub-samle of the agricultural fie lds of village-based households. Recent Research Findings: Data from our dietary diversity surveys shows that diets are least diverse in the village locality and most diverse in the urban center. The small town occuie s an intermediate osition on this continuum. In addition, seasonal variation in diet and in the div ersity of the diet is most ronounced in the villag e locality and least variable in the urban center. Food consum tion atterns suggest that village households cons ume rimarily those foods they roduce, relying less he avily on the market than households in the small to wn or, most significantly, the urban center. While 50 ercent of the households we follow in the urban lo cality continue to cultivate fields on the outskirts of th e city or small gardens along the riverbank, all of these households sulement their own roduction with foo d urchased in the market. Across all of the sites, food security -- measured by indicators such as the number of meals served an d self- reorts of the adequacy of food sulies as well as the use of coing strategies -- varies from year t o year. Reorts of food security are highly sensitive to sh ifts in domestic roduction even though Chad relies in all years on food imorts in order to meet demand. Alth ough food shortages are common across all three sit es, households in the village, who grow their own food but also rely on the roduction and sale of stale cros for cash, are most likely to reort food shortfalls and more frequent use of coing strategies. Househ olds in the urban locality are least likely to reort short ages and rely less frequently on coing strategies. Common coing strategies including reducing the number of meals served, reducing the quantity of food served at meals, and eating 'famine foods' or foods that are not desirable but that are inexensive. The icture that emerges from this data is one of chronic hunger tha t is not however recognized under the sign of 'cris is.' The influx of cash into the village economy resulti ng from ayments made for land ceded to the oil comanies has so far had little imact in terms of these food consumtion atterns. However, it has ha d a major imact on the amount of land available to far mers, articularly in the village locality. More th an 80 ercent of the households we follow in the village have lost land or fruit-bearing trees to the oil co manies. This has led to more intensive land use ractices a nd the introduction of social ractices such as the leasing or the sale of land and the marking of land boundar ies - ractices that were reviously unknown in thi s region. Soil conservation techniques are not wides read, in art because the only commercial fertilize rs available are roduced and distributed by the cotto n comany for cotton roduction and in art because of the lack of ox-carts or other means of transorting large quantities of organic material to the fields . Laboratory analyses currently underway of soil sam les gathered during the summer of 2007 will allow f or a more comlete icture of the health of the soils and rovide a baseline against which to track the i mact of more intensive farming ractices. Challenges and Opportunities: Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 149 We face methodological and temoral challenges. The se flow from the fact that our aims are organized thematically and chronologically. We imagined a suc cession of events corresonding to different discilinary interests. In ractice, the transition in all sectors of social life and the economy is o ccurring nearly simultaneously and not in succession. This r equires sustained and concurrent attention from all the collaborators, giving us little time to reconcile i nterests, methods and directions. This will be deal t with over time as team members adat to one another's di scilinary requirements. In terms of oortunities, we highlight our success in integrating student resear ch and learning into this roject. We have sonsore d two undergraduates through an REU sulement, and multi le graduate students from the US and Chad. In addition, we have rovided annual training to our C hadian research team which has emhasized the imortance of an interdiscilinary aroach to the study of social change.

Levin, Vanderbilt University Co-PIs: Megan Saylor, and children's' beliefs about the caabilities of humans, comuters, and robots 2. Secify behavioral differences in interactions with intentional vs. mechanical audiences, and abo ut how different audiences might interret behavior. 3. Exlore how basic kinematic roerties, and mo re abstract roerties of human action might be segmented, and ultimately identified by a machine v ision system. Thematic Areas: 1. Concets and Theory of Mind 2. Human-Comuter, and Human-Robot interaction 3. Machine vision Methodologies: We have emloyed a range of behavioral methodologie s to meet goals 1 and 2. These have included illustrated questionnaire studies to assess concet s about different kinds of intelligent system. Thes e questionnaires not only ask about subjects' beliefs about these systems, but also ask them to make con crete redictions about their actions. We have also asked subjects to segment actions (e.g. give a resonse when one meaningful action begins and another ends), and have measured their movements when engaging in actions characteristic of face-to-face teaching by demonstration. To ask about the emergence of these beliefs we have also used develomental interview t echniques to understand how reschoolers construe different kinds of intelligent artifact. In additio n, we have alied machine vision techniques, and m otion analysis to movement data acquired by a hand tracki ng system, and via video. Recent Research Findings: We have found that adults make fundamentally differ ent redictions about the behavior of comuters and eole, and initially, at least, equate anthroomor hic robots with comuters. However, if they are re quired to focus on a robot engaging in a series of intenti onal-aearing behaviors, subjects begin to differe ntiate robots and comuters. In studying the develoment o f this kind of belief, we have found that reschool ers initially emloy a hybrid concetual model for cate gory-defying robots by assuming that robots have ma ny mechanical features on the one hand, but that they also have sychological and biological features as well. Then, they transition to a more mutually exclusive model. We have also comleted initial exeriments testing the effects of viewing videos, and of direc t interaction on children's concets, and have these concets resis tant to change by these simle exeriences as child ren age. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 152 In exeriments testing subjects' assumtions about comuters' ercetion of action, we have observed t hat they resume that comuters rocess action in small er, more concrete chunks, and that this effect is redicted by individual differences in ratings of c omuters' ability to understand the goals of human action, indeendently of their beliefs about comuter intel ligence overall. Finally, in exeriments exloring the relationshis among kinematic features, rated events, and event segments, we have found that both rated looking, an d rated hand-to-object contact are strong redictor s of breakoints. In addition we have coded a series of kinematic features, and have observed that some of these redict breakoints, but that the strength of this rediction is more modest. Challenges and Opportunities: This research can inform the develoment of new int eractive technologies by heling us understand the concets eole use when considering the caabiliti es of such systems. A key challenge is to integrate these behavioral findings into models of imitation learning.

Laboratory Exeriments 2. Post-Disaster Surveys 3. Elite Interviews 4. Content Analysis Recent Research Findings 1. An evaluation of the usability of a new Official's Guide for Hurricane Evacuation Decision Making involved 113 research articiants who read the Official's Guide , took a 43 item Hurricane Knowledge Test (HKT ), and erformed a hurricane tracking task. There w as only a moderate level of erformance on the HKT (M = 26.8; Md = 28.0) and substantial variance in erformance ( SD = 6.6, with a range from 9-40 items correct). 2. Analyses of tsunami hazard management lan quali ty in 43 Pacific Northwest coastal counties show that most lans have a weak factual basis, unclear goals and objectives, weak olicies, and few coordination and imlementation mechanisms. The ave rage lan quality score is 12.25 out of 50 oints and ten counties never mentioned tsunami risks in t heir local lans at all.

Content analysis revealed local newsaers in Pa cific Northwest coastal jurisdictions showed a significant sike in Indian Ocean tsunami coverage but there was no corresonding increase in discussions of emergency management toics in city council minutes during this eriod. Challenges and Opportunities 1. The evaluation of the Official's Guide is being followed u with analysis of data from a hurricane tracking task and an assessment of local officials' mental models of hurricane evacuation. 2. The evaluation of lan quality revealed nonsignific ant correlations with jurisdictional characteristic s such as budget size, so a survey will be conducted to collect data on lanning deartments' use of different lanning tools, organizational caacity a nd commitment, technical resources, data sources, and contacts with other agencies and community grou s.

Proposal #: SES 0624256 HSD Dynamics Of IRI, Alexander Pfa ff Collaborators: NGO Forum for Water and Sanitation, Bangladesh Research Goals: 1) (DHB ) Theory: Determine what allocation of decision-mak ing authority maximizes social welfare in a roblem of roviding a local ublic good. We will: (i) Comare outcomes when a central organization, such as a NGO, government or rivate firm, makes all decisions and when the community which wi ll be using the ublic good makes all decisions in a dynamic model of interaction between individual agents. Outcomes will include social welfare, access to the ublic good, costs of access. We will examine central organizations with different objective functions. (ii) Determine what allocation of decision-making author ity maximizes social welfare. (iii)Determine how the welfare-maximizing allocatio n of decision-making authority and outcomes in the two cases in (i) deend on individual and av erage attributes of social networks, individual and average community wealth, wealth inequality, an d size of community. 2) (DHB, AOC ) Emirical: Collect original data generated by an organizational exeriment to test and revise the theory and distill olicy imlications. In the emirical context, the organizational change which we will observe will be due to a natural disa ster; the natural occurrence of high concentrations of arsenic in groundwater in Bangladesh. We will: (i) Conduct an organizational exeriment in which we ch oose randomly which village receives one of three tyes of interventions to rovide access t o safe water and which is in a control grou in which no intervention occurs. The interventions wil l corresond to organizational forms we study in the theoretical model. (ii) Determine which intervention yields the best averag e outcome. Determine for which tyes of communities each intervention is best by examining how the outcomes of each intervention vary with characteristics of social networks, distr ibution of wealth, and size of village. (iii)Use the control grou to study communities in which collective action occurs in the absence of any intervention, i.e. determine the attributes of communities which solve the ublic good rovision roblem on their own. Thematic Areas: 1. Dynamics of human behavior 2. Agents of change Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 158 Methodologies: 1. Dynamic models of interaction between individual agents whose behavior has stochastic elements and who are laced on a grah which models social netw orks. Solution methods include analytical methods as well as simulation. 2. Household surveys which collect new data. 3. Econometric analysis of data. Recent Research Findings: 1. We have been determining the ros and cons of di fferent models for our analysis before roceeding further with one articular model. Thus far, we ha ve a very reliminary result regarding the effect o f the size of grou of agents on whether or not agen ts articiate in a collective action to rovide a local ublic good. The decision which agents make is whe ther or not to contribute money to build a well. If a well is built, everyone in the grou can use it, e ven those who did not contribute. The effect of gro u size on the robability of contributing seems to b e non-linear. The robability of articiation seem s to decrease with the number of agents, as is the case in most existing literature. However, this relatio nshi only holds u to a certain size of the grou. Then it reverses and the robability of articiation increases with the number of agents. The result re quires further work to determine its sensitivity to assumtions. 2. We have comleted the groundwork for the emiri cal work. We have collected data on basic characteristics of the samle villages. In all the samle villages at least 70% of wells have unsafe levels of arsenic, therefore there should be considerable demand for safe water. We have re-tested a subsamle of the wells for arsenic in order to che ck the accuracy of the testing rogram which reced ed our roject. We have determined the otential sour ces of safe water in the samle villages. Finally, we have comleted a ilot baseline survey and finaliz ed the questionnaire. The baseline survey of all 10,000 households will begin on Setember 8, 2007. Challenges and Opportunities: 1. Develoing a modeling framework which rovides a s general an environment as ossible for the interaction between agent decisions and factors wh ich are likely to affect articiation in a collect ive action and at the same time allows us to solve the model has been a challenge. 2. Another challenge has been resolving tensions be tween constructing an exeriment in the field which yields high quality research results and our artn er develoment organization's objectives, methods a nd cultural attitudes. 3. In the rocess of develoing the models of commu nity articiation which we will test in the field, we will conduct a worksho to bring together the exe rtise and oinions of academics and develoment workers in Bangladesh. This worksho will rovide an oortunity for sharing information and extracting lessons regarding successful olicies e ven before the roject yields any results in an are a in which information is rarely shared. 4.

To this extent, the research aims to: (1) develo a n agent-based architecture that will assess coordin ation erformance outcomes of a variety of organizational designs through its focus on decision making and information sharing in a highly comlex context wit h mixed organizational interests; and (2) develo analytic models to redict the effects of coordinat ion-enhancing organizational designs on relief su ly chain erformance. Thematic Areas: 1. Inter-organizational coordination 2. Recognition Primed Decision Making 3. Relief suly chain erformance Methodologies: Qualitative, simulation and modeling methods are us ed. Qualitative data gathered in the rocess of comarative case study research of coordination bod ies is used to rovide contextual information for t he simulated decision making in the agent architecture . To date four coordination bodies, namely ECB4, NetHoe, Humaninet and the UN Office for the Coordi nation of Humanitarian Affairs have been successfully recruited for the study and over 20 in terviews have been conducted. The qualitative data also rovides contextual information to guide the modeli ng of suly chain erformance. To date the case st udy research is comaring coordination bodies that diff er on characteristics such as funding mechanisms, number of members, and the centrality of disaster r elief to their mission. In- deth interviews with a nd observations of staff and members have rovided ric h data on the rocess, context and criteria for dec ision making. Data gathered from interviews will be sul emented by content analyses of organizational chart s, meeting minutes, memos, ress releases, and olicy documents. Recent Research Findings: Our case study research has found that decision mak ing in the context of inter-organizational coordina tion in voluntary organizations is articiative and inv olves little controversy. It aears this is the re sult of four Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 161 factors: olicies that encourage members to define otential rojects which results in controversial rojects being avoided, olicies that allow members to arti ciate only in those activities in which they have interest, a general degree of homogeneity among tho se engaged based artly on the freedom to choose an d the relatively small size of the organization, and that members have develoed trusting relationshis over the years. These circumstances enable the coordinat ion bodies to actually carry out rojects, however rojects that would address more contentious inform ation sharing issues are not undertaken. These findings rovide the basis for extension of t he RPD-based agent architecture to include factors such as interersonal trust in the decision making simul ations. Further the case study reliminary findings suggest that the agent architecture may be a valuab le tool that through exerimentation can hel the organizations find designs to facilitate tackling d ifficult issues. In the domain of ICTs difficult is sues are those related to systems aimed at information shari ng, rather than those to simly rovide access. Whi le access can hel imrove the flow of information thr ough the suly chain, it is likely that real imrovements will require information sharing.

Makse, Levich Institute and Physics Dea rtment, City College of New York Co-PIs: Michael Batty (Centre for Advanced Satial Analysi s, University College London), Fredrik Liljeros (Deartment of Sociology, Univers ity of Stockholm), Shlomo Havlin (Bar-Ilan University, Israel) Research Goals: 1. to rovide a classification of social networks b ased on the self-similar measure 2. to understand the modular structure in societies and its influence on immunization rocesses in soc ial networks 3. to develo an understanding of the dynamical law s of evolution of large-scale social networks 4. to unravel universal laws for comlex networks f rom sociology to biology to technology Thematic Areas: 1. social networks 2. self-similar concets 3. modularity and communities Methodologies: In general, statistical hysics methods are alied , which in articular includes the box-covering fra ctal technique and inferred methods. The basis of our r oject lies on the analysis of real-life large-scale social databases, whose accuracy is of fundamental imorta nce. Recent Research Findings: 1. Networks Classification We have comleted a thorough scan for fractal and s elf-similar roerties over a large number of social networks, as well as of networks from varyin g discilines for comarison uroses. We have used our box-covering techniques (described in deta il in Song, Havlin, Makse, Nature 433 , 392 (2005)), where we measure the number of boxes NB of size lB needed to otimally cover a network. The boxes reresents communities and modules in the network structure as exemlified in Fig.1(a). The fractal exonent fractality and the organiz ation of the communities in the network, but it can still not cature all the s tructural network roerties. Our basic hyothesis is that correlations in node connectivity lay the det ermining role in the evolution of the system. Therefore, we have develo an analytical theory to investigate such correlations (Gallos, Song, Makse, submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett. ). We were able to classify all network in a novel hase diagram, which is searated into three regimes by t he limiting cases of random networks and fractal to non-fractal transition. Most social networks are characterized by strongly correlated hubs. This is akin to a ``rich club henomenon'' where the highly connected individuals form a core in the center of the network. The reasons behind this behavior ar e still intriguing us and we are currently working on this asect. The imortance of these cor relations in the network structure is highlighted in imortant alications, such as the imlications for the efficiency of immunization rocess on Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 163 social networks, as well as for the time evolution of such networks. Our current studies indicate that immunization strategies are highly affected b y this kind of toological structure. 2. Modularity One of the most imortant features of social networ ks is their modular character. We have develoed a new method of characterizing modules in such networks, based on our box-covering fractal technique (see Fig.1(a)). In this way, we a re able to study the emergence of clustering in different scales, which in a society may successive ly reresent families, neighborhoods, cities, counties, states, etc. Our striking finding is that the modular character is retained over these different observation scales in a self-similar way. This attern may be used to exlain how societies are hierarchically formed in a bottom-u aroach. The form and stability of this structure has imortant imlications in fields of extreme ractic al interest, such as in immunization strategies, information flow, rumor sreading and many more dyn amical rocesses in the society. We are studying the exact contribution of the social organ ization and the modular structure to these alications. 3. Analysis of online communities Using the Swedish online community database we have started to analyze members interactions and interests, such as for examle the grous in which the subjects articiate. By using the number of common grous where two subjects articiate, we ca n derive a measure for the strength of a ossible relation. This quantity reresents the `we ight' of relations in a social network. Consecutively adding the connections with strong re lations, grous of friends emerge. On the other hand, by adding those edges with weakest weights, w ide sanning networks emerge which can be related to the Granovetter hyothesis that week tie s connect the grous, while subjects within a grou are connected by stronger ties. These findin gs are comared to the information obtained by the 'favorites' list, where a member declares which eole he/she considers to be friends in the online community. The idea is to quantify a measur ement of the social ressure, which means that although the network is changing from time to time the underlying social structure may remain strongly conserved over time. 4. Cities One of the fundamental results in urban develoment is the so-called Gibrat's Law, which states that the rate growth of a city is random and is indeend ent of the city size. Our study of the existing data, though, seems to suggest a different icture. Smaller cities tend to grow in a faster rate than larger cities, while the variance of these growth r ates follow the same trend. This shows that smaller oulations may grow faster, but at the same time t hey are at a greater risk to shrink in size equally fast. We are currently studying different areas of different oulations around the world in order to understand the extent of this henomenon and whethe r it alies equally in develoed or develoing countries. Our mathematical aroach is based on fractal growing algorithms which identify cities in coterminous geograhical saces; one such an examle is in Fig.1(b) where we have identified the fractal human agglomeration sur rounding the city of London (New Laws of Poulation Growth, J. S. Andrade, D. Rybski, M. Ba tty, H. E. Stanley and H. A. Makse, submitted to Nature ). Challenges and Opportunities: It is widely believed that the comlex structure of social networks arises from the collective emergen t roerties of the large number of individuals and t heir interactions. Desite the rogress of analysis based Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 164 on small-scale data, the circuitry of social connec tions is so comlex that the study of small grous may not suffice in exlaining many emerging roerties of t he system as a whole. Recently, the introduction of statistical hysics methods combined with advances in database technology has shed new light on the analysis of large-scale social networks. It is the urose of this roject to bring together concets from the science of comlexity and nonequilibrium systems in to the science of social networks. By unraveling ne w architectural laws in the construction of these net works we aim to rovide a fundamental view of the evolution of these systems.

Thematic Areas: 1. Physical sensing of individual and crowd moveme nt 2. Goal-directed navigation in interactive virtual environments 3. Mathematical modeling of crowd dynamics Methodologies: Our roject brings together researchers from the co mutational science, mathematical modeling, and cognitive science in order to study the individual and collective use of sace. The roject has develo ed tools for caturing and rocessing data that can be used for comarison with analytic models, to yield an understanding of the link between human collective behavior at different temoral and satial scales. Our work is focused on the California Science Center wh ich has allowed us to observe, record, and analyze natural crowd behavior. Recent Research Findings: We have systematically imroved our human osition data collection methods after studying the ilot l aser and video data recorded in the California Science C enter's Life Tunnel exhibit. We have collected seve ral tens of hours of data from synchronized lasers at f rame rates an order of magnitude higher than before . The result is a reository of several gigabytes of rang e-scan data from real-time human satial activity t hat we believe to be the first of its sort. In order to wo rk with this magnitude of data we have develoed ne w software that allows for interactive annotation, ca libration and editing. Playback at multile timesca les has allowed for detection and correction of a variety o f counting errors, which has surred us to simultan eously collect (and subsequently annotate) video data. We have identified key factors associated with visu al ercetion and memory that seem to strongly influence individual satial behavior in geometrica lly comlex, oulated environments. These factors were identified from ilot exeriments on a novel s atial search task that we designed with the dual objectives of (i) making both the geometric roert ies of the sace as well as the number, distributio n and hysical attributes of the eole in the sace exl icitly relevant to erformance, while (ii) enabling a rinciled microscoic characterization of each sub ject's behavior. Our exerimental latform is a rea listic virtual model of the ground floor of the California Science Center oulated with natural-looking arti ficial Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 166 agents. Desite a variety of technical challenges f rom using naturalistic stimuli and lacing minimal constraints on subject's behavior, data from our in itial exeriments confirmed that the task and exerimental latform satisfactorily met the above objectives. Analysis of the data revealed that atte ntion biases roduced by the resence of agents in the en vironment lay a surrisingly imortant role in influencing navigation decisions. Last year we develoed a mathematical model to stu dy dynamics of visitors to the Life Tunnel exhibit. In the model, each exhibit dislay is a node, connecte d to other dislays (nodes) by links over which the museum visitors move. The simle henomenological m odel we investigated last year described the collective dynamics of a homogeneous grou of museu m visitors as they move through the exhibit. Unfortunately, the model's redictions did not matc h exerimental observations, e.g., it could not ex lain fluctuations observed in exerimental data. We made two significant changes to the model this year. Fi rst, we used the emirical data to guide model selection . We measured real-life movement of visitors betwee n dislays using the methodology described above and left only the links that had significant visitor tr affic along them. Second, we modeled visitor heterogeneit y by introducing a stochastic term in the transitio ns between the dislays. These changes led to a better agreement between the model and exerimental data. Challenges and Opportunities: In the sensing art of the roject, the suitable cl ustering and tracking algorithms run far slower tha n real- time, and rocessing our reository is a comutatio nal challenge. We will imrove these methods in the coming year. We are also designing exeriments to e xand on these initial observations of the visitors behavior in virtual environments and will exlore m athematical models of correlated grous of visitors who exlore the museum together.

May, University of Washington Co-PIs: Bryan D. Jones, University of Washington Collaborators: WilliamWallace, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Research Goals: Enhance understanding of: 1. The coherence of federal homeland security and risk management olicies. 2. The factors that shae organizational caabilities to resond to multile risks. 3. The dynamics of organizational resonse for risk ma nagement. Thematic Areas: 1. Policy rocesses: setting Bureaucratic decision-making: to disrut ion olicy signals. 3. Systems modeling: modeling of organizational reso nse to disrutions. Methodologies: Several datasets are being develoed tracing th imacts of olicy disrution on decision-making f or ublic risks. One set of data concerns the agenda of federal disaster agencies from 1984 through mid 2006. This has entailed collection and coding of rules an d guidance documents issued by FEMA and DHS. A second set of data concerns the shifting federal ag enda from 1988 through 2004 for eight olicy system s that comrise major comonents of what is currently labeled as homeland security. For each subsystem we are collecting data from congressional hearings, u blic testimony, and ublic laws about changing issu e emhasis, olicy justifications, and subsystem make u. The rimary educational comonent of the roje ct has been the offering of an advanced undergraduate seminar on \"The Politics of Risk.\" Recent Research Findings: One set of findings concerns organizational attenti on shifts regarding disaster rearedness and domes tic security. Any organization and esecially ublic a gencies are confronted with a lethora of cometing agency demands. We develo a theory of organizatio nal resonses to major olicy disrutions and aly it to the way that disaster agencies resonded to new olicy signals about terrorism threats over the as t decade. The agency-level resonse to residential and congressional initiatives concerning terrorism in the mid 1990s was a bureaucratization of the roblem th at tended to damen the olicy signals. In contras t, after 9/11 the centralization of attention within t he to-levels of DHS to the terrorism threat and re liance on hastily devised grant rograms led to a number of n egative consequences for agency functioning: oscillation in grant rograms, oor relations with intergovernmental artners, and meddling from above . As a consequence, we argue a aradox of attention w as fostered. In seeking to focus attention on terr orism, the broader homeland security agenda suffered. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 168 The second broad set of findings, which is just eme rging, concerns the shifting dynamics of subsystems that address rearedness for and resonse to ubli c risks surrounding disasters, terrorism, and other extreme events. Our research foci are the olicy d isrutions across the various subsystems that have been brought about by terrorism and how efforts to resha e the federal-level arrangements for homeland secu rity have altered the makeu of these subsystems. Our reliminary findings show that the terrorism disrut ion began in some subsystems in the mid-1990s as they b egan to attend more to the terrorism threat and, no t surrisingly, was heightened and exanded after 9/1 1. That disrution, however, layed out in differe nt ways for the subsystems we study. While the DHS ha s had an imrint within several of the subsystems, the original subsystems for the most art remain st rong and the olicy glue of homeland security has s erved as weak organizational device.

Terrence McCabe, University of Colorado at Bo ulder Co-PIs: Abe Goldman, Mike Binford and Brian Child, Univer sity of Florida; Paul Leslie, University of North Carolina - Chael Hill; Collaborators: University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; University Centre; Botswana Wildlife & Natural Resources Deartment Research Goals: 1. To examine the ways in which arks act as agents of change in eastern and southern Africa. 2. To establish the tyes and hases of resonse by local households and communities to the constraint s and oortunities associated with arks and the re lationshis among resonses. 3. To clarify how resonses to costs and benefits, constraints and oortunities associated with arks contribute to transformation of local social-ecolo gical systems (SES) and whether and how they create the conditions for more widesread transformations . 4. To establish the range of differing resonses an d imacts of arks across varying ecological, demograhic, and olicy contexts in different coun tries and identify the factors that lie behind thes e variations. Thematic Areas: 1. A focus on human agency and process as central to understanding a social-ecological sy stem (SES), both by considering the ercetions and decision ma king that drive action, and by considering the consequences of that agency for the SES, which incl udes the ark and surrounding areas. We take agency to comrise actions that imlement decisions by ind ividuals and social entities such as families and communities. This imlies a need to understand the ercetions and decision making rocesses that inf orm and roduce those actions. 2. An examination of the dynamic rocesses by which arks reciitate and accelerate transformation of social-ecological systems under diverse circumstanc es. We exect that the imacts of arks rogress through a series of stages. In these phases of response, we exect that early resonse entails a eriod of accommodation followed by a hase of adaptation . The first hase is short term with little in the way of longer-term imlications. The second hase is likel y to entail new adative behaviors, strategies, soc ial ractices, and/or institutions. The third hase may result in a significant system transformation and reorganization as further changes are induced in both the social and biohysical realms of the SES. This may roduce a new set of relatively stable conditio ns in the immediately affected areas. In the fourth hase, the imacts radiate outward as the direct effects o f the ark diffuse and indirectly affect more dista nt areas. 3. Consideration of response diversity -- individual- and community- level heterogeneity in resonses to may have imortant longe r term imlications for system resilience. 4. Consideration of actions at multiple levels , which may sometimes have oosing objectives and consequences. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 170 Methodologies: 1. Focus grou discussions, oen-ended interviews, and articiatory maing; 2. Household surveys; 3. Analysis of decision-making and distribution of benefits; 4. Time series analysis of land use, land-cover cha nge, and landscae fragmentation analysis. Recent Research Findings: Our results are very reliminary at this stage of t he research, having recently comleted only one fie ld season of research. However we can reort that data collected so far suggest that many of our hyothes es may be suorted. These hyotheses include: 1. The effect of arks on transforming land use is determined by the interaction between the relative value of alternative uses of resources and the influence of ower relationshis on the distribution of bene fits. 2. Parks attract roads and secial interest grous , which influence atterns of settlement and instit utional organization, and increase land and social conflic ts. 3. Resonses to arks are mediated by ercetions of risk and by local mistrust of institutional owe r and intent. 4. Resonse diversity within and among communities is directly related to the variability of erceive d severity of risks (variability measured within or among communities). 5. Parks have a differential imact on men and wom en, and on elite and non-elite grous, generally increasing differentiation. 6. Parks in landscaes characterized by high oul ation density (and agricultural saturation) will be less likely to reciitate raid transformations in liv elihood strategies than those where oulation dens ity is lower We do not have enough data at this time to address hyotheses that relate to resilience or identity of the social and ecological systems in the areas with ro ximity to arks. Challenges and Opportunities: Working in five countries and dealing with the vary ing conditions, regulations, and systems of ermiss ions in the host countries confronts us with multile ch allenges as well as oortunities. We are also fac ed with coordinating research activities and ersonnel from different universities in the US and overseas. We believe that we have the oortunity to make a uniq ue and imortant contribution to the literature as no one else, to our knowledge, is undertaking the tye of comarative work we are doing on the imacts of ar ks. We also have the oortunity to involve researchers and olicy makers from the host countries who may influence the ways that arks and rotected areas a re managed and how the resources and hazards associated with them are distributed.

Thematic Areas: Research Questions National Scale : (1) What energy flow atterns would yield significa ntly imroved energy system erformance? What oerational roduction and/or transortation change s need to be made to realize these imrovements? (2) What infrastructure weaknesses exist? How do th e effects of catastrohic events roagate through the network? What infrastructure enhancements would rea lize the most erformance benefit? (3) How do national environmental constraints influ ence system erformance? Regional Scale (e.g., ISO-NE, MISO, PJM, NYISO, CAI SO): (4) What is the influence of market design on energ y system erformance? Local Scale (e.g., Alliant, MidAmerican Energy): (5) Can we reflect the influence of ossible change s in raw fuel roduction and transortation on a comany's rofits from investing of lant at a secific location? Methodology: Two Complementary Modeling Approaches As detailed at our NSF HSD Project Homeage (see above), we have develoed two comlementary a nd related classes of decision models, a structural mo del and an agent-based behavioral model, to address the above research questions. Inut data to the structural model includes toolog y (nodes, arcs), suly and demand at gas and coal suly oints and electric demand oints er unit e nergy flow cost along each arc, and arc caacities and efficiencies, all at each time t. Aggregated toologies are then used to reresen t the national US energy system. The model is solved as a generalized networ k simlex algorithm. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 172 The behavioral model is an agent-based comutationa l test bed (Java) for studying the commercial network layer overlaying the NEES hysical transmis sion network layer. To date the test bed incororates market rotocols and oerational rules for ISO/RTO-managed wholesale ower markets oerating over AC transmission grids, with a secif ic focus on the ISO-NE and MISO. Human decision- makers are comutationally reresented as autonomou s agents with learning caabilities and goal- seeking behaviors. Version 1.3 of this test bed ha s been released at htt://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/AMESMarketHome .htm as oen-source software. Recent Research Findings Structural Model } We have comared simulated energy rices from our m odel to actual energy rices based on the events of 2005 that occurred in the US, which included hur ricanes Katrina and Rita. An interesting result is that the imact of Katrina and Rita in terms of addition al energy costs is estimated to have been about $10 .5 billion from Setember to December 2005. We have also develoed a comutational aroach for assessing bulk investment in energy system transortation infrastructure that indicates the tr ansortation links for which it would be most economically attractive to invest. For examle, usi ng a \"reduced cost\" metric, equivalent to rofit e r unit energy flow, it was found that the more rofit able investments in the natural gas infrastructure are from Canada to the northeast and to the west, and f rom the southeast to the northeast. The more rofitable investments in the electric infrastructu re were found to be into the northeast. To account for uncertainty, we have alied stochas tic rogramming. Our initial effort has focused on the cost of natural gas due to its volatility over the one-year time horizon of the test data set and in anticiation of extending the behavioral model to i ncororate the natural gas market. When aggregate otimization results were comared with historical fuel usage, the deterministic solution had a higher roortion of electricity generated from coal rathe r than gas, but the solution to the stochastic mode l showed a fuel mix closer to actual exerience. Agent-Based Behavioral Model Our initial focus has been on the otential market inefficiency and exercise of market ower that can arise in restructured wholesale ower markets due t o strategic trader learning, as induced or encourag ed by various market design features. Initial exeriments with 3-node, 5-node, and 30-nod e test cases taken from ISO/RTO training manuals and IEEE sources indicate that current ISO/RTO-mana ged market designs in oeration in the U.S. encourage strategic suly offer reorting by gener ators that results in substantially higher market oerational costs. These oortunities for the exercise of market owe r are quickly discovered over time by generators relying on simle reinforcement learning methods th at use ast own-rofit outcomes to determine future suly offer selections for the Day-Ahead Market. Challenges and Opportunities The structural and agent-based behavioral models st ill need to be linked within a single NEES software design ermitting the assing of results back and f orth between them. We also lan to further suort this unified NEES s oftware design by an organizational study of the energy industry that will deict information flows in the overall energy system. We are articularly interested in the strategies NEES articiants use to handle risk and uncertainty, and the effects of ownershi structure on their decision-making. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 173 Project Title: Origins and Develoment of Tribal Social Identities and Territorial Behaviors in Ancient Southern Arabia Proposal #: 0624368 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Joy McCorriston, Ohio State University Co-PIs: (France); Eric Oches, University of South Florida Research Goals: 1. To document and explain the long-term social dyn amics in the emergence of territorial tribal social groups and their political integration into state societies. Historical evidence across the Near East\u2014from the earliest written tradition to the Mon gols of mediaeval history\u2014suggests that tribal soci al identity is linked with hysical territory and soci al systems that ma onto hysical terrain. Archaeol ogy offers a unique ersective on tribal dynamics beca use the ersective is long-term and deals with the material culture of tribes eole themselves rather than the texts that others write about them. This roject will document the territorial manifestations of tri bal identity through a long time-frame (about 7000 years) and will exlain the dynamics of tribal behavior as affected by major climate and olitical changes. 2. To refine the uses of remotely sensed imagery in the analysis of ancient human landscape dynamics. Although satellite images record a static moment i n time and the technologies to do so are ever better, landscaes are dynamic and imbued with soci al meaning and history that both affects the hysic al terrain and the ways that societies erceive and in teract with it. These histories and human behaviors remain challenging to detect. This research collabo ration involving social, hysical and statistical s cientists will integrate temoral and subjective asects of l andscae in the interretation of remotely sensed i mages of the resent-day hysical terrain and archaeologi cal monuments left by territorial tribes eole in antiquity. Thematic Areas: 1. Anthroological archaeology, including human beh avioral ecology, social theory, culture history, an d olitical economy 2. Satial statistics and machine learning 3. Geodetic sciences, esecially high-recision GPS , remote (aerial) sensing, Digital Elevation Modeli ng (DEM) 4. Arabia Methodologies: The roject deends on the interlay of US-based an alysis of remotely sensed images of Southern Arabia and the ground-truth work of field teams that will visit remote areas of the Arabian deserts to collec t archaeological data and ground control oints. We a re building on rior knowledge collected both by NS F- funded members of this team over 9 years of fieldwo rk in Yemen and through collaboration with French archaeologists. We use ilot data to (i) Locate the exact locations of small-scale archaeological monu ments (\"cairns\") on a remote-sensed image and (ii) Identi fy signature attributes on the image that may ossi bly characterize these monuments. These monuments were built in antiquity by tribes-eole to mark their Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 174 territories and their social associations with each other and with available resources and terrain. Ov er the ages, nomadic astoral eole built such monuments in different styles that can be differentiated by s hae, height, size, and on the ground, details of constru ction and associated artifacts. These differences corresond to cultural and temoral differences. We hyothesize that satial atterns\u2014whether associat ion with distribu tions of articular \"cairn\" tyes\u2014can be in related to social behavior (territories) and interreted in te rms of the major olitical and climate shifts known to take lace in rehistory. This year we have used ilot data from the 2005 fie ldwork and revious archaeological survey in Southe rn Yemen to develo a localized understanding of the l and cover and monument distributions detectable on satellite images. We have used an ASTER based (DEM) (5 m) and high resolution image (0.6 m ixel) on which the monuments visited can be seen and verifie d through GPS coordinates taken in the field. We ha ve overseen the develoment of new \"unsuervised\" imag e classification techniques, using smoothing of two data sets (DEM and RGB) on image ixels. We smoothe d the RGB raster data of the actual image by Fourier Transform and alying a low-ass filter. W e identified feature clusters in 2-D and 3-D lots and noted that the data is mainly searated in one dire ction, by DEM, with a distinct number of divisions between clusters, denoted by several ronounced ea ks of varying heights. The evident atterns may lea d us to redict how many classes to exect when this technique is alied in an unknown area and a new image. Recent Research Findings: From revious ground observations, we anticiate th at aroriately classified landforms will increase efficiency of cairn detection and contribute to mod els of human activity. Recently, we have added elev ation and infrared band combinations and moved to a suer vised context. This aroach has yielded a 10% to 15% increase in accuracy (uwards of 75-78%) over t he initial unsuervised RGB clustering When training classes sidering within-class variation has roven extremel y critical. Our consultations confirm the value of fr equent dialogue because archaeological and geologic al knowledge defines which features, arameter values, scales, and classes are aroriate for detecting cairns or segmenting landforms. Challenges and Opportunities: The Middle East is as geo-olitically troubled as w hen we wrote our roosal. We have already made several tris to roose our roject and engage loc al scholars and students in Yemen, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. This engagement will continue with fieldwor k. Never has it been more imortant and more difficult for American scientists to remain engaged in cultural and scientific rojects in the Middle East. We anticiate challenges in security and logistics as we organize our fieldwork for winter 2008. We ha ve already received written assurances from both Oman and Yemen that the research ermits will be issued, and we have substantial exressions of interest fro m Saudi scholars and authorities. We also anticiate analytical challenges in develo ing software) for monument auto-detection, and ther e will be uncertainties about the reservation of the archaeological record\u2014what roortion of the extan t monuments have we detected and what roortion has been destroyed by subsequent natural and human events, so that the original monuments are undetect able? Finally, the fieldwork logistics of working i n some of the world's most remote deserts offer both challenges (equiment failure, transort, security) and oortunities (extension of technologies to unchart ed regions).

Previous research of judicial systems has faced a t rade-off between large scale quantitative inquiries focused on readily-counted behaviors and smaller st udies that allow closer examination of legal texts. This roject will aly automated content analysis techniques to the study of the US Sureme Court, thereby otentially obtaining \"the best of both wor lds\". 2. By viewing the legal system as an intricate and com lex web of communication, this roject aims to better understand the role and influences of variou s actors through analysis of written records. Those records include, for examle, briefs written by lit igants and other stakeholders and oinions written by judges and justices. This goal will be accomlished by drawing uon methods from comutational linguistics and information retrieval, couled with visualization techniques. 3. To suort research, we will comile, organize, and annotate a large collection of legal documents associated with cases heard by the US Sureme Court over the last half-century. Thematic Areas: A key art of our roject is the creation of a free , ublicly-accessible, online \"United States Surem e Court Text Collection\" (SCTC). This collection will consi st of all available Sureme Court of the United Sta tes (SCOTUS) oinions (~12,000), briefs (~41,000), and or al argument transcrits (~8000) from all SCOTUS cases from the beginning of the Warren Court (1953) to resent. We are designing our database to allow for (1) instant batch downloading of all queried docume nts (2) in a variety of formats (3) with full contr ol over the inclusion or exclusion (and location) of such t hings as headings, footnotes, and citations and (4) the ability to associate available metadata to the text content in a variety of ways, such as tagged and i mbedded within the document files themselves or in searate files with unique identifiers to link them. While the immediate reason for creating the collection in thi s manner is to enable raid document acquisition, formatting, and re-rocessing for the array of ana lyses we will conduct in the roject, we anticiate that the collection will imact legal research more broa dly by enabling and encouraging other judicial scho lars to incororate digital text rocessing technologies into their research. Methodologies: We are taking a three-ronged aroach to accomlis hing our research goals: 1. Database and other infrastructure develoment to r ovide a foundation for subsequent work. 2. Alication of automated text rocessing algorithms to analyze collections and extract relevant featur es for human analysis. 3. Visualization of system outut to facilitate raid human comrehension of content analysis algorithms. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 176 Recent Research Findings: We have been exloring the roblem of visualizing \" influence\" within a text collection --- more generally, how the writings of different authors fr om different oints in time are similar, and how \"themes\" or secific uses of language in articular contexts evolve over time. One simle examle is the reuse of words from a revious document, with o r without exlicit citation, to convey a similar id ea or to critique it. Together with Georg Aitz (Ph.D. student, Comuter Science, UMD) UMD), have develoed a rototye exloratory search interface that hels legal scholars detect, track, and analyze atterns of influence between actors in a text collection. In July 2007, Georg Aitz successf ully defended a dissertation . Comonents of his research include: o Creation of a visual language that describes how co ntent roagates within text collections. o Develoment of general temoral atterns of influen ce, showing under what circumstances they work and do not work, and showing how they transfer between collections. o Emirical demonstration of how atterns of influenc e hel exerts understand text collections and find imortant information that is otherwise hidden or extremely tedious to find. o Design of an alication that serves as a central w orksace for scholarly research and elucidation of the underlying design rinciles. We have been alying automated linguistic analysis techniques to transcrits of Sureme Court oral arguments with Tim Hawes (Ph.D. student, Linguistic s, UMD) and Philli Resnik (Associate Professor, Linguistics, UMD). This work exlores the hyothesi s that justices' verbal behavior offer insight into their decision making rocesses (in the simlest fo rm, their votes). Going beyond simle word-level features, we are examining rich syntactic and disco urse-level cues that can give us insight into unobservable roerties of justices. Preliminary fi ndings: o Use of basic features, including word counts and do cument length, for document classification by each justice's vote aears to be insufficient to e xceed the baseline established by a justice's bias for or against the etitioner. o However, the inclusion of linguistically-informed f eatures for sentence comlexity and stylistic choices has yielded reliminary results that are in excess of the baseline for the majority of the justices tested. Challenges and Opportunities: We have established collaborative ties to other uni ts on the Maryland camus that enhance our research. The Human-Comuter Interaction Laborator y (HCIL) has exertise in the design of user interfaces, whose assistance has been valuable in g uiding develoment of our rototye search tool. Maryland's Institute for Technology in the Humaniti es (MiTH) has a Mellon-funded roject called MONK (Metadata Offer New Knowledge) that aims to he l humanities scholars discover and analyze atterns in the text they study---the goals are qui te comatible with our own and discussions have shaed our thinking in develoing widely-alicable tools for different domains.

Recent Research Findings: This collaborative roject draws uon game theory a nd historical evidence to examine the effectiveness of alternative multilateral treaty mechanisms for gove rning a trans-boundary marine fishery. It is well- established that cometitive exloitation of a comm on roerty resource tends to be destructive, both of the resource base and of the economic rents derived fro m its utilization. In the context of transboundary marine fisheries, international cooeration is required to overcome this \"common-roerty flaw.\" Consequently, develoments in international fisheri es law have focused on creating multinational institutions whose role is to romote both sustaina ble management of the resources and an equitable division of fishery benefits among nations claiming a rorietary or harvesting interest in the resour ce. For examle, Regional Fishery Management Organizati ons (RFMOs) have been established to cover all of the world's major tuna fisheries. Management of the se \"highly-migratory\" secies is comlicated by the fact that the migratory ranges of the harvested fis h stocks intersect the extended economic zones (EEZ s-- the \"200 mile limits\") of several or many coastal c ountries and may even extend out into the high seas area where fleets from all countries are free to harvest . The management task is further comlicated by the fact that migratory atterns, recruitment, rey availabi lity, and other fish oulation dynamics are sensit ive to imerfectly redictable climate variability and cha nge. Poorly anticiated changes in the fish stock's Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 178 density and distribution across its range, may lead to unexected outcomes from allocation and management decisions. Resulting disaointments ca n lead to conflict among the managers and even disrution of the orderly cooerative management of the fishery. The historical analysis comonent of this roject examined the effects of this tye of uncert ainty, together with ressures arising from the ex losive recent growth of industrial commercial fisheries fo r highly migratory tunas and related secies on the evolution and functioning of the set of RFMOs that attemt to govern tuna fisheries across the world. The game theoretic art of the roject has examined two situations by constructing two distinct models . The first hase of the roject utilized the \" Stochastic Imperfect-Information Split Stream Fishe ries Model, which treats the case of a air of adjacent coastal states, and focuses on the uncertainties imosed b y stochastically varying oceanic conditions. The seco nd hase of the roject introduced the Highly-Migratory Stock Management Model, which treats multinational fisheries associated wi th wide-ranging fish stocks such as tuna and swordfish. It attemts to catur e the comlications associated with management of a highly migratory marine fish stock, such as tuna. T his tyically involves a large number of diverse ac tors (coastal states, national fleets, and a multination al fisheries management authority), all laying dif fering roles in the fishery. In this multi-layer harvest game, management auth ority is invested in a multinational Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO), whose members are all regional coastal states lu s those nation-states whose fleets harvest this stock, within the extende d stock range, including on the high seas. Thus the member states of the Commission interact cometitiv ely on the fishing grounds and cooeratively throug h the Commission. Challenges and Opportunities: Comlexity of management settings allowed develome nt of the game model for only a limited set of cases. Further model develoment would allow analy sis of a broader array of olicy otions, and more comlete assessment of relevance of secific featur es of the management setting. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 179 Project Title: Agents of Change: Imrovisation in Emergency Reson se: Linking Cognition, Behavior, Proposal Emphasis Area: AOC Lead PI: Jersey Institute of Technology Co-PIs: Carter Butts, University of California at Irvine an d Gary Webb, Oklahoma State University Research Goals: Large-scale disasters\u2014whether induced by human, tec hnological or natural causes\u2014require society to la n for and resond to substantial disrution. As agent s of sometimes rofound change, disasters require integrated lanning and resonse at multile levels , but they also demand flexibility and an ability t o imrovise. This roject is the first large-scale s tudy to investigate imrovisation from a multi-disc ilinary ersective at the nexus of cognitive, behavioral a nd social henomena in emergency resonse. The thre e main goals of this work are 1. to exlain the dynamics of imrovisation in emergen cy resonse; 2. to reresent and make ublicly available machine-re adable data and tools from the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the 2001 World Trade Cent er attacks; and 3. to develo and evaluate materials to suort traini ng and olicy making regarding imrovised resonse to disaster. Both the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center disas ters were emblematic of the sudden, unexected crises arising from modern terrorist attacks, but a lso have characteristics in common with other minim al- warning hazards such as earthquakes. In articular, both disasters serve as natural laboratories for t he study of imrovisation in resonse to unexected events. Thematic Areas: 1. Human behavior in disaster response : the roject exlores cognitive, behavioral and in teraction rocesses at individual through organizational leve ls. 2. Multi-method analysis : the roject combines quantitative and qualitative aroaches to the analysis of multi-level data. 3. Data-driven policy : the results of the roject are exected to contri bute to the to shae resonse activities. Methodologies: The aroach to addressing the first goal of this research is emirical: we seek to understa nd the dynamics of imrovisation by drawing uon data from two rom inent disasters of the recent ast: the 1995 bombin g of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahom a City, OK; and the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York, NY. Primary data sources consis t of recordings and transcritions of communication and disatch logs, sulemented by mas, images and other first-hand documentation. Post-event interviews with resonse ersonnel rovide addition and detail. Secondary materials incl ude after-action reorts. The research is being driven by hyothesis which secify main and combined effec ts regarding cognitive, behavioral and interaction he nomena. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 180 The aroach to addressing the second goal is to create, document and disseminate data sets w hich consist of (i) digitized coies of raw materials (anonymize d where aroriate) and (ii) an encoded version of these materials, identifying where cognitive, behav ioral and interaction events have occurred. Because the rimary source materials associated with this study are ublicly available, the raw materials can be v erified and sulemented by other researchers, in contrast to the confidential interview data on which disaste r researchers must often rely. Materials such as thes e here have been underutilized in ast work, yet th eir richness and quality\u2014combined with their historical imortance\u2014make them excellent candidates for further analysis beyond the work in this roject. Recent Research Findings: To suort the first goal, data acquisition activities entailed (i) working with archivists at the Oklahoma City National Memorial to identify and attemt to f ill gas in original materials and (ii) attemting to secure other materials collected during the resons e to the World Trade Center attack that are not ava ilable through the sources discussed in the roosal. To suort the second goal, a systematic analysis of a random samle of after -action interviews with olice ersonnel following each event was conducted. A co ding scheme was develoed that enabled research ersonnel to identify cognitive, behavioral and int eraction events in the raw materials, as follows: Cognitive Events consisted of thinking about ast, current or ossi ble future events; Behavioral Events were classified as either conventional or imrovis ed. If imrovised, the event was further classified as involving alterations to standard oerating rocedures; exanding activities and/or authority of a role; lacing restrictions on ublic mobility or engendering legal transgressions; involving the use of alternative to ols in a role erformance; or involving location or facility changes. Interaction Events corresond to first- or second-hand transfer of in formation from one erson to another, and were classified either as orders (i.e. , commands) or non-orders. Also assigned to each event was an estimated Location and Time of Onset . The analysis yielded 3,271 cognitive, behavioral, a nd interactional (C/B/I) events, detailed in Tables 1 and 2. Aroximately 55% of the events came from the O KC data, while 45% came from the WTC data. Table 1. C/B/I Events (Counts) CBS Event OKC WTC Total C Orient 568 510 1078 Pros 12 31 43 Retro 101 107 208 B Conv 50 69 119 Im 65 53 118 I Order 723 322 1045 Non-Order 288 372 660 Total 1807 1464 3271 Table 2. C/B/S Events (%) CBS Event 54% The cognitive dimension shows close similarity between the event s: orientation redominates, followed far behind by retrosection, and further still by rosection\u2014suggesting an emhasis on thinking in th e resent. The behavioral dimension reveals some imortant similarities betw een this reliminary analysis and revious studies of other disasters. For examle, conventionally erformed behavioral comonents Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 181 outnumber those that were imrovised\u2014affirming a lo ngstanding notion that resonse entails a blend of established and emergent behaviors. The interaction dimension reveals some differences between the eve nts: for OKC, orders redominated, while for WTC orders and non-orders are fairly equa lly slit. While reliminary, these results underscore the ot ential for the OKC and WTC data sets to shed light on cognitive, behavioral and interaction dynamics amon gst resonse ersonnel. They also rovide an imort ant test of the feasibility of this articular aroach to describing these rocesses. Finally, to suort the third goal, discussions with ractitioners have been held in the US and abroad, an article targeted towards ractitioners has been ub lished, and a anel at the 2007 Natural Hazards Wor ksho was organized. Numerous undergraduate and graduate students have been involved in all asects of this roject. Challenges and Opportunities Current work on this roject is in three areas: fur ther organization, rearation and cataloguing of r aw materials and data to be analyzed; extension and re finement of the coding scheme described above, combined with methods for analyzing the data; and d issemination of results, including investigation of imlications of this work for olicy. The raw materials for this roject are extremely he terogeneous, and in some laces sensitive. Our work is focused on develoing a database schema that reflec ts the richness of the source materials, while allo wing us to manage them effectively. The data for analysi s are being created through a combined automatic an d manual rocess of digitization, roofing and electr onic ublication. Extension and refinement of the coding scheme rese nted above is leading to a two-level rotocol. At t he higher level (similar to that described above), hum an coders interret the data to find meaning in it. This is erhas the most common aroach to content analysi s. At the lower level, human coders are also emloyed, but instead are searching for finer-grain ed events, such as ercetual observations, simle actions and elementary communications. This is a highly lab or-intensive rocess, but one that removes much of the subjectivity from the coding rocess. We exect to aly this technique to a subset of the data in ord er to determine a roof-of-concet for ossible future wo rk. Analytic methods being used in this work range from simle difference testing to event-driven models, w here current event robabilities are conditioned on rior ones. This roject resents several exciting oortunitie s. First, it will advance our understanding of imrovisation in emergency resonse by develoing a novel concetual framework that is multi- dimensional and multi-discilinary. Second, the r oject is roviding valuable educational oortuniti es for undergraduate and graduate students at three univer sities. Finally, the results of this roject have the otential to imrove olicy making and to inform th e design of training rograms for first resonders.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 182 Project Title: The role of natural resources in mitigating olitic al, environmental, and health shocks to extremely oor households in Southeastern Afric a Proposal # : BCS-0624168 HSD Emphasis Area : Agents of Change Lead PI: Frank Merry, Woods Hole Research Center Co-PIs: Gregory Amacher, Virginia Polytechnic Institute a nd State University Paul Estein, Harvard Medical School Nadine Laorte, Woods Hole Research Center Collaborators: Richard Howarth, Dartmouth College Heidi Gengenbach, Harvard University Andrew Plumtre, Wildlife Conservation Society Research Goals: Using a broad range of country and natural resource access conditions, we are analyzing the role of na tural resources in oor household strategies during times of extreme stress. We aim to rovide a historica l and ethnograhical review of resource use by households during times of extreme stress. Secial attention is being given to collecting oral histories of conditi ons and resources use while households are in force d migration, face unforeseen environmental or health setbacks, or are excluded from traditional access t o resources. We are develoing subsistence household-based econo mic models of natural resource reliance that will quantify the relationshi between households and na tural resources and allow estimation of the effects of restricted or additional access to resources, as we ll as the effects of olicies on revealed behavior and decisions. We will then, create alternative scenar ios of governance, environmental stress, natural re source access that will simulate changing climate, health and natural resource conditions over time in the re gion. Finally, we will be able to develo land and resour ce use mas that identify where the highest ressur e on natural resources will be felt in a redetermined s et of environmental and governance scenarios. We focus in two regions of the Rift Valley of South eastern Africa: Central Mozambique and the border a rea of Uganda/Democratic Reublic of Congo; where over ty is ubiquitous and where natural resources lay a vital role in household subsistence and decision st rategies. Methodologies : We are using a combination of the three levels of s tudy: household, historical, and satial to rovide a comlete understanding of household actions and the ir deendence on natural resources. Each art of t he study relies imortantly on and comlements the oth ers. The economic models of household behavior and decision making will allow us to quantify the reso nses of households to extreme events and overty, a nd to changes in natural resource condition and access; w e will, for examle be able to estimate the reducti on in hunting range due to sickness of the rimary househ old hunter. Historical and ethnograhic studies wi ll hel us understand why rural households make the de cisions they do; how, for examle, gender and generational relations shae labor-allocation strat egies\u2014within and across households\u2014in changing olitical and/or economic circumstances, and how cu ltural ideologies and local knowledge of rural landscaes guide land-use ractices in ways oorly understood by urban-based olicy-makers. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 183 These studies will also hel us frame the imortant variables needed to assess the economic benefits a nd costs of shocks and changes in natural resource con dition and access. The satial analysis will integ rate the economic household decisions and land use choices i n order to inoint where imortant changes to natu ral resource condition, overty and disease are occurri ng in resonse to shocks, and to redict the outcom es of alternative scenarios that imly either a decrease in natural resources (such as war) or an increase i n natural resources (such as forest rotection rograms). Th e integration of all elements of this roosal are needed to bridge the ga between science and olicy making that is so critical and often ignored in oor subsistence-based economy research. Satial, household and historical data collection i s currently underway in Mozambique and will begin i n Uganda in early 2008. Recent Research Findings: We are still in the data collection hase and so ha ve no research finding to reort. Challenges and Opportunities: We have broadened the list of collaborating institu tions to include 2 local non-governmental organizat ions, 2 government research institutes, and one universit y. We have 11 Mozambican students who will be articiate in data collection and use the results for senior theses. Data collection - satial commu nity resource use maing and surveys alication in 2,0 00 households - is to begin on Setember 5 th in Mozambique and will conclude on October 5 th . The challenges are mainly logistical with a tea m that now includes more than 15 institutions. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 184 Project Title: The Reression and Dissent Nexus in the Middle Ea st Proposal #: 0527339 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of Change Lead PI: Meyer, J. Craig Jenkins; Ohio State Unive rsity Co-PIs: Phil Schrodt - University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS ; Mary Ann T\u00e9treault - Trinity University, San Antonio, TX; Jillian Schwedler, Ch ristian Davenort - University of Maryland, College Park, MD Research Goals: This roject examines the interaction between disse nt and reression in the Middle East to advance understanding of the rosects for democratization and globalization there. It focuses on several im ortant nations -- Egyt, Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, and Turkey -- during the 1990s, a articularly con tentious decade. These locations make it ossible to examin e the rocess of transformational change and the imlications of cultural variation for conflict. Research goals of the roject include: (1) the dev eloment of research models that include dynamic an d interactive rocesses in socioolitical systems aff ected by extensive and often violent dissent and reression; (2) the creation of a database that int egrates data from both qualitative and quantitative sources; (3) interdiscilinary and international artnershi s involving senior and junior faculty; (4) rofessi onal training of and collaborative work with graduate an d undergraduate students; (5) demonstration of the ower of interdiscilinary, multi-method social sci ence research. Using multile research methods to study the dissen t/reression nexus in the Middle East (event analys is, field research, and social surveys), this research goes beyond most revious research which utilized a single nation and/or a single methodology. It also conside rs more concetual refinements of dissent and rere ssion, a theoretical lack in existing research. Finally, it takes seriously the social, olitical and cultur al contexts surrounding contentious activities in each nation, features which are often overlooked. Research qu estions include: 1. How do dissent and reression influence one another and over what time eriod - e.g., quarterly, annually? 2. What kinds of reression roduce what kinds of diss ent and vice versa? 3. What are the social, olitical and cultural context s that surround contentious activities? 4. What consistencies and inconsistencies exist in the region regarding the nature of dissent, its source s, and its contexts? Thematic Areas: The importance of context: The team has just comleted the roject's second ye ar. The research integrated data from in-deth surveys in the six co untries with survey and event data and content anal ysis of newswire and newsaer data. A conference at Mersh on Center, highlighting the team's work was held on July 31 st, following a five week worksho of intensive study . Essential to that was the work of graduate and undergraduate students who each worked in deth on one country, focusing on the mechanisms and exlanatory theories of reression and dissent in t he 1990s. From the country case studies, four over arching themes emerged that are critical to understanding atterns of reression and dissent across the region : Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 185 1. The imortance of rentier status, both oil and for eign aid, that creates internationally deendent st ates 2. The size and out-migration of Palestinian and Kurdi sh oulations creating highly mobilized diasora communities 3. The significance of the 1990-1991 Gulf War, which t ransformed olitical oortunities and transnational networks among activists 4. The central role of technological and social networ ks that accomany globalization The distinctiveness of issues: Although comarisons among the nations studied coul d be drawn, unique issues fueled conflict in each location. For exam le, in Turkey, regime changes during the 1990s were a trigger for state action, and civil dissent was fue led by the mobilization of resources within central ized grous, e.g., PKK and Dev Sol. In Israel/Palestine , state action was fragmented and iece-meal with frequent changes in leadershi. A attern of romis es and broken romises was notable routinely sawne d violent conflict between local tribal and informal grous as well as by larger bureaucratic organizati ons. In Kuwait, struggles at the times of arliamentary ele ctions among secularists, Islamists and the ruling elite made transarent ersistent cleavages within the Ku waiti social system. Dissent eruted over the right s of women, foreign workers, the ress, and stateless e ole. The utility of multiple methodologies: The roject utilizes multile methodologies and sou rces of data. The latter include: (1) World Handbook of Political Indicators IV (htt://www.sociology.ohio- state.edu/faculty/jcj.h), which rovides event da ta from Reuters on relevant territories and is gene rated and utilized at The Ohio State University (OSU); (2 ) Kansas Event Data System (KEDS), which rovides event data from Agence Francaise Presse; it resides at University of Kansas (KU); (3) Euroa World Onl ine Reorts, Keesing, and Lexis-Nexus dissent and rere ssion news stories, which have been consolidated at OSU; (4) Field work data which has been collected b y American University in Cairo, KU, OSU, Trinity University, University of Maryland); (5) Kuwait Gen eral Social Surveys for the 1990s, country-secific demograhic data and World Values Survey data merge d at OSU; and the (6) Religion and State Data Set from Fox, 2006, merged at OSU. Using data from thes e sources in combination with each other has yielde d a richly textured icture of contentious activity. Challenges and Opportunities: The roject is relete with challenges and oortun ities related to research goals 1 - 5 above. We men tion three: 1. Attention to detailed atterns of state violence, s tate sanctions, and civil violence and rotest in e ach country using multile methods of data collection rovided an oortunity to examine the utility of theories of reression and dissent for exlaining c onflict in the Middle East and a challenge to corre ct and modify models deriving from such theories. (res earch goals 1, 2, and 5.) 2. Attention to the social, olitical and cultural con texts of each nation using multile methods made it ossible to extract characteristics common to natio ns in the region, a significant move beyond generalizations based on case studies. (research g oals 1, 2, and 5.) 3. The nature of the work and its social and olitical imortance has facilitated cross-discilinary and international oortunities for graduate and underg raduate students as well as faculty.

Analysis of the extent to which social networks and livelihood strategies result directly or indire ctly from interactions between IDPs and governmental an d non-governmental organizations involved in the ost-conflict governance environment. 3. Comarison of the social networks and livelihood strategies of in the general oulation and IDPs. 4. Centering the forced migrant or IDP in the anal ysis of the ost-conflict governance environment. Thematic Areas: 1. Forced migration (Internally Dislaced Persons) 2. Governmentality in ost-conflict communities (Ca ucasus, Georgia, Post-Soviet Societies) 3. Social networks, Gender, and Livelihood strateg ies Methodologies: Semi-structured interviews, narrative interviews, a nd formal social network analysis Recent Research Findings: Most IDPs in Georgia have been living in dislaceme nt for u to 15 years. While unemloyment rates ar e relatively similar across the general oulation an d IDPs, recent olicy changes have created the oss ibility for dramatic shifts in the welfare of IDPs. Genera lly horrible living conditions are exacerbated by s low and limited state resonses as well as a clear Georgian state olicy of non-integration. IDPs became a to ol in the olitical and economic rocess of Georgian nation-s tate building in both the domestic and internationa l arenas. Throughout the 1990s, international humani tarian aid rovided assistance to IDPs through both local and international non-governmental organizati ons. By the early 2000s, donors reduced sending a nd many left the country due to the rotracted nature of the conflict and the lack of recetion by the Ge orgian government to develoing mechanisms for integration (i.e., donor fatigue). In the last few years, mou nting ressure from the international community (now incl uding the Euroean Union) has finally led to the emergence of a collaboratively develoed lan for i ntegration - the National Strategy and Action Plan. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 189 Our initial findings concerning the governance envi ronment identified a set of clashing neoliberal age ndas, where the non-Georgian (international) agenda emha sizes integration into society and into caitalist economic forms (emhasis on human security and huma n rights as well as rivatization of collective centers) and the Georgian agenda emhasizes issues of sovereignty and the recognition of the ower struggle with Russia. While the National Strategy d iscourse suggests widesread involvement of the IDP s, our site visits to many collective centers in our t hree case study sites (Zugdidi, Kutaisi, Tbilisi) f ound the IDPs generally ignorant of the basic remises of th e lan yet very inquisitive. We have finished the field interviews with the general oulation and IDPs, ho wever the data are not yet ready for analysis. We are in the rocess of coding and translating. Challenges and Opportunities: The olitical and economic situation in Georgia is highly dynamic. Even the descrition as a ost-con flict situation is called into question nearly weekly as skirmishes occur around the Abkhaz conflict zone an d between the Russian and Georgian governments. The shifting olitical and donor landscae rovides bot h challenges and oortunities. For examle, our sur vey has the oortunity to contribute to on-going a nd emergent olitical debates about forced migrant res ettlement and integration; yet, the challenge is to get our results into the aroriate arenas in a timely fas hion. We have the oortunity at this critical oi nt in the changing relationshi between IDPs and the Georgian government to rovide insight from the unique combination of the qualitative and quantitative ana lysis to rovide inut into the olicy debates. Ye t, at the same time, the challenge is to make our findings mu ch more broadly alicable to the continuously grow ing international forced migrant oulation and contrib ute to more theoretical and emirical debates about the nature of social networks. An additional key challenge and oortunity is to m aintain and develo communication of our key findin gs to non-governmental organizations, governmental age ncies, and IDP grous concerning social networks an d livelihood strategies. Through highlighting of cri tical elements in the narratives and social network analysis we can extract from the ersective of IDPs the mos t imortant elements to kee them intact and which olicies and agencies are most helful and harmful to livelihood and human security. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 190 Project Title: Workshos on Surveillance and Society State University Co-PIs: Simon Cole, Jill A. Fisher, Gary T. Marx Research Goals: 1. To foster interdiscilinary dialogue on contem orary surveillance issues 2. To ma core areas of surveillance research to l ocate collaborative oortunities and existing rese arch gas 3. To facilitate graduate student training Thematic Areas: 1. Power and inequality (differential surveillance along the lines of race, class, gender, and/or sex ual orientation) 2. Social sorting and crude categories as concetual resonses to the challenges of resear ching contemorary electronic surveillance 3. Potentials for enabling or emowering environme nts through ervasive comuting Methodologies: There will be two agenda setting workshos for this grant. The first international and interdiscilin ary worksho was held in March, 2007, at Arizona State University. The second will be held in 2008. The first research goal is addressed by bringing together 23 scholars from the many discilines currently studyi ng surveillance and society issues who, because of exi sting discilinary territories (of journals or conf erences), may be unaware of each other's work. The second go al, of maing core areas of research, is met throu gh a combination of structured toical discussions by a rticiants and oen forums for guided conversation about the research needs of the field. The final goal, o f training graduate students who are working on surveillance and society dissertation rojects, is met in conjunction with the first two activities an d by scheduling time for students to receive individuali zed feedback on their research in rogress. Recent Research Findings: The first worksho brought together a multi-discil inary and international array of scholars studying the social imlications of contemorary surveillance wi th a articular interest in questions of the ublic shere, equality, civil liberties, rivacy, and fairness. The academic discilines reresented were Anthrool ogy, Business / Management, Communications, Criminology, Geograhy, Information Studies, Justice Studies, Philosohy, Political Science, Sociology, Science a nd Technology Studies, and Women and Gender Studies . In total, there were 23 articiants (including the PIs) from 5 different countries. Preliminary findings included an in-deth discussio n of the different forms inequality that might be aggravated by surveillance and the roer role of s cholarshi in studying such henomena (e.g., neutra l, interested, activist, intervention-focused, etc.). One dimension that was esecially roductive was t rying to figure out what \"good\" surveillance systems might l ook like -- whether for elderly care or those with Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 191 different mobilities or for environmental monitorin g of toxics. We're currently editing a secial iss ue of the journal Surveillance and Society based on the worksho, which will be a more formal synthesis and reresentation of the worksho outcomes. In terms of outreach, we circulated a ress release which garnered media attention for the event. The PI articiated in several radio and newsaer intervi ews. One newsaer article mentioned the worksho secifically. In the wake of this ublicity, the P I answered numerous email queries from members of t he ublic who wanted further information on issues of surveillance and society. Additionally, a website was designed to disseminate information about the event and ublications that arise from it: www.ublicsurveillance.com/worksho.html . Challenges and Opportunities: The rimary challenge first worksho was ne gotiating different discilinary ersectives about the role of scholarshi in addressing issues of ower a nd inequality. While this created some tension amo ng articiants, it also led to a generative discussio n about the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies and sarked several collaborative ro jects among articiants, which was one key objecti ve of the worksho. The second challenge was trying to move beyond critical stances either for or again st surveillance to identify criteria for (and examles of) enabling surveillance environments. This challenge also serves as an oortunity, or a rovocative inv itation, for moving the field of surveillance studi es beyond reactionary stances and toward roductive, c ollaborative engagements with science and engineeri ng ractices. The greatest oortunity, at this oint , is for redirecting research toward areas where th ere are huge gas in emirical data or theoretical knowledg e concerning surveillance: toward studies of differ ential surveillance (based on oulation), enabling (erva sive) surveillance, automated surveillance, and as sive surveillance through ubiquitous information systems and devices.

Monroe (Pennsylvania State University) Co-PIs: Kevin Quinn (Harvard University), Michael Colares i (Michigan State University), Dragomir Radev (University of Michigan), Steven Ab ney (University of Michigan) Collaborators: Michael Cresin (University of Georgia), Yael Shom er (Washington University), Akitaka Matsuo (Rice University), Sarah Hobolt (Un iversity of Oxford) Research Goals: 1. Develo databases from electronic records of le gislative seech around the world. 2. Develo and imlement statistical models of lan guage use in olitics. 3. Use these data and models to rovide insight in to fundamental questions in olitical science about the nature of democratic cometition and reresentati on. 4. Use these unique data to rovide insight into t he dynamics of language. Thematic Areas: 1. Democratic reresentation. 2. Political communication and language. 3. Comutational linguistics / natural language r ocessing. Methodologies: The data are being created through a variety of web sidering / scraing and natural language rocessi ng techniques. The analyses have been conducted using statistical andmodels that are novel large-scale Bayesian statistical learning aroaches develoed by the PIs and designed secifically to address the questions brought u in these data. Recent Research Findings: Our most recent work addresses the nature of changi ng language use over time by arties and other identifiable grous. This is of fundamental imort ance to olitical science concerns with democratic reresentation and olitical cometition. For examle, a long-running debate addresses the is sue of whether arties remain essentially constant in their arty ositioning or whether they have or tak e the oortunity to shift ositions for strategic advantage. Our aroach allows, for the first time, to track i n minute detail the aeals and ositions that art ies take on a wide variety of olitical toics. We find, ge nerally, that artisan cometition is in fact stabl e in many ways, but also is subject to surrising volatility under certain conditions. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 193 Challenges and Opportunities: The most challenging asects of the roject have be en (1) bridging social science and comutational discilines, (2) the highly multilingual nature of the roject, and (3) the sheer size of the datasets , and subsequent analysis results, being develoed. The last is also the rimary oortunity. These da tasets will be a unique resource to corus linguist ics and will be among the very largest ever assembled in so cial science. They should rove to be a rich sourc e for analysts well after the comletion of this secific roject. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 194 Project Title: Social Network Dynamics of Youth Proposal #: 0624158 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics of Human Behavior Lead PI: James Moody - Duke University Co-PIs: Daniel McFarland - Stanford University, Scott Ge st - Pennsylvania State University Research Goals: While youth networks shae social identity, influen ce behavior and rovide resources for action, most emirical treatments study static networks focused on a limited range of relational tyes. We seek to build a richer ortrait of youth networks by modeling netwo rks across both an interactive and temoral dimensi on. With resect to social interaction, at the most mic ro-level we have face-to-face communications bounde d within classrooms. We then extend to less-bounded w ithin grade friendshis and then finally to relatio ns that cross multile contexts. The second dimension focuses on the temoral exansiveness of relations. Face-to-face communications result in immediate net works bounded in time to the current moment. These exand in friendshi to much longer time-scales. M ovement across these two dimensions can be thought of as a general rogression from strongly \"bounded\" to \"unbounded\" networks. We are thus building new software for analyzing networks, comiling data for ublic use, and modeling these data substantively. Our three main goals are thus: 1. Provide a new vision of the networked life of y outh that catures the endogenous develomental their interse ction life-course develoment. 2. Build new tools and rovide samle data for ma ing, measuring and modeling dynamic networks. 3. Provide lug-in oints for network models that can extend network evolution to eer influence mode ls of youth behavior and ideational diffusion. Methodologies: We first build dynamic reresentations of youth net works then model these networks statistically. To cover all scales, we build similar models on multile dat a sources that, combined, will form a astiche ort rait of the evolutionary sequence of youth networks. Our methods include exloratory visualizations, ar ticularly network \"movies\" that allow us to watch a network evolve over time. We also cluster networks to find eer grous, build local-network sequences of local relational atterns and then fit exonential random grah models (ERGMs) for each setting. Recent Research Findings: Our funding was finalized in Feb of this year, so w e are starting by focusing on data collection and t ool building. We have udated the Social Network Image Animator (SoNIA) to work with the R statistical ackage, making linking estimation of ERGM models i n STATNET and visualization of dynamic networks in SoNIA simler (Bender-deMoll et al, 2007). We de scribe the challenges involved in making meaningful network movies in two recent ublications (McFarlan d and Bender-deMoll 2007; Moody, McFarland and Bender-deMoll 2006), and submitted recent visualiza tions from the SoNIA tool to the NetSci 2007 conference. We have similarly been building tools for clustering networks, exloring the relative erformance of tools commonly used in different dis cilines. In (Gest, Moody & Rullison 2007), for Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 195 examle, we show that there is reasonable concordan ce with different methods alied to similar data, but that different data collection techniques hamer co marability across studies. We have extended some of this work in recent aers aimed at bringing tradit ional social-network aroaches to relational data to (Gest et. al, 200 7; Kindermann and Gest 2007). We have also been working on develoing tools for real-time analysis of dyadic interaction sequences (McFarland, 2007) a nd analyzing flows of individuals through settings, as a way to hel identify latent cluster evolution in networks (McFarland, 2006). Looking forward to building ee r influence and diffusion models across evolving networks, Moody has identified a number of analytic tools for tracking the limits of diffusion in dyna mic networks (Moody, forthcoming). Challenges and Opportunities: We see 4 challenges as the roject moves forward. F irst, estimation of ERGM models on fully dynamic da ta across multile waves is currently just becoming fe asible. We thus focus on modeling current networks with functional summaries of ast networks. We are look ing forward to fully dynamic models that can incor orate relational trajectories more comletely. Second, c ombining model results across data sources and wave s is currently cumbersome and largely unrecedented with in the ERGM framework. Our current aroach is to treat the studies in a meta-analytic frame, then us e network simulation tools to comare models with r eality. Third, the theoretical time-scales for social roce sses are difficult to secify. Moreover, we susec t that the temoral unfolding is heterogeneous across actors a nd relations, making it difficult to secify the \"t emo\" for network evolution. Finally, multile sources for s ocial action have been secified, which imly only artially overlaing model terms. While we can obviously fo llow standard ractice and include terms for each, we'd rather find a arsimonious unifying theoretical sto ry for the unfolding of these relations. Our future analytic work on dynamic networks aims at accommodating thes e last two issues. References Bender-deMoll, Skye and Daniel A.

Develo a mathematical framework to reresent co nstruction rocess information and design algorithm s that simulate ossible roject futures to estimate associated risk. 2. Develo interactive adative simulations based o n the mathematical framework and construction management field data and use it to cature data o n exert and novice decision-making. 3. Develo mental models of construction management decision-making under uncertainty, secifically highlighting differences between exerts and novic es in knowledge organization, information rocessing, and risk assessment. Thematic Areas: 1. Artificial intelligence in decision suort sys tems 2. Construction management simulations 3. Exert/novice cognition Methodologies: 1. Reresentation and agent based reasoning about construction information using temoral constraint networks 2. Collection and organization of field data throu gh structured surveys and interviews of racticing construction managers 3. Using interactive simulations to collect human d ecision-making data 4. Analysis of collected data using statistical and grahical methods Recent Research Findings: The rimary research outcomes of this roject have been the design of a framework that can be used to encode construction roject management information including costs, schedule constraints, and uncertai nty associated with ossible external events, and varia bility in roductivity and market costs. The framew ork uses a temoral constraint network, called TONAE, t o reresent the information and reason about robab le future scenarios. The theoretical significance of t his framework is that it estimates risk from a Mont e Carlo samle of ossible roject futures, instead of stud ying defined models of secific crisis scenarios th at are anticiated during the lanning rocess. The sace of ossible futures consists of all the aths that the TONAE can traverse in time. Each such ath can be s imulated by tracking the cascading imacts of different combinations of constraint violations tha t drive the construction roject schedule and cost. The samle sace thus covers all ossible scenarios tha t may arise - some of which may be entirely Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 197 unanticiated, but quite ossible. The size of the samle sace grows exonentially given the number o f constraints. Hence, to reduce the comlexity of ana lysis, and increase the accuracy of the estimate, t he sace is samled for a very large number of times. The framework and associated algorithms has lead to the imlementation of an interactive simulation of the construction of a steel framed office building. The construction roject data used in the simulation c omes from a real roject that was comleted in the Mid-W est and documented by the American Institute of Ste el Construction. The simulation can be used to identif y the robability of the samled roject scenarios and their imacts. In addition, for an identified aram eter (such as a cost overrun indicator) the simulat ion can track changes in the distribution of ossible futur e outcomes at each oint during the execution of th e construction roject. The direct imlication of thi s research is that it will hel construction manage rs (and lanners in general) identify and assess the risks involved with low/high imact and low/high robabil ity scenarios and assign contingencies accordingly. The secific scenarios that are of rimary concern are the ones that are identified by the simulation to be of high imact and low robability. In addition, the simulation will hel managers interactively assess risk and uncertainty during the construction rojec t as it evolves under raidly changing conditions. This research was conducted as art of a MS researc h thesis in Comuter Science by a graduate student (co- advised by the PI and Dr. Nilufer Onder) who was su orted by the grant. The work has been acceted fo r resentation at the Winter Simulation Conference 20 07 (Anderson et al. 2007) and has been submitted fo r review to the Journal of Comuting in Civil Enginee ring, ublished by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

(2007) \"Execting the Unexected: Reresenting and Reasoning About Crisis Scenarios,\" In the Proceedin gs of the 2007 Winter Simulation Conference, December 9 -12th.Washington D.C. Challenges and Opportunities The next hase of the research will be to collect d ata regarding human decision making in comlex construction rojects. A two-ronged aroach will be used to collect and analyze the data in collabor ation with our co-PIs at Florida State. We will use struc tured interviews and surveys to collect data direct ly from racticing construction managers. The surveys will rovide subjects with secific crisis scenarios and elicit their resonses to managing uncertainty with an em hasis on cost, schedule, and relevant constraint considerations. In addition, we will collect constr uction decision-making data in crisis scenarios tha t are dynamically unfolding by subjecting construction ma nagers to the interactive simulation. Secifically, the focus of the data collection will be to cature sta tistically significant atterns (if any) in decisio n-making among construction managers with different levels o f exertise. The develoed simulation can estimate risk during t he execution of a construction roject by samling ossible futures. The behavior of critical aramete rs, such as cost overrun and schedule delay indicat ors, over the samled futures can be used to generate di stribution functions that reflect robable roject outcomes. These functions rovide us with an oort unity to quantitatively identify, analyze, cluster, and ma the roject futures anticiated by human subjec ts. However, it also oses the challenge of develo ing models that will encode human decisions in the simu lation environment and calculate comarable values of the above indicators. These models will be a functi on of cost, schedule and event variables that defin e the simulation. The relationshis between these variabl es (indeendence or conditional deendence) will al low Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 198 us to develo grahical models that can be used to analyze the collected data and query statistically significant atterns that we refer to as situation models of decision-making. The simulation also rovides the oortunity to im rove undergraduate construction education. Students will get an oortunity to articiate in the simul ation to exlore imacts of decision-making in com lex crisis scenarios.Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 199 Project Title: Develoing a Measure of Voluntary Consent for Proto col-based Treatment Decisions Proposal #: SES-0527618 HSD Emphasis Area: Decision Making, Risk, and Uncertainty (DRU) Lead PI: Robert M.

To create an item ool that assesses all major d imensions of decision making control for this saml e of arents. 2. To construct a voluntary consent scale (DMCI) a roriate for use with these arents. 3. To examine the relationshi between DMCI total s core and selected measures of decision-making reference, coing style and affect. Thematic Areas : 1. Risk ercetion 2. Decision making 3. Voluntary choice Methodologies : 1. Qualitative: Focus grous and semi-structured i nterviews with arents, hysician-researchers, and other research rofessionals to elicit their views of vo luntary decision making to ensure that all asects of voluntariness are included in the DMCI item ool. 2. Quantitative: a) Common statistical techniques for scale develoment including, rincial comonen ts analysis, exloratory factor analysis, and confirm atory factor analysis. b) Linear regression to esta blish causal relationshis between DMCI and measures of affect, decision making and information reference, and other variables. Recent Research Findings : All articiants are biological arents or legal gu ardians of children articiating in rotocol-based treatments for cancer (85 ercent) and other medica l disorders (rimarily cardiology and ulmonary). Ninety ercent were undergoing treatment as inatie nts and ten ercent as outatients. Sixty-eight er cent are women and 32 ercent are men. Seventy-two erce nt are white, 14 ercent are African-American, six ercent are Asian, and eight ercent are other. Fou r ercent of these identify as Hisanic or Latino. Overall, articiants are well-educated, with 78 ercent re orting at least some college, a college degree, or a higher degree. Seventy-five ercent are married or living with a artner, and 70 ercent reort annual income of $40,000 or above, with a substantial minority of th ese (24 ercent) earning greater than $100,000 the decision with at least one other individua l Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 200 (multile resonses were ossible), tyically one's souse/artner (70 ercent), but including a hysician (30 ercent), the child (13 ercent), ano ther family member (six ercent), and the researche r (three ercent). Seven ercent of the articiants reorted delegating the decision to at least one ot her individual including a souse, a hysician, or the child. Only two ercent of articiants reort that the outcome of their decision to articiate in the ro tocol is negative; otherwise their resonse (83 ercent) or neutral (15 ercent) outco me. At the time of survey comletion, the mean numb er of days since articiants made the decision to enroll their child in a rotocol was 4.7 (SD= 3.9). Sixty -seven articiants comleted the survey within five days of making the decision, 27 comleted it between six and ten days, and four articiants comleted the surve y more than ten days after the decision. Only five arents who were aroached refused articiation. We don't yet have enough data to conduct the exlor atory and confirmatory factor analyses necessary fo r final scale construction, which will require arox imately 200 cases, a number we should reach by December, 2007. However, as a first ste in the sca le construction rocess, we conducted a rincial comonents analysis to reduce the number of items a nd establish a reliminary factor structure. We beg an by running solutions for one through six factors us ing the 28 items secified to measure voluntariness (i.e., decision making control). Over several iterations, we eliminated items if they loaded oorly on a fact or or had multile factor loadings. As we exerimented wi th the item ool, including item analysis and item selection, to get the ool down to a manageable set of items for closer insection, the number of cons istently interretable factors fell to between three and fiv e. Several criteria were used in this rocess, incl uding eigenvalues > 1, screen lots, as well as number an d interretation of item subsets. In general, our four most interretable factors accounted for aroximat ely 70% of the total variance. Analyses done thus f ar were considered to be interim in nature and were do ne rimarily to begin introducing us to the data's many underlying attributes. Once subject recruitment in comlete and all data have been collected we will r erun the analyses as outlined in our alication and in our statistical analysis lan. Challenges and Opportunities : An early challenge of this roject involved recruit ment of arents who had recently made decisions abo ut enrolling children in rotocol-based treatments. Pa rticiants are recruited from a number of different locations and deartments within the hosital, nece ssitating the develoment of an extensive network o f relationshis with investigators, study coordinator s, and other clinical and research ersonnel. As ou r numbers indicate, we have successfully met this cha llenge by sending considerable time with our refer ral sources, over time develoing trusting relationshi s that have resulted in a steady suly of subject referrals. Meeting this recruitment challenge has also rovide d us with a unique oortunity: to interview arent s within a very short time (i.e., one to 10 days) of their having made what for many is a difficult and emotion- laden decision. Much of the emirical research on i nformed consent and research articiation decision making involves small numbers of subjects who are r eflecting uon decisions made well in the ast. Uo n comletion of recruitment, we will have a large dat a set with measures comleted during a eriod when the articiation decision was quite fresh. Finally, wh en the scale construction hase of the roject (Aim 2) is comlete, we will have the oortunity to assess th e association between voluntary decision making and a number of variables related to affect and decision making (Aim 3). Variables such as affect, coing, t rust in hysicians and researchers, information and decisio n making reference, and self-efficacy have rarely been evaluated in studies related to research articiat ion (or clinical) decision making.

Infrastructure dynamics Methodologies: A hierarchy of simle agent based models to rerese nt the key human reaction and decision-making dynamics couled to a hierarchy of models of comle x engineered infrastructure systems is used to investigate the imact of the human interactions wi th the comlex infrastructure systems. This intera ction dynamics can then be used to look for feedbacks and vulnerabilities in the couled systems Recent Research Findings: Using a simle dynamic Cascade model reresenting t he oeration of an infrastructure system we have begun investigations of the imact of different cla sses of decision making on the infrastructure dynam ics.. The dynamical evolution of the system in the long t ime scale is governed by a daily increase on consum er demand that raises the overall load on the system a nd the engineering resonse to failures that involv es the ugrading of the comonents. The system is controll ed through two arameters and two agents who oerat e the system by selecting those arameters control th ose two arameters. The utility functions used by the agents to otimize erformance incororate some er cetion of the events that affect the decision maki ng of the agents.

Risk averse and risk taking attitudes in the o eration of the system. 2. The resonse to large events triggering a change in behavior on the art of the agents 3. The effect of the learning time in adating to new conditions. These three social characteristics have an imact o n the erformance of the infrastructure system. In going from risk-taking oeration to risk-averse oeration there is a reduction in the frequency of failures and in the number of failures er unit time. However, risk ave rsion brings an increase in the robability of extr eme events. During risk-averse oeration, the PDF falls off with a lower ower than in normal oeration. W hen risk-averse oeration is triggered in resonse to e xtreme events, we obtain similar results as in the case of continuous risk-averse oeration, but the robabili ty of extreme events can be higher than the continu ous oeration if this reaction is triggered too often, that is if the threshold for juming into risk aver se oeration is relatively low. Challenges and Opportunities: Connecting the hierarchy of infrastructure models w ith a standard agent system (the Reast agent syste m) resents both a challenge (making the couled syste m efficient enough to do the needed investigations) and a great oortunity (the flexibility to exlore a w ider range of agent behavior with an acceted stand ard agent system Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 204 Project Title: Ecological Boundary-Setting in Mental and Geohysic al Models Proposal #: 0433165 HSD Emphasis Area: Decision Making, Risk and Uncertainty Lead PI: Bryan G.

The streams of research are unified by a shared focus o n satiality; in articular, we are all concerned w ith how eole - whether members of the ublic, government administrators, or scientists - \"bound\" the systems to which they attribute environmental roblems. The r ocess of bounding is often imlicit, hidden in definitions of terms or in unsoken assumtions. T o comlicate the matter (and make it interesting), roblem bounding is also a dynamic rocess, changin g according to new scientific discoveries, olitica l changes, and shifts in values and ercetions. In our individual and small-grou research rojects, w e have ursued various asects and ersectives on satial behavior and related attitudes. In addition to these varied rojects, we have also considered how these research streams feed into one another. As we worked on our own rojects, we soug ht to combine our work to make a contribution to general theory in the area of behavior and decision making. We therefore challenged ourselves in gro u meetings to concentrate on the recursors and the e ffects of satial modeling in understanding environmental roblems. We have, accordingly, begun working on a book-lengt h manuscrit on scale and environmental olicy, tentatively titled: Scale Matters: Where We Are; Who We Are; and Why We Care. This book will develo a multi-discilinary theory about the role of scale i n olicy formation, and it will do this by building uon, and generalizing from, the findings and seculation s of individual studies and streams of small-grou research. The research streams resond to three uni fying questions, which will begin to illustrate how the various arts will contribute to the larger book r oject. The following three questions summarize the shared interests that guide our research, and these questi ons will form the structure for the three-art book. 1. The Descriptive Question - How do eole (including scientists and other stake holders in environmental roblem debates) \"bound\" the systems to which they attribute a roblem? Activities Include : A. Content analysis of regional newsaers concerning ollution in the Chesaeake Bay (Hirsch and Zia) B. Survey of Georgia Water Planning Process (Hirsch) C.

The Dynamic Question - How do these temorarily stable decisions regardi ng the \"scale\" of a roblem change? Activities Include: A. Sense of Place and Landmark District Designations ( Noonan) B. Discourse analysis - eliciting cultural models from social science research of ollution in the Chesaeake (Zia, Hirsch, Norton) C. Hedonics of Industrial Corridors, Landmarks and Dis amenities (Noonan) D. Neighborhood Networks (Metcalf) E. Contagion of Imact Fees (Noonan and Fonseca) F. Sense of Place Theories and the Oerationalizat ion of Ambit (Zia, Norton, Hirsch, Hannon) 3. The Normative Question - Can we articulate criteria to guide the \"scaling\" o f environmental roblems? Activities Include: A. Environmental Justice Meta-analysis (Noonan and Fon seca) B. Macro-scoing, Social Learning, and Choice of Scale (Norton, Zia, Hirsch) C. Satial Policy Analysis (Zia) D. Analysis of lace commitments as exemlifying socia l values (Norton, Zia, Metcalf, Hirsch, Hannon) We are currently consolidating our findings in the articular research streams, in anticiation of the grant's end in May, 08. We are now working on individual a nd collaborative ublications that will disseminate our findings in several fields; and we are also working on a draft of an overview book that will roose a general theory of sace, lace, and their effect on environmental roblem formulation.

Collaborators: Jodie Lester Particiating Institution: The University of Malawi , Centre for Education Research and Training, Ms. Elizabeth Meke Research Objectives: Using the Positive Deviance Inquiry aroach, the esearch will: /square4 Identify ositive deviant individuals and grous in the education sector who are roactively adating to the HIV/AIDS eidemic and exlore characteristics that make them ositive deviants. /square4 Identify the factors that suort those individuals and grous, as well as the barriers they face, in their attemts to catalyze action in the context of a decentralized education sector. /square4 Develo recommendations to olicymakers and ractit ioners for suorting ositive deviant teachers, school management committees, and any oth er education-based actors in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Thematic Areas Education and HIV/AIDS Methodologies: In this research, the ositive deviance aroach (c alled Positive Deviance Inquiry, or PDI) is used to identify the strategies and characteristics of teac hers and education officials whose actions ositive ly deviate from the norm of stigmatization and silence with re gard to HIV and AIDS in Malawi's education system. In the early 1990's this aroach was initially used t o conduct research to decrease childhood malnutriti on. Though ositive deviance has been alied in 41 cou ntries by various organizations in the fields of he alth and nutrition, it has rarely been used in the educa tion sector. For the urose of this study, ositiv e deviants have been defined as individuals or grous who over come the many barriers - the norm of silence, shame and stigmatization, the lack of access to services, the low level of social caital for confronting th e eidemic, etc. - that surround HIV and AIDS. In the context of the Malawian education system, these ar e individuals and grous who exhibit deliberate osit ive and roactive behavior. The first ste of the research involved exloratory discussi ons with reresentative grous of education stakeholders to gather information on the context a s well as to identify examles of ositive deviance within the education sector. In the second ste, the research team used criteria generated th rough these consultations to identify secific ositive deviant individuals and grous. In-deth interviews and fo cus grous were conducted with teachers, head teachers, school management committee members, rimary education advisors, members of arent-teacher assoc iations, district education and district HIV/AIDS Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 207 officials, community based organization (CBO) and n on-governmental organization (NGO) reresentatives. In the rocess of conducting these qualitative inte rviews, a grou of teachers who had formed a suor t grou, called T'LIPO, and another grou of eole l iving with HIV and AIDS were identified. Members of these grous were also interviewed individually and as art of focus grous. In addition, officials f rom the Ministry of Education were interviewed, as well as reresentatives from the education divisions of UNI CEF and USAID. The third ste, which is scheduled to begin the second week of the ucoming school term (mid-Setember), will involve quantitative data col lection, using questionnaires that have been develo ed as a result of the extensive qualitative information c ollected during the second ste of the research. T hese questionnaires will be administered to teachers, he ad teachers, District education managers (DEMs), an d members of the suort grous of teachers living wi th HIV and AIDS. The collection and analysis of thi s data adats the traditional format of PDI by adding a quantitative ste to build uon information gath ered through the in-deth interviews and focus grous, t o more systematically examine ositive deviant activities, as well as factors that act as barriers and facilitators of ositive action. Recent Research Findings: With an adult HIV revalence of 14.2 ercent, Malaw i is one of the countries most heavily affected by the andemic. As a result of the andemic, the sector i s losing teachers to AIDS-related and other deaths faster than relacements can be trained.i This contributes to ever-increasing teacher-uil ratios and a growing burden on the other teachers who must comensate du ring their colleagues' rolonged illness. Quality o f education has further declined as illness and funer al attendance have grown to account for over 60 er cent of all cases of teacher absenteeism.ii The availability of testing for HIV has increased significantly in the districts that were the main focus of this research . Even in many of the rural areas, treatment is ava ilable to those who are HIV-ositive. Yet, as is the case wi th the general ublic, teachers are reluctant to ge t tested for HIV. The norm in the schools visited by the res earchers is for teachers who are ill not to get tes ted and if they have been tested, not to disclose their HIV st atus to others within the school. Therefore, by th e time they have been tested and have access to aroriat e treatment - both for oortunistic infections and for AIDS through ARV treatment - they are often quite i ll. On the other hand, teachers have the oortunity to influence the way that uils and members of the community resond to eole living with HIV/AIDS. T he otential of teachers to act as change agents in the community has been exemlified by a small grou of ositive deviants. In each of the districts visite d, HIV- ositive teachers have joined together to rovide s uort to each other. Some have begun to disclose their HIV status in ublic and to seak to other teachers and even visit other schools to reduce the stigma associated with HIV and AIDS and encourage others t o be tested. While the researchers were in Blantyr e, they joined a large grou of teachers marching thro ugh the streets chanting \"Kee the Teachers Alive!\" , along with reresentatives from the Ministry and th e media. As exlained by the T'LIPO resident: \"... The problem is that it is secret. People don't wan t to say the truth. AIDS is like a taboo. People don't want to r ecognize that it is a problem. We teachers want to be a role model for people to recognize this as a diseas e... To me, I just feel time is up. It's not time fo r people to be fearing , they should be happy to go to VCT [vol untary counseling and testing for HIV]. Little by little people will be used to go to VCT. ...We want to attra ct more and more to come and get tested and live positively. The fear itself and keeping it secret m akes people to die faster.\" Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 208 Challenges and Opportunities: Challenge: The alication of a ositive deviance aroach to decreasing the imact of HIV and AIDS i n the education sector is not clear-cut. Many of the ositive deviant actions identified in this resear ch rely on exensive and often unavailable external forces, wh ereas research on ositive deviant behavior related to nutrition generally uncovers simle behavior that i s within the control and the resources of the targe t oulation. For examle, in the two districts that were the original focus of this research, there was extensive and increasing access to VCT, ARV, nutrit ional suort, and sychosocial suort through existing networks of eole living with HIV/AIDS. The research revealed that information is lacking o r eole are misinformed or fearful of accessing thes e services. However, in this case, ositive devian ts can rectify gas in information and can encourage attit udinal change to access the services that are avail able in their districts. On the other hand, in areas where there is no access - or very limited access - to th ese exensive and rare external resources, the incentiv es to learn one's HIV status are limited. Potentia l ositive deviants in that situation would face a ve ry different set of challenges. Oortunity: The use of survey questionnaires to qu antify the factors revealed by the qualitative data collection is exected to rovide an estimate of th e extent of the HIV/AIDS-related ositive deviance and contribute to the PDI methodology by quantifying th ose factors identified through in-deth interviews and focus grous. Meetings with reresentatives from t he Ministry of Education resulted in other otentia l oortunities, in that the Ministry officials have been suortive of the research and are anxious to learn from the results. In fact, they encouraged the res earchers to collect data from the Central and North ern regions of Malawi, exanding beyond the original in tention to collect data only in the Southern region . ____________________________________ 1 Government of Malawi, nment of Malawi, 2003, 1. 1 Harris, Abigail M. and Schubert, Jane G. \"Defining 'Quality' in the Midst of HIV/AIDS: Rile Effects in the Classroom,\" 7 Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 209 Project Title: Human and Social Dynamics in Myvatnssveit, Iceland, from the Settlement to the Present Proposal H.

Collaborators: Arni Einarsson, Institute of Biology, University o f Iceland, and Myvatn Research Station; Orri Vesteinsson, University of Iceland and Icelan dic Institute of Archaeology; Jennifer Brown, University of Stirling, Scotland. Research Goals: In line with rimary HSD aims, the main goal of the roject is to foster breakthroughs in understandin g the dynamics of human action and develoment, as well a s knowledge about organizational, cultural, and societal adatation and change. Further secific go als are to: 1. Investigate the human and social dynamics of natura l resource use and economic ractice in Myvatnssveit, northern Iceland, in the context of environmental and climatic change over time, secifically the last 1100 years. 2. Use this information to evaluate decision-making an d the management of change in order to develo sound long-term economic otions and strategies fo r residents, educators, and other stakeholders. 3. A third, overarching goal is to facilitate the unde rstanding of the comlex consequences of how societ ies and cultures evolve and change over time from a gl obal as well as an Arctic and sub-Arctic viewoint. Thematic Areas: 1. Reasons for the millennium-scale success or failure of farms and districts in surviving raid and rofound environmental change and climate fluctuat ion. 2. The relationshi of major transformations in landsc aes (e.g. near total deforestation, widesread but not universal soil erosion, fresh-water ecosystem chan ges) to several key changes in stock-raising strate gy from the ast to the resent. 3. Placing modern shifts in land use in a broader envi ronmental ersective while relating them to their local geograhic, temoral and human and social co ntexts. 4. Connecting local knowledge of farmers and stakehold ers to scientific data sets through the use of enhanced and accessible comuter models used as in terview tools and bridges to research artnershis. 5. Producing integrative modeling and syntheses of at terns of adative resilience to global and local changes with wide relevance beyond the circumolar zone. Methodologies: The roject draws on systems theory in order to foc us on agents of change (AOC) in social-ecological systems (SES). Resilience may be \"measured\" in rela tion to the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated by a SES before it relocates, adots a di fferent set of rocesses, or fails. The roject als o makes use of the concets and methods of anarchy to exlore transformations in human-ecological systems. Panarc hy rovides a theoretical framework for understanding sustainability that integrates SES with economic, ecological and social asects at various time scale s. Temoral and satial modeling is being used to e xlore Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 210 how the economic growth and social develoment of a society, in this case in northern Iceland, is infl uenced by its eco-systemic links and socio-economic instit utions. Land-use and agronomic studies also of relevance, and the roject is comiling quantitativ e data bases of time series of grass and hay yields and fertilizer usage to extend and udate revious agro nomic and regression studies. Simulation modeling i s being used to investigate the interactions between farm management, vegetation, climate, and land degradation, through the examination of satial and temoral atterns of vegetation roduction and utilization. Historical and archaeological data are subject to the analyses aroriate to these disci lines. Recent Research Findings: It has been noted that sc heduling of communal use of the highland astures ( now largely eroded deserts) was more critical than tota l number of shee maintained. While biomass roduct ivity was sufficient to sustain very large grazing oula tions of shee, keeing shee in the highlands ast the (climatically varying) end of the growing season co uld trigger local erosion hot sots. Changing inter - annual redictability thus seems to be at least as imortant as gradual climate cooling in defeating w hat aear to have been sohisticated and generally eff ective traditional strategies for communal grazing management. Further, major destabilization of the K r\u00e1k\u00e1 river valley (flowing into the lake basin area from the eroded highlands to the south) occurs in the ea rly eighteenth century, rather than in the medieval eriod as once thought. Loss of human labor due to eightee nth century smallox eidemics, and the \"famine of the mist\" due to the Lakag\u00edgar volcanic erution, may h ave been critical factors in this destabilization, as human landscae management strategies were starved of wor kers, just as cooling climate and \"inherited\" small - scale erosion (begun in earlier eriods) began to a ccelerate. Interviews and archival work focusing u on human inuts to landscae stabilization are thus sw itching from a \"oulation as roblem\" to \"oulati on as resource\" ersective. Challenges and Opportunities: During the summer 2006 and 2007 field seasons, exca vations in the Narfastadir location confirmed that a significant ortion of the sixteenth- to eighteenth -century farm remains intact, desite the archaeolo gical challenge of the develoment of a modern farm and h otel comlex in the immediate vicinity. Conditions of organic reservation are good, and the otential fo r further investigations combining selective excava tion with ongoing survey work on boundary walls and larg er cultural landscaes is high. The Narfastadir sit e is highly suitable for an outreach rogram, and this roved very successful during the 2007 field season. The Gr\u00e6navatn site nearby is a large, still occuied, m edieval chieftains' farm which reresents a major archaeological resource with a standing turf farm h ouse. Discussions with the modern farm family are roducing a set of test investigations which it is hoed will lead to a long sequence connecting the r ecent eriod with first settlement. In August 2007, a Vik ing-age boat burial was discovered at Litli-Nuur n ear Narfastadir. This is an unusual find for Iceland an d, in addition to a number of interesting artifacts which will illuminate economic and cultural ractices, th e remains of at least 2 humans will rovide the oortunity for radiocarbon dating and dietary isot oic analysis.

Estimate the levels of inter-ethnic interaction and the state of searatist beliefs 3. Develo and ilot test the use of an integrated suite of tools (GPS, GIS, remote sensing, survey d ata, field interviews) to measure the effects of confli cts on local communities in different cultural sett ings Thematic Areas: 1. Inter-ethnic relations (social diastances) in t he former war zones of Bosnia and the North Caucasu s 2. Satial analysis of the localized distribution of violence (terrorism, assassinations, military ac tions, etc) 3. Remote sensing of landuse/landcover changes as a result of conflict, esecially minefields and eth nic c leansing Methodologies: We use an integrated methodology of individual and aggregate data that relies on oinion survey, censu s, governmental, and remote sensing data collection to oerationalize a satial analysis across a variety of scales. We focus on localized outcomes (village-le vel) of revious conflicts as well as contemorary distributions of small-scale violence. We mostly u se the suite of geograhic analytical tools (GPS, r emote sensing imagery analysis, GIS, satial analytical m ethods) comlete the work. Recent Research Findings: Recent research on this grant has moved forward on three fronts. First, on the question of interethni c trust, we have shown that conventional wisdom that tells u s that societies that have exerienced violent stru ggles in which individuals of different ethnic grous hav e (been) mobilized against each other are likely to become ossified along ethnic lines is misguided. Us ing multidimensional scaling in the analysis of 400 0 resonses, we do not find atterns of clear attitud inal cleavages among members of different ethnic gr ous in Bosnia nor the North Caucasus. Further, in anoth er aer, we show that there is a substantial belie f in the ossibility of inter-ethnic co-oeration both in Bo snia and the North Caucasus, in site of substantia l inter- ethnic violence in each location. In both regions, the resondents who believe that things are getting better and who exerience higher levels of material well b eing are more otimistic about co-oeration. Other attitudinal variables and war exeriences do not se em to lay a large role in these evaluations of eth nic Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 212 relations. In a third aer, we show that the tene t of modern studies of nationalism, that mobilized nations will want to live searately from members of other grous to achieve ethno-territorial goals, is inacc urate for the study regions. When examining sub-categor ies of the ethnic grous in each region, traditiona l social science factors, like religiosity, erceived income and levels of ride yielded significant difference s but more so for Bosnia-Herzegovina than for the North C aucasus. Intuitive factors, such as exerience with violence during the wars, were not consistently rev ealing and significant. The best exlanations for searatist sentiment in both locations were geogra hical location (individual towns and counties) and resondents' levels of general trust. The second focus is the satial analysis of violenc e. Examining the localized occurrence of all violen t events from August 1999 to August 2007 in the North Caucas us shows a dramatic diffusion of the conflict from Chechnya to the adjoining reublics of Ingushetia a nd Dagestan. The satial analysis combined both geostatistical analysis of static atterns (all eve nts in a month categorized by the tye of actor - g uerrillas, military, olice) and dynamic analysis of the chang ing attern. Both the nature and scale of violenc e is changing as the Federal authorities in Moscow entru st 'eace maintenance\" to the local Chechen leaders hi, but the region as a whole is becoming 'infected' wi th the sillover from the Chechen wars. The third focus of the roject is the migration and economic changes in the war zones as the local economies remain stagnant, a rocess begun with the coincidence of the collase of the two states (Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union) and the beginning of local conflicts. Extensive field work to colle ct demograhic and economic data for the smallest unit s (county equivalents) has been able to document th e uneven attern of out-migration, economic disariti es and olitical (in)action. We have attemted to estimate the rosects for further unrest as a resu lt of the unequal benefits/losses, frequently corre lated with nationality and locality, over the ast 15 years in both study sites. Challenges and Opportunities: Continuing a coule of the themes that I elaborated last year, managing a five university, two country , two study sites and multidiscilinary roject is much m ore time-consuming than anticiated. While I knew a ll the co-PIs well, I had only worked closely with two of them before. Learning the styles, work calendar s, roclivities and emhases of the others and trying to meld them into the team has been more difficult than exected. Whilst there have been no conflicts, re ferences vary significantly and styles often clash. For examle, one co-PI wants to immediately share all d ata collected while another wants to embargo it til l the end of the roject. Similarly, in the choice of ublication outlets for a multidiscilinary roject, naturally, individuals vary in their references for journals. Another continuing challenge that emerged again in the ast year in two extended tris to the North Caucasus was the secrecy and unwillingness to assis t in roviding data to foreign researchers that is endemic in the region, ridden with many kinds of et hnic, religious, national, and olitical cleavages. Working with local academics is the only way to acc ess these data but that in turn has significant dif ficulties since their academic traditions, styles, norms and ethics are hugely different than one normally sees in Western social science.

James P. Sillane, Northwestern University Brian Rowan, University of Michigan Gary Sykes, Michigan State University Research Goals: The rimary goal of this research study is to study change rocesses linked to new institutional ress ures on schools brought about by the threat of sanctions un der the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). In articular, the research seeks to develo and test models that integrate accounts of individual and organizational change in resonse to NCLB. In this study, our rincial question is \"How do so cial rocesses and structures formed during the imlementation of revious reforms and innovations enable and constrain teachers' resonses to new institutional forces?\" This question calls for atte ntion to organizational level factors that affect i nteractions, the formation of interactions in resonse instituti onal ressure and how those interactions affect tea chers' behaviors. Therefore, we ask: How do formal oortunities for shared decision-mak ing and informal oortunities for collaboration carry over or shift as a wave of res sure begins to take hold? How do interactions teachers draw on to resond to new institutional forces emerge from interactions regarding revious reforms? Which interactions, exeriences and attributes that emerged through rior reforms are most strongly related to teachers' resonses to new institutional forces? Thematic Areas: Linking individual and organizational change Institutional theory Network change Educational reform Methodologies: The study team is collecting longitudinal data on t eachers' classroom teaching ractices, rincial an d other administrative leadershi behaviors, and on teacher s' social networks using questionnaires and intervi ews. We are using a combination of case analyses of scho ols' leadershi ractice's effects on organizationa l Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 214 functioning, social network analyses to model selec tion of ties and change in networks over time, and multi- level models to test the influence of network ties and individual characteristics on teacher change. Recent Research Findings: How do formal opportunities for shared decision-mak ing and informal opportunities for collaboration ca rry over or shift as a wave of pressure begins to take hold? /head2right Organizational forms that emerged from an earlier s chool restructuring movement in the 1980s and 1990s are being used now to discuss NCLB-related co ncerns, including how to raise test scores of low-erforming students. Beginning in the 1980s, schools develoed organizat ional structures designed to reduce the isolation o f teachers and romote greater teacher involvement in school-level decision-making. Desite the fact the se efforts had limited imacts on teaching and learnin g, these forms have ersisted. They include the cre ation of grade-level and \"vertical\" teams that meet regul arly to discuss curricular matters, the creation of common lanning eriods for teachers, and rotocols and r ocesses for structuring collaboration. Today, schoo ls have aroriated these organizational forms to dis cuss strategies for imroving the achievement of lo w- erforming students, including underreresented gro us in the school. /head2right Relative to earlier reforms studied for schools in the samle, interactions concerning reading and mat h are less frequent. The average teacher received hel from 0.6 others c oncerning imlementation of the reform whereas the average teacher received hel from 0.32 others to i ncrease STAR reading test scores and 0.35 others to imlement STAR math test scores. Thus, in sum, the re is as much interaction concerning STAR testing f or both reading and math as there was about the reform . We also note that the differences could be a fun ction of our instrument: school rosters were used to elic it names concerning hel with the reform whereas resonses to hel regarding the STAR test were base d on free recall. The differences in amount of hel received for STAR testing for reading and math were not statistically different, although many of the interactions concerning reading and math were betwe en the same teachers. Teachers received hel from about 0.5 colleagues for a total of about 36 days i n the school year for each subject. Which interactions, experiences and attributes that emerged through prior reforms are most strongly related to teachers' responses to new institutional forces? /head2right Perceived ressure to change is linked to receit o f federal funds. Teachers in the aggregate erceive less ressure when they teach in schools not receiv ing Title I funds. Princials and teachers in more economically advant aged schools reorted little to know influence of N CLB on their individual or organizational behavior, rel ative to schools that received Title I funding for serving low-income children. This fact is not surrising, s ince the sanctions of NCLB aly only to Title I sc hools. Nonetheless, it is imortant, because NCLB is art of a larger set of institutional forces related to accountability in education, to which all schools a re subject. /head2right Many teachers and rincials do not distinguish NCL B ressures from state and local ressures associated with a larger set of institutional force s: accountability-based reforms. Even secific Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 215 requirements regarding teacher quality, which osten sibly affect their job status, are not distinguishe d by teachers. This finding was surrising in that NCLB was \"new\" in its demand that schools be held accountable for erformance of all subgrous and that all teachers hold a degree in the subject matter they taught. Be fore NCLB, California did not hold its schools accountab le for high levels of achievement for each subgrou in a school. At the same time, accountability ressures on schools had been mounting for several years rio r to assage of NCLB. Teachers had already adjusted in s ome ways to a tighter couling between their classroom ractice and organizational ractice. Challenges and Opportunities: /head2right A key challenge in struggling schools is high teach er turnover. This challenge creates ractical roblems for schools but also methodological ones, when studying network change. At least some asects of network change are a function of levels of turnover, not resonses to institutional ressur e. This has imlications for building school caacity and teacher induction. Aroximately 35% of the eole on our rosters in 2 005 were not on our rosters in 2007, and aroximat ely 28% of the eole on our rosters in 2007 were not o n our rosters in 2005. This suggests about a 33% turnover in 2 years.

Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 220 Project Title: Emergent social behaviors in sensorimotor control Proposal #: ECS-0433948 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Co-PIs: Mitra Vishton Collaborators: Kyle Reed Research Goals: A most basic form of human social interaction is th e hysical cooeration necessary to erform a manua l task in airs (dyads) or grous. Our research exlo res how the human sensorimotor control system imlements cooerative motor control. The roject t eam has demonstrated that when a dyad embarks on a reeated simle manual task requiring seed and acc uracy, motor strategies quickly arise that not only differ significantly from individual strategies on the sam e task, but also rovide better erformance. This r esult runs counter to conventional wisdom that high accur acy tasks are best erformed by one individual alon e. Nevertheless, the result is reasonable: humans are social animals and have develoed sohisticated way s of working together hysically. Motor interactions re resent a social communication mechanism distinct fr om facial exression, gesture, and soken language. By taking the new strategy of two humans cooerating, the roject team has recently been able to study how hu mans can interact more naturally with robots. The roject team and its aroach are interdiscilinary : the work encomasses cognitive science, neurobiol ogy, robotics, and sensorimotor control. Experimental Methodologies: To gain insight into this hysical communication ch annel, we interose a robotic mechanism between two subjects as they engage in a shared motion task. Th e robotic interosition allows us to both monitor t he forces exerted by the each individual, and to selec tively erturb the interaction between them (by add ing or subtracting forces and/or noise). We used several caabilities of our custom built 1- DOF crank: (1) The crank has strain gauges that al low us to monitor the torque exerted about its axis of rot ation by each subject indeendently. These torques will be acquired at a high samling rate for off-line analy sis. (2) Two searate video feeds can rovide diff erent visual dislays to the two subjects. This allows us to control the timing and goal ositions of the ta sk for the two subjects indeendently. (3) Comuter-generated torques can be injected about the crank's rotation axis, via a direct-drive DC brushless servomotor located under the table. This will allow us to selectively erturb the interaction between the subjects by adding or s ubtracting forces and/or noise. Exerimental setu with two-handled crank. A rojector dislays the targets from above. A curtain hangs between the two articiants to revent visual communication. A motor is mounted below the table. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 221 Recent Research Findings: We investigated hysical interaction between two e ole and a human and a robot using the simlest tas k we could conceive: rotating a two-handled crank to bring a cursor into a target region. Based on the secialization found in dyadic tasks, we rogrammed a robotic artner to simulate one of the human artners. Each subjects' artner was hidden behind a curtain, so we could make half the subjects belie ve the artner was a human and half know a human was not resent, thus that they were interacting with a robo t. When two eole work together, the dyad erforms fa ster than the average of the subjects working individually. When a erson works with a simulated artner, yet believes the robotic artner is a huma n, the human-robot erforms the same seed as the subject working alone. When the subject knows they are not working with a human, the human-robot erforms slow er than working alone. The erceived origin of the robotic artner causes the subjects to erform diff erently: worse when they thought their artner was a robot and better when they thought their artner was a hu man. Subjects in the Human-Robot grou knew they were working with a robotic agent while subjects in the H-R-Confederate grou believed they were working with a human. A negative value means the two eole (or human-robot air) worked faster together than the individual. Two humans working together are significantly faster than an individual working with a motor simulating a artner. When working with the robotic artner, subjects with a confederate resent are faster than subjects without a confederate resent, but not significantly.

Thematic Areas Land use and demograhic changes, historical er sective Urbanization and land cover changes Methodologies: Archival data collection Ethnograhic Ecological Remote sensing Agent based modeling Recent Research Findings 1. Brazilian government welfare rograms, includin g the relatively new rogram that allows farmers to aly for retirement benefits, are the most imort ant reasons why rural folk of the Amazon estuary vi sit and maintain long-term contacts with urban areas. While the rograms are designed to make rural life more secure and allow rural eole to stay in thei r communities, ayments are delivered in the cities . Farmers travel to cities to collect ensions and o ther benefits on average twice er month and the gr eat majority have closed relatives or their own houses in the city. Government ensions reresent more th an 50% of the household income of the estuarine house holds. 2. Land diversification is allowing the estuarine residents to engage in commercial agroforestry and forest management activities and reduce their deendency on cash cro roduction. Our data show that sale of forest and agroforestry roducts, notably a\u00e7a\u00ed al m fruit and fast-growing timbers managed in housegardens, fallows and forests, has become the second (after government benefit rograms) most Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 224 imortant source of income for estuarine household s. Demand for non-agricultural roducts is transforming land use and land cover in the estuar ine area and is even increasing the abundance of aquatic resources including fish and shrim. 3. Municialities (and municial government) do no t seem to be benefiting from an active and growing economy of forest roducts. Commercialization tend s to take lace informally and between families and a variety of brokers and buyers, and usually at th e regional caital. Municialities do not benefit f rom tributes and taxation, thus continue to deend on federal assistance funds to rovide basic services. 4. The attern of declining annual cro roduction and increasing emhasis on tree roducts is notabl y changing forest cover trends in the Amazon estuary . Remote sensing data show that the estuarine regio n is exeriencing a rocess of net afforestation rat her than deforestation. In a 10 km radius around th e town of Ponta de Pedras, the area of intensive a\u00e7a \u00ed agroforestry has increased from around 1,100 ha i n 1985 to around 2,150 ha by the year 2000. The latt er reresents close to 75% of the total area of floodlain forest for the area analyzed. This roc ess of afforestation includes ongoing \"a\u00e7aization\" of the estuary (i.e., increased lanting and manageme nt of the highly-valued a\u00e7a\u00ed alm while maintaining floodlain forest cover) but also features growing diverse secondary forests, woody fallows and house gardens and fewer fields and astures. Challenges and Opportunities We are examining the comatibility or congruence of our data and the model we are constructing with theoretical constructs that have sought to exlain other earlier instances of \"forest resurgence\" incl uding theories of forest transition based on Euroean ex eriences. We have been fortunate to collaborate wit h Dr. Sandra Costa, an Urban Geograhy from Brazil, who r eceived a ost-doctoral fellowshi from the Brazili an government to send a year at Indiana University wo rking in collaboration with this roject.

Rodgers III, Rutgers University Co-PIs: David Bensman, Rutgers University Maria Boile, Rutgers University Collaborators: William Kramer, Rutgers University Charles Rawlings, Past President of United Nations Association-New Jersey Sotirios Theofanis, Rutgers University Global logistics chains are systems of suliers, m anufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customer s where hysical, financial, and information flows connect stakeholders in both directions. The IT revolution transformed global logistics chains, making them ma jor agents of change. The transformation redefined how seaorts function and gave rise to a new global com merce business model. This roject studies how emloyers, emloyees, and institutions are resondi ng to the transformation. We test three hyotheses: Retailers now control not only what they will rodu ce, when and where it will be delivered, but they also dictate rice and thereby the labor standards of roduction. As a result, wages and working conditions throughout the suly chain have deterio rated. The knowledge intensity of the logistics system its elf is art and arcel of a growing need for econom ic actors to be able to collect, rocess, and use dive rse sources of information. This dynamic assures th at highly educated workers will remain in short suly , and in a osition to demand high wages and desirable working conditions. Public olicy can lay a role in influencing emloy er choices as to whether they take the \"high\" or \"low\" road to cometitive success. As a recursor to testing these hyotheses, we are erforming a comarative study of United States to foreign orts, with the Port of New Jersey-New York serving as our focal ort. Our rimary goal is to rovide researchers and olicy analysts with a fram ework of the global logistics chain that can be use d to analyze the industry and develo olicy. Currently, we are describing the Port of New Jersey -New York. We have conducted a ilot survey of ort truck drivers. Most ort truck drivers work on cont ract to small trucking comanies, which receive con tracts from shiing lines, freight forwarders, and logist ics services roviders. Low caital costs, ease of entry, and intense cometition characterize the market for ort trucking services. Port truck drivers find themselves cometing with new entrants who are ofte n deserate to find the means to ay the leases and maintenance exenses on their used trucks. As a res ult, rates have been stagnant while the cost of oe rations has been rising; many drivers leave the market mont hly, and emloyers reort a chronic shortage of dri vers, as well as roblems of reliability and service qual ity. Longshoring used to be the ort's dominant labor fo rce. Since containerization emloyment has fallen f rom 50,000 to 5,500. Unlike dislaced longshoremen, rec ently hired longshoremen have lower levels of wages and benefits, and less access to overtime. Yet, em loyers still view labor costs as a growth constrain t on freight through the ort. Longshoremen comlain of less emloyment certainty and deteriorating ay. As a result, dockworkers accet all the work they can wh en it is offered, leading to long work hours and la ck of slee, followed by eriods of idleness. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 226 Warehouse workers comrise a third tye of logistic s workers. We have interviewed warehouse and distribution center oerators, shiing line execut ives, and logistics services roviders, in order to learn where freight unloaded from shis is brought on the first and second sto. While in the ast most frei ght was unloaded from shis directly into warehouses on the docks, those warehouses are now being torn down to rovide room for shi unloading, and warehouses are moving to locations outside the ort, sometimes ev en 75 miles away. During our interviews with warehouse oerators and third-arty logistics oerators, we learned that th ere is a substantial labor force of customer service agent s booking freight in offices scattered throughout t he metroolitan region. These agents work at a desk wi th a telehone and comuter; otentially never visi ting the ort. Little is known about these workers. Efforts to test hyothesis #1 are underway. Using t he Current Poulation Survey, we have relicated an d udated the work of Black and Brainard, who estimat ed the relationshi between \"trade oenness\" and th e gender wage ga. We exand and extend their study t o measure the link between \"trade oenness\" and wag e inequality (e.g, overall and within categories of e ducational attainment). Our reliminary evidence in dicates that the link between \"trade oenness\" and U.S. ear nings inequality has a strong cyclical comonent wi th its biggest effects occurring during the 1990s recessio n. During the next six months we will formally test hy otheses #1 and #2. Prior to conducting these tests we will comare labor market outcomes in ort economie s to metroolitan areas that do not have seaorts. This will enable us to identify whether globalization ha s had a differential imact on \"gateway\" labor mark ets. From a series of ilot/exloratory interviews with industry and ublic agency officials, we develoed a framework of the Asia to the Port of New York-New J ersey logistics chain. Figures 1 and 2 show the movement of container traffic (i.e., hysical entit ies or units of goods). Figures 3 and 4 illustrate how transortation systems involve both the flow of inf ormation and hysical entities. The following summa rizes these Inbound, outbound, and trans-shiment logistic roc esses comrise hysical flow activities. They inclu de all value-adding and movement activities from the sul ier to the final consumer. Physical flow is the mos t visible iece of the suly chain. It is the distin ct ath by which goods move to customers. However, information flow is an information exchange among d ifferent links. Information flows can be either electronic or aer-based: system-to-system, system -to-erson, erson-to-system, or tye, an effec tive suly chain is hard to achieve without integr ating customer demand to the roduction and manufacturing rocesses. We have faced two major challenges. The biggest cha llenge has been develoing a framework that is general, yet catures the logistics chain's richnes s. Another challenge is balancing academic rigor wi th the immediate needs of olicymakers. We have develoed a dialogue with officials from the Newark Mayor's office and the staff of New Jersey's Governor. At t he city level, officials are seeking advice on how to better link Newark residents to ort emloyment oortunit ies. At the state level, the Governor's staff is se eking advice on how to ensure the ort's continued intern ational cometitiveness.

Research Goals: The Integrated Public roject is comiling the world's largest ublic use census database at the University of Minnesota. With fund ing from NSF, the research team headed by Prof. Ruggles has so far rocessed 80 census datasets fro m 26 countries, containing the individual-level cen sus resonses of 202 million ersons. The data san th e eriod from 1960 to the resent. In all, 73 count ries reresenting over 60% of the world's oulation hav e signed agreements authorizing the IPUMS- International roject to distribute their census da ta. Most of these data would be inaccessible to res earchers without the efforts of the roject. The roject does much more than just archive the da ta: it translates all documentation into English, fully documents comarability issues regarding census que stions, and codes the data consistently across sam les to facilitate international comarisons. An intera ctive data system lets users select only the variab les and censuses that they need for their research. To hel users manage the vast quantity of information, th e web dissemination system filters the documentation to d islay only the censuses that users secify. The d ata and web system are available to qualified researchers a nywhere in the world comletely free of charge. 2006-2007 Progress: During the ast year, we greatly exanded the numbe r of samles in the data series. In November 2006, we added 16 samles from 7 Euroean and develoing cou ntries. Six months later, we added 17 more samles from Argentina, Hungary, Israel, Palestinian Territ ories, Portugal, and Rwanda. In addition, we have a dded thousands of additional variables to the data serie s. We have also made strides in the imlementation of new metadata technology, imroved the website functiona lity, added thousands of additional variables, and imroved geograhic coding of the data. We have ste ed u our efforts at outreach and training, and t he number of IPUMS-International researchers has more than doubled in the ast year. Over 2,500 researche rs have registered to use the database, making IPUMS-I nternational one of the most widely-used new data sources in the social and behavioral sciences.

Sa flow monitors detect no difference in street tree function between native lanatus and non nati ve lanatus, and no significant difference in water us e during hot dry sells and cooler weather imlying great availability of water in the urban environmen t. Challenges and Opportunities: The rogram we are studying has changed in unantici ated ways, including its management. This has mad e our access to decision makers more difficult, and h as also meant that the grou imlementing the rogr am is not meeting on a regular basis. For us to resent our results to the imlementers we will have to cre ate new communication venues that do not exist currently. It also means that decision making has become far m ore centralized, leading us to have to change our socia l science research methods to a more network based aroach.

Next growing season we will want to move the sensors to different locations and tree secies to get more information. Oortunities include being able to coule our rese arch with another roject that is looking at urban arks in the city, so we are going to be able to use the dat a gleaned from that roject to comlement our hedon ic analysis of roerty values and greening. We also have been able to add researchers from the Pacific Southwest Research Station of the US Forest Service to our team, and this has brought greater monitori ng caacity and local knowledge.

To obtain and use feedback from elders, family caregivers of elders, and rofessionals who serve e lders about the otential benefits and challenges of som e comuter-based assistive technologies for elders; 2. To enable such feedback to affect the design of a reconfigurable exerimental system, or \"Sandbox system\", based on existing comonent technologies; 3. To understand the influence of recursive feedba ck from exloratory focus grous, imlementation of an integrated system of technologies in a senior cent er, and interdiscilinary collaboration between comuter scientists and behavioral scientists on t he design of technologies; 4. To assess the exerience of elders with these t echnologies and their otential to contribute to en hanced functioning in elders; 5. To reare current and future ractitioners in comuter science and social work for collaborative research efforts which are based on an areciatio n of elders' ersectives and riorities, and which integrate an understanding of human behavior with an understanding of various alications of assisti ve technology. Thematic Areas: 1. Use by of comuter-based assistive techn ology; 2. Adatation and reconfiguration of technologies that would make them more functional for use by eld ers; 3. Learning and training issues affecting elders' cometence with these technologies; 4. Percetions of caacity of technologies for enh ancing quality of life, increasing sense of mastery and control, and rolonging ability to remain living a t home; 5. Exectations of variations in utility for elder s with different cognitive and hysical caacities and imairments; 6. Cross-discilinary collaboration and ersectives from behavioral and comuter scie nces; 7. Issues in for cross-discilinary rese arch and ractice. Methodologies: Behavioral science: Design of research methods has been influenced by an Advisory Grou of elder citiz ens committed to the roject in collaboration with the Research Team. The first hase of research has used focus grou methodology, a semi-structured interview desi gn, audio recording of interviews and verbatim transcrition of data, interview notes from comute r science research team members, qualitative data analysis with three levels of thematic coding by th ree members of the research team, and indeendent review of data by four other members of the team. T he second hase of research involves imlementation of Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 234 designated \"Sandbox\" technologies, now named ASSIST , into a senior center with elder subjects. A mix o f quantitative and qualitative measures will be emlo yed. Comuter science: The comuter science team rovi suorting field tests designed to rovide emirical data that can be used as dynamic feedback to the behavioral science team. This develoment cycle links technological in novation with rinciled methods for testing and evaluating the technology, which in turn drives fur ther develoment. The comuter science team has develoed: 4. a distributed sensor network infrastructure embedde d in a small smart sace for research, develoment and testing; 5. the ASSIST user system according to interface reco mmendations for elderly users. The system is comosed of the five alications described below, an oerating interface for the system, as well an email system, an internet ortal, and access to gam es for the elderly; 6. five technology demonstrations as art of ASSIST, including: f. a daily event lanning calendar that reminds users of imortant events, such as aointments and medication times; g. an address book containing information about friend s, relatives and caregivers; h. an easy to use videohone alication for face-to-f ace communication with family and friends; i. a fall detection system based on a distributed sens or network within the home; j. a system for finding secific \"lost\" objects such a s keys, cell hones, coffee cus, and remote controls. The ASSIST system will now be imlemented in the Am herst Senior Center. Recent Research Findings: Focus grou findings: Elders, family caregivers, an d rofessionals who serve elders reorted that the y erceive great otential for comuterized, assistiv e technology and the articular alications being develoed by the Comuter Science team to emower e lders and contribute to their well-being. At the sa me time, their enthusiasm is temered by some signific ant ambivalence about the increasing imortance of technology in every area of their lives. Though foc us grou articiants are for the most art eager t o see the technologies that were resented become available t o them, they would like to see their concerns recog nized and considered in choices about design and alicat ion of technology. The ositive resonses to technologies, in descendi ng order of significance, included: 7. Potential for imroved family and other long distan ce relationshis through enriched (video) communication; 8. Potential uses in health care through increased mon itoring of health status and communication with health care roviders through video communication; 9. Enhanced management of multile tasks, access to in formation, and oortunities for leisure; 10. Increased communication about falls and other threa ts to safety; 11. Increased sense of cometence and ower when techni cal skills are mastered; 12. Reduced caregivers' burdens, enabling alternative m eans of monitoring safety. The concerns about the technologies, in descending order of significance, included: Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 235 5. Comromised rivacy; 6. Potential for augmenting negative family and other long distance interactions with increased visual information; 7. Comromised quality of health care, substituting r eferred \"face to face\" interactions with health care roviders with communication \"through machines \"; \"high tech over high touch\"; 8. Potential for increasing social divisions, between those who are comuter literate, have access to high seed communication caacity, and can afford t o kee ugrading technical caability, and those who cannot; exerience of shame, of being \"left beh ind\" without this caacity. Suggestions to influence design and imlementation of technologies for elders: 8. Attend to sensory needs of elders, including reduce d visual and auditory abilities and adat interface technology to a range of caacities; 9. Comare the roosed technologies to those already available and imlement easiest to use and most cost effective; 10. Consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of RFID and comuter-based technologies at different stages of elders' life cycle and with dif ferent degrees of imairment; 11. Recognize the tensions between rivacy and safety a nd develo balanced solutions for a range of roblems; 12. Attend to the learning styles of elders in training and need for relationally based, ongoing suort t o acquire and maintain these skills; 13. Increase social networking, by elders for elders, a nd cross-generationally, around these technologies; 14. Make these technologies available as quickly as os sible! Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 236 Project Title: The Causes and Consequences of Urban Exansion Proposal #: SES-0433278 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents of Change, Dynamics of Human Behavior Lead PI: Stehen C. Sheard, Williams College Co-PIs: Shlomo Angel, New York University Daniel Civco, University of Connecticut Research Goals: This roject is designed to investigate the causes and the consequences of the exansion of urban land use around the world. The investigation roceeds throug h modeling, data collection and field research in a global samle of 120 cities stratified so as to re resent the global urban oulation by size, geogra hic region, and level of economic develoment. This inv estigation is of central scientific and olicy imo rtance articularly for cities in develoing countries, wh ere the urbanized oulation is exected to double, from 2 billion to 4 billion in the next 30-35 years. With increasing incomes in the develoing countries, th e consumtion of land by their cities will likely dou ble in the next 25 to 30 years. These growth rates imly that in the develoing world a new city with more t han 1 million inhabitants must be built every week for the next four decades. Confronting and managing thi s massive exansion in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner is a serious global challenge. T he research will identify the relative imortance o f the factors that contribute to urban exansion, the ot ential effectiveness of olicies in altering the na ture and form of urban exansion, and some of the consequenc es for economic and social welfare of the exansion . Thematic Areas: Agents of Change Dynamics of Human Behavior Satial Social Science Modeling human and social dynamics Methodologies: The research uses a combination of several methodol ogies, contributed by the variety of discilinary aroaches alied in the study. Classification of remotely sensed satellite data (Landsat Thematic Maer) is used to measure the amount and extent of urban land cover at two oints in time for each ci ty in our samle. These results are then combined with o ulation and economic data for secific jurisdictio ns using geographic information systems to measure the change in urban land cover in each jurisdiction, and to further identify whether these changes take lac e in areas that are already comletely surrounded b y urban land use or, alternatively, take lace at the urban erihery. The resulting remotely sensed and geograhically analyzed data are then augmented by data collected via survey by field researchers identified in or disatched to each of the 120 citi es in the samle. These data are then combined and used to estimate the parameters of econometric models to determine the relative contributions of olicy, economic, hysical and social factors towards urban exansion, and to test hyotheses about the qualit ative imact of these factors. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 237 Recent Research Findings: The research has roduced several findings which ha ve been or will be resented at rofessional meetin gs or is forthcoming in ublications. 1. The Impacts of Terrorism on Urban Form By combining data collected in our research with da ta from the Memorial Institute for the Prevention o f Terrorism's (MIPT) Terrorism Knowledge Base, we are able to recisely identify the intensity, target a nd tye of terrorism in urban centers. This ermits u s to exlore the imacts of terrorism with greater recision, and otentially to distinguish between d ifferent tyes of terrorist incidents. We find that an increase in the number of terrorist incidents is as sociated with reduced levels of urban exansion - h olding oulation and income growth constant. That is, inc reasing terror is associated with delaying or foreg oing urban develoment and increasing urban density. Thi s in contrast to a variety of claims ost-9/11 sugg esting that terrorism would act as a disersing force in c ities. We emloy an instrumental variables strateg y using geograhic and environmental structure as instrumen ts to address the endogeneity of terrorist attacks. (Presented at Brookings Institution, October 2006 a nd forthcoming in Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs, 2007) 2. Measuring and Modeling Global Urban Expansion This aer reorts some results from analysis of da ta collected from our samle of 120 cities, chosen to be globally reresentative of the urban oulation in laces having oulation of at least 100,000. Satel lite images have been used to estimate total urban land use at two oints in time for each city, and these data have been matched to oulation, income, and many o ther economic variables collected both from ublic sources and by field researchers in each city. We d escribe the rocess of measurement and summarize th e atterns of exansion (both within the urban area a nd in the eri-urban zone), oulation density, and other information for the samle. We then resent a serie s of estimates that examine the relationshi betwee n observed urban land use and other variables. From t his we draw some reliminary lessons that can serve to usefully inform olicy discussions concerning urban exansion. We conclude with a discussion of resear ch roblems whose solution may be available via enhanc ed data collection and global collaboration between scholars and olicy makers. (Presented at Bellagio Global Urban Summit, July 20 07 and forthcoming in Global Urbanization in the 21 st Century , University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008.) 3. Gender and Urban Form An imortant characteristic shared by most moderniz ing economies is a change in the economic role of women. As the economy develos, women find increasi ng labor market oortunities oen to them and they begin to take advantage of these oortunities. Thi s increase in skilled labor, in turn, hels to enco urage and drive the rocess of economic develoment and moder nization. Urbanization and urban growth are also widely associated with economic develoment and mod ernization. There have been some studies that have considered the role of urban form in constraining o r shaing the economic oortunities available to women. Conversely, however, there aear to have be en no studies that considered the imact of changin g economic roles for women on emerging urban form. Th is aer rovides a first evaluation of this imort ant issue. We find that increasing the labor force art iciation rate for women is associated generally wi th a more comact urban form. The resumed causal mechan ism is that households with working women face increased transortation costs for commuting from h ome to worklace, along with otential demands Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 238 associated with child care. This leads to an increa sed willingness to substitute locations close to th e worklace and to schools in exchange for reduced r ivate land consumtion. This would lead to more comact urban form. (To be resented October 2007 at the Worksho on Re sidential Srawl and Segregation at the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique , Dijon, France). 4. Infill versus Outspill: the microstructure of urban expansion The continuing ace of urbanization around the worl d has generated an ongoing rocess of exanding urb an land use. Several factors contribute to the growth in urban land use: for examle increasing oulatio n and income, falling transortation costs, and changing values of agricultural land surrounding the city. I n this aer we investigate how the local structure of urb an exansion is affected by these factors. Do these forces encourage increasing urban land use at the eriher y, or encourage infill of vacant areas within the c ity, or both? It is difficult to emirically test our under standing of these rocesses using data from a singl e city or even a single country because the data do not offer sufficient indeendent variation in the relevant f actors to reliably distinguish their searate imacts. This aer makes use the data collected from our global s amle of cities with land use data classified from satell ite imagery in all cities. The analysis distinguish es increasing urban land use at the erihery from inc reasing urban land use through infill of built u a reas, and examines the extent to which this rocess diffe rs around the world. There are tremendous variation s in the extent to which new urban exansion is taking lace at the erihery - which we call \"outsill\" an d define as on oen land that is not surrounded by ot her develoed land, or on land that is surrounded b y other develoed land and is generally referred to as \"inf ill.\" We estimate the extent to which oulation, i ncome, transortation costs, and other factors contribute to infill and to outsill. (Presented at the meetings of the North American se ction of the Regional Science Association in Toront o, November 2006.) Data collected, resentation slides, and working a ers are available from the roject web site: htt://www.williams.edu/Economics/UrbanGrowth/HomeP age.htm Challenges and Opportunities: The research faces several challenges as we move to wards comletion, but also several oortunities fo r further develoment and continuation. Challenge 1: Field research has been essentially co mleted in 117 cities. We face some challenges in coordinating, motivating and comleting the data co llection in the final 3. Challenge 2: Taking advantage of some of the oort unities (discussed below) would be greatly facilita ted if we could maintain contact with and hoe for assi stance from our global network of field researchers . For erhas 60 to 90 cities in our samle, this will be ossible. For the remaining 30 to 60 cities we wou ld need to identify new field researchers to assist in any follow on research. Challenge 3: Maintaining collaboration of our resea rch team and generation of research outut that se aks to (and generates rewards for) researchers from thr ee different discilines is a serious challenge. Oortunity: There is considerable interest from bo th an international olicy community, foundations, and scholars in the data we have collected and the resu lts we are obtaining. The data are essentially uniq ue (although others have collected similar - even more detailed - data for secific regions or the cities of selected countries). We look forward to develoing collaborative relationshis for further analysis of our data and for extending the research to consider oth er imortant olicy roblems. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 239 Project Title: Collaborative Proosal: Self-Control in the Life Course Proposal #: 0624305 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics of human Shoda, University of Washington Co-PIs: Ozlem Ayduk, University California, Berkeley; B. J. Casey, Sackler Institute; John Jonides, University of Michigan; Walter Mischel, C olumbia University. Collaborators Smith, Colu mbia University; Vivian Zayas, Cornell University Research Goals : Longitudinal studies from our laboratory have shown a strong relationshi between delaying gratificati on early in childhood and various behavioral consequen ces later in life. Preschool children's ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of more desira ble but delayed outcomes has been shown to redict such long-term outcomes as academic achievement in adole scence and cocaine use, as well as aggression, and body-mass index in adulthood. These studies have al so identified distinct trajectories of stability an d change. This roject asks: What might underlie thes e atterns of stability and change? What cognitive and neural rocesses are associated with each tye of t rajectory? Secifically, our goals are as follows: Goal 1. To test neural correlates of life-long indi vidual differences in self-control. We hyothesize that individuals with life trajectories characterized by consistently low versus consistently high levels o f self- control throughout develoment will differ redicta bly in their brain connectivity and function. Secifically, we redict that those with consistent ly low levels of self-control in their trajectory w ill be characterized by less activity and less refined con nectivity (e.g., less myelination and orientation r egularity) in the frontostriatal and frontoarietal regions du ring erformance of cognitive control tasks. We wil l test this rediction by erforming diffusion tensor imag ing (DTI) MRI, and functional MRI. Goal 2. To test the hypothesized links between meas ures of cognitive control and life trajectories of self- control. We will test the hyothesis that trajectories of se lf-control over the life course are systematically related to individual differences in cognitive cont rol in ercetual, working memory, and resonse rocessing. Secifically, we redict that those wit h a consistently low self-control trajectory will b e characterized by significantly less effective behav ioral cognitive control mechanisms at each stage of rocessing. Those with a declining trajectory and those with an imroving trajectory are characterize d by distinct configurations of deficits in ercetual, working memory, and/or resonse roduction rocesse s. Secondary Goals. The roject has three secondary goals that, while admittedly exloratory, seem worth ursuing given the unique oortunities rovided by the resent longitudinal samle. First, we shall examine the role of basic cognitive-control mechani sms as a otential buffer against the effect of str essful life events (e.g., divorce, job loss, illness) as w ell as chronic disositional vulnerabilities (e.g., anxious over- sensitivity to interersonal rejection) on individu als' social-cognitive functioning over the life cou rse. Second, many articiants in the ongoing, long-term longitudinal study now have young children, making it ossible to examine the otential transmission of t heir self-control ability to their children. Furthe r, some of the cognitive tasks that we shall use to study cogn itive control mechanisms also are aroriate both for adults and young children, allowing us to examine i nter-generational continuity in cognitive control o n these Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 240 measures as well. Third, we lan to exlore genetic bases of delay of gratification ability and cognit ive control, both for adult articiants and their chil dren. This goal is motivated by recent gene associa tion studies that suggest that olymorhisms affecting d oamine athways may underlie brain anatomical and brain activity correlates of cognitive control. Giv en currently available knowledge and methods, this comonent may not yield conclusive findings now, bu t it is a low-cost, exloratory ste for obtaining unique data that ultimately may have considerable utility. Thematic Areas: 1. Ability to delay gratification in order to obtain m ore desirable rewards 2. Behavioral assessment of rocesses underlying cogni tive control; control of attention, working memory, and reotent resonses 3. Function and connectivity structure of frontostriat al and frontoarietal regions during erformance of cognitive control tasks 4. Polymorhisms in the genes involved in the doamine athway Methodologies: 1. Reaction time and error analysis of erformance on cognitive tasks 2. Life outcome data 3. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI, and functional MRI of frontostriatal and frontoarietal regions of the brain 4. PCR and TaqMan-based genotying of genes a ilot study for the current roject we examine d the relationshi between children's ability to de lay gratification at age 4 and their erformance, four decades later, on a task assessing imulsivity in lanning. Of articular interest was erformance on the Dog-C at-Mouse (DCM) lanning game that consists of three animals, a dog, a cat and a mouse, arranged on an u ndirected network of four vertices. A final configu ration of animals is marked by the osition of food items (a bone, a fish, and a iece of cheese). The goal o f the game is to take the animals and rearrange them alon g a lattice of interconnected nodes to the vertices containing their resective food items without viol ating several constraints. This game was designed t o resent layers with a temtation to engage in a sh ort-sighted strategy called hill-climbing. More secifically, the game oens with a configuration t hat temts layers into making erroneous moves beca use these moves change the current configuration to su erficially resemble the goal configuration. When l ayers ot for these moves, they are launched down a less than otimum route towards solving the uzzle. We thought that resistance to hill-climbing on the DCM and ability to delay gratification may recruit com mon regulatory mechanisms or skills as both involve bei ng able to tolerate short-term frustration, and tak e into account long-term goals. Preliminary findings suo rt this exectation in both the Bing adults and in their children. Therefore, this task is now being conside red for inclusion in the fMRI comonent of the roj ect. An exloratory goal of the current roject was to e xamine genetic correlates of delay ability. Towards this end, a small grou of Bing articiants (aroximat ely 40 articiants residing in or around CA) and t heir children (between the ages of 4 and 11) comleted v arious cognitive control tasks and rovided cheek Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 241 samles for DNA analyses. This ilot study was rim arily ran under the Hellman Family Faculty Fund awarded to Dr. Ayduk at UC-Berkeley as described in our original alication. However, the analysis of the cheek cells at the University of Washington is bein g suorted by the resent grant. Cheek cells were collected by a soft cotton swab (similar to a Q-ti ) reviously ackaged in a sealed container, by rub bing it on the inside of the cheek of the articiants. The DNA samles contained in these swabs are being extracted and genotyed at the Functional Genomics Laboratory at the University of Washington. Challenges and Opportunities: To achieve the roject objectives we must carefully select, develo, and refine measures of cognitive control that can be used to collect erformance data from o ur articiants, now residing throughout the U.S. a nd abroad. Thus far, we have focused our efforts on s electing an aroriate battery of measures to be administered to articiants. In addition, we have been develoing web-based versions of these measur es that will aid in the data collection rocess. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 242 Project Title: Flows of Information and Influence in Social Netw orks Proposal #: BCS-0527249 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead PI: Eliot R. Smith, Indiana University, Bloomington Co-PIs: Robert Goldstone, Luis Rocha, Indiana Universit y, Bloomington Collaborators: Elizabeth C. Collins, Winter A. Mason, Frederica R. Conrey, John K. Kruschke, Peter M. Todd Research Goals : This roject investigates flows of information and influence in social networks, using multi-agent mod eling and studies with human articiants. There are two sub-rojects. Social Influence: Social influence occurs when one erson's attitude or behavior has an imact on the attitude or behavior of a second erson. For exam le, if erson B sees A urchase a articular roduc t or brand, B may be influenced to make a similar urcha se. The goal of this roject is to exlore the out comes of influence examined over time when each individua l is both a source and reciient of influence, usin g u- to-date theoretical models of the details of social networks and social influence rocesses. Social flows of information about eole: It is est imated that as much as 50% of the information that we exchange in daily conversation is information about other eole. Thus, social information can strong ly affect our imressions of other eole, and our beh aviors toward them. This roject aims to understan d when and how eole exchange information about othe rs, and the conditions under which the social flow of information allows individuals to make better decis ions about who to cooerate or comete with, etc. As an imortant secial case, eole often socially transmit information about otential dates or mate s. Existing theory of mate search assumes that a erso n's desirability as a mate can be assessed almost a t once (based mostly on immediately visible characteristic s), but research on romantic relationshis shows th at eole also care about other, less immediately know able characteristics of a artner (asects of erso nality, for examle). That harder-to-acquire information c an be transmitted as gossi through social networks . Thematic Areas: When eole draw on information from their individu al exeriences and use it to make a decision or judgment, some individuals may obtain biased or ina dequate samles of information. Pooling information al resources may hel the grou as a whole arrive at a better decision. This rocess is dynamic, for eac h individual's decisions in turn rovide additional i nformation to the network. Our research considers the relationshis of variables at several levels, from individual agents' decision rules, to inter-agent i nteractions, to the overall structures of social networks, as in dividuals share information and influence each othe rs' attitudes and behaviors, or assess each other as o tential cooerators or mates. Methodologies: Our research uses laboratory exerimentation (the t yical research methods of social and cognitive sychology) as well as survey questionnaires and th e collection of data from the web (e.g., in our Fac ebook study). We also aly agent-based modeling techniq ues. We have written a aer introducing and Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 243 advocating the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) te chniques for social sychological issues.

Recent Research Findings: In the Social Influence project: We have ublished a review of models of social infl uence drawn from discilines ranging from sociology and economics to cognitive science and hysics. We will build on th is review to construct models incororating the detail ed, micro-level understanding of influence rocesse s derived from laboratory studies, but contextualized in ways that recognize how multidirectional, dynam ic influences are situated in eole's social networks and relationshis.

In the Social Flows of Information about People pro ject: We have drafted a aer arguing that social erceivers, instead of assively receiving re-ack aged information, are active in eliciting and creat ing the information on which they base their imressions an d judgments. We describe a theoretical model of rocesses of active social cognition, and resent r esults of a multi-agent simulation of selected roc esses. Our model assumes that erceivers can actively deci de whether to obtain information about a social tar get; that they elicit as well as interret imression-re levant information; that social targets as well as erceivers are active (for examle, in strategically shaing t he imressions they create); that erceivers can so licit information from third-arty sources who are linked to erceivers and targets in social networks; and that erceivers may actively attemt to correct biases s temming from imression formation rocesses.

With Luis Rocha, we are conducting a study of users of the Facebook social networking website, examini ng both friendshi networks and dating atterns in a g rou of college students. Challenges and Opportunities: The studies by Winter Mason on social influence fro m imlicit attitudes (noted above) roduced unexec ted results. In the first study, the sources' imlicit attitudes led to a reverse effect on the reciient s' exlicit attitudes. In the second and third study the mani ulation of the sources' attitudes did not work as e xected, and there was no influence of the sources' imlicit attitudes on the reciient. Theory and some exeri mental results do suggest that a erson's imlicit attitud es can influence another erson's attitudes, but th e conditions in which imlicit attitudes lead to infl uence deserve further research. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 244 The Facebook study noted above suffered about a 6-m onth delay due to IRB concerns about rotection of human subjects, and our lanned design had to be si gnificantly limited in scoe. In our oinion, unde r Federal regulations, the study should have been exe mt from review (as it involved the collection of ublicly available data without retention of indivi dually identifying information), and should not hav e been delayed or limited. Oortunity: Overall, this work romises to make ma jor concetual contributions to the field of social sychology by showing how to embed its theories abo ut micro-level rocesses of social influence, erso n ercetion, etc. within the context of social netwo rks over an extended time course.

This roject is the first test with national dat a of the dynamic hyotheses about networks and grou s from McPherson's evolutionary ecological theory of affiliation 2. The analyses significantly exands that theory b y adding features of bottom-u self-organization of social systems and of the relationshi of internal comlexity to environmental features. 3. The data set collected under the grant will rov ide anel and life history calendar on network, vol untary association and other major life activities (work, family, geograhic moves, etc.) for a samle of individuals originally studied in the 2004 General Social Survey. Another data set will reresent a national samle of voluntary grous, generated thr ough a hyernetwork samle of the individuals' affiliation and measured through interviews with b oth members and leaders. Methodologies: The cornerstone of this roject is the collection o f over time data on the co-evolution of ersonal ne tworks and voluntary association membershis, through a sa mle survey of individuals from the non- institutionalized US adult oulation. Until two we eks ago, only cross-sectional data (from the first wave of data collection\u2014the 2004 General Social Survey\u2014were available. This fact has limited our modeling of social dynamics to equilibrium models. However, wh en we can use the new life history calendar data to create an event history data set, we will be able t o exlicitly model the dynamics of movement in and out of relationshis and membershis, based on contextual and timing variables. In the new data, we have re-interviews (anel and l ife history calendar information) on 851 resondent s, for a resonse rate of 58 ercent. We have interviews with 221 of the 341 voluntary association leaders f or whom information was rovided by resondents in the 2004 General Social Survey, for a resonse rate of 66 ercent. Combining the leader interviews with m ember reorts of small grous that had no formal leaders, we have reorts on 661 voluntary organizat ions (with measures from both leaders and the resondent member for 149 grous). Recent Research Findings: The data from the re-interview and the hyernetwork samle have just arrived from NORC (our subcontractor). Current results are from the first wave of data (ublicly released as the 2004 Genera l Social Survey Networks and Voluntary Association modules. In a first aer, ublished in the June 2006 Americ an Sociological Review, we asked: Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in the las t two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 246 collected the first nationally reresentative data on the confidants with whom Americans discuss matte rs that are imortant to them. In the 2004 General So cial Survey, we relicated those questions to asses s social change in core network structures. Discussion netw orks are strikingly smaller in 2004 than in 1985, w ith nearly trile the number of eole saying that ther e is no one with whom they discuss imortant matter s. The mean network size dros roughly a third (one co nfidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The m odal resondent now reorts having no one with whom he o r she discusses imortant matters; the modal reson se in 1985 was three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the ast two decades, but the greater shrinkage of non-kin ties leads to a core c onfidant network more centered on souses and aren ts, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods. Other structural features of e rsonal discussion networks remain relatively stable. Most eole have densely interconnected confidants who are like them in most resects. However, some changes reflect the changing demograhics of the U.S. oulation. Educational heterogeneity of core netw orks has decreased, while racial heterogeneity of t ies has increased. While the data may overestimate the num ber of social isolates, the declining discussion ne twork size is an imortant social change in American's in terersonal environments. In a new series of aers, we exlore the structure of the networks. Here, we ask whether the strengt hs of five key social dimensions- sex, race, religious r eference, age and education- have changed over the ast two decades in these close confidant networks. Rac ial homohily, the most salient dimension among the se five, has remained relatively constant over the two decades. However, the social distances between rac ial grous have shifted somewhat. Hisanics have becom e more similar to African Americans in their atter ns of out-grou confidants, while other-race resonden ts (mostly Asians) have become more similar to Angl o whites. Gender homohily has declined substantiall y, esecially among kin, as both men and women embrace souses as confidants. In-grou associatio n has increased by age and, among non-kin, by education. Religious homohily has increased for P rotestants, Catholics and Jews, but decreased for t hose who reort no religious reference or are members o f other faiths. Challenges and Opportunities: We are currently negotiating with NORC to obtain de tailed information on the neighborhood context of t he original resondents. Since Census tracts level da ta would allow resondents to be identified in many cases, we are working out extensive rocedural rotections through the IRB at NORC and Duke to assure that th e roject's assurances to the research articiants w ill be honored. After these issues are resolved, we will have a rem arkable data set for ublic use and for the analysi s of our original theoretical questions. We will have dynam ic data on networks and voluntary associations on a national scale, with extensive context information about the social situation surrounding the resonde nt. In addition, we will have the first nationally rerese ntative samle of voluntary grous which does not d eend on a oulation list (which necessarily over-reres ents large, formal grous).

Research Goals: 1. Develo a synthesis between linguistic field wor k and language acquisition studies within which we exlore the relationshi between human cognition a bout knowledge and belief and the grammar that language makes available for communicating about b eliefs and mental rocesses. 2. Establish the ath of develoment of children's knowledge of language exressing mental rocesses and their understanding of false beliefs and other min ds. 3. Collect and analyze data from languages that di ffer widely from English in the way that they encod e the link between mental rocesses and human behavior. 4. Develo materials that a) allow the extension o f exeriments designed initially for children to be used as a basis for fieldwork with adults, ideally in a wa y that makes comarison ossible and b) make use of new data about adult grammar to imrove edagogy f or endangered languages. Thematic Areas: Dynamics of Human Behavior Methodologies: 1. Exeriments on child language acquisition in En glish and Tibetan. 2. Field work techniques on Navajo and Tibetan usi ng techniques that allow eole to make more subtle judgments than in other studies, that in turn lead to imroved edagogical materials. 3. Theoretical research in syntax and semantics. Recent Research Findings: 1. Syntax and semantics of evidential morphemes In Tibetan, all sentences that convey information m ust include a morheme indicating how the seaker came to know the information. Tibetan a. nga 'bras za-gi- yod 'I eat rice' (I infer)(Garrett 200 1:211) Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 248 We have been studying the differences and arallels between the evidential morhemes and the English exressions used to translate them, such as \"must\", \"looks like\" etc.We have discovered that there are systematic differences in the way that evidentials and English modals (e.g. must) behave. We have foun d interesting ways that evidentials interact with oth er arts of the grammar such as tense. 2. Child acquisition of Tibetan Evidentials We have discovered that the child's mastery of evid entials is linked to their caacity for inference a nd not secifically to their ability to understand false b eliefs of others. We have begun to establish an ord er of acquisition of the different evidential morhemes. The difficulties Tibetan children have with evident ials resemble the difficulties English-seaking children have with modals (must, might) 3. Deixis and complex sentences Our exeriments on the acquisition of ronouns and satial terms in English suggest that English seak ing children have difficulty integrating oint of view across several of these terms, and might go through a stage where their grammar resembles the grammar of Navajo . 4. Application of results to field work and langua ge pedagogy The Navajo textbook co-authored by PIs Seas and Pa rsons-Yazzie is in ress, out in October. Challenges and Opportunities: 1. The challenge is to organize coordinated exerim entation across different languages and cultures. There are significant hurdles and learning oortu nities. 2. An additional challenge is to make the right con nections between the style of fieldwork investigati on and the controlled circumstances of exerimentatio n. 3. Finally, we need to understand the secial ragm atics of each language and culture to allow us to a sk the right questions and elicit informative answers.

Sencer, University of Iowa Co-PIs: Gregor Sch\u00f6ner, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany; S teve Luck, University of Calivornia, Davis Research Goals: 1. To exlain how the brain integrates 'what' and 'where' information to form a unified ma of object s in a local worksace 2. To develo a theoretical framework for understa nding how visuo-satial cognition evolves in real t ime and over learning in a task-secific manner 3. To emirically test our new theory using behavi oral exeriments with adults Thematic Areas: 1. Satial Cognition 2. Working Memory 3. Theoretical Neuroscience Methodologies: We combine behavioral research with adult articia nts with dynamical systems/neural network modeling. Recent Research Findings: We have shown a counterintuitive finding: eole ar e actually BETTER at remembering the details of similar objects. Most theories redict that the mor e similar objects are, the more they will interfere with one another in memory. We have also shown that the reresentations of simi lar objects can \"drift\" in memory such that eole exaggerate the difference between the two objects a fter a short delay. Finally, we have shown that satial working memory is attracted toward the focus of attention in siml e satial cueing tasks. Challenges and Opportunities: We have imlemented a new neural network model that is quite comlex. Thus, we need more comutational ower to make simulations of this mod el more reasonable. The bottleneck aears to be th e seed of the convolutions in the equations we are s imulating. Interersonally, the main challenge has been the di stance. Dr. Steve Luck moved to UC Davis this ast year. Thus, we have been communicating via video conferen ce. Our collaborative work was greatly facilitated by Dr. Luck's visit to Iowa this ast summer. In addition, Dr. Sch\u00f6ner's robotics grou and my la b at Iowa have started having joint lab meetings ev ery other week via video conference. We exect this wil l be a huge boost to our collaboration.

During this eriod, hum an health and welfare were transformed enormously by t he transition from foraging to farming, the rise of cities and comlex forms of social and olitical or ganization, Euroean colonization, and industrializ ation. With a trans-Atlantic network of collaborators, we will undertake large-scale comarative studies of t he causes and health consequences of these and other d ramatic changes in arrangements for work, living, a nd human interaction. Thematic Areas: Agents of change Methodologies: We are making extensive use of geograhic informati on system data bases to exlore correlations betwee n local environmental conditions and the health statu s of local oulations. We have also develoed and tested a data collection rotocol that allows direct coma risons of observations made by different observers. We are also develoing an inter-observer error quiz to quantify the comarability of data collected throu gh this roject with that of an earlier roject that focuse d on skeletal collections from the Western Hemishe re. The roject involves over 20 lead investigators and their students in institutions throughout Euroe a nd relies heavily on lato-based data collection soft ware we have develoed for efficient data collectio n. Data are transmitted to a server at Ohio State Universit y for cleaning and analysis. Our website oerates a s the nerve and communications center for the roject. It is assword rotected and is the vehicle for uloa ding and analyzing skeletal data as well as collecting a nd distributing information about articular sites. From this webage, we also oerate an interobserver erro r quiz, rovide the codebook, a chat ro om that allows roject articiants to exchange and o st information. Recent Research Findings: Health-related data have been collected on aroxim ately 5,000 skeletons over the ast year. Our resea rch is currently focused on sites dating to the Medieval eriod. Challenges and Opportunities: We have identified over 150,000 skeletons from more than 500 sites that could otentially be included in our study. We are currently develoing a samling s trategy will allow us to exloit the scientific ot ential of this massive bioculturally diverse samle.

Social/cultural dynamics: internal social roles, no rms, ractices and trust, that is, a socially dynam ic team culture, are necessary for IDR teams to beco me established and to thrive. 2. Organizational dynamics: evolution of social networ ks, as collaborations attemt to form (some never do) and mature, social exectations, rocesses, a nd roles of members are transformed as the organizational life course of IDR teams rogress (regress) over time. Methodologies: Subjects are academic researchers at University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB) and Kansas State University (K- State) who reviously or currently collaborate with at least two researchers outside their disciline to seek research funding suort and/or to ublish research findings as a roduct of IDR collaboration. IDR researchers were recruited through outreach worksho s (K-State in fall 2006, UB in sring 2007) and li sts generated using advice from knowledgeable faculty c olleagues and administrators (e.g., the Office of t he Vice-President for Research). We included (i) scien tists who had tried IDR but the team failed to gel, (ii) researchers who are members of new or established I DR teams and (iii) those who are members of IDR teams that are winding down or inactive. We also be gan intensive ethnograhic research on an 'IDR grou in formation' at KState (summer 2007) from its ince tion and are in the rocess of staging a UB counterart. We are using multile Delhi rounds of online surve y data collection (Phase 1 oen-ended exloratory survey rate at UB) to develo and refine standardized data collection instruments, in tensive interviews with IDR investigators, and ethnograhic observation of IDR teams in various or ganizational life course stages. Recent Research Findings: Oen-ended resonses from the Phase 1 online survey have been oen coded using grounded theory techniques for the analysis of qualitative data. Am ong the social, organizational, and cultural conce ts central to this exloratory work include key social relations, structural elements of the team social milieu Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 252 and social dynamics relating to ower structures, n orms of grou behavior, and role exectations. The demograhic characteristics of IDR teams (size and comosition in terms of rank, gender, discilinary background among others), the ower structures iml ied by grou dynamics and institutional relations, and the differences among teams in formation versus est ablished or dying (active and inactive) teams were toics identified as imortant by resondents to th e first round survey. Some subjects defined the key to successful IDR tea ms in terms of rocess and the quality of social interactions, including mutual resect, equivalent efforts, trust, and satisfaction. Other researchers emhasized roducts, including funding, conference aers and ublications, and scientific breakthroughs/new discoveries imossible within a s ingle disciline. Themes relating to social dynamic s of successful teams included mutual resect, oen-mind to work together, shared humor, good communication, and assion. Themes relating to the social dynamic s that undermine team success include overbearing ind ividuals, data/credit hogs, arrogance/large egos, l ack of resect based 'to leadershi, selfishness/greed, and su ression of dissent. In terms of IDR team social dy namics that affect individuals ositively, themes emerging from analysis of subject resonses include oortu nities for networking, generosity of individuals teaching about other discilines, resect and encouragement, others valuing contribution, colleagues who share w ork and credit, mentorshi and friendshi. Asects of IDR team social erceived status hierarchies (discilines/ranks), cometitiveness, lack of exectations, bullying, slackers, fear and hostili ty between ranks/discilines, turf wars, critics who don't con tribute, domineering individuals and weak leaders. These and other dimensions of social dynamics are being r efined and exlicated for use in a standardized clo sed- ended survey in Phase 2 (beginning 11/07). Rolling recruitment for Phase 2 (acceting all elig ible volunteers) will generate the highest ossible articiation rates for the next online survey aski ng resondents to rank order the imortance of key concetual categories taing the social, cultural and organizational dynamics of IDR teams. Continuin g exansion and refinement of lists of eligible resea rchers will maximize variation on key subject attri butes (e.g., rank, tenure, gender). Beyond demograhic di versity, future recruitment will also focus on maximizing the variation among \"tyes\" and \"roles\" of individual IDR team members (leadershi, allianc es, disciline, roles on rojects). While the Phase 2 o nline survey is in the field, UB researchers will c onduct interviews at UB and travel to KState for intensive interviews with IDR scientists there. With regard to Research Goal 3, two Graduate Assist ants have been hired. They are engaged with both survey data collection as well as observational res earch of the 'IDR grou in formation,' and have ur sued other interdiscilinary activities including rear ing new curriculum materials for the graduate cours e Multidiscilinary Thought and Presentation (K-State ). Challenges and Opportunities: Challenges: Persuading busy academic researchers to resond to online surveys and identifying sufficie nt researchers for the samle who have attemted to la unch IDR teams but failed to do so. Oortunities: On both camuses, researchers have been able to ident ify and will have oortunities to observe 'new' ID R teams in formation, using ethnograhic techniques f or data collection. Observation of new team has beg un at K-State (08/07) and will begin in Buffalo (10/07 ). In resonse to the recruitment workshos held at Kansas State and University at Buffalo, and their e xosure to the first round of data collection, a nu mber of researchers have volunteered for in-deth intervie ws, which will be started in fall 2007.

Collaborators: Jodie Lester Particiating Institution: The University of Malawi , Centre for Education Research and Training, Ms. Elizabeth Meke Research Objectives: Using the Positive Deviance Inquiry aroach, the esearch will: /square4 Identify ositive deviant individuals and grous in the education sector who are roactively adating to the HIV/AIDS eidemic and exlore characteristics that make them ositive deviants. /square4 Identify the factors that suort those individuals and grous, as well as the barriers they face, in their attemts to catalyze action in the context of a decentralized education sector. /square4 Develo recommendations to olicymakers and ractit ioners for suorting ositive deviant teachers, school management committees, and any oth er education-based actors in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Thematic Areas Education and HIV/AIDS Methodologies: In this research, the ositive deviance aroach (c alled Positive Deviance Inquiry, or PDI) is used to identify the strategies and characteristics of teac hers and education officials whose actions ositive ly deviate from the norm of stigmatization and silence with re gard to HIV and AIDS in Malawi's education system. In the early 1990's this aroach was initially used t o conduct research to decrease childhood malnutriti on. Though ositive deviance has been alied in 41 cou ntries by various organizations in the fields of he alth and nutrition, it has rarely been used in the educa tion sector. For the urose of this study, ositiv e deviants have been defined as individuals or grous who over come the many barriers - the norm of silence, shame and stigmatization, the lack of access to services, the low level of social caital for confronting th e eidemic, etc. - that surround HIV and AIDS. In the context of the Malawian education system, these ar e individuals and grous who exhibit deliberate osit ive and roactive behavior. The first ste of the research involved exloratory discussi ons with reresentative grous of education stakeholders to gather information on the context a s well as to identify examles of ositive deviance within the education sector. In the second ste, the research team used criteria generated th rough these consultations to identify secific ositive deviant individuals and grous. In-deth interviews and fo cus grous were conducted with teachers, head teachers, school management committee members, rimary education advisors, members of arent-teacher assoc iations, district education and district HIV/AIDS Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 254 officials, community based organization (CBO) and n on-governmental organization (NGO) reresentatives. In the rocess of conducting these qualitative inte rviews, a grou of teachers who had formed a suor t grou, called T'LIPO, and another grou of eole l iving with HIV and AIDS were identified. Members of these grous were also interviewed individually and as art of focus grous. In addition, officials f rom the Ministry of Education were interviewed, as well as reresentatives from the education divisions of UNI CEF and USAID. The third ste, which is scheduled to begin the second week of the ucoming school term (mid-Setember), will involve quantitative data col lection, using questionnaires that have been develo ed as a result of the extensive qualitative information c ollected during the second ste of the research. T hese questionnaires will be administered to teachers, he ad teachers, District education managers (DEMs), an d members of the suort grous of teachers living wi th HIV and AIDS. The collection and analysis of thi s data adats the traditional format of PDI by adding a quantitative ste to build uon information gath ered through the in-deth interviews and focus grous, t o more systematically examine ositive deviant activities, as well as factors that act as barriers and facilitators of ositive action. Recent Research Findings: With an adult HIV revalence of 14.2 ercent, Malaw i is one of the countries most heavily affected by the andemic. As a result of the andemic, the sector i s losing teachers to AIDS-related and other deaths faster than relacements can be trained.iii This contributes to ever-increasing teacher-uil ratios and a growing burden on the other teachers who must comensate du ring their colleagues' rolonged illness. Quality o f education has further declined as illness and funer al attendance have grown to account for over 60 er cent of all cases of teacher absenteeism.iv The availability of testing for HIV has increased significantly in the districts that were the main focus of this research . Even in many of the rural areas, treatment is ava ilable to those who are HIV-ositive. Yet, as is the case wi th the general ublic, teachers are reluctant to ge t tested for HIV. The norm in the schools visited by the res earchers is for teachers who are ill not to get tes ted and if they have been tested, not to disclose their HIV st atus to others within the school. Therefore, by th e time they have been tested and have access to aroriat e treatment - both for oortunistic infections and for AIDS through ARV treatment - they are often quite i ll. On the other hand, teachers have the oortunity to influence the way that uils and members of the community resond to eole living with HIV/AIDS. T he otential of teachers to act as change agents in the community has been exemlified by a small grou of ositive deviants. In each of the districts visite d, HIV- ositive teachers have joined together to rovide s uort to each other. Some have begun to disclose their HIV status in ublic and to seak to other teachers and even visit other schools to reduce the stigma associated with HIV and AIDS and encourage others t o be tested. While the researchers were in Blantyr e, they joined a large grou of teachers marching thro ugh the streets chanting \"Kee the Teachers Alive!\" , along with reresentatives from the Ministry and th e media. As exlained by the T'LIPO resident: \"... The problem is that it is secret. People don't wan t to say the truth. AIDS is like a taboo. People don't want to r ecognize that it is a problem. We teachers want to be a role model for people to recognize this as a diseas e... To me, I just feel time is up. It's not time fo r people to be fearing , they should be happy to go to VCT [vol untary counseling and testing for HIV]. Little by little people will be used to go to VCT. ...We want to attra ct more and more to come and get tested and live positively. The fear itself and keeping it secret m akes people to die faster.\" Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 255 Challenges and Opportunities: Challenge: The alication of a ositive deviance aroach to decreasing the imact of HIV and AIDS i n the education sector is not clear-cut. Many of the ositive deviant actions identified in this resear ch rely on exensive and often unavailable external forces, wh ereas research on ositive deviant behavior related to nutrition generally uncovers simle behavior that i s within the control and the resources of the targe t oulation. For examle, in the two districts that were the original focus of this research, there was extensive and increasing access to VCT, ARV, nutrit ional suort, and sychosocial suort through existing networks of eole living with HIV/AIDS. The research revealed that information is lacking o r eole are misinformed or fearful of accessing thes e services. However, in this case, ositive devian ts can rectify gas in information and can encourage attit udinal change to access the services that are avail able in their districts. On the other hand, in areas where there is no access - or very limited access - to th ese exensive and rare external resources, the incentiv es to learn one's HIV status are limited. Potentia l ositive deviants in that situation would face a ve ry different set of challenges. Oortunity: The use of survey questionnaires to qu antify the factors revealed by the qualitative data collection is exected to rovide an estimate of th e extent of the HIV/AIDS-related ositive deviance and contribute to the PDI methodology by quantifying th ose factors identified through in-deth interviews and focus grous. Meetings with reresentatives from t he Ministry of Education resulted in other otentia l oortunities, in that the Ministry officials have been suortive of the research and are anxious to learn from the results. In fact, they encouraged the res earchers to collect data from the Central and North ern regions of Malawi, exanding beyond the original in tention to collect data only in the Southern region . ____________________________________ 1 Government of Malawi, nment of Malawi, 2003, 1. 1 Harris, Abigail M. and Schubert, Jane G. \"Defining 'Quality' in the Midst of HIV/AIDS: Rile Effects in the Classroom,\" 7 Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 256 Project Title: Ecosystem Services from Low-inut Croing Systems: Incentives to Produce Them and Value of Consuming Them Proposal #: 0527587 HSD Emphasis Area: Agents Of Change Lead PI: Scott M.

Thematic area: Agents of Change: Social, Political, and Economic D ynamics Methodologies (by objective): 1: Scaling u - Farming of 27 farm fields on Kello gg Biological Station (3 rotation entry cros (corn , soybean & wheat) X 3 treatments X 3 field sizes ove r 3 years). 2: Farmer focus grous (3 grous in each of 2 regi ons; 39 articiants total). 3: Farmer focus grous and mail survey of Michigan corn and soybean farmers (scheduled for 2007-08). 4: Mail survey of Michigan taxayers (scheduled fo r 2008-09). Recent research findings: The 2007 focus grou study found that farmers 1) ar e already adoting low-inut croing ractices tha t save labor and/or inut costs without reducing reve nues, 2) are oen to soil testing, est scouting, a nd other information-based technologies that can reduce agro chemical inut use, and 3) are reluctant to adot ractices that are erceived as having a significan t risk of reducing incomes. This last category inc ludes lanting low-value cros (such as wheat in a rotati on), lanting cover cros that can interfere with s ring lanting of major cros, and reducing agrochemical inut levels below currently recommended norms for rofitable farming. The farmers believed that the environmental benefits of certain low-inut croin g ractices, such as reduced global warming, were of greater value to society at large than to themselve s. They also doubted whether the roosed changes in t heir farming ractices would affect be as beneficia l as scientists believed (notably the global warming mit igation effect). But the farmers believed that cer tain ractices - reduced hoshorus runoff, esecially - would have greater benefits than scientists claime d. Challenges and opportunities: In addition to revealing farmer attitudes and aware ness about low-inut croing ractices, the focus grou meetings rovided oortunities to elicit w illingness-to-accet ayment information through exerimental auctions, and b) to refine questionnai re design for next year's contingent valuation mail survey of farmers.

To document how Asians/Asian-Americans are well served by imlicit suort, and Euroean- Americans are well served by exlicit suort. Thematic Areas: 1. Culture 2. Social Suort 3. Stress Methodologies: Questionnaire and exerimental investigations that draw on self reorts of stressful exeriences and/o r laboratory stress tasks to examine the imact of di fferent modes of social suort on sychological an d biological stress resonses. Recent Research Findings: Social suort is believed to be a universally valu able resource for combating stress, yet Asians/Asia n Americans reort that social suort is not helful to them, they resist seeking it, and they are underreresented among reciients of suortive ser vices. We distinguish between exlicit social suo rt (seeking and use of advice, emotional solace) and i mlicit social suort (focusing on valued relation shis) and show that Asians/Asian Americans are sychologi cally and biologically benefited more by imlicit social suort than by exlicit social suort; the reverse is true for Euroean Americans.

Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 258 Project Title: Traffic Congestion: Actions and Rea ctions Proposal #: 0527252 HSD Emphasis Area: Dynamics Of Human Behavior Lead PI: K. Triantis, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Co-PI: D. Teodorovic Collaborators: S. Sarangi, Louisiana State University and L. Razzo lini, Virginia Commonwealth University Research Goals: 1. To assess dynamic demand based strategies as an im ortant aroach for mitigating traffic congestion. 2. To understand and validate dynamic hyotheses about current and future structures of the social and transortation networks, and about their erforman ce. 3. To assess whether the level of traffic congestion d eends on the individual social interactions of drivers/co-drivers/assengers, as well as on the olicy choices made by the traffic authorities. Thematic Areas: 1. Downtown Space Inventory Control System (Y. Zha o, K. Triantis, D. Teodorovi , P. Edara) The fundamental rationale when alying reservation concets is that individual choices in terms of reserving saces in a cordon-based urban area would create dynamic variations in the utilization of th e transortation network. In this case two questions are targeted: (1) how the cordon is defined; (2) w hat is the aroriate charging scheme. 2. Intelligent Parking Systems and Their Potential Impact on Urban Congestion (Marti Roper, K. Triantis, D. Teodorovic, P. Edara) During the ast two decades, traffic authorities in several cities have begun to inform and guide driv ers to arking facilities with real-time variable message signs. This arking guidance is often art of a comrehensive urban congestion mitigation olicy. This research focuses on designing a arking reservation and a arking revenue management system for multile arking garages in the downtown area. 3. Evaluation of the Impacts of a Cordon-Based Dyn amic Traffic Congestion Pricing Policy-A System Dynamics Approach (S. Liu, K. Triantis, S. Sarangi) The objective of this research is to build a dynami c modeling framework by which olicy makers can understand the dynamic and comlex nature of trans ortation-socioeconomic systems within a downtown area. This framework rovides olicy makers with a n assessment latform which demonstrates the long- term dynamic behaviors caused by a cordon-based con gestion dynamic ricing olicy. 4. Trip Reservations for Highway Travel (P. Edara, D. Teodorovi, K. Triantis) The basic idea of Highway Sace Inventory Control S ystem (HSICS) is that all road users have to make reservations in advance to enter the highway. In t his research, highway is treated as an inventory of erishable saces. Hence a system that allocates t he highway saces temorally and satially over tim e is needed to otimize the system erformance. Imleme ntation issues and olicy considerations relevant t o the HSICS are addressed. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 259 5. Traffic Experiments (L. Razzolini, S. Sarangi) Having surveyed the existing literature in economic s on traffic flows and exeriments we decided to fo cus on two main issues: (a) toll roads and, (b) the cho ice between ublic and rivate modes of transortat ion. In the context of toll roads we examine two ossibilit ies. The first task is to investigate traffic flows when one of the two ossible routes has a toll. Next we int roduce two toll roads with different travel times a nd examine how tolls on the two roads affect traffic f lows and travel times. The second set of exeriment s focuses on the role of incentives in determining th e choice of mode of transort by commuters. 6. Heterogeneity in Networks (P. Billand, C. Brava rd, S. Sarangi) In order to study the interaction between social ne tworks and traffic flows, it is first necessary to understand the interaction between different arameters of a n etwork model and their stability in the resence of heterogeneity. The initial research examines the is sue of existence of Nash networks followed by their characterization. We then examine efficiency issues . This rovides us with an understanding of the rol e of heterogeneity which is crucial for modeling the int eraction between the two networks. Methodologies: Artificial intelligence (neural networks, fuzzy set theory), otimization, dynamic modeling, economic exeriments, game-theoretic network formation techn iques. Recent Research Findings: The reresentation of linguistic variables in a dyn amics modeling environment using fuzzy set, a management flight simulator to evaluates congestion ricing strategies, artificial intelligent formula tions of downtown and arking reservation strategies. Challenges and Opportunities: There are two oortunities, i.e., is the initiatio n of a collaborative activity with colleagues in Ch ina; and second a secial issue on traffic congestion with Transportation Planning and Technology . The main challenge continues to be the integration of the di fferent methodologies.

Satial Analysis and Comlex System Simulations 2. Urban and Transortation Geograhy 3. Urban Planning and Design 4. Public Health Methodologies: The team will gather data from six two-mile square neighborhoods in the Detroit Region. Surveys will b e mailed to 1600 households in the two Detroit neighb orhoods and 800 households in the four suburban sit es. This will enable the research team to focus on urba n form, travel behavior, hysical activity, and obe sity within the context of diverse socioeconomic conditi ons and race/ethnic oulations. Statistical method s of relevance include dummy variable regression, olyno mial regression, network structures, location-alloc ation models, and discriminant analysis. Multinomial logi t models will be used to exlore the relationshi between the built environment, hysical activity an d obesity. A dynamic satial simulation-modeling environment will be emloyed to characterize, link, and model structural determinants, feedback system s, thresholds, and individual, household, and communit y behaviors. The roject intends to integrate moder n comuting and simulation theory with urban design, two research tracts have been dissimilar enough in both language and methods to inhibit collaborative work. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 263 Recent Research Findings: The roject is still in its infancy, receiving fund ing in November 2006 and being initiated full force in January 2007. The work until now has largely concen trated on the land use analysis, the GIS maing, a nd the 3D AutoCAD modeling. The surveys will be mailed out in Setember, and they will be collected throughout October and November, with the data codi ng, statistical analysis, and comlexity modeling following throughout 2008 and 2009. Challenges and Opportunities: We are currently exloring modeling environments to include both the roosed exansion of the CAPE model develoed by Messina as art of NASA NAG 5-12 617 and also the NetLogo modeling environment. Both modeling tools allow for the inclusion of mult ile land cover tyes or multile agents. At this e arly stage in the research we are allowing the emergent research questions to dictate modeling environments rather than enforcing an inaroriately constraini ng system on the neighborhoods and Detroit context. Further, we are not re-ordaining our comlex model ing environment as it is yet to be determined which if not more than one theoretical comlex interactive s ystems are active. To date the vast majority of the geosatial modeling work has focused on database de veloment.

Alying social and Wildavsky, to assess the reso nses of FEMA, the Coast Guard, the Bush Administration, and on-site emergent grous resect ively to Hurricane Katrina. 2. Coding materials gathered from teleconference tr anscrits among federal, state, and local organizat ions during the resonse; Senate hearing testimony trans crits; government resonse assessment documents; and source-verified newsaer articles to determine the cultural bias of and change in organizations resonding to Hurricane Katrina. 3. Imlementing the coded materials as an organizat ional resonse timeline into a formalized comuter simulation of cultural theory written in Visual Bas ic.NET called Organizational Resonse and Culture i n Disaster Simulation (ORCiDS). Thematic Areas: 1. Organizational studies: management culture and change during disaster. 2. Disaster lanning and resonse: task resolution as a function of cultural bias. 3. Cultural theory simulation: formal modeling tas k resolution as a function of cultural bias. Methodologies: Key methodologies included document collection and analysis of transcrit and verified source material . Transcrits included daily teleconferences of feder al managers during the first eight days of resondi ng to Hurricane Katrina, as well as US Senate hearing tes timony, government self-assessment documents, and source-verified eriodicals. In each case, coding w as done to assess the dominant cultural bias and management style (fatalist, individualist, egalitar ian, or hierarchist) of the resonding organization and how it changed over time during disaster resonse. Addi tionally, data were used in dynamic systems modelin g using Ventana Systems VenSim software, and in forma l modeling using Visual Basic .NET to understand task resolution and how it is affected by managemen t cultural biases. Recent Research Findings: Transcrits coded in terms of cultural biases found that the Coast Guard maintained a hierarchist organizational culture, favoring a \"high-grid\" task resolution style that emhasizes adherence to orde rs and rotocol but is also imrovisation. FEMA increasingly adoted tasks, involving a \"h igh-grid\" aroach that favored orders and regulati ons, but a \"low-grou\" aroach that roved inflexible when it came to resonding to community needs. The White House tightened its individualist cultural bias, in dicating a \"low-grid\" and \"low-grou\" management st yle resulting in no clear rocedures or resonsiveness, while on-the-scene emergent grous shifted from a Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 266 slightly fatalist bias to a clearly egalitarian cul tural bias. Egalitarian grous functioned with no c lear rocedural rotocol or methods (\"low-grid\"), but r oved highly resonsive to community needs and task resolution methods (\"high-grou\").

(2006) Resolving Cris is Tasks: Organizational Cultures and Disaster Resonse, Presentation given at the Rockefeller Col lege of Public Affairs and Policy, Deartment of Pu blic Administration and Policy, State University of New York at Albany, October 19, 2006 Challenges and Opportunities: The oortunity resented by this roject is to cle arly understand how organizational culture shaes effective and ineffective disaster resonse. This a roach to coding documents also makes it ossible to quantitatively model Douglas' cultural theory to as sess its effectiveness as a framework of analysis a nd lanning for organizational resonse to disasters. In develoing the ORCiDS simulation software, our r esearch shows that treating disaster tasks as an undifferentiated quantity flow, which is the tradit ional aroach in dynamic systems modeling, did not take full advantage of the cultural theory framework. Th is is because a cultural theory model of organizati onal resonse rooses that tasks are not uniform, and c annot be reresented as a homogenous stock. Visual Basic .NET offers the necessary flow control for a model that differentiates between tasks by a two dimensional vector (grid and grou) and are resolve d by one of four different cultural biases; VenSim and its flow control was never intended for this tye o f modeling rocess.

By utilizing the strengths of t wo new modeling and analysis techniques - agent-bas ed modeling and social network analysis -- we address the following overarching question: Why, desite so much individual level effort and activity, system-l evel change is so difficult to achieve? More secifically, in this effort we will model and anal yze the roblem of understanding the emergence of system-level change in the context of three cases o f reform initiatives: school choice, small schools reform and individualized instruction through track ing. Thematic Areas: 1. agent-based modeling 2. social network analysis 3. school reform Methodologies: Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) Social Network Analysis (SNA) Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) General Linear Modeling (GLM) Clinical and Task interviews -- questions and tasks Recent Research Findings: Using data collected from a comlete network of ado lescents in one large, urban school engaged in a small schools reform, we find that the academic er formance of eers is \"contagious.\" Moreover, we find that this eer effect is easy to miss if on e only looks at the average effect. Instead, we fi nd evidence that eer effects are moderated by network structure, with students in highly dense networks of friends subject to stronger contagion. In our HLM analysis of historic achievement data fr om Chicago Public Schools, we find that amount of the variance in high school student achievement that can be attributed to differences is schools is aroximately 45%, but decreases to about 10% when controlling for rior achievement. Although small, there seem to be statistically significant d ifferences in school effects across schools that ar e stable over time. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 268 Using SNA of enrollment atterns in Chicago Public schools, we have also confirmed that, for the most art, students are indeed leaving low achievin g schools for higher achieving schools, with higher achieving students more likely to choose not to attend their assigned school. Using SNA of freshmen eer friendshi structures we find that communities (grous of friends) redict 35% of math achievement. We also find that the eer grous redict 9% of the change in math achievement (growth). Further, including eer grous in general linear models (GLMs) adds significant redictive ower (10% for achievement a nd 7% for growth) even controlling for math teacher, demograhics (including race, gender, and age), small schools, and revious achievement (8 th grade math scores). Using clinical and task interviews with one higher achieving and one lower achieving eer community we find significant differences in the no rms of the two communities. This exloratory work is intended to account for the correlations be tween eer grous and achievement. The findings suggest that higher erforming eer grous are run ing their old friendshis to establish stronger tie s with their resent academic community. Additionally , the higher erforming community is more likely to do low consequence academic tasks (e.g., homework, and tutoring sessions) with their eer grou than the lower erforming community. Further, it aears that the lower erforming community members may be doing more outside of scho ol to reare for future contingencies that do not include higher education. Challenges and Opportunities: With resect to our work on school choice, our rim ary challenge is collecting data that will give us a greater understanding of how households decide wh ich schools to attend. This information can then be combined with our school effects finding in an agent-based model of school choice in Chicago that gives us a better idea of what emergen t outcomes are reasonable to exect in choice- based reforms. With resect to our work on eer effects, the rima ry challenge is investigating our initial findings in other settings. Our current work comes only from d ata collected in one school. This asect of our work has imlications for our other two cases as we ll, both small schools reform (which attemts to change student social structure), and tracking refo rms, which grou students by ability levels.

The rototye industry is the tart ch erry industry which is 1) highly sensitive to climate ex tremes and threshold events, 2) reflects the limite d adatation strategies of any industry that has long lanning horizons and long-term investments, and 3 ) currently is undergoing a substantial evolution in terms of emerging roduction areas in central Euro e.

Develo tools for assessing coastal communities' be st otions for rotecting themselves from hurricane and tsunami surge hazards. 2. Develo comrehensive and integrated models of surg e imacts, warning transmission, and evacuation behavior. Thematic Areas: 1. Coastal hazards - tsunami and hurricane 2. Scenario simulation 3. Casualty and damage models Methodologies: To achieve our research goals, a comrehensive scen ario simulator for hurricane and tsunami hazards is being develoed. The simulator integrates models of surge imact, warning transmission, decision-making, evacuation behavior, and evaluatio n of casualties and damages. The following comonents are under develoment: rational and qua ntitative models for casualties and damages; behavi or models to determine rearation times rior to evac uation; traffic models for evacuation. Their develo ment requires close interdiscilinary collaboration, sa nning the fields of social and behavioral science, information technology, geosatial information scie nce, and hydrodynamics. Cyberinfrastructure suort is making it ossible to integrate the functionality o f these models and aly usability engineering to m ake them suitable for use by emergency managers, land u se lanners, and transortation lanners along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts. Recent Research Findings: Note that a rototye of the simulator was resente d at the 2006 PI Meeting. While the framework of simulator is continually being imroved, the follow ing models that are incororated in the simulator h ave been develoed: 1) tsunami forces on onshore struct ures, and 2) casualty evaluation. The first rovide s ractical means for evaluating the structural damag e caused by tsunamis ( J. Disaster Res. , in ress). Using the second model, we found that biological and hys iological disadvantages make a significant differen ce in casualty rate from tsunamis. Interestingly, gender and age discriminations in casualties become most ronounced when a tsunami is marginally strong; the difference tends to diminish as tsunami strength increases (MS in rearation). We also analyzed a w ide variety of field observations - from hydrodynam ics to human behaviors - in India for the 2004 Indian O cean Tsunami (ASCE J. Waterway, Port, Coastal, Ocean Eng., in ress). Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 272 Challenges and Opportunities: The scenario simulations involve many elements, inc luding hydrodynamics, warning transmission, evacuation, human behavior, and social and environm ental imacts. Once the rototye simulator is comleted, it should give researchers in all asect s of coastal hazard sciences and lanning an exeri ence similar to that obtained in a real field investigat ion. In running the simulations and evaluating the results, critical roblems will be identified for imrovemen t in each secialized area. The simulation exercise will also rovide a valuable common background from whi ch to forge and maintain coherence in the broadly distributed multidiscilinary coastal-hazards commu nity. Hence, further generalizing the simulator be an oortunity to enhance and exedite collaboratio n for natural hazards research.

Develoing effective treatment effect models to estimate the socioeconomic and ecological effects induced by imlementing the rograms; 3. Integrating exertise and aroaches in landsca e ecology, social science, remote sensing, and clim ate change. Recent Research Findings: 1. The rograms have been imlemented differently, and thus their imacts vary. In some areas they hav e been very successful, while in other areas they hav e failed; the success or failure has much to do wit h the effectiveness of the local schemes of rogram e xecution and follow-u monitoring and management. 2. Biodiversity, measured in terms of multilicity and variation of secies and the structure of regio nal ecosystems have seen imrovement in certain laces. 3. While carbon stored in the vegetation of regiona l ecosystems has trended u, that stored in the soi l has not increased at the best due to continued, severe erosion. 4. Livelihoods of households and communities have b een mostly affected in ositive ways, but the in- discriminatory, to-down aroach to rogram imlem entation is inefficient, and the transition to a more sustainable economy has been slow to come by. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 274 Challenges and Opportunities: 1. China's ecological restoration efforts carry som e tremendous domestic and international imlication s in terms of both economics and ecology; 2. The acquisition and rocessing of a large number of satellite images and the develoment of an eros ion simulation model have taken more time and effort th an exected; 3. Collaborating with Chinese scientists is very be neficial. But it has been slow to come due to the segmentation of the research community in China and their lack of familiarity with international research develoments and ractices; 4. Done roerly, the Chinese government is willing to listen to what's been suggested by internationa l research, and is thus willing to take actions in im roving its olicy, which suggests that rojects li ke this can and will make a significant imact; 5. Assessing the environmental and socioeconomic im acts of China's ecological restoration rograms wi ll lay a solid foundation for ecosystem service evalua tion and comensation, which will offer some great follow-u research oortunities. Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 275 Project Title: See Where I'm Looking: Using Shared University Kuhlen, Mark Research Goals: 1. Cognition is usually studied in eole acting al one, but much of everyday human behavior requires interacting or collaborating with other eole. Our goal is to study cognition, esecially visual sear ch, in collaborative tasks. Collaborating has obvious bene fits, but it also requires coordination, which has its costs. 2. For this roject, we created a shared gaze syste m in which two remotely located artners can view t he same scene with each other's eyegaze cursor suerim osed over it. This enables artners to monitor each other's attentional focus in real time and wit h more recision than in face-to-face configuration s. 3. Using this system, we are exloring the effects of shared gaze alone and in combination with seech in tasks with increasing comlexity: search tasks, sea rch + consensus tasks, and tracking tasks (with moving targets). Thematic Areas: 1. Collaborative cognition 2. Visual search in naturalistic environments 3. Interactive multi-modal communication and coordi nation Methodologies: We conduct laboratory exeriments in which human su bjects erform collaborative tasks alone, in airs, or in small grous (currently, 4). In these, we combi ne techniques and tasks from the field of visual at tention (PI Zelinsky's field) with those from sycholinguis tics of soken dialogue (Co-PI Brennan's field). Ou r exerimental tasks include that rely on 3-D simulat ion and the rocessing of 3-D information that enab le maing between the ersectives of two artners lo cated at different oints in an environment (Co-PI Samara's area of exertise). In addition to our rototying efforts on the share d gaze system used for the 2-erson exeriments (an d single erson controls), we are imlementing and ex loring the use of different visual and temoral reresentations of a artner's focus of attention. While the main focus of the roject is on collabora tion between remotely located artners, some of our exeriments look at how airs of co-resent eole interacting face-to-face use visible and soken cue s about each others' focus of attention. In Hanna & B rennan (2007), we reort evidence that eole use information about where a artner is looking to dis ambiguate referring exressions early (before heari ng the whole exression). Project Updates - By PI Last Name Human and Social Dynamics 2007 Grantees Conference - Page 276 Recent Research Findings: In a collaborative O-in-Qs search task, airs of co llaborating artners erformed better than solitary searchers. In comarisons of collaborating via voi ce alone shared gaze alone (SG), or shared gaze and voice (SG+V), search in the shared gaze condition was bes t of all: twice as fast and efficient as solitary s earch. In fact artners can successfully communicate and coor dinate joint search using shared gaze alone (in thi s task, quickly dividing u the dislay and following a \"Lo ok where I'm not looking\" strategy, with the first artner to finish assisting the slower artner). Strikingly , and somewhat surrisingly, SG search was faster t han with voice added (SG+V); In this task, which terminated as soon as one artner found the target, seaking incurred substantial costs. This exeriment is reo rted in Brennan, Chen, Dickinson, Neider, & Zelinsk y (2007) and has been resented at several conference s. The shared gaze rototye was introduced at the 2005 meeting of the Vision Sciences Society (Zelins ky, Dickinson, Chen, Neider, & Brennan, 2005). In a more comlex search task that required both a rtners to fixate and achieve consensus on a target (a snier in an urban landscae), being able to commun icate with shared gaze and voice (SG+V) enabled the artner who first found the target to alert the oth er artner so that artner could align gaze with th e first artner (\"Look where I'm looking\"). Our current ex eriments examine collaborative tracking of moving targets, the effects of different gaze cursor rere sentations of a artner's attention, satial divisi on of visual search labor among 4-erson grous, and whether the interretation of a seaker's eye gaze is automatic/reflexive (as oosed to a more flexible and adative cue). Challenges and Opportunities: Oortunities: On the technological front, our shar ed gaze system imroves the ability of remotely loc ated team members to communicate satial and dynamic inf ormation quickly and efficiently under time ressur e. On the scientific front, our studies are enabling u s to better understand how eole use verbal and no n- verbal cues to coordinate their attention in tasks of varying comlexity, with and without time ressu re. Challenges: Currently our shared gaze exeriments u se EyeLink head-mounted eye-trackers worn by stationary remote artners, whose movement through an environment is simulated. We would like to transfer our system to a latform that enables wire less oeration for tasks that require moving throug h an environment. For exerimental tasks on stationary collaborators, we would like to move to a desk-moun ted or screen-mounted latform that enables automatic c ature and calibration of the user's face and eyega ze. Conclusion: The coordination of joint satial refer encing is dramatically affected by the availability of shared gaze information. When artners are either co-resent in the same environment or able to share visual information remotely, they can use where eac h other is looking as a coordination device. A ar tner's eye gaze rovides incremental and highly sensitive information that is missing from more intentional f orms of ointing with a mouse or other inut device. A g aze or a glance may be not only instrumental (neces sary for erforming a satial task), but also informativ e (one artner may be able to use this information in interreting another's utterance or intentions), or even communicative (the gazer may actually intend for the artner to recognize a meaning and may oint with t he eyes. Shared gaze affords a highly efficient me thod of coordinating arallel activity in a time-critica l satial task. References: Brennan, S. E., Chen, & Zelinsky, G. (2007; In ress).
