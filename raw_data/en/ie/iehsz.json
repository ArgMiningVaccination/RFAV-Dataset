I look at the quality of stu-dent successes not on how wellthey answer questions, but howwell they ask questions and thequality of questions. Look'at a whole array of ideas and conceptsand piece it together. Challengeyour own prejudices. Put togetherethics. Put together 3'value sys-tem. Thaf 8 for educators. Govern-ment, I guess, is government ofthe people and its response to theelectorate. We could do it nmchbetter if our representativeswould be representatives. Q. And business?A. Business will do what peoplewant. If people decide they don'twant something, it doesn't takethe business sector very long torealize it.In lectures, I role-model a per-son running for office and I tellmy students that if elected I'mgoing to put a $4 to *5 surchargeon a gallon of gasoline. Gas isway too cheap. If you paid $3 or $6for a gallon of gasoline, thingswould change enough that atti-tudes would change. Then I ask ifI would be elected. I can't be elect-ed.' Even students, idealisticyoung people from an environ-mental perspective, don't wantthat sort of economic mandate.But these are the sorts of thingsnecessary to influence the changewe want to see.There is no silver bullet if weare going to have to reduce car-bon emissions by 3 or 4 billiontons annually to address globalwarming.

The GreatLakes are just a tragedy. On asmaller scale, it's a tragedy on theFox River. I think that whole con-taminated sediment business \u2014we've got to get through that de-bate. As a scientist, I don'.t knowfor sure what the role^of fCBs is.But as an environmentalist, Iwould argue that you have todraw a line.

There ar\"Bsome responsibilities, I think,that can be shared. The bottomline is really to do something. Weneed to get that sys^m cleanedup. We owe it to the next genera-tion. We need a resource here inGreen Bay which is usable, recre-ationally usable. You have to becareful in the science. But I em-brace the philosophy that if we'regoing to err, let's err on the side ofthe environment. Q. Is the Fox River a test ofhow the system is gotnf to re-spond to problems? -A. Yes. We could do nothing andthings would ultimately change.But we're dealing with decades,with centuries really. What are Wegoing to accept as quality environ-ment? Do we want to be able tofish in the Fox River and be able toeat those fish? A lot of us say wedon't care. Then we have a Hmongpopulation utilizing that resourceand we need to be concerned. I'dlike to see people say they want tobe able to use this resource. Towant to be able to go swim at BayBeach and want to be able to fishthe walleyes, eat them once in awhile and not be worried. Q. How do you put a cost onthat?A. I don't know. We can put dol-lar signs on many kinds of things,but we have difficulty putting dol-lar signs on what healthy ecosys-tems are. What's the value of awetland? What's the value of awalleye fishery? I guess you coulddo the walleye fishery \u2014 measurethe fees paid, etc. I've been aroundlong enough to realize it's notgoing to make any environmentalsense unless it can make econom-ic sense. When we do that, thenwe can say it might cost us $700minion lu *t>uu mmnm \\o un-aii -the Fox River. But over a 50-yearspan that is miniscule comparedto the economic value of ahealthy system. Q. Is there preventive value?People see the river and -say,\"Left not let this happen again.\",A. I would hope that would be 'part of the thinking. The river'scome a long way in the 30 yearsI've been here. The collegeTi'asbeen documenting fish popula-tions in the rivet- and that's quitehigh, it's quite diverse in terms ofspecies. We're gt'iu\"predorninat\u00a3dby carp and catfish, but it's, made;remarkable changes in-te'rmrof-/environmental health. Look at thepotentialfor lamprey. (People)think of the lamprey as thispredator that decimated the lakesfish population. But it's a verypersnickety critter. It needs verygood water to spawn. The FoxRiver is getting to the point wherewe have to be concerned aboutlampreys getting into Lake Win-nebago.We have probably one of themost pronounced world-classwalleye fisheries right here belowthe dam, but unfortunately it'snot usable \u2014 not usable in thesense of the warnings of PCB andmercury contamination. ManyWisconsin lakes have mercury ad-visories. Where does it comefrom? It comes globally from theatmosphere. But if we're going tofind someone to blame, by far themost significant source of mercury is coming down in precipita-tion from coal-powered utilities. Q. How big a concern are inva-sive species such as purpleloosestrife and zebra mussels?A. They change the system.Once something gets Into the sys-tem, it's very hard to clear out.The zebra mussel is an interest-ing story. It does a wonderful Jobcleaning up water. Yet it's occupy-ing about every square centimeter of the (bottom). It out-com-petes by far native mussels andclams. That's a concern. Rightnow, these huge windrows ofmussel shells on the bay, what doyou do with them? You can't land-fill it. It's toxic waste. It's gotPCBs in it. You've got to go to real-ly far remote places to find unper-turbed ecosystems. I do that whenI take students into the rain forestof Central America.We will need to live our lives,but there are some species thatoverwhelm the system and driveit <-'ineaaous~numDen?Kmiexamples I like to use is if theChinese decided to drink just onemore beer a year, it would takethe entire grain production ofNorway.

Watching your own kidsgrow up, you don't see them growup unless you get pictures ofthem. As we live in a communityfor a long period of time, we ac-cept change and all of us look atchange differently. Some of us say,\"Hey, it is a better place becauseof these opportunities.\" Somewill say, \"It's hot what it used tobe.\" There is no clear-cut answer.Attitude is the local part of it.As an environmentalist, as anecologist, I have some real con-cerns for society We have to liter-ally save the planet. Wa have to beconvinced that we are in thia raceto save the planet. We only have 40years to save it. If we don't reducepollution, if we don't reduce Car-bon, it we don't do somethingabout acid rain, if we continue tolet business go as usual, in 30 or40 years things will be such thatwe cannot change. - \"You need to go to a place likeLima or Bangkok. Then you get adifferent perspective on what Itmeans to not have the resourceswe have.

Lower Fox Rivernamed as forcleanup of toxic wasteWASHINGTON (AP) - TheClinton administration says it willask Congress to steer an extra $50million to the Great Lakes statesnext year to help clean up the worsttoxic hot spots.The initiative would make GreatLakes communities eligible formatching grants to help restorewaterways for drinking, fishing,swimming, boating and urbandevelopmentJP$jple want to see the GreatLakes cleaned up,\" said Vice Presi-dent ^1Gore, who announced the. proposal. \"After a while, if an, effortthis size continues, it's going to\"have a huge impact\"The money for the lakes' 31 mostpolluted sites, if provided by Con-gress, would be distributed basedon a competition, with the winnersrequired to kick in 40 percent of thetotal, wetlands or make otherimprovements.; ; It would be in addition to some$17 million worth of other GreatLakes-targeted cleanup programs,plus the region's share of Super-fund money, Environmental Protec-tion Agency waterways fundingand the portion of the Army Corpsof Engineers budget devoted toGreat Lakes work.Even all of that though, is smallcompared with the needs of the 31polluted sites, which along with adozen in Canada were designated\"areas of concern\" in 1987 by theU.S.-Canadian International JointSTATE SITES|3\u00bb f!**' Commission.Total need, said if it isn't enough to get\u00a3h\u00a3 jobdone. ,i ;-\u00ab/:;.Gore said the expected budgetsurplus will make the spending pos-sible.Dealing with the areas of con-cern, which environmentalistsgenetically refer to as \"the hotspots,\" has been a vexing problemfor more than 30 years. . '\u00abAll over the Great Lakes, yearsof unchecked factory' dischargedhave left a legacy of toxic god thatstates can't aflbrd to clean up andcan't afford to leave alone. ' ;- RIVER: Corps studying possibility of cleanup involvementFrom A-1 > bility in'the cleanup.Both state and federal regulatorssupport the. study.\"We look forward to having theCorps of Engineers bring theirexpertise and resources to the FoxRiver and Green Bay cleanup pro-ject,\" said DNR Secretary GeorgeMeyer.The study will identify federalbenefits that would flow from thecleanup and determine what rolethe corps might play. It will relylargely on years of costly scientificanalysis already conducted by theDNR and by the U.S. Fish &Wildlife Service.Although the corps traditionallyuses dredging as a tool to enablenavigation, it can also dredge forother reasons.\"In this particular case, thedredging would be to make sure thenatural habitat is protected,\" LynnDuerod, a corps spokeswoman,said Wednesday.Boosting local recreation bymaking fish safe to eat could alsobe considered a legitimate reasonfor corps involvement, officialssaid.DNR officials said one possiblebenefit of corps involvement, inaddition to its expertise in naviga-tional dredging and sediment han-dling, would be the ability to directfederal funds toward the cleanupwithout having to place the Fox.River on the National Priority Listof Superfund sites.The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency has proposed the riveras a Superfund site, but has held offon making that designation while itfunds a risk assessment and feasi-bility study (RIFS) which is beingconducted by the DNR.A draft RIFS was released inFebruary 1999. The final RIFS anda proposed cleanup plan are sched-uled to be released by the DNR andthe EPA in late spring or early sum-mer. That will be followed by a perkod of public comment and theUperhaps early next year, by a final,decision on the cleanup plan, eithermandated or negotiated.EPA officials have said a Super-,fund designation - which has-been opposed by the DNR and byGov. Tommy Thompson - can be?averted if the Fox River Groupnegotiates a cleanup plan with reg-ulators, a plan that will likely cost,the companies hundreds of mil-lions of dollars. <Environmental organizations,such as the Clean Water ActionCouncil, support Superfund desig-nation because it would authorizethe tfnmediate use of federal moneyto begin the cleanup, money whichcould be recovered through legalaction against the paper compa-nies.The six paper companies are onthe hook because they dischargedtons- of polychlorinated biphenylsinto the river before the ban ontheir use hi 1976. PCBs are knownto cause reproductive failure insome sp6cies of fish-eating mam-mals and birds. The long-lastingindustrial compound also beenlinked to developmental problemsin the;children'of mothers who reg-ularly ate contaminated fish.Although the discharges werelegal) the companies are still liablefor the cleanup costs under stateand federal environmental law.An. infusion of federal moneythrough the corps, and possiblystate money, could reduce that lia-bility^ ;Area residents and municipalofficials have voiced general sup-port, : for such shared fundingthrough public meetings and dis-cussion groups hosted by both fed-eral and, .state agencies..'^[^municipalities would bene-fiipfrbm' a. negotiated cleanupbecause, they are not currentlybeing held liable for the cost.If the Fox River is designated asa Superfund site, however, and thecase is litigated in court, areamunicipalities could be named ascodefendants because PCBs movedthrough wastewater treatmentplants. Other businesses that hadlesser roles in the transportation ofPCBs could also'be dragged in.The $100,000 inquiry is beingcalled a reconnaissance study.Jinane Karmo, project manager forthe corps, said she will report toCongress on the results of the studyin July or August, about the timethe DNR and the EPA release thefinal RIFS and cleanup plan.Congress would then have to,appropriate a significant sum ofmoney to fund any corps participa-tion in the cleanup, officials said.Such.an action would likely bedependent on the success of nego-tiations between the Fox RiverGroup and state and federal regula-tors.Members of the Fox RiverGroup are Fort James Corp., P.H.Glatfelter Company, RiversidePaper Corp., U.S. Paper MillsCorp., Wisconsin Tissue Mills Inc.,Appleton Papers Inc., and NCRCorp., a owner work .'V'\"'^.'''' __ !

Behrens said.Even though less contaminated sed-iment was removed then expected,Behrens said there Is nothing firmindicating the DNR will return tothe area near Fort James Mill. - ,\"Going back will depend on ifthere is enough money left and if theFRG is interested in it,\" Behrenssaid.Besides information from the testsites, the various peer review ofwater modeling of the river willdetermine if the models are good orif they need to be reworked, Lindleyadded.\"Hopefully 2000 will give us agood blueprint of what the FoxRiver is like,\" he said.The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency has said if the FoxRiver Group is willing to implementa protective remedy, it would not listIhe site on the National Priority List,or Superfund.30 - 5.

The same models showthat after an aggressive cleanup,which could take a decade, mostfish could be safe to eat within 12years.The companies dispute this.Their experts have developed acomputer model that shows theriver cleaning itself to safe levelswithin 25 years, making massiveenvironmental dredging unneces-sary.At an all-day conference Fridayin Neenah, attended by only ahandful of area residents, the FRGexperts presented their model tothe panel of scientists. The panel,chosen by the American Geologi-cal Institute, turned out to be atough group. FRG experts weregrilled for hours, facing rigorous,and sometimes critical question-ing. I;At one point, panelist StiveChapra of Tufts University deter-'mined that one reason for the dif-fering results was that FRGexperts plugged different assump-tions and different estimates onhistoric PCB discharges into theirmodel. ;He asked the FRG experts/ifthey ran the DNR's model changed assumptions and fig- Please see DISPUTES, EP3 , WIS.

Instead, the DNR wasrepresented by cleanup managersGreg Hill, chief of the agency'swater quality monitoring section,and Ed Lynch, who is managingthe final Fox River feasibility studyand cleanup plan due out nextspring.When Chapra asked if he andother panelists could contact DNRmathematicians directly, he wastold they would have to put theirquestions in writing and send them .through Hill.\"That's unacceptable,\" Chaprashot back. He said he didn't care jabout the politics.\"As for anything else, we are justhere to do a job and be objectiveabout it,\" Chapra said.Lynch referred to a contractsigned in January 1997 by the FRGcompanies and the DNR. Underthat contract, the FRG companiesprovided $10 million to fund a pilotdredging project in the river.The companies also agreed towork cooperatively with the DNRto develop methods to test, andpossibly enhance, computer mod-els being used to develop thecleanup plan. The deadline for thatwork, which remains unfinished.was February 1998.\"The DNR has been frustratedthat the FRG has not been timelyin efforts to cooperatively completethe model evaluation process,\"Lynch told the- panel. \"The FRGdid not follow the process in thedevelopment of their alternativemodel.\"In presenting the FRG modelFriday, consultant John Wolfe saidit used recent studies on erosionand deposition that were conduct-ed in the Fox River and more accu-rately portrayed the burial of morehighly contaminated sedimentsunder cleaner sediments.But when FRG consultants dis-played model diagrams showingdeposition upon deposition in theriver, with little erosion, they werequestioned sharply by panelistWilliam Lick of the University ofCalifornia-Santa Barbara, who is sowell known that one of the equa-tions used to calculate, sheer stresson sediments bears his name.\"You have no erosion in the nar- ]row part of the channel?\" he asked,clearly finding this unusual. JFRG consultants replied thattheir models showed the depositingof sediments would more thanmake up for any erosion.The panel is expected to com-plete its review of the models byFebruary. Whether the DNR willinclude its work in the feasibilitystudy remains uncertain.Wolfe said the panel is so wellqualified, its recommendationscould hardly be ignored.\"The views of these experts canonly enhance the quality of said. as well as patients.

The river's PCBs aregradually spreading into Green Bay.In October, the pilot project seemed apromising step toward a large-scalecleanup. Mills and the Department ofNatural Resources expected 80,000 cubicyards of contaminated material to besucked from the river by hydraulicdredges. On-land processing would re-move PCBs for safe deposit in landfills.But as winter nears, less than 40 per-cent of the material \u2014 about 30,000.cubic yards \u2014 has been removed.

ButCongress has not renewed thosetaxes since they expired In 1995,and the trust fund is running outof money.There is about $1.5 billion left -enough to last through fiscal 2001,Environmental Protection Agen-cy officials said.By spending general revenue onSuperfund, Congress preventedthe trust fund from being depletedas quickly, buying time to try topass legislation to overhaul thecleanup process without shuttingdown the program.But many lawmakers, businessleaders and environmentalists areskeptical that Congress will ac-complish much when it recon-venes.\"Bottom line \u2014 the odds are forcontinued inaction next year,\"said Sen.

DNRofficials have described the indus-try computer model as beingflawed.The DNR's computer model - arefinement of a model already inuse by the U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency - predict that with-out action, PCBs in the river willremain dangerous for more than acentury.The'FRG model predicts PCBcontamination in fish tissues andin the water column will decline tosafe levels just as quickly if noaction is taken as it would if mil-lions of cubic yards of contaminat-ed sediments are removed from theriver through environmental dredg-ing.Both FRG paper company offi-'lcials and AGI scientists said their Inew study will be independent of Iany influence from its sponsors. *\"We have not even been in con- Please ; s RIVER, A-8.

Other members are SteveChapra of Tufts University, JamesBonner of Texas A&M University.Louis Thibodeaux of LouisianaS' University, William Lick oft. niversity of California-SantaBaroara, and Kevin Parley of Man-hattan College.All hold doctorate degrees andare : described by the AmericanGeological Institute as experts inthe development of computer mod-els and the fate of PCBs in river sys-tems.Keane said none have worked onFox River issues before, and allhave been asked to sign conflict-of-interest statements to ensure theirobjectivity.The scientists have been asked toreview the existing computer mod-els that have played a key part inthe contentious Fox River cleanupdebate.Lindley said ERA and DNR offi-cials have decided not to conductan independent peer review of theirwork, which he called a commonpractice in scientific fields.DNR officials say this is nottrue; the model they are using hasalready been extensively peerreviewed.\"It has been peer reviewed morethan once,\" said Bruce Baker,deputy administrator for theDNR's division of water.Baker said the FRG companiesagreed in a 1997 contract with theDNR and the state Justice Depart-ment to participate in an evaluationof the computer model being usedin ' Fox River evaluation.He said the company has consis-tently failed to produce work onthat evaluation called for under thecontract.\"We feel we are being genuineand living up to our original agree-ment,\" Baker said. \"We are stillpushing to complete that effort,and are still having some troublegetting them to live up to their partt)f the agreement\"As part of the new, industry-sponsored review, the six scientistswill be host to a public hearing thisfall somewhere in the Fox Valley forresidents to offer comments andask questions.Keane said the DNR and EPAwill be invited to participate in theprocess as well. He said the panel'sfinal report, due by March, willlook at the strengths and weakness-es of existing models.EPA spokesman Mick Hans_saidthe agency hasn't yet toparticipate in the review, \"but as arule we're wide open to anythingthat continues the dialogue.\" Post-Crescent staff writer Ed Similar Contents Fox River Group takes issue with DNR againBy Karl EbertOf the Northwestern The group of paper companies responsible for PCB contaminationin the LowerFox River are upping the pressure on the science thatundergirds an evolvingplan to remove PCBs from the river and taking a top stateDepartment ofNatural Resources official to task for opposing part of anongoing review ofriver science. The Fox River Group is taking exception to comments made byBruce Baker, theDNR's Lower Fox River team leader, explaining the agency'sdecision not toparticipate in recent National Research Council forums on PCB cleanuptechniques. The September meetings, held in Green Bay, are part of acongressionallyordered study of the human and ecological risks of variouscleanupapproaches, including dredging, capping and letting nature takeits course. In news reports, Baker said the agency wouldn't participate inthe forumsbecause officials saw the meetings as an industry-drivenattempt to callinto question the safety and effectiveness of dredging. The study, which is being overseen by the National Academy ofSciences, wasordered by Congress in response to a request by GeneralElectric Corp.,which faces a large-scale cleanup on New York's Hudson River. In a letter to DNR Secretary George Meyer, the Fox River Groupof papercompanies said Baker's comments imply an unwillingness tolisten to whatoutside experts have to say about river cleanup issues. \"What is most egregious about Mr. Baker's comments is hisimplication thatprivate companies can somehow influence the NAS and it'sconclusions.Congress - not private companies - charged the NAS to conductthis review ofnational sediment policy,\" the group wrote. On Friday, Baker reiterated the agency's objections to the NASeffort. \"The history is pretty clear and factual that this was theresult of GEgoing to Congress, in a joint effort with other companies, inan attempt toblock any dredging,\" Baker said. \"They couldn't do that, so thefallback wasto ask NAS to look into dredging and see if somehow call itinto question.\" The study requirement was added as a rider to the U. S.EnvironmentalProtection Agency's funding appropriation last year, by Rep.Gerald Solomon,R-N.Y., whose district includes contaminated stretches of theHudson. Aproposed moratorium on dredging died in the face of athreatened veto byPresident Clinton. GE and the EPA have been scrapping over cleaning up the Hudsonsince 1980,when the river was listed as a federal Superfund cleanup site. \"It's clearly an industry-driven initiative,\" Baker said. David Lee, a spokesman for P.H. Glatfelter Co., said it wassurprising thatthe DNR chose not to participate in a discussion about theeffectiveness ofdredging, especially since its governmental partners, includingEPA and theU.S. Fish and wildlife Service participated. \"Here's a very reputable group, mandated by Congress to come upwith someanswers, and the DNR does a slam dunk on their credibility.That's what Ifind pretty outrageous,\" Lee said. \"For groups to be taking aposition andholding on to their beliefs without letting neutral groupsassess theinformation and give their read on it, that's wrong.\" Meanwhile, the companies have agreed to pay for a peer reviewby theAmerican Geological Institute of the models used by the DNR topredict themovement and fate of the roughly 63,000 pounds of PCBsremaining in the39-mile contaminated stretch of the river between Neenah andGreen Bay. The Fox River Group has raised guestions about the accuracy ofassumptionswithin the DNR model - a computer program designed to simulateand predictchanges caused by the flow of the river. The group has spentmillion todevelop its own model, which the group claims shows that PCBsare beingnaturally covered by clean sediment and are not moving downriver to GreenBay at the rate predicted by the DNR's model. The companies and DNR are at loggerheads over the competingmodels, whichprompted the Fox River Group to use part of the $10 million ithas agreed topay for river study to have the models evaluated independently. DNR officials say they are comfortable with the existing model,which hasbeen developed over more than a decade of study. \"The DNR is not receptive to reconsidering their model, andrather than forus to stand in two separate corners, we thought there's bemerit in havingan independent group take a look at the models and draw aconclusion thathopefully has some credibility,\" Lee said. AGI, a not-for-profit federation of 34 earth sciencesorganization, willevaluate both models and release a report early next year. Baker said the agency is open to adjusting its model to incorporate commentsfrom the A GI review as well as other comments it has already received. But, he said, changes to the model would affect only a portionof theRemedial Investigation and Feasibility Study, or RI/FS, thatwill serve asthe underpinning of a cleanup effort. \"They're trying to portray it as playing a significant role inthe RI/FS butif you look at it, it's a minor role,\" Baker said. \"It dealswith only onealternative - the no action alternative - and that's the onethey prefer.But most of the cleanup options are being driven by a riskassessment andthat doesn't depend on the model. The risk assessment is a separate evaluation of the risk of PCBexposure tothe environment and human health. The EPA has agreed to provide up to $2 million to fund anexpansion of thestudy to include all of Green Bay, which was not included inthe DNR's draftevaluation. The additional work will push back release of the next draft ofthe RI/FS toearly summer. The document was originally scheduled for releasein January.

(AP) - The group of paper companies responsiblefor PCBcontamination in the Fox River want to know why a top stateDepartment ofNatural Resources official decided not to participate in recentforums onsediment cleanup. DNR Fox River team leader Bruce Baker refused to participate inlast month'sforums conducted by the National Research Council in Green Baybecauseofficials saw the meetings as an industry-driven attempt to call intoquestion the safety and effectiveness of dredging. The forums are part of a congressionally ordered study of thehuman andecological risks of various cleanup approaches, includingdredging of PCBs,or polychlorinated biphenyls, that were widely used in themaking ofcarbonless paper and other products at paper mills along theFox before theywere banned in the 1970s. The study, which is overseen by the National Academy ofSciences, wasordered by Congress in response to a request by GeneralElectric Corp.,which faces a large-scale cleanup on New York's Hudson River. Baker's comments imply an unwillingness to listen to whatoutside expertshave to say about river cleanup issues, the Fox River Group, aconsortium ofpaper companies negotiating with environmental agencies on theFox Rivercleanup, said in a letter to DNR Secretary George Meyer. \"What is most egregious about Mr. Baker's comments is hisimplication thatprivate companies can somehow influence the NAS and it' sconclusions,\" theletter said. \"Congress - not private companies - charged theNAS to conductthis review of national sediment policy.\" Baker Friday reiterated the agency's objections to the NASeffort.\"The history is pretty clear and factual that this was theresult of GEgoing to Congress, in a joint effort with other companies, inan attempt toblock any dredging,\" Baker said. \"They couldn't do that, so thefallback wasto ask NAS to look into dredging and see if somehow call itinto question.\" GE and the Environmental Protection Agency have been scrappingover cleaningup the Hudson since 1980, when the river was listed as afederal Superfundcleanup site. \"It's clearly an industry-driven initiative,\" Baker said. It is surprising the DNR didn't participate in a discussionabout theeffectiveness of dredging, especially since the EPA and theU.S. Fish andWildlife Service participated in it, said David Lee, aspokesman for P.H,Glatfelter Co, a member of the Fox River group. \"Here's a very reputable group, mandated by Congress to come up with someanswers, and the DNR does a slam dunk on their credibility.That's what Ifind pretty outrageous,\" Lee said. Meanwhile, the paper companies have agreed to pay for a peerreview by theAmerican Geological Institute of the models used by the DNR topredict themovement and fate of the roughly 63,000 pounds of PCBsremaining in the39-mile contaminated stretch of the river between Neenah andGreen Bay. _Jur i. ion:The Press-Gazette strives, as it has since 1915, to be the primary>rovider of information in NortheastefrvWisconsin, keeping the wel-are and development of the Greater Green.

Such unitywill be essential as the InternationalJoint Commission continues the vitalwork of healing and protecting them.Efforts must include: Commitment to guard against backsliding on pollution control and remedialwork. Willingness to consider more regufation if sound science shows new threats Adequate government funding to ersure independent scientific study andmonitoring.The five Great Lakes are the dominanfeature of a vast region shared by theUnited States and Canada. Millions ofpeople live along the lakes and dependon them for water, recreation, trans-portation and commerce.

Water is a spe-cial liquid with important anom-alous properties around which lifeis built. It can exist in three forms:solid (ice. snow), liquid and vaporIsleam). All three forms are tem-perature-dependent. It boils at 100degrees Celsius and freezes at 0degrees C. Its density is highest at4 degrees C, which is actually ablessing for fish because whenwater freezes, the denser waterremains liquid at the bottomwhere fish can survive.Water is considered a universalsolvent and helps in diffusion,osmosis, electrokinetics, and otherday-tcKlay functions of the living.Most dissolved materials increaseits boiling point to above 100degrees C. depress its freezingpoint to less than 0 degrees C, andcan decrease surface tension.What is pollution? There arcmany definitions based on levelsof allocations for an industry at aset location. In general, pollutionmeans any change, positive or neg-ative, from the natural state. Forexample, though a little higher . temperature cauaedj>y the outfall ;of a power plant may improve fish-ing in that location, it can belabeled as thermal pollution and.thus, may be required to be con-trolled. What, then, is a naturalstate? Remember that the onlysure thing in nature is change. Thewhole system is dynamic. The so-called natural state baseline, thus,keeps changingThese changes come from manypressures Nature can dump impu-rities through volcano eruptions,forest fires, floods, etc . throughland animals whose excretions dump impuritiesthrough excretions in water (1 havenot seen any fish walking out to abathroom). All these pressures a.-ein the \"pristine\" waterNature takes care of all theabove impurities. So ask yourself aquestion. \"What happens when weas a society dump?\" Ultimately, iall boils down to the type and con-centration of the pollutant andwhat kind of a balance it can cre-ate in the natural environment.What Is natural water? Natur-al waters insoluble and/or inorganic natureAbo present such a algae, fish.daphnia, caddisfry. rnayfly. zebramuscle, etc. Impurities also play apart in the survival of life in water-ways. I hope you realize that purewater (distilled water) is a desert.it must have \"impurities\" for life toexist and survive. River water is acomplex solution; sea water iseven more complexThe Fox River is no exceptionIn such a large reservoir of thou-sands of different chemical andbiological species. I wonder howone can guarantee and control theinteractions and synergism of achemical studied in the laboratoryunder controlled conditions.UMW Fox River About 40miles long, the Fox .River is one ofthe lew rivers flowing north. It hasnine locks and dams to control a170-foot drop with a flow averag-ing about 4.000 cubic feet per sec-ond The Fox serves 19 pulp andpaper mills (and other industries).and satisfies the personal andrecreational needs of a large sur-rounding community.

I can safely saybleached fibers will be the first tovanish from the underwalerdeposits, say within one to twoyears. Unbleached fibers will belonger lasting, followed by wood-bark, which would be long lasting.How to monitor health of riv-er There are three main biological moni-toring makes more sense. It is adirect measurement of the environ-mental condition; there is no otherbetter wayThe biological method involvesa study of any living component ofthe aquatic system. Macroinverte-brales (organisms without back-bones large enough to see) are oneof these components. Aquaticinsects, clams, snails, leaches, etc.,are included in these forms andare good indicators of environmen-tal quality. These are used becausethey art easy to collect, their scien-tific identification family is estab-lished, and they have recognizedtolerance limits to water qualityparameters such as dissolved oxy-gen. pH. etc., and arc food for fish.By sampling through time (sea-sonally, annually) and space(upstream, downstream from sus-pected source of pollutants). a pic-ture of the river's health can bedeveloped, documented, and usedto measure progress in improvingenvironmental quality.Because these studies areinvolved, time consuming, andsomewhat expensive, their moni-toring frequency should be decid-ed based on scientific justification,and input from the regulatoryagency and the industry. Althoughsome mills conduct such studieson a yearly basis. 1 think a mini-mum of a two- to three-year cyclemay be sufficient. It would be likegoing to a doctor for a physical ona regular basis.Whatever we do, it is not for theindustry, DNR, EPA and us; it willbe for the sake of our children andtheir children. Just awaken thesleeping natural processes and letthem do their jobs.

One gentleman told mehow a mill dumped its dye-saturated fiberinto the river, making the water red, yellow,' blue, etc. One wonders what kinds of toxic crudthey used for dyes back then. Many of theseolder dyes have been taken off the market #because of carcinogenic connections. Eventhe natural dye indigo is carcinogenic.Many older adults have told me abouthuge islands of wood fiber floating down theriver after being dumped by a paper mill.This stuff was visible and easily identified.The mills had to do something to improvetheir image.Most residents older than 40 rememberthe sulfur stench that used to lay over GreenBay like a beer, chili and pickled egg bodilyemission.To put the frosting on the cake(yeeeeech!) the mills, with various city andtown approvals, dumped its sulfite liquor onthe gravel roads \"to keep down the dust.\"Driving in the country became quite agag-fest back then. You could go out andlook at the autumn leaves and toss yourcookies during the same trip. Many millsnow get their pulp elsewhere, includingsome from Brazil.

The hearing was scheduled by a National Research Councilcommittee thatCongress has authorized to propose methods of removing thepoisoned sediment. \"It's extremely important, if people want to see this riverand othercontaminated sites cleaned up and want to encourage thesescientists to take astrong stand, that they be (at the hearing),\" said RebeccaRaters, executivedirector of the Green Bay-based Clean Water Action Council.\"These are highlyinfluential scientists that need to know that these are realpeople they aredealing with. This is not a theoretical laboratory exercise.\" The Fox River, which flows into Green Bay, containspolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that can cause cancer. TheU.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants them removed. That could mean dredging tons of silt at great expense. Someobservers have said that the tainted silt from years ago hasbeencovered by more silt and ought to be left alone rather thanstirred up. Congress has asked the council Committee on Remediation ofPCB-Contaminated Sediments for suggestions. The committee also is visiting Albany, N.Y., because of PCScontamination of the Hudson River. \"This is an issue that attracts a lot of attention, not onlyinWisconsin but around the country,\" said Roberta Wedge, projectdirector for the council, a branch of the National Academies. The hearing, at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, isintended to gatherperspectives on the cleanup. Among the commentators is the Pox River Group, whichrepresentspaper companies whose riverside mills formerly used PCBs andcould be sued bythe EPA to pay for dredging. Others on the presentation agenda include the EPA, the U.S.Fish and Wildlife 1Service, American Indians and the Green Bay MetropolitanSewerage District. \"The committee is trying to develop a framework on how toapproach the wholeissue of what techniques should be used,\" Wedge said.\"Obviously, the generalpublic, activist groups and industry groups all get factoredin.\" Congress ordered the council study in response to a requestfrom GeneralElectric Co. for a review of the merits of dredging. Like the seven paper mills along the Fox between LakeWinnebagoand Green Bay, GE faces an expensive bill for cleaning up theHudson. Estimatesof the Fox dredging range from $150 million to $728 million. GE has said that dredging would worsen the problem bystirring up ,contaminants. The company wants the EPA barred from PCBdredging projects 1nationwide until a National Academies study is completed. \"The focus of the committee is the technology, but the taskis to provide aframework for assessing the risks for the technologies,\" Wedgesaid.

Fox/Wolf Basin 2000board members said they try to form a coalitionof interested parties and reaching a consensus inthat fashion, while Clean Water Action Councilrepresentatives said they use grass roots and trav-el door to door to reach people.The council confronts facts and canvassesareas to inform the public, said Rebecca Katers,executive director.\"We build awareness through direct actions,\"she said. \"There's a lot of outrage out there thatneeds to have a voice.\"\"Our style is different,\" said Bruce Johnson,executive director of Fox/Wolf Basin.\"We go for collaborative efforts while CleanWater Action Council takes a stark, grass-rootsapproach.

Out on the water,a dredging barge traversed the rivershe by means of fixed cables. Ahorizontal auger, moving up anddown with the contour of the river,cut three feet into the sedimentpile, and used suction pumps todraw watery sediment into a 12-inch pipe, sealed within a 16-inchpipe, that stretched its way north tothe treatment facility, located justnorth of the mill on the formerShell Oil lotRichard Weber, project managerfor the Montgomery Watson engi-neering firm, said monitors in theriver showed no resuspension ofsediment IS feet away from thedredger.The slurry is pumped into twosettling lagoons, each occupyingone acre of land and capable ofholding 1.2 million gallons. Alu-minum sulfate is added to the slur-ry to hasten the separation ofsolids, which sink to the bottom.Water is decanted off the top andpiped to a sand and carbon filtra-tion system, where1 it is cleaned andtested before being returned to theriver.The thickening sediment is thendredged and pumped off the bot-tom of the lagoons into filter press-es where more water is squeezedout and sent back for filtration.

Why should we believetha,t cleaner sediment will remainon fop?Years back, the paper companiesused the river as a dumping groundfor their waste water that containedPCBs, hoping it would dilute andflow down the river. Unfortunatelyfor the paper companies, some ofthe PCBs hung around and are stillin the river. Just because floodwaters over the years washed mostof the PCBs down the river doesnot mean natural recoveryoccurred. The PCBs just wentsomewhere else.I do not believe that PCBs areself destructing. Covering themwith topsoil or silt does not destroy'nor permanently contain them-.What exactly does Mr. Schmidtmean by the \"natural recoveryprocess?\" Is he saying that thePCBs will break down under thesilt? That's unlikely.Allowing the PCBs to go intoGreen Bay or Lake Michigan willdilute them so there are fewer partsper million, but the PCBs will con-tinue to exist. If you have a smallpail of dirty water and dump it intoa larger pad of clean water, you willhave fewer parts of dirt per sample.from the larger pail than you had inthe smaller one. However, the once-clean water is now dirty. Allowingthe PCBs to migrate into the largerbodies of water in Green Bay andLake Michigan does not solve theproblem. It merely shares it.Charlotte Arendt,Neenah )AY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1999 SERVING AN ALL-AMERICA CITY .www.greenbaypressgazette.com . 50 CENTS PCB dredging resumes projectmight finishon scheduleBY SUSAN CAMPBEU.PRESS-GAZETTE Contaminant dredging resumedwith a new dredge that isbetter-suited to the project,but a DNR official says aweek or more may have beenlost by dredging problemsand other delays.A new horizontal augerdredge was brought to thePCB hot spot outside FortJames Corp.'s West Mill inGreen Bay this week afterthe proved ineffec-tive.The original dredge, calleda cutterhead, wasn't pullingenough sediment out of theriverbed, said Bob Behrens,project manager for the stateDepartment of Natural Re-sources.

And, subsequendy,our \"entire local economy could be affected through the potentiall?pss of job, investment and business opportunities. , EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY Bureaucrats have made it apparent that dredging is dieir pre-ferred way of dealing with the risk of PCB exposure in die FoxRiver. Late last year, the WDNR conducted a test project in theFox River to measure the effectiveness of dredging. Despitearound-die-clock dredging, the WDNR reported that only about4,600 cubic yards of contaminated soil were removed, includingonly 97 pounds of PCBs. The acknowledged project costs wereapproximately $2.7 million, or $587 per cubic yard of sedimentremoved and nearly $28,OOO for each pound of PCBte removed Yet, with all this expense and questionable results at hand,the WDNR is returning to Deposit N. The costs becomeastounding when projected over the millions of cubic yardsof sediment that would be removed under die bureaucraticdredging plan being considered. Most government-managed dredging projects have far exceededinitial cost estimates. In Michigan, for example, PCB removal in Manistique Harbor was estimated by the EPA to take two yearsa|i(d^cpst $6;rnillion,; Now, fpur;years later, die dredging continues,withi costs exceecling $24 million. What's worse is dredgingincreased surface concentrations of PCBs, exposing fish and^djifean the harbor to higher PCB levels dian before the\"laeanup\" began. Costs continue to mount and die EPA willnot speculate on a completion date. It is also apparent that part of the problem lies in inefficientgovernment operations. According to the federal GeneralAccounting Office (G\"AO), nearly 60 percent of the EPA's 1998Superfund budget never went to direct cleanup activities. Instead,bureaucrats spent it on support and administrative expenses. Data from both government and independent studies indicatethat 85 percent of the PCBs in die Fox River are buried under afoot or more of clean sediment, making them unavailable to fish<{nd wildlife. Dredging should be a last resort because othersolutions,'such as sediment capping, may well be more effectiveand affordable.

The use of PCBs in mak-ing carbonless copy paper was dis-continued in 1971 shortly afterconcerns were expressed and sev-en years before the federal govern-ment banned most applications ofPCBs in 1978.In 1980, Congress passed theComprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Act (CERCLA), more com-monly known Superfund.CERCLA, interestingly, wasapplied retroactively. Talk aboutfairness, or lack thereof.Keep in mind that during thistimeframe, state and federal offi-cials were urging the paper indus-try to produce more paper fromrecycled fiber. Keep in mind, too,that these wastewater dischargeswere legal at the time.Let's put this issue into properperspective.How would you like it if the fed-eral government, say the InternalRevenue Service, knocked on yourdoor tomorrow and said: \"Weknow the tax return you filed in1975 was legal, rules have,u..,) paper and alliedindustries. Schmkjt,on the council for 22years, is a registered lobbyist and hasbeen on many legislative and regulato-ry advisory committees. To contacthim, call 722-1500 or fax 722-7541, for your past actions, plus assessinterest\"?I don't know about you, but I'dbe irate. 'Granted, the mills probablyhave a moral, if not a legal respon-sibility to assist with remediationof the river. To their credit theyhave responded very professional-ly, very responsibly to this awk-ward situation.The remediation process is pro-ceeding slowly with demonstrationprojects under way near Kimberly(Deposit N) and Green Bay(Deposits 56-57). Unfortunately,the remediation process has beenmired in bureaucratic red tape andpolitics. The results of thesedemonstration projects, however,should be extremely helpful indeveloping an appropriate courseof action.Before discussing a possibleapproach to resolve this issue, let'stake a look at some important butsometimes overlooked facts aboutthe Fox River and the remediationprocess: The Fox River is in the midstof a well-documented naturalrecovery. PCB levels in fish, sedi-ment and water have dropped sig-nificantly during the past two-plusdecades. Eighty-five percent of thecontaminated sediment is buriedunder one foot or more of cleanersediment effectively isolating thePCBs. Human health and ecoloeicalrisk assessments show very lowrisks from PCBs in the Fox River.Statistics show average fish con-sumption patterns are alreadywithin safe levels of exposure. The DNR's proposedcleanup level - 0.25 part per mil-lion - compares with a goal of 3parts per million - 10 ppm forcleanup efforts of this kind in oth-er parts of the country. In reality,the Fox River is already at the lev-el that other Superfund sites havebeen declared completed andcleaned-up by U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency.Much of the current debatelocally focuses on a singular issue- dredging of the PCB-contaminat-ed sediments. This is unfortunate,as \"risk reduction\" should be theobjective of the remediation effort,not dredging for the sake of dredg-ing.It seems logical that the goal forremediating the Fox River shouldbe twofold: First reduce the risk of expo-sure to humans, fish and wildlifeand enhance the use and enjoy-ment of the entire ecosystem. Second, restore the ecosys-tem in a manner that preserves theeconomic vitality of local commu-nities and industries.In other words, we need a.bal-anced approach, a common senseapproach.Back in 1992, a group of paperindustry leaders and the late v Department of Natural ResourcesSecretary C.D. \"Buzz\" Besadnyinformally agreed on a concept, anapproach to remediate the FoxRiver.That approach, in essence,called for a risk assessment ofeach deposit area, an analysis oftreatment options for each area,and a priority ranking for thedeposit areas.In some areas, dredging wouldbe the preferred option. In othercases, capping the deposits wouldbe the best approach. And in otherinstances, it would be preferable tocontinue the natural recoveryprocess.This is a balanced approach.It seemed logical in 1993.It seems today.

The monitorsare about 18 inches square by about3 to 4 feet high; each looks like asmall hut and rests on a platform.The DNR installed 26 air moni-tors beginning at ground zero andradiating out to 1.2 miles away from the site.

The governor, is ignor-ing the clear financial, legal andtechnical advantages of workingcooperatively with federal partnerson the matter. These actions are aclassic example of governmentwaste and dereliction of publicoffice by ignoring the very people hewas elected to serve, not paid toserve.As further insult to the people ofWisconsin, the Fox River polluters,the perpetrators, are the only partiesallowed to nominate the consultantsto write the state's NRDA. This cre-ates a pro-industry, pro-abuserbiased assessment. Further, the gov-ernor's Department of Natural ,Resources will give the industryconsultants' opinions legitimacythrough endorsement by the Wiscon-sin state government. This is wrong.This arrogant and dictatorial deci-sion-making should not be toleratedin a democracy. The Fox Rivercleanup is too important to be sabo-taged by the state and governor'sDNR in this manner.Cease and desist the NRDA pro-ject and all other secret deals withthe perpetrators of pollution.

Most said they were con-cerned about numerous issues.Vicky Harris, a former DNRemployee who now works for theUniversity of Wisconsin SeaGrant Institute, thinks an unbi-ased scientific study would helpclear up confusion.\"I think what we need to do isbring experts together and pres-ent their unbiased opinions \u2014 notrecommendations \u2014 and then letthe public draw their own conclu-sions,\" Harris said. \"It seems tome that kind of public outreach isneeded.\"Bob Schmitz of Green Bay saidhe had nothing but good experi-ences with the EPA, but worriesabout what he calls \"propaganda\"from the seven paper mills.\"We poor peasants don't havethe money to spend on propagan-da the (paper mills) have,\"Schmitz said. \"The EPA has atough job trying to combat thissort of thing and I think they'vedone a hell of a job on it.\"Participants highlighted theneed to get the community moreinvolved in the cleanup process.\"What I'm afraid of, in the end,is a decision is going to be madein a judge's office or a back roomof the Har-ris \"A place involved.\"Muriel a WinnebagoCounty supervisor, shared Harris'concerns.\"Most people know this is'aproblem,\" Crowley said. \"I feellike it may not get done by publicopinion, and that scares me.\"OPBiHOUmmCUBMETJUPITER AlWUQE71BACH milCONNTROt Sch Appleton Papers expansionis a strong sign for the future We were quite pleased Wednesday to report Apple-ton-Papers' further investment in the Fox Cities, a$25 million expansion of its Combined Locks mill.The expansion - at the expense of a similar operationin Newton Falls, N.Y. - will allow the Locks mill to pro-duce coated free-sheet paper, the glossy paper that is usedfor many high-end printing applications. It augments a$180 million expansion of the Locks mill, which helpedAppleton Papers' parent company, Arjo Wiggins Appleton,enter the coated-sheet market in the first place.What-this turn of events says about the commitment ofAppleton Papers - in light of the uncertainty of thecompany's financial culpability for PCB cleanup in the FoxRiver - to this area is important, and sends a strong signalto other international businesses that are based here.It says that this is a great area for Appleton Papers toconduct business, to employ people, to continue itsinternational standing as an industry leader.It says that while Appleton Papers has done well in itspast here in the Fox Valley, it intends to do even better inthe future..It says, we hope, that the company is deeply committedto the people of the Fox Valley. Over the past year or so,there has been concern - spoken and unspoken - thatthe PCB cleanup of the river could cost the company toomuch for it to continue business here. Wednesday's newsseems to fly in the face of those concerns.While no additional jobs are expected to come from thisinvestment, any time a major employer sinks that muchmoney into a business, it is a sign that they aren't goinganywhere soon.

'Not\u00ab ctoanup'The dredging project is expect-'ed to reduce PCB levels Within theproject'site to 1 ppm, said BobPaulson, an environmental toxi-coldglst with the DNR. That num-ber represents a lower standardthan the two cleanup levels sug-gested earlier this year for thewhble river cleanup \u2014 levels of.25 ppm or an average of .25 ppm,both proposed in the DNR's pre-liminary cleanup studies.The DNR last month signed anagreement with Fort James thatthe company would not have tofund more cleanup work at thesite if it paid another $2 millionto increase the project scope to itscurrent size. Despite the agree-ment, the project leaves behind40,000 cubic yards of tainted sedi-ment, though the remaining PCBlevels at the project site will bebelow 100 ppm.Dave Lee, mill manager at P.H.Glatfelter in Neenah \u2014 one of thetargeted mills \u2014 stressed that thework outside Port James is hot in-tended as a cleanup.\"Some people tend to view thatas a cleanup project.

The different guidelines for the two rivers for dredging contaminated silt have attracted questionsfrom environmental organizations and the state Department of Natural Resources. \"We are very concerned that (the Sheboygan) project not be done in a way that is inconsistent withthe Fox River,\" DNR Secretary George Meyer said. \"We want to make sure is it somethingexplainable in terms of the level of cleanup.\" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's comments on its cleanup standards for theSheboygan are puzzling to Rebecca Katers of the Clean Water Action Council, which urged the EPAto help clean the Fox. \"One thing that jumped out at me at Sheboygan is the EPA 's admission in their own materials thatthey weren't fully protecting human health,\" Katers said. The EPA wants the Fox River from Lake Winnebago downstream to Green Bay cleansed ofpolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemicals that are found in river silt and are believed to causecancer. Plans include dredging sediment in the Fox and the Sheboygan, which also has silt tainted withPCBs. The EPA proposes to reduce PCB levels to 1 part per million in the Sheboygan River. The DNRproposes a cleanup level of 0.25 ppm for the Fox, four times more stringent. Cameron Davis, executive director of the Lake Michigan Federation, said the Sheboygan Riverwould still have contaminated fish that would be unhealthy to eat. \"The proposed cleanup does not take enough PCBs from the river sediment to protect women,children and the Hmong community,\" whose members catch carp and catfish in the Sheboygan,Davis said. Tom Short, EPA project manager for the Sheboygan, said different cleanup targets can be expectedfor various rivers because of different flows, fish populations and fishing patterns. \"What may be appropriate at Sheboygan may end up being a different number for the Fox,\" Shortsaid. \"We think (the Sheboygan plan) is protective of human health. \"It is certainly not the most protective level,\" he said. \"It's a balancing criteria.\" \"What we are saying to the EPA is that they need to get their act together on how you makedecisions on cleanup levels,\" said Bruce Baker, the DNR agent in charge of the Fox cleanup. \"Weought to be able to say to the people of Sheboygan that we are providing the same level of protectionfor you.\" The DNR says contamination of sediments, floodplain soils and ground water should be reducedto levels considered safe for fish, birds, animals and humans. PCBs, now outlawed, were once dumped in the Fox by paper mills. The main source of PCBs inthe Sheboygan River came from an engine and transmission factory about 14 miles upstream fromLake Michigan. Tecumseh Products Co., which has the factory at Sheboygan Falls, has suggested an $18 millioncleanup of the river, while the EPA dredging plan could cost $65 million. \"We believe the EPA proposal goes well beyond what is necessary or appropriate to protect humanhealth and the environment and in fact may create additional risks,\" Tecumseh spokesman KerryDeKeyser said. The 39-mile lower Fox is estimated to be the source of more than 70% of the PCBs polluting LakeMichigan. The Sheboygan contributes about 5%.

KleinThe EPA proposes to reduce PCB levels to 1 partper million in the Sheboygan River, a fourth asstringent as the plan for the Fox River.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyplan for cleaning up the PCB-pollutedSheboygan River falls far short of cleanupstandards proposed for the Fox River andsets a disturbing prece- dent, both state officials andenvironmentalists say. \"The proposed cleanup does not takeenough PCBs from the river sediment toprotect women, children and the HmongcommunitY in She- boygan,\" said Cameron Davis, executive director of the Lake Michigan Federation, which received a federal grant to explain cleanup proposalsto the public. Davis said the EPA failed to account for smaller body sizes of women and children in computing the risk from eating contaminated fishand failed to account for the numbers of highly contaminated carp and catfisheaten by Hmong fishermen and their families. The plan also worried members of the Clean Water Action Council, which haslobbied for EPA involvement in the Fox River cleanup. \"One thing that jumped out at me at Sheboygan is the EPA's admission in theirown materials that they weren't fully protecting human health,\" said Re-beccaKaters of the nonprofit Clean Wa-ter Action Council. State officials are alsocalling on the EPA to refine the plan so that greater amounts of PCBs would beremoved from the river. The DNR said contamination levels in the sediments,floodplain soils and groundwater should be reduced to levels considered safe forfish, birds, animals and people. A key difference between the EPA plan for the Sheboygan and the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources plan for the Fox is the target cleanup level forcontaminated sediments. The EPA proposes to reduce PCB levels to 1 part permillion (ppm) in the Sheboygan. The DNR is proposing a cleanup level of 0.25ppm for the Fox, four times more stringent. \"We are very concerned that that project (Sheboygan) not be done in a way that isinconsistent with the Fox River,\" said George Meyer, secretary of the stateDepartment of Natural Resources. \"We want to make sure is it somethingexplainable in terms of the level of cleanup.\" of 4 8 9,99 3:27 PM The Post-Crescent - Fox Cities - PCB News Archive Wysiwyg://! l/1ntp://wisinfo.com/postcrescent/pcb/080899-l.html The primary source of PCBs in the Sheboygan was the Tecumseh Products Co.,which has an engine and transmission plant at Sheboygan Falls, 14 miles from themouth of the river. Company officials, who had proposed an $18 million cleanup of the river, believethe EPA's $65 million plan calls for too much dredging. \"We believe the EPA proposal goes well beyond what is necessary or appropriateto protect human health and the environment and in face may create additionalrisks,\" said Kerry DeKeyser, environmental manager of Tecumseh's engine andtransmission group. Like the Fox River, the Sheboygan is a steady source of industrial PCBs flowinginto Lake Michigan, only on a smaller scale. While the 39-mile lower Fox isestimated to be the source of more than 70% of the PCBs polluting LakeMichigan, the Sheboygan contributes about 5%. PCBs have been linked to reproductive problems in fish-eating birds andmammals. They are suspected human carcinogens and are believed bygovernment health officials to be responsible for developmental problems inchildren whose mothers regularly eat PCB-contaminated fish. In 1986, the EPA placed the lower Sheboygan River on the Superfund list of thenation's most badly polluted sites. The remedial investigation was completed by Tecumseh in 1990, and during thatyear and the next the EPA asked the company to remove 4,000 cubic yards of themost heavily contaminated sediments from the upstream reach of the river closestto the plant. These were stored in containment facilities at the company'sSheboygan Falls plant. Another 1,200 cubic yards of sediment were capped in the river, covered with anon-porous fabric and weighted down with rocks and sand. Tecumseh completed the Sheboygan River R1FS in 1998, arguing that theremaining PCBs should be left in the river. The company's position, similar to theposition taken by the Fox River Group of paper companies, is that contaminatedsediments are being covered by cleaner sediments and that it is safer to leavethem in the river than to dredge them out. The EPA rejected Tecumseh's first RIFS. A second RIFS was released by thecompany in May, recommending that 7,500 yards of contaminated sediments,located in discreet upstream deposits, be dredged from the river, at a cost of $18million. This would remove 68% of the PCBs remaining in the upper reach of theriver. The company recommended no dredging for the middle section of the river or forthe harbor in Sheboygan where most of the river's PCBs lay buried. The EPA accepted that RIFS and then modified it, calling on the company todredge 18,200 cubic yards of sediment upstream, which would remove 93% ofthe remaining PCBs upstream. The EPA concurred no dredging is currently required in the middle stretch of theriver. For the lower river and harbor, the EPA is recommending that 100,000 cubic 2 of 4 8/9/99 3:27PM The Post-Crescent - [;ox Cities Wysiwyg:'/! 1/http:- uiMiito com postcrescentpcb 08089C)-! .html yards of sediment be removed by dredging down to a \"safe navigational depth\" of10 to 12 feet. This would be accomplished by dredging to 14 feet and thencovering the contaminated sediments that this dredging would expose with 2 feetof clean sediment. DeKeyser said this makes no sense, since there is no longer commercial shippingin the harbor and the contaminated sediments are already buried. \"Why go in there and cut through 4 feet of clean sediment, remove that, try andgo down through areas of contamination, backfill that and call it a day?\" saidDeKeyser. \"I don't know what you would be accomplishing for $31 million.\" The DNR would like an explanation as well. In its plans for the Fox River, anyareas dredged would be entirely cleaned of highly contaminated sediments. Toremove all contaminated sediments from the Sheboygan harbor would cost $341million, according to the second RIFS. The DNR has not yet formally commented on the EPA's Sheboygan plan, but inremarks read into the record at a public hearing, the DNR said the cost estimatesfor dredging in the Sheboygan plan are too high. Recent experience has shownthat far greater amounts of sediment could be removed for the same $65 million,the DNR said. The EPA's project manager for the Sheboygan, Tom_Short, said that differentcleanup targets can be expected for different rivers because different flows, fishpopulations and fishing patterns are involved. \"What may be appropriate at Sheboygan may end up being a different number forthe Fox,\" Short said. \"The chain of uptake (pollution entering the food chain) isgoing to be different. We think (the Sheboygan plan) is protective of humanhealth.\" Short agreed with environmentalists that the EPA plan falls short of protecting allorganisms in the river from any observable level of harm. \"It is certainly not the most protective level,\" he said. \"It's a balancing criteria.\" It is distinctions like this that worry DNR officials. Bruce Baker, the DNR administrator in charge of the Fox cleanup, said the HPA'splan for the Sheboygan raises concerns on several levels, one of which is themethod by which the decision was reached. \"What we are seeing on the Sheboygan River is a tendency to make a decisionthat is not driven by an assessment of risk,\" Baker said. \"What we are saying tothe EPA is that they need to get their act together on how you make decisions oncleanup levels. \"We ought to be able to say to the people of Sheboygan that we are providing thesame level of protection for you.\" 3 of 4 8'') W 3:21 online http://www.greenbaypressga7.ette.co...storiesfoxriver/0805agency I'Krss <;mm.EXTRA To get a really good jobyou need the right connection MillenniumMOM. <. bptii.il assessdamage to foxBy Susan CampbellPress-Gazette Published on August 4, 1999 Plans by the state and paper mills to jointly assess PCB damage to the FoxRiver are raising the ire of the federal agency conducting a similar assessmentfor five years. The state Department of Natural Resources on Wednesday released for publiccomment plans for how the joint assessment will be conducted. The release triggered an angry response from the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service,which has been compiling an assessment of how much it will cost to restore fishand wildlife along the river and reimburse the public for losses related to PCBcontamination. That information is part of a Natural Resource DamageAssessment that ultimately will be filed as a claim against seven paper mills heldresponsible for discharging PCBs to the river David Alien, Fox River assessment manager for Fish and Wildlife, said his officedidn't learn the DNR's assessment plan was going public until he received aDNR press release Wednesday. Alien said he had hoped the DNR and the mills would collaborate with Fish andWildlife on its damage assessment rather than proceed with its own - somethingthe DNR says it also supports. One of the barriers to that cooperation is the different approaches to how moneycollected from the eventual damage claim would be used Bruce Baker of the DNR said his agency worries that if the mills are handed twobig bills - for river cleanup and restoration - they might lack funds for both,meaning potential cleanup dollars might be spent on restoration \"We don't want to take money away from the cleanup,\" he said If they can doboth, that's fine - but we've made it pretty clear that our priority is the cleanupand if it turns out that we can't do both, the NRDA stuff is going to suffer\" But Alien said the last thing Fish and Wildlife wants to do is undermine thecleanup to gain more money for habitat and other restoration projects thatultimately could be recontaminated if the river cleanup is inadequate \"Before making it into a contest between the agencies, the mills and everyoneelse over what percentage should go to cleanup vs the NRDA, shouldn't we firstfind out how much is the cleanup going to cost? And what are the damages?We're maybe six months away from having real answers to both of thosequestions,\" he said. The release of the plan is the third time this year the DNR's federal partners -Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and two Indiantribes - have criticized the agency for making public information key to the 1 of 2 8/6/90 8:46 AM Green Bay Press-Gazette online http://www.greenbaypressgazette.co...storiesfoxriver/0805agencyfox.html cleanup without adequate review/ time for the partners. \"\"\" Other instances included the DNR's agreement a week ago with Fort JamesCorp., one of the seven mills, to pay $2 million more to expand a pilot dredgingproject in exchange for being freed from further cleanup responsibility at the site.In February, the agencies complained when the DNR released a series ofcleanup studies without more than a week's notice. Alien said ifs especially frustrating in the aftermath of a 1997 IntergovernmentalPartnership Agreement in which the governments pledged to cooperate on acleanup plan for the river \"It's almost as if we hadn't just gone through that. It's almost like we're back totwo years ago,\" he said. \"I can't understand what's going on. . . there are a lot ofpeople who are at the end of their rope.\" Baker said his staff has been communicating with Fish and Wildlife about itsplans for the damage assessment, and that agency was given \"adequate time\"to review the cleanup studies. As for the suite of cleanup studies released earlierthis year, he said the information had been given to the various agencies earlierbut apparently didn't filter down to everyone.

From 1985-1989 over 15 million m3 were dredged for moreefficient navigation through rivers and harbors of the Great Lakes; 51% of this material had to be placedin confined disposal facilities due to high contaminant levels. From an environmental cleanup point of view, there are currently few ecologically-baseddecision-making tools available for pinpointing the most effective contaminated sediment managementstrategies, and often decisions become overwhelmed by regulatory complexity. Sediment contaminantsstill represent a major factor limiting our ability to reach a healthy, sustainable environment andeconomy. Management of Contaminated Sediment Considers Restoration of Beneficial Uses All 42 Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes basin have contaminants in sediment that exceed chemicalguidelines, but their effects on the ecosystem are only partially quantified. However, there are clearlinkages to restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption, fish tumors or other deformities, loss of fishand wildlife habitat, degraded natural communities, and other ecosystem effects identified in Annex 2 ofthe Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. In most Areas of Concern, the sediment problem has not been quantitatively coupled to ecologicalimpairments. Therefore, deciding on volumes of sediment to be cleaned up, why, and what ecologicalimprove-ments can be expected over time has been challenging. It is important not only to know theexisting degree of ecological harm associated with sediment contaminants, but also the circumstancesunder which those relationships and threats might change, making contaminants more bioavailable ordetrimental under different environmental conditions. The ability to forecast the expected degree ofrecovery and the ecological improvements from sediment cleanup must be demonstrated. A better understanding of the relationships between contaminated sediment and environmental qualitywould provide stronger justification for a particular sediment management strategy. It would help inmaking management decisions among the following options: source control and natural recovery;removal and containment; removal and treatment; in situ capping, and in situ treatment. If relationshipsbetween contaminated sediment and beneficial uses were better understood, more compelling casescould be made to fund sediment cleanup. Better public support for sediment management decisionswould result, and more corporate involvement could be expected. Greater Emphasis Must be Placed on Monitoring the Ecological Effectiveness of SedimentCleanup From 1986-1999, over $580 million have been allocated for 38 remediation projects in 19 Areas ofConcern. In addition, the rate of increase has accelerated in recent years as shown in the two figures. of 3 9/16/999:50 AM Sediment Management for Ecosystem Recovery http://www.ijc. org/boards/wqb/sedpacbroc/index.html 403530 Number of 2520151050Projects -I I 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Year FinancialResources(in millions)700 600 500 400 300 200 100 01986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Year Unfortunately, of these projects, few have produced information on ecological effectiveness gained bymonitoring the recovery of environmental quality after a cleanup has taken place. Measuring ecologicaleffectiveness of sediment cleanup is also important where a new environmental technology has beentested, in order to improve innovative approaches. Benefits of effective sediment management have beendemonstrated in Collingwood Harbour, Waukegan Harbor, and Black River, where monitoringcontinued once sediment remediation was completed. Collingwood Harbour In Collingwood Harbour, Ontario, approximately 8,000 m3 of contaminated sediment were removedusing an innovative dredging technology. This was the first true application of a biologically-baseddecision that defined the extent of sediment cleanup. Toxic levels of metals have now been eliminated.Additional post-project monitoring is underway. An important lesson learned was that communicating clearly the environmental consequences ofsediment contaminants to the local Public Advisory Committee and community was necessary. Thishelped reach multi-stakeholder consensus on the need for sediment remediation to achieve PAC goals.Cleaning up sediment in a partnership helped industry from having to \"go it alone\" in the future. Thebroad-based partnership benefitted all funding partners. The cleanup contributed to removing the stigmaof an Area of Concern for the community, and is believed to have positively affected property values. Waukegan Harbor In Waukegan Harbor, Illinois, a 1989 U.S. EPA Superfund Consent Decree resulted in the removal andtreatment or disposal of approximately 453,600 kg (1 million pounds) of PCBs in 38,254 m3 of sediment 2 of 3 9/16/999:50 AM Sediment Management for Ecosystem Recovery http://www.ijc.org/boards/wqb/sedpacbroc/index.html and soil at a cost of more than $49 million (U.S.) for the entire site remediation. By monitoring theeffectiveness of sediment removal, Illinois EPA was able to measure a significant decline in PCB levels/\"~' in fish as a direct result of the cleanup. As a consequence, the harbor fish advisory has been removed.Property values have increased due to the cleanup. The Remedial Action Plan (RAP) process helped Illinois EPA look beyond traditional water programs tofocus on restoring beneficial uses. Team building within the Waukegan Harbor Citizens Advisory Grouphelped secure funds for remediation costs from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when Illinois EPAhad none. Good facilitation helped elicit private sector contributions also. Communication tools such askiosks, a home page, and a video were effective in delivering the message that use restoration requirespartnerships. Black River A 1985 Consent Decree resulted in the removal of approximately 38,000 m3 of PAH contaminatedsediment from the Black River, Ohio at a cost of $1.5 million (U.S.). As a result of this sedimentremediation project, PAH levels in sediment have declined substantially and cancerous liver tumors havenow been eliminated in the resident brown bullhead population. Sediment Management is Incremental and Integrated In cases where sediment remediation was undertaken as a result of regulatory action, the projects weredesigned to remove the worst masses of contaminants to reduce environmental risks. These projectswere very effective in meeting the regulatory requirements, and are consistent with the step-wiseincremental approach to management of contaminated sediment called for by the Great Lakes WaterQuality Board. After remediation of the worst sites, an integrated evaluation of all sources, includingsediment, must be undertaken to determine whether or not further remediation is required and to ensurethat remediation is sustainable. Much more effort should be placed on forecasting and measuring the extent and pace of ecologicalrecovery. This will help in future efforts to make decisions on the most appropriate sedimentmanagement strategy, thereby advancing restoration of beneficial uses in Areas of Concern. The International Joint Commission (IJC) The IJC is a binational organization established under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty. The Treatyrecognizes that each country may be affected by the others actions in shared lake and river systems alongthe boundary. The IJC was created to assist governments in preventing and resolving disputes in use ofthese resources. Under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, the IJC was assigned responsibilitiesto assist the governments in meeting their commitments under the Agreement and to assess progress bythe govern-ments in restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of thewaters of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. The Sediment Priority Action Committee (SedPAC) In recognition of the scope of the contaminated sediment problem and the limited progress in addressingit, the IJC identified contaminated sediment as a program priority and assigned this priority to the GreatLakes Water Quality Board (WQB). SedPAC was formed to review the contaminated sediment problemand provide advice to the Board, and in turn the IJC, on means to overcome obstacles to sedimentremediation.

The National Research Council, an arm of the NationalAcademies, was called on to review the scientific literature todate on the effects such chemicals have on the reproductive,developmental, neurological and immunological systems ofpeople and wildlife. The 16-member scientific panel was commissioned by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department andthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The panel reported that a class of chemical compounds knownas hormone disrupters are interfering with human and animalhealth. The sources of exposure can come from eating taintedfood - such as some Great Lakes fish, which carry high levels ofPCBs in their fat -or from commercial products such ascleaners, pesticides and food additives. Among other findings, the researchers reported that babiesexposed in the womb to PCBs, pesticides and other pollutantscan cause lower birth weights, tower IQs, memory deficits anddelayed neuromuscular development. Yet the panel reports that just how the agents operate on thebody's systems is not well-understood and notes that themajority of evidence is based on studies of wildlife andlaboratory animals. To gain more insight, it recommends that new studies beconducted by following groups of at-risk subjects fromconception through adulthood. \"Determining the risk to humans from contact with thesechemicals in the environment is difficult because ordinaryexposure to these agents has not been routinely monitored,\"said committee chairman Ernst Knobil, a professor at theUniversity of Texas in Houston. \"Determining what theseexposures actually are is therefore of primary importance \" Addressing a particularly contentious issue, the panel reportedno conclusive evidence to date that hormone disrupterscontribute to breast cancer or low sperm counts, as some havespeculated. One researcher on the panel said the earlier studies of 2 8 6/99 9:32 AM Green Bay Press-Gazette online http://www.greenbaypressgazette.co...ies/storiesfoxriver/0805panel.html were inconclusive. \"The absence of information cannot be taken as evidence thereis absence of harm,\" said Frederick S. vom Saal, a professor atthe University of Missouri. In Green Bay, where PCB contamination in the Fox River isextensive enough to warrant a proposal to make it a federalSuperfund priority cleanup site, some had hoped the panel'sreport would offer guidance on what to do about RGBs in theenvironment. \"That's where the debate seems to lie these days. Yes, we needto know more about it, but what do we dp in the meantime?\"said John Kennedy, who chairs a scientific subcommittee ofGreen Bay's Remedial Action Plan committee. \"That's what you see locally with the RAP committee. We stilladmit there could be lots more data to look at, but we're gettingthe picture that the cautious and hopefully wise person wouldsay this is serious - and that we should err on the side ofcaution,\" he said. Rebecca Katers of the Clean Water Action Council agreed. \"That's the most frustrating part of scientists.

The state Department of Natural Resources on Wednesdayreleased for public comment plans for how the joint assessmentwill be conducted. The release triggered an angry response from the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, which has been compiling an assessment ofhow much it will cost to restore fish and wildlife along the riverand reimburse the public for losses related to PCBcontamination. That information is part of a Natural ResourceDamage Assessment that ultimately will be filed as a claimagainst seven paper mills held responsible for discharging PCBsto the river. David Alien, Fox River assessment manager for Fish andWildlife, said his office didn't learn the DNR's assessment planwas going public until he received a DNR press releaseWednesday. Alien said he had hoped the DNR and the mills wouldcollaborate with Fish and Wildlife on its damage assessmentrather than proceed with its own - something the DNR says italso supports. One of the barriers to that cooperation is the differentapproaches to how money collected from the eventual damageclaim would be used. Bruce Baker of the DNR said his agency worries that if the millsare handed two big bills - for river cleanup and restoration - theymight lack funds for both, meaning potential cleanup dollarsmight be spent on restoration. \"We don't want to take money away from the cleanup,\" he said.If they can do both, that's fine - but we've made it pretty clearthat our priority is the cleanup and if it turns out that we can't doboth, the NRDA stuff is going to suffer.\" But Alien said the last thing Fish and Wildlife wants to do isundermine the cleanup to gain more money for habitat and otherrestoration projects that ultimately could be recontaminated ifthe river cleanup is inadequate. \"Before making it into a contest between the agencies, the millsand everyone else over what percentage should go to cleanup of2 8/6/99 additional $2 million for apilot dredging project out-side its West Mill paves theway for the largest PCB re-moval from the Fox River toda'ix .*, it will leave as muchas one-third of the contami-nation behind at a site recog-nized as the most highly-contaminated hot spot January 1997 be- taminated sediment fromThe agreement was madein exchange for additionaldollars that will pay for asafer project that would re-move enough tainted se'di-ment so that the dredgingdoesn't leave a worse prob-lem behind.\"Just because they werelocked into that bad agree-ment two years ago, they'vebeen put in this weak posi-tion of having this cap ohthe money available,\" Katerssaid. \"And now they've hadto make another bad agree-ment just to get a larger por-tion of the hot spot out.\" .The additional money:means tneTmills will remove tween the state Departmentof Natural Resources andthe seven Fox River papermills deemed responsible forcontamination from poly-chlorinated biphenyls.Katers said the DNR backed into a corner onthe project's scope since themills agreed in that earlieraccord to spend $7 millionon a pilot dredging projectoutside the Fort James mill.She and other environmen-talists have argued loudlysince then that the size ofthe project should have beenbased on science rather thanmor-v.1 iday's agreementadde^ insult to injury, shesaid, when the DNR free Fort James from fu-ture cleanup responsibilityat that site.the site \u2014 as was originallyproposed \u2014 rather than-.ajscaled-down, 45,000-cubic-yard removal the DNR de-scribed earlier this month inlight of higher than antici-pated project costs. DNR offi-cials say the smaller projectwould have been unsafe be-cause the dredging couldhave exposed and left behindsediment bearing high PCBconcentrations.Katers objects further tothe fact that the DNR negoti-'ated the agreement withFort James in the wake ofpublic hearings on the proj-ect. \"How can they suddenlychange the ground rules?They always told us this wasjust a demonstration, it wasjust a pilot \u2014 it didn't mean Please see PCBs, B-2Is/80,000 cubicyards to be removed FrOmB-1 hat they weren't ever going to gofor the rest,\" she said. \"Itwasn't supposed to mean any ofthose things.\"i i)NR Secretary George MeyerSaid removing 80,000 cubic yardspf tainted riverbed from the sitewould reduce PCB concentrations. an average of .25 partsmillion.

And what are the damages? We'res~ maybe six months away from having real answers to both ofthose questions,\" he said. The release of the plan is the third time this year the DNR'sfederal partners - Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency and two Indian tribes - have criticized theagency for making public information key to the cleanup withoutadequate review time for the partners. Other instances included the DNR's agreement a week ago withFort James Corp., one of the seven mills, to pay $2 million moreto expand a pilot dredging project in exchange for being freedfrom further cleanup responsibility at the site. In February, theagencies complained when the DNR released a series ofcleanup studies without more than a week's notice. Alien said it's especially frustrating in the aftermath of a 1997Intergovernmental Partnership Agreement in which thegovernments pledged to cooperate on a cleanup plan for theriver. \"It's almost as if we hadn't just gone through that. It's almost likewe're back to two years ago,\" he said. \"I can't understand what'sgoing on. . . there are a lot of people who are at the end of theirrope.\" Baker said his staff has been communicating with Fish andWildlife about its plans for the damage assessment, and thatagency was given \"adequate time\" to review the cleanupstudies. As for the suite of cleanup studies released earlier thisyear, he said the information had been given to the variousagencies earlier but apparently didn't filter down to everyone.

The millsagreed in 1997 to spend $7 million of a$10 million \"down payment\" on cleanupfor the pilot. Total cost of cleanup couldrun to hundreds of millions of dollars.It was distressing to learn as the pro-ject got under way with preparation of aStaging area that rising costs will slashits scope. But if accurate monitoringshows good results, why not expand theproject?If hot-spot work is effective, the millswill have a golden opportunity to stepforward and show their environmentalcommitment by increasing the amountpledged for the pilot to treat all of theFort James sediment.

Within a few months, theDNR will be releasing a recom-mended plan to clean the Fox Riv-er and the federal government hasjust begun an internal peer reviewof such a plan for formal releaseearly in 2000.It is likely that these plans willrely heavily on hydraulic or envi-ronmental dredging as a means ofremoving the contaminants fromthe river, a process that could costthe paper companies and the inter-national corporations that ownthem anywhere from $260 millionto $730 million.\"We only have a small timeframe to work with,\" said DennisHultgren, an executive with Apple-ton Papers and the leader of theFRG's science committee.The Sensible Solutions docu-ment does not offer a specific plan,or range of plans, for cleaning up a39-mile stretch of the lower FoxRiver, which is contaminated withan estimated 30 tons of PCBs,industrial chemicals that are sus-pected by governmerjf health scien-tists of being human carcinogensand that have been linked withbirth defects in wild animals anddevelopmental 'problems inhumans.Instead, the companies are offer-ing what they call guiding princi-ples\" for river restoration.\"This is a document that wehope should.hejp the communitycome together... to have a dialoguethat will lead to balanced, cost-effective solutions,* said Hultgren.\"What we don't want to say is 'Hereis a Fox River Group solution.'\"The principles restate Fox RiverGroup positions that the river isdoing a good job of cleaning itself,that clean sediment is overlayingcontaminated sediment, that high-water storms will not disturb theseburied sediments, that PCBs in theriver do not present a significanthealth risk to humans, that dredg-ing could do more harm to the riv-er than good and that other envi-ronmental issues - such as theloss of grasslands and wetlands todevelopment and the damage doneby phosphorous-laden runoff fromagricultural fields and urban land-scapes - should be addressed aspart of the plan.Government officials were quickto respond to the companies' claimon page one of Sensible Solutionsthat PCBs in the Fox \"pose little orno risk to people and wildlife.\"\"We disagree with that state-ment wholeheartedly,\" said BrendaJones, an EPA biologist, \"unr riskassessments show there are impactsto both people and wildlife overtime. We did conservative evalua-tions. From a human health per-spective, yes, the biggest risk isfrom ingestion of fish, but from anecological perspective, the crittersare exposed where they live, and ina variety of different ways. Fishingestion is not the only route.\"To back their argument aboutPCB risks, the companies' point tothe PCB standard adopted by theFood and Drug Administration forthe commercial sale of fish, whichis set at fish tissue concentrationsof 2 parts per million. Most fish inthe Fox River have concentrationsat less than half this level.The companies conclude thatsport anglers on the Fox could eattheir catches with little risk.\"Such low risks are not surpris-ing since fillets of sport fish caughtin the Fox River, like walleye andperch, contain such low levels ofPCBs that the FDA would deemthem safe to sell in grocery stores,\"the FRO document said on page58.EPA regulators called foul.\"It's not true that they are belowthe risk,\" said Hahnenberg.\"What you find in the market-place - because all the (commer-cial) fish have very low if even mea-surable concentrations of PCBs -are average concentrations that are20 times lower than 2 ppm, so onestray fish of ppm population's exposure,\"said Hahnenberg. \"With these fish, pretty much all the fishhave high concentrations. That'swhy the fish advisory numbers arelower. The FDA agrees with theEPA evaluations and approach.\"The ERAi also challenged thecompanies' statement in the docu-ment that high water flows woulddo little to scour PCBs from thebottom of the river. In SensibleSolutions, the companies say a 100-year flood was recorded in June1990 that had no discernible effecton PCB levels.\"It didn't happen,\" said Hahnen-berg.The companies relied on mea-surements of water flows at themouth of the river, but these werecaused by a seiche effect, withwinds pushing lake water into themouth of the river, water that bel-lies in and then flows out. To mea-sure a flood, Hahnenberg said, youhave to check gauges up river.Upriver gauges monitored by theU.S. Geological Survey showed nounusual activity in June 1990, withthe highest Hows at one uprivergauge occurring on June 24, 1990,at 15,500 cubic feet per second, farbelow the levels set for a 100-yearflood and even less than the 17,000cfs that would be recorded in a five-year flood.\"That conclusion (by the compa-nies) is not correct,\" Hahnenbergsaid. \"That's a case where they havetheir facts wrong. That's the mostpolite way to say it.\"This dispute lies at the heart ofthe debate about the Fox River. TheEPA and DNR, relying on twodecades of study, have describedongoing forces of deposition anderosion that are constantly mixingsediments, freeing some chemicalsthat were buried and burying oth-ers that had been exposed, at dif-ferent times and at different rates indifferent parts of the river.\"You have all these things hap-pening,\" Hahnenberg said. \"It isn'ta good sound bite because natureisn't that simple. It is not all ero-sional or depositional. It's a mix-ture. If it were true that it were onlybeing buried, you should have a sur-face layer that is totally clean withPCBs not detected at all, and wedon't see that.\"It is this process that causes thecontinual release of PCBs into theenvironment and that will threatenhuman and animal health for morethan a century if nothing is done,government scientists argue.The Fox River Group companiessee the river differently and devotea great deal of space in SensibleSolutions on this point.\"How can they say it's not depo-sitional when it is?\" said Hultgren.\"Eighty seven percent of the PCBsare in the last seven miles. That'swhere the river widens and deepensand it tends to settle in there.\" Sensible Solutions can be down-loaded from the Fox River GroupWeb site al www.foxrivergroup.org.The EPA's on-line perspective is atwww. epa.gov/region5/foxriver.

Fort James Corp. is a member of the Fox River Group, which is made up of seven paper mills identified assources of pollution in the river that stretches through northeastern Wisconsin. The company is providing extra funds to ensure that a pilot project - one of two on the river - will be carriedout without severe cutbacks, the DNR said. The projects are designed to help clean up the river and gatherinformation on the effectiveness of dredging. Sediments in the river are contaminated with the industrial chemical PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls,used in making carbonless paper before they were banned in the 1970s. The project is at a 9-acre segment of the river near De Pere. \"This project was designed to provide us with important information about the potential impact of dredgingon the Fox River,\" added Dan Platkowski, a senior vice president for Fort James. \"Any curtailment of theproject would mean less data available to us - data that we need to chart the course for the remediation ofthe river.\" The Fox River Group wants the DNR to wait until research is completed on the De Pere site before choosingr~- a cleanup plan for a 39-mile stretch of the Fox, which flows into Lake Michigan's Green Bay.VI..\"-' A draft cleanup study by the DNR outlined six cleanup options ranging from a $728.3 million all-dredgingsolution to a $154.5 million strategy that would combine dredging and capping contaminated sites with sandor rock. The Clean Water Action Council of Northeastern Wisconsin has favored having the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency place the 39-mile river section on its Superfund cleanup list, a move opposed by the stateand the companies as unnecessarily expensive. The project near De Pere originally called for removal of 80,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediments.However, rising costs forced officials to cut estimates nearly in half, the DNR said. Because of Fort James'contribution, the project now can move ahead as originally planned, the DNR said. Plans are to prepare the site for cleanup by late August. Then a contractor will use a hydraulic dredge to\"vacuum\" contaminated sediments out of the river. The sediments will be dried and taken to a Fort Jameslandfill for disposal. But state environmental groups say the polluted material should be cleaned first. Overall funding for the pilot project totals $9 million, with the initial $7 million coming from the Fox RiverGroup, as part of an agreement reached between the state and the companies. The group has hiredcontractors to carry out the project, the DNR said. In other news, the DNR recently decided to resume dredging PCB-contaminated sediments at the othercleanup site in late August. That project was shut down last fall because of cold weather, the DNR said.

In 1986, the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources cre-ated committees for developing aRemedial Action Plan to clean the FoxRiver and Green Bay. They were heav-ily influenced by the corporations andfailed to produce a cleanup, but theprocess produced good media cover-age and gave the impression that acleanup was under way.* 1992, the DNR formed the \"Fox., Coalition\" with 14 industry rep-rlSetitatives and several local officials.They tried to End a \"cooperative, vol-untary approach\" to river cleanup. Forsix years, the industries on the coali-tion and local officials dragged theirfeet, called for more studies, and failedto develop even an outline of a cleanupplan.The only real money the corpora-tions donated was more than $200,000to hire a public relations firm to tell thepublic what a great job they weredoing. Much of the coalition's time wasspent trying to locate governmentgrants (our tax dollars) to pay for thecleanup.Now that the state's weakness hasbeen exposed, and the federal govern-ment is breathing down their neckswith Superfund, the corporations havelaunched a media blitz, claiming\"Science is the Solution.\" Yet $25 mil-lion has already been spent studyingthe Fox Rjver. It's one of the most stud-ied bodies of water in the world. PCBs 8 The Scene July 1999have also been intensively studied by 'international experts for decades, andare well-known health risks. And local-ly, our wildlife is an indicator of ourown risks, as animals suffer fromdeformities, tumors, thyroid abnor-malities, immune system problemsand reproductive failures.Appleton Papers makes severalfalse claims in its advertisements.First, it claims PCBs are safely buriedin the sediments, and that a 100-yearflood in 1990 did not cause movementof PCBs into Green Bay. But scientistsspent more than $13 million on the\"Green Bay Mass Balance Study\" doc-umenting and computerizing the aver-age movement of 600 pounds of PCBsdown the river each year. Storms arean undisputed factor. The PCBs arenot safely buried. They're moving andwe need to catch them before they allget to the bay. Up to 70 percent of thePCBs in all of Lake Michigan are com-ing from our Fox River.Furthermore, the deeper PCBs willremain toxic for centuries, and manyare piled up behind locks and dams.What happens in 100 to 200 yearswhen a dam gives way? What happenswhen dams need repair and replace-ment? Who will pay the cost of dealingwith PCB-contaminated sediments inthe future if we don't require the cor-porations to clean up their mess now?It's understandable that the papercompanies would like to escape thisliability, but taxpayers should see thata complete cleanup is a good invest-ment against future taxpayer costs.Appleton Papers claims the cleanupshould only meet the U.S. Food andDrug Administration's standard forfish consumption, which is 2 parts permillion (ppm). But the PDA warned 20years ago that this standard shouldnever be applied to a local PCB hotspotwhere heavy fish eaters face a consis-tently higher average PCB level.Recently, after more than eightyears of study and negotiation, theGreat Lakes states agreed on a new\"Protocol for a Uniform Great LakesSport Fish Consumption Advisory,\"which set a standard of .05 ppm PCBsin fish. But this number was a politicalcompromise (as so many standardsare) which still allows a 1-in-10,000cancer risk. And it doesn't of 1.5 ppm PCBs fish fallsshort of achieving even the compro-mised .05 ppm standard. It's ludicrousfor me corporations to attack this weakcleanup number as \"unrealistic\" or loostrong. If anything, local anglersshould be outraged that the DNR'splan wffl*tfll leave our public river andbay loo contaminated for unlimitedfish and duck consumption.The realty is that many fishers andtheir lamjfiei have been eating PCB-taced fish for 40 years and at levelsmuch higher than these. They couldalready be experiencing health prob-lems, though nobody has bothered tolook. U could be another 15 or 20 yearsbefore the cleanup standard is met Inthe meantime, does Appleton Papersintend to compensate these anglers fortheir reduced fishing opportunities orincreased medical bills?Ifi important to keep in mind thatlocal flab actually contain hundreds of.Other toxic chemicals along with.thePCB* \u2014 such as dioxins, furans, mer-cury, arsenic and cadmium.The health effects of all these chem-icals acting together inside our bodies\\t unknown and unaccounted for in thefish advisories, which means the truehealth risks of local fish eating areactually higher. The good news is thatsediment cleanup should reduce thelevels of an these contaminants in fish.Appleton Papers hails \"naturalrecovery processes* as a dilution, spreading theirFox River pollution into LakeMichigan and beyond. -A Rde known fact from the MassBalance Study is that about 4.000pounds of PCBs also evaporate(volatilize) into the air off the surfaceof the Fox River and Green Bay eachyear and blow over the rest of theGreat Lakes, contributing significantlyto PCB fish-eating warnings in LakeSuperior and elsewhere. And when air-borne PCBs hit cold arctic air, they set-tle out and threaten the health ofEskimos, other northern people, andwildlife who depend on high-fat fishand seal meat 365 days of the year.Already, health experts warn that theentire Eskimo culture is threatened bytoxic chemicals from outside, and thetoxins are stil] accumulating.While it's true that our local PCBswill \"go away\" from the Fox River aftera century or two, it would be irrespon-sible to simply shift our contaminationto other areas.Appleton Papers supports cappingPCB hotspots in the river, and says\"capping does not destroy the ecolo-gy.\" Yet if the river bottom is filled orcovered with something foreign, theecology is altered to an unnatural con-dition. Worse yet, capping often does-n't work, and has failed to containPCBs in the Sheboygan River.The alternative, hydraulic (vacuum)dredging, does disturb the river's nat-ural bottom, but would leave behind anatural, deeper surface.Capping creates shallower, unnatur-al surfaces, with the risk of PCB leak-age and ultimate failure as erosionwears the cap away over the comingcenturies.The Fox River Group diverts ourattention and attracts goodwill withdonations to nature centers and tolocal universities for wildlife research,but these relatively small donationsare not a substitute for the higher-costriver cleanup. Diversions don't protectus from PCB contamination.After nearly 30 years of awarenessof the fox River PCB problem.Appleton Papers' excuses are wearingawfully thin. Our health is threatened.Public relations campaigns aren'tenough. Katers is aemtivt director of theClean Water Action Council, a nonprof-it group based in Green Bov.

State andfederal approval allows Fort James to design a part of itsexisting landfill toaccept the polluted sludge, said Len Polczinski, waste teamsupervisor for thestate Department of Natural Resources' northeast region. State and Fort James officials called the approval a key steptowarddemonstrating the effectiveness of dredging to clean the mostpolluted parts ofthe river. An environmental group, however, criticized theproposed cleanup as aproject \"designed to fail.\" Plans call for dredging about 70,000 cubic yards of sedimentcontaminated withpolychlorinated biphenyls, a class of chemicals suspected ofcausing cancer,from the river near the Fort James plant. Once water issqueezed from the sludge, an estimated 30,000 cubic yards \u2014 the equivalent of2,000 dump-truckloads \u2014 would be stored in the landfill. The PCBs would bedumped in aspecially spokesman. The landfill will haveimpervious linersand a system to collect any PCBs that leach from the sediment. PCBs bind tightly to soil, making them unlikely to escape froma well-designedlandfill, officials have said. Nonetheless, finding a site toaccept thepollutants in Wisconsin has proved difficult. PCBs were widelyused in theproduction and recycling of carbonless paper until theirproduction was bannedin the 1970s by the federal government. They are considered aprobablecarcinogen in humans. Colorless and odorless, the toxins alsohave been linkedto lower IQ scores and immune system defects. Fish, wildlifeand the water fromthe Fox River contain 10 to 800 times the level deemed safe. \"Finding a landfill for them has been a sticking point,\"Lindley said. \"Thiswill allow the project to go forward.\" Lindley estimated thatthe dredgingcould begin later this summer and continue into the fall. Undera 1997agreement, the $8 million, project will be managed by the DNRand funded byseven paper companies, including Port James, deemed byofficials to bepotentially responsible for the pollution. \"It's a demonstration project to show to local people that this0,1,14040,>canbe done safely,\" Polczinski said. \"In addition, everythingtaken out means less to contaminate fish.\" Pollution in the FoxRiver is suchthat the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is poised todeclare the 39-milestretch of the river and a portion of Green Bay a Superfundsite. That statuswould empower the agency to order a cleanup and bill the papercompanies deemedresponsible for the pollution \u2014 a project that could cost morethan $1 billion. The state and the paper companies are resisting the Superfunddesignation,saying a negotiated settlement would be cheaper and moreeffective than thefederal program. The state says it could cost as much as $720million and takeseven to 10 years to accomplish. But Rebecca Raters, executive director of an environmentalactivist group, the Clean Water Action Council of Northeastern Wisconsin, said thedemonstrat ionproject is \"designed to fail.* She predicted that the dredgingwill stir upclouds of contaminated sediments and leave others exposed toriver currents,providing the paper companies with evidence that removing thePCBs is moreharmful that allowing them to stay in the river. \"They're planning to dig a hole in the middle of the mostpolluted part of theriver,\" Raters said. \"What it will do is demonstrate a mess.\"She said hergroup favors Superfund designation and more comprehensivecleanup efforts. \"Wewant it done right,\" Raters said. \"That's The Milwaukee Journal SentinelCopyright 1999Wednesday, June 16, 1999News Environmentalists criticize Fox sludge panelToo few outsiders at table, group says;DNR contends body isn't making policy MEG JONES Journal Sentinel staff An environmental group is criticizing the makeup of a new statecommitteecreated to discuss the cleanup of contaminated sediment in theFox River becausethere are no public interest groups on the panel.

S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday movedone step closerto recommending a cleanup plan for the Lower Fox River. The EPA's Chicago Superfund office delivered a preliminary recoramendation for cleaning up Fox River PCB contamination into the hands ofits RemedyReview Board, an in-house body that does internal peer reviewsfor allproposed cleanups costing more than $30 million. Composed of senior Superfund managers and EPA technical staff,the boardmeets regularly to review proposed projects for feasibility,cost-effectiveness and consistency with BPA Superfund cleanuppolicy. Theboard will meet next month. For now, the contents of the proposal are being closely guardedby theagency. BPA staff will say only that it closely mirrors work currentlybeing done bythe Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The DNR is now working on revisions to a remedialinvestigation/feasibilitystudy, that lays out the extent of PCB contamination in theriver, the risksit poses and cleanup alternatives. The study includes cleanup options ranging from a $728.3millionall-dredging solution to a $154.5 million strategy thatcombines dredgingand capping contaminated sites with sand or rock. \"This is an extension of our internal, informal discussions,and we're notmaking it public because we don't want people to misconstruethat anythingwe're talking about is a final proposal, because we are not tothat pointyet,\" said James Hahnenbero. the BPA's Superfund projectmanager for the FoxRiver. A cleanup proposal is expected to be released early next year,followed by a60-day public comment period. The Fox River Group of paper companies, seven companiesidentified assources of the contamination, and the Clean Water ActionCouncil, recipientsof an EPA technical assistance grant, will be invited tocomment and presenttheir own proposals. But those groups also won't be allowed to see the EPA'spreliminary plan forthe river. -> Dennis Hultgren, a spokesman for Appleton Papers, said the FoxRiver Grouphas not yet received details from SPA about how to comment, orto what issues the group should address its comments. \"We don't have a whole lot of time to work out what kind ofcommenta we'regoing to submit,\" he said. However, Hultgren said the BPA'\u00bb announcement that itsrecommendations won'tcome out until next year is good news for the paper companiesbecause itwill allow them to submit data from a test dredging projectscheduled tostart near DePere in August. The three-month pilot project is expected to provide additionalinformationabout the safety and effectiveness of dredging along the39-mile stretch ofthe Fox River targeted for cleanup. The paper industry has longbeencritical of dredging as a risky and expensive cleanup approach. Bahnenberg said the DKR study and the XPA's proposal aretraveling onseparate, but roughly parallel tracks. Still, he said, technical issues and the question of to whatextent GreenBay should be included in the state study that need to behammered outbefore the agencies efforts can come together in acomprehensive plan. If that doesn't happen, or if the paper companies don't agreewith theproposed cleanup, the Pox would likely be listed as a Superfundsite. \"We're hopeful that down the road we'd converge on the samekind of plan,\"he said. \"I'm sure we will because we really don't have anyfundamentaldisagreements with the state. When we do make a proposal, weexpect it willbe done jointly with the state.\" Karl Ebert may be reached at (920) 426-6688. / WISCONSINDEPT. OF NATURAL RESOURCES NEWS RELEASEWisconsin Department 266-1902 Lower Fox River Natural Resource Damage AssessmentPlan available for review MADISON, Wis. - The state is asking people to review and comment on a plan for the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) of the Lower Fox River. An NRDA identifies and quantifies potential ^juries to natural resources and determines actions and costs to restore contaminated sites. The parties responsible for contamination and injuries must pay for the losses and help restore the natural resources through funding or direct action. A plan ensures that the NRDA is performed in a thorough and systematic manner at a reasonable cost. The NRDA is one mechanism to restore natural resources (fish, wildlife, land, water, etc.) that have been injured by hazardous substances. Injuries may include death or destruction of natural resources and may also include the loss of resource availability to the public, which can occur when fish and wildlife become too contaminated to eat safely. Under Wisconsin's Constitution and laws, the state has jurisdiction and serves as trustee over natural resources within its borders (state-lead resources). As the authorized trustee, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) will assess damages, resulting from polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination of the Lower Fox River system. The NRDA is being funded by the Fox River Group of paper companies (comprised of Appleton Papers, Inc., Fort James Corporation, NCR Corporation, P.H. Glatfelter Company, Riverside Paper Corporation, U.S. iper Mills Corporation, and Wisconsin Tissue Mills, Inc.) through a 1997 agreement with the State of Wisconsin. The NRDA plan is available for public review at libraries from Oshkosh to Door County. The plan will so be posted on the DNR website at http://www.dnr.state.wi.us within the next couple weeks. Written comments will be accepted until September 7, 1999 and may be sent to Mr. Greg Hill, Wisconsin DNR, WT/2, 101 S. Webster Street, P.O. Box 7921, Madison, WI 53707-7921. -30- / "}
