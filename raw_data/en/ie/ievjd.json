And, 'tis the season, the subject o f gifts comes to the forefront. Since our culture has increasingly become more technology -focused and constantly on -the-go, our holidays, too, have become a celebration of consumer -ism. Getting gifts has devolved into getting the recipient only what they ask for, an endless stack o f gift cards, or abandoning gifts all together. Where is the joy in this? What does it mean to give a gift? It means that you care about someone: that you want to do something nice for them that brings them joy. It shows that you know who they are and appreciate their interests. It shows in the smile and surprise the y express when they receive the gift. As the giver, this is the biggest happiness you can receive: feeling that this special person now has a token that signifies a small portion of the love you feel for them. This year, consider giving the gift of health. What better way to demonstrate your love and care for someone than to help th em improve their health? We can be rich, we can have all kinds of \"stuff,\" we can go places, we can be around great people, yet if we don't feel well, can we really enjoy any of it? The gift of health means you can move your body better, your endurance improves, your energy increases, you are sleeping better and feel well rested, your longevity is enhanced, and you feel more mentally clear, happier, and have a more positive attitude. (Um, yes?!!!!) And, talk about \"the gift that keeps on giving:\" when you are experiencing life like this, you mak e life more enjoyable for all of the other people you encounter. Then, joy spreads more joy. Now, that sounds like what the holida ys and giving gifts were intended to be! It is in this spirit that this edition of the NITE Light is full of gift ideas for health. From small lifestyle tweaks and r ecipes to series' of massages and consultations to furthering education with interesting classes, there are ideas for every person in your life . We all wish you a wonderfully happy Holiday season and blessings for a healthy New Year!

I think this is most exciting and most empowering! You get to decide what state of health you want to have. The tricky part is believing that you can do this and taking action to make it happen. First, you have to clarify your intentions around what you do want regarding your health. If this is difficult, there are some great books by Louise Hay available in the Herbs, etc. store to help you set goals and create affirmations. You can also make an appointment for PSYCH -K\u00ae balances which integrates beliefs in the mind with the function of the brain and body to make achieving your goals easier to accomplish. Next, you have to take action. Here are some common health misconceptions, what the truth really is, and steps to take to incorporate these things into your healthy lifestyle. Falsehood #1 Salt is bad: it 's bad for the heart, and it raises blood pressure. We've heard forever that salt is bad for heart health and that a low sodium diet is the one to follow. Well, that 's true if we 're talking about refined white table salt. What most people think of as salt is refined sodium and chloride, which is possibly iodized to make it healthier (false!). In fact, real sea salt, like Himalayan sea salt or Redmond 's sea salt, has a balanced ratio of minerals, like potassium and sodium, and has been used for thousands of years because of its health benefits. Have you heard the expression: \"worth one 's salt? \" Well, that saying comes from the fact that Roman soldiers were paid in salt or given an allowance to be able to purchase salt; that 's how highly salt was regarded at that time. Sodium is considered the \"Youth \" mineral; it helps with flexibility and healthy joints. It helps with hydration. Actually, good quality sea salt helps relieve bloating and water retention because of its mineral balance. It has 84 trace minerals in it, and in the age of our nutritionally -depleted farming practices, this is important! It is a great source of electrolytes that are essential for muscle function, preventing muscle cramps, and aiding in heart and brain health. It has anti -inflammatory properties that benefit the skin, adrenal glands (which are affected by stress!), and wait for it - even blood pressure! Natural sodium is also necessary for proper digestion, because it is a component in the production of hydrochloric acid which helps break down carbohydrates and proteins in your diet. The Truth About Health Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH 5 Imbalances here can create symptoms such as indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux, gas, and bloating. So, the truth is we should all be using a good quality sea salt every day! Sprinkle it on your food, put it in your water, or make your own electrolyte drink by adding sea salt and some lemon or lime juice to your water. Try 1 tsp daily! Falsehood #2 Coffee and pop are not harmful to health. I'm sorry; no matter how many studies come out and say that either one of them, especially coffee, is beneficial, I am not going to agree. They create acidity in the body, they are dehydrating, they stress the adrenal glands, and they deplete your friendly bacteria. Plus, the pop can have chemical sweeteners, dyes, and other toxic ingredients (brominated vegetable oil = thyroid disaster). In fact, some of my clients have seen the most dramatic health improvements just by drinking more water and weaning off of coffee and/or pop. Just making that switch! So, if you 're a pop drinker, and you don 't like the taste of water, add some real fruit or fruit juice to it for flavor. If you're a coffee drinker, switch to an herbal tea or an herbal coffee, like Teecino. Herbs, etc. carries several flavors of the Teecino coffee as well as many flavors of herbal tea (Toasted Coconut Caramel? Double Dark Chocolate Mate? Ginger Peach? Yum!) And, if you can 't make the switch in one day, start weaning down: instead of one full cup of coffee, drink \u00bd cup coffee and \u00bd cup Teecino and slowly make the switch. So, the truth is the coffee and pop need to go, and you can find some other tasty ritual that you will love! Falsehood #3 You have to be born flexible. Good news! This is totally not true. Flexibility is something that you build just like training weights for stronger muscles. In fact, I am more flexible now than I was in elementary school - because I 've been working on it! Proper hydration and good nutrition is essential. So, make sure you are drinking water. Plus, the natural sodium that was mentioned earlier is key for joint flexibility. Then, you need some good fats to lubricate the joints. Butter and coconut oil are great. Nature 's Sunshine carries the Super Omega 3 EPA and Flaxseed Oil in capsules. Herbs etc. also has a wide variety of Barlean 's oils in delicious liquid flavors like Strawberry Banana, Orange Cream, and Pomegranate Blueberry Smoothie. Finally, you need to practice! The only way your flexibility will improve is if you are using it. So, find a stretching, yoga, or qi gong video or class, and commit to it. The truth is that flexibility can be acquired, and better flexibility leads to fewer injuries, less pain, greater strength, and a more positive state of mind. Falsehood #4 Supplements are a waste of money, and massage is a luxury. This couldn 't be farther from the truth. First of all, farming practices have changed, the soil is depleted of nutrients, and the food is being depleted and changed by genetic modifying, pesticides, chemicals, and who knows what else. We really do need supplements to support and build our health and prevent dis - ease these days. And, if we are working on improving a health concern, we certainly need supplemental support to nourish those areas of the body being affected so that they have the energy to return to balance. In regards to massage, it may feel luxurious, yet it is a necessity. Massage improves circulation, lymphatic flow, nerve communication, and numerous other body functions, not to mention that it improves your mental and emotional outlook and helps build self-esteem. In fact, receiving massage on a regular basis actually helps your nutritional program work more effectively. In essence, investing in regular bodywork sessions means less money on supplements because the ones you are taking will work better and quicker. So, the truth is that everyone should visit their naturopath regularly to advise them on their health program and also, receive regular bodywork as part of their lifestyle plan. You are worth it: schedule those appointments, or stop in to buy some gift certificates! Have you looked in the mirror today? Did you realize that there were messages there for you? That 's right; long before cell phones were dinging you with texts, your reflection was also trying to get your attention. Our bodies are amazing in their design, and they give us an outward sign that there is an imbalance on the inside. The eyes, the face, the hair, the tongue, the fingernails, etc., etc., all relay information about the functioning and health of different organs in the body. Isn 't it great that our bodies give us a non -invasive means of evaluating what is going on inside them?! In this article, we will be featuring what messages the face has to convey, so grab your mirror, and here we go! Every line, mole, pimple, and \"spot\" means something according to where it is located. To begin, the upper part of the forehead relates to the large intestine, while the lower part of the forehead, closest to the eyebrows, relates to the small intestine. Horizontal lines are common in these areas and indicate an imbalance with digestion (small intestine) and elimination (large intestine). Moles or other spots here, depending on their location, will indicate the same. Consider food enzymes, probiotics, or even a colon cleanse to address these types of imbalances. The area between the eyebrows and also directly under the eyebrows (above the eyes) relates to the liver and gallbladder. Vertical lines are common between the eyebrows and indicates liver congestion as well as unresolved anger. Adding fresh lemon to your water and/ or taking a liver support supplement like Liver Cleanse Formula or LIV -J will be helpful to aid this type of imbalance. The flower essences, Find Strength and Keep Cool, can address the emotional component of a liver/gallbladder imbalance. The upper part of the nose at the bridge area relates to the pancreas. Lines or spots in this area can indicate blood sugar balance issues. So, eliminating processed foods, especially white flour and white sugar, and eating more whole foods and proteins will be beneficial. 6 The area in between the eyes on either side of the nose and the area just at the end of each eyebrow corresponds with the spleen. Again, eliminating processed foods as well as eating warm foods (like soups and root vegetables) will be helpful. Chinese Spleen Activator is an excellent herbal blend to support spleen health. The area directly below each eye as well as both ears relate to the kidneys. Puffiness, redness, or blueness under the eyes, especially, is a sign that the kidneys require some balance. Make sure that you are drinking \u00bd your body weight in ounces of water each day. The tip of the nose corresponds with the heart. Redness, veins, or spots in this area indicate heart and circulation concerns. Some ideas for balance here could include Hawthorn Berries, Cardio Assurance, and Capsicum, Garlic, and Parsley. Most of the area that we call the cheeks relates to the lungs. Moles or spots here are trying to communicate an imbalance with the respiratory system. Deep breathing, breathing exercises, and supplements like Four or Lung Support can be helpful. The chin area corresponds with the reproductive system, and moles and pimples are common when this area needs some attention. There are a number of herbal supplements, for both men and women, that will support the reproductive glands, plus the oil blend EndoFlex is great for restoring balance to the entire endocrine system. Well, what did your face say? This is just a quick overview of the messages that your face can relay about your overall health. For a more in depth analysis and/or a personalized program to address these messages, consult with one of the naturopaths at Herbs, Etc.

The patient is generally seen as a collection of symptoms and previous treatment. Medical professionals are trained to keep a clinical distance from their patients and to avoid becoming emotionally involved. The results have been disastrous on both sides. There is increasing burnout of the medical professionals and limited positive outcomes in patient care. Narrative medicine, the art of \"close listening, \" has entered into treatment rooms across the country. It began several years ago in New York City at Columbia University 's School of Medicine. The medical faculty saw a crisis in listening in health care. Since then, it has become a required course in many nursing and medical schools. Those medical doctors trained in using narrative medicine 's methods have seen significant improvements in patient care and their own emotional well being. Patients report \"feeling heard \" which makes them more optimistic about getting well. We know in natural health that hope and optimism are powerful remedies for physical illness. Narrative Medicine in Natural Health The practice of narrative medicine has spread into many fields \u2014including natural health. Holistic health 's model of wellness and the whole person make it the natural field for narrative medicine to thrive. Narrative medicine 's process of \"close listening\" hones into a person 's story of illness and creates a context for collaborative listening. The result is the patient feels heard which significantly improves the outcome of therapy. How does it work? The best way to understand is to imagine a scene like the following: A naturopath sits behind their desk and listens to a new client 's list of symptoms and complaints, noting down certain issues. The client is anxious for help and has been suffering for some time. She tells the person about her experience with illness, tearing up from time to time. The naturopath hears her report of symptoms and mentally begins to form a treatment plan. The new client leaves the consultation with a list of therapies and supplements to take. She is hopeful that this time she will get better. Over the next few weeks, she dutifully follows her instructions for treatment and sees some improvement. She begins not to follow the protocol and fears the loss of even more quality of life, and she 's worried about being able to stay on her new therapies and supplements. At their next meeting, she pours out her fears and doubts to the naturopath. The naturopath is sympathetic and also feels the client is resistant to getting well and says so. The client feels that she must change, but how? The client leaves with a new therapy request, this time for emotional healing. In the meantime, the naturopath wishes there was a way to help the client see what she sees. \"If only, \" she thinks to herself, \"my client would leave behind this illness story she is telling herself, she would get well much faster. \" Can Narrative Medicine Improve Natural Health? By Sheila Carroll 13 What is happening here? They are both stuck and yet both want the same thing \u2014healing. What can be done? To improve results requires a paradigm shift to a more collaborative relationship in which the client and practitioner are working together for the best outcome-- symbolized by sitting in chairs facing each other. As the interview progresses the therapist uses close listening skills to create a space in which they can recognize, interpret, and be moved by stories of illness they are hearing. Close listening involves using the three R 's of... Recognition of other Respect for the other Responsiveness to the other The goal in close listening is to understand the stories and themes that have shaped a person's life before they come in asking for help. Out of all the experiences a person has lived, what has held the most meaning? What choices, intentions, and relationships have been most important? Narrative medicine proposes that only those experiences that are part of a larger story will have significant impact on a person 's lived experience. In this way, the health care professional can focus on building the plot which connects a person's life together as part of their care. We know that illness causes fragmentation of the personality. In fact, the loss of wholeness can be said to be the primary cause of illness. When the therapist understands the bigger picture of a person 's life and reflects that back to the client, they feel seen and heard and healing can begin. How Does Narrative Medicine Work? Here are a few simple principles to help in understanding how narrative medicine can improve outcomes in natural health. 1. You, as the listener, are the receiver of that whole person before you. You are there to listen in a deep way. You do not judge or analyze, and you note any biases you may have. 2. You, as the listener, bring your whole person to the interview. You bring your personality, thoughts, hopes, and dreams. As much as possible, you are fully present to your client. 3. You ask yourself five questions that, with practice, become automatic: When is this happening? Where is it happening? What do I hear? What do I see? How does it feel? The five questions may, at first, seem rather simplistic, but once you attempt them, you will see how profoundly it changes your view of the client. You will be able to pick up themes and issues not otherwise noted. The willingness of the client to comply is much higher, because they feel heard and seen. Using the three principles of Narrative Medicine can bring a greater sense of healing, wholeness, and compassion into your life no matter if you are a practitioner, a student of natural health, or just deeply interested in personal wellness.

Her training in colon hydrotherapy has taught her a great deal about gut health and other ailments related to such things as the brain, migraines, memory, toxicity, allergies, skin conditions, and much more. Not only does Haley specialize in gut health, but she has been studying emotions for years. When we are not getting the results we are looking for with our physical health, finding the emotional component can significantly improve the healing process. Working with addiction is another interest of Haley's. Both of these consultants are accepting new clients at Herbs Etc. Call (989) 773-3636 to get your health consultation scheduled!
