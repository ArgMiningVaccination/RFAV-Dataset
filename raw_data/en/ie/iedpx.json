Detoxification removes toxins, excess mucus and congestion from the body through a cleansing process, which can take many forms, including diet, herbal remedies and acupuncture. Detoxification starts with changes in diet and lifestyle that reduce the ingestion of toxins through foods such as sugar, caffeine, refined food products, in addition to alcohol and tobacco, to improve the body's natural elimination process. Chemicals found in every day products such as hairspray, deodorant, and household cleansers must also be avoided. In addition to chemical avoidance, drinking large quantities of water speeds up the elimination process and flushes the toxins quicker. Acupuncture can play an important role in the detoxification process. It reduces stress, which is a major contributor to the production of internal toxin levels and hinders the natural healing process. Acupuncture increases blood circulation and restores homeostasis through the flow of Qi, providing the body energy to recuperate naturally. In the process acupuncture improves the functionality of the immune system, making the body more resistant to disease. It also helps to improve the functions of the digestive system and other vital organs. Once the body has achieved homeostasis, toxins can be expelled. Body massage also helps to improve the functions of the immune system and the absorption of nutrients and minerals during digestion. The muscles and tissues are strengthened and bowel disorders like constipation are alleviated, not to mention it's very relaxing too. These are the things that support an optimum natural detoxification of the body. What are toxins? Toxicity is the degree to which something is poisonous and is of major concern in the 21st century as chemical based products, by-products and emissions are pervasive in most urban, suburban and rural areas of population. Heavy Metal Toxicity Over the duration of years, heavy metals, such as lead, iron, cobalt, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel, and uranium accumulate in the organs and tissues of the body, eliminating essential minerals and severely impacting physiological functions. Some heavy metals are necessary in minute amounts; however, excess amounts absorbed through the lungs and skin, as well as, ingested through food intake, can literally poison the body. Heavy metals affect the liver, teeth, skin, central nervous system, and bones, among others. Heavy metals are a part of our modern society as the soaring world population requires technology that is less expensive and is delivered to the consumer quickly. Heavy metals are released into the atmosphere and absorbed into the body through processes such as, nuclear waste, industrial spillage, manufacturing emissions, coal burning and other fuel producing pollution. They are a major cause of hormonal imbalances, cancer, thyroid problems, neurological disturbances, learning problems, depression, food allergies, and the immune system. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TOXICITY |Headaches||Runny Nose||Backaches|| congestion| Why do we need cleansing detoxification? Toxins are substances that create irritation and harmful effects on the body, negatively impacting the physical immune system, as well as emotional, mental and spiritual health systems. Chemicals in the air and water, food and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous. Chemical toxicity in the body is linked to cancer and cardiovascular disease, arthritis, allergies, obesity, and many skin problems. Other symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, pains, coughs, gastrointestinal problems, allergy symptoms, can all be related to toxicity. Toxicity can occur both externally and internally. In both cases, we are exposed to them every day in great quantities. Externally, toxins from our environment can be ingested, inhaled and absorbed through physical contact with them. Internally, our body naturally produces toxins as part of normal functioning activities which generate substances that need to be eliminated, such as bacteria, yeasts, and parasites. Our thoughts and emotions, as well as, stress can also generate increased levels of biochemical toxicity. While physical detoxification is crucial to maintaining health, mental detoxification is also important. Negative thoughts and emotions cause stress, which in turn, suppresses the immune system and generates internal toxins. Cleansing the body and mind can positively impact spirituality as well, allowing clarity of purpose to develop unobstructed. Many common acute and chronic illnesses may be alleviated by a program of cleansing detoxification.
