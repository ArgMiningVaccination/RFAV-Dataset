The word Spiritual originates from the Latin 'spiritus' meaning 'breath of life'. Healers transfer healing 'universal' energy to the person who needs it and the benefits can be felt on many levels - physical, mental and emotional. No faith is required and it is suitable for most people including children and animals. In accordance with 'NHS Choices' your Doctor can refer you for Spiritual Healing if it is felt that it will be beneficial and you also have a right to request Spiritual Healing. Healing can also take place in hospitals with the agreement of the Doctor responsible for your care plan. If you are unable to attend the clinics then healing can still be administered via Distance Healing. This is just as effective as the 'Laying of Hands'. Lisa trained with Mr George Stone (Newport Holism Centre), who has over forty years of experience providing Spiritual Healing, and she is accredited with the Healer Practitioner Association International. English Kings and Queens practised healing, from the time of Edward the Confessor to the reign of Queen Anne. Throughout the year Lisa attends various health and wellbeing events providing Spiritual Healing and talking about how Hypnotherapy and Healing can help. A brief consultation takes place to allow you to meet Lisa and a full explanation of what is involved in the spiritual healing process is provided. If you are then happy to continue you will be asked to complete a consultation form and then healing will be given whilst you are sat on a chair or laying on the therapy bed. If you are happy for Lisa to place her hands on non-sensitive parts of your body then 'Laying of Hands' contact healing will take place. If you would prefer to just have hand-to-hand contact or no physical contact at all please tell Lisa. The duration of Healing varies dependent upon the clients needs - some sessions may only take around 20 minutes whereas other long term or more chronic cases may take longer. Once complete you will be given a glass of water and asked for feedback on your healing experience. Most recipients describe receiving healing as being a very relaxing and calming experience. Each person's healing experience is unique and you may experience feelings of warmth, coolness, tingling or none of these. What happens for you is right for you. Sometimes just one session is all you need. However, for more chronic health conditions and where there are underlying issues further sessions may be required. Lisa abides by the Code of Conduct of the Healer Practitioner Association International. "}
