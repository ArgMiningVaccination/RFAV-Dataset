It is your body's own personal defense system and if you want to keep your self healthy, you have to help your immune system. As [COVID-19](https://www.willschiro.com/blog/tips-to-stay-healthy) continues to spread, it is particularly important to keep your immune system. Here are our tips to help boost your immune system. Consume Vitamin C Vitamin C is an antioxidant that will help boost your immune system. It's largely known for its cold and flu-fighting power and is often advertised as an immune system supporter. To get more Vitamin C, add foods like oranges, lemons, and limes into your diet. Leafy greens like kale, spinach, and dark lettuce also have Vitamin C. Both whole foods and supplements are a great way to get Vitamin C in your diet. Exercise Exercise is a great way to help your immune system health. It can help you maintain a healthy weight, keep blood pressure and blood sugar regulated, and keep your digestive system moving. All of these factors give your immune system extra power. Exercise helps you stay healthy overall and a regular routine can keep your body strong so it can fight off illness more easily. Visit Wills Chiropractic for Regular Chiropractic Care Seeing a chiropractor isn't just for treating neck and back pain - it can also make a big difference for your immune system. When the spine is in proper alignment, all systems and parts of the body can function optimally. Because the spine is part of the central nervous system, proper alignment allows messages to travel more efficiently throughout the body. That means your overall health and wellness improves, including that of your immune system.
