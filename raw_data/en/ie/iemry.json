Should we be celebrating? \"Y es and no, \" according to Timothy Block, PhD , president and co-founder of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its research arm, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. \"There is no question that the discovery of HBV , its association with liver disease, and development of the HBV vaccine are recognized as being among the major scientific achievements of the 20th century. \" The discovery of HBV and invention of the vaccine have literally saved hundreds of millions of lives. Indeed, for these discoveries, Baruch S. Blumberg, MD, DPhil , was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. During the early 1960s, Blumberg and colleagues were searching for genetic polymorphisms by analyzing blood proteins from individuals of diverse geographic origins, including aboriginal people from Australia. The designation \" Australia antigen\" (Au) was used in the first paper to report this finding ( Blumberg, Alter, Visnich, JAMA 1965 ). The association of Au with chronic hepatitis was first suggested in 1966 in a study of patients with Down's syndrome. This prompted W . Thomas London, MD , and others working with Blumberg to analyze the serum of many more patients with acute, resolved and persistent hepatitis. In 1967, Blumberg and London published a paper that linked Au with hepatitis infection and later developed an assay to detect its presence in the blood. The association of Australia antigen with both acute and chronic hepatitis was eventually firmly established.Even before complete acceptance that HBV was the cause of \"serum hepatitis, \" Harvey Alter, MD , and his colleagues at the National Institutes of Health led the call to test all blood to be used for transfusions for the presence of Au. Testing the national blood supply was an important translation of basic scientific findings into an enormously useful clinical application in an unprecedented short amount of time. Transfusion-associated hepatitis declined more than 70% in a matter of a few years. But then, advances in hepatitis B research stalled. The safe blood supply and an effective vaccine made it less urgent that a cure be found.

INFORMEDNo. 68THE NEWSLETTER OF THE HEPATITIS B FOUNDATION FALL 2015 Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Hepatitis B Virus Discovery50years Dr. Baruch Blumberg (center front) discovered the 'Australia antigen,' later identified as the hepatitis B virus, with Dr. W. Thomas London (left of Blumberg) and their research team at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. (Photo taken in the 1960's)From the Editor's Desk First World Hepatitis Summit Focuses on Elimination The mood was euphoric. It was a love fest, actually. More than 600 policy makers, public health experts, and representatives from non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and patient advocacy groups from 80 countries, including the Hepatitis B Foundation, were invited to participate in the first World Hepatitis Summit during September 2-5 in Glasgow, Scotland, hosted by the World Hepatitis Alliance in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO). The message was serious. Hepatitis B and C kill more people each year than HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined, and together the two viruses represent the seventh-leading cause of death worldwide. Y et, viral hepatitis as a global health concern, which results in 1.5 million deaths annually, remains mostly invisible and under-funded. But the focus at the summit was on raising awareness and solving the problem. This wasn't a pity party. Rather, the WHO unveiled its ambitious global plan to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030 based on their assessment that elimination is a feasible goal. Given that the policy-makers in attendance and the NGO and patient advocacy representatives were in agreement that more can and must be done to address the viral hepatitis pandemic, the WHO plan was an inspiring light at the end of a long tunnel. Many speakers emphasized a key message driving the summit - that action is much cheaper than inaction. The high economic cost of illness and premature deaths caused by viral hepatitis would be greatly reduced if more effective immunization, screening and treatment programs were available. Without aggressive intervention, the WHO estimates there will be 20 million needless deaths around the world from viral hepatitis over the next 15 years. In addition, addressing the global problem of viral hepatitis is more than just a public health concern. It's also a human rights issue. Individuals don't want to get tested for HBV or HCV because they can lose educational and career opportunities, lose their jobs (see page 7) and their loved ones. If one is afraid to access necessary health care, then a basic human right is being violated. As a result, stigma and discrimination must be addressed in any global planning for the elimination of viral hepatitis.

Thank you!Hepatitis B: A Wave of New Therapies on the Horizon To mark the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the hepatitis B virus, the Journal of Antiviral Research has compiled an HBV Symposium - a special collection of articles - organized by Drs. Timothy Block, Jinhong Chang and Ju-Tao Guo of the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute , which was established by the Hepatitis B Foundation to fulfill its research mission. Although much has been accomplished over the past five decades, current antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis B achieve sustained clearance of infection in only a minority of patients. Recent success in using combinations of drugs to cure almost all cases of chronic hepatitis C has stimulated interest in a similar approach to curing chronic hepatitis B. Papers in the HBV symposium review the history, science and current management of hepatitis B, and describe a wave of newly identified drug targets, investigational compounds and experimental strategies that are under clinical evaluation or in preclinical development. Articles in the symposium are available for free download on the website of Antiviral Research , the official publication of the International Society for Antiviral Research at www.journals.elsevier.com/antiviral-research/symposia/ symposium-hepatitis-b. Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Fall 2015 hepb.org 350th Anniversary of HBV Discovery ...continued from Front Page The fortuitous, albeit important, discovery that interferon and oral antivirals in the management of HIV could be used to manage HBV made the U.S. and the western world even more complacent. The search for a cure for hepatitis B lost momentum. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) was then discovered in 1989 and the nation became panicked. The already limited funding for hepatitis research was redirected toward the new virus. Now, within just 25 years of its discovery, HCV is essentially curable. But what about hepatitis B? It is still not cured by current therapies. Renewed Momentum Finally, after a decade of limited interest in HBV science, the momentum around hepatitis B is growing. Perhaps because researchers are now shifting their focus from HCV or perhaps because Asia \u2014 where HBV is most prevalent \u2014 is growing in wealth, a renewed interest in a cure for chronic HBV infection has never been greater. For example, just a couple of year ago only 50 people showed up for the Special Interest Group (SIG) on hepatitis B at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases meeting. Last year, more than 500 people attended the SIG to hear about the research pipeline for new HBV experimental therapies! \"With that quantity, and, frankly, quality of interest, we are very optimistic our time has come, and we will be seeing revolutionary new therapies for hepatitis B within the next few years, \" Block predicts. Fortunately, there is now a new wave of HBV antiviral strategies coming through the research pipeline. There are many other steps in the virus life cycle that can be targeted for potential drug intervention. Some of these are viral functions and, of course, some involve the immune system. So that brings us back to the original question. Y es, we should be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the discovery of HBV and can now look forward with growing confidence to celebrating the cure. Hopefully, we are beginning to write the next and perhaps final chapter in the history of the hepatitis B virus.\" We are very optimistic our time has come, and we will be seeing revolutionary new therapies for hepatitis B within the next few years.\" \u2014 Dr. Timothy Block, president and co-founder, Hepatitis B Foundation and the Baruch S.

Blumberg Institute, established by the Hepatitis B Foundation to fulfill its research mission, announced the creation of the W . Thomas London Distinguished Professorship in recognition of Dr. London's transformational contributions to the discovery of the hepatitis B virus and his unwavering commitment to the elimination of this devastating liver disease, which kills almost one million people each year. \"For more than half a century, Dr. London has represented the very best in a doctor and scientist - sincere compassion and outstanding research to advance the cause of and cure for hepatitis B, \" said Dr. Timothy Block , president and co-founder of the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute and the Hepatitis B Foundation. \"The W . Thomas London Distinguished Professorship is imbued from the outset with a legacy of scientific integrity and achievement that will inspire the occupants of this professorial chair for generations to come. \" In 1966, Dr. London left the National Institutes of Health to join Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, PA. His long-term collaboration with Dr. Blumberg, who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the hepatitis B virus, led to breakthrough epidemiological, clinical, and virological studies of hepatitis B and its link to primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Dr. London was the first to report the association of what was then called the ' Australia antigen' with acute hepatitis, and then, together with colleagues, the association with chronic hepatitis. The Australia antigen was named the 'hepatitis B virus' since there was already a hepatitis A virus. He showed that chronic hepatitis B infections were endemic among patients in hemodialysis units, while staff that became infected developed acute hepatitis. This was the first demonstration of the role of the immune system in determining the type of hepatitis a person developed. In 2009, Dr. London retired from Fox Chase after having served as a senior member of the Division of Population Science, director of the Liver Cancer Prevention Center, and chairman of the Institutional Review Board. He currently serves as vice-president of the Board of Directors for both the Hepatitis B Foundation and the Blumberg Institute. Dr. London is a graduate of Oberlin College and Cornell University Medical College. He received his clinical training in Internal Medicine at Bellevue Hospital and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New Y ork City. A Woman for All Seasons HBF Associate Executive Director Peggy Farley Retires The Hepatitis B Foundation salutes Peggy Farley, MBA , who is retiring after almost 12 years with the organization. She started as Outreach Coordinator and is leaving as Associate Executive Director. During her tenure marked by outstanding accomplishments, Peggy helped build awareness about the organization and hepatitis B, managed the comprehensive outreach and education programs, and coordinated its national and international meetings. Under her leadership for the past 7 years, the International HBV Meeting, which brings hundreds of scientists together from around the world to North America, Europe and Asia on a rotating basis, has developed into a very successful, professionally run conference that is growing in numbers each year. Most importantly, Peggy's lasting legacy will be her 'high-touch' approach to fulfilling the mission of the HBF. She cared deeply for the patients and families that are served and for the colleagues she managed and worked with. Peggy will be greatly missed by everyone who had the privilege of working with her and by the families whose lives were forever touched by her. Best wishes to an amazing woman as she enjoys the next season in her life!Dr. Ju Tao Guo Named First W. Thomas London Distinguished Professor The inaugural recipient of the W . Thomas London Distinguished Professor is Ju-Tao Guo, MD , director of Experimental Therapeutics at the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. Dr. Guo is a leader in the field of hepatitis B research and worked closely with Dr. London and other leading hepatitis scientists at the Fox Chase Cancer Center before joining the Blumberg Institute. Dr. Guo has been conducting antiviral research and studying the molecular pathogenesis of hepatitis viruses, flaviviruses and human coronaviruses for more than 30 years. \"The selection committee had a list of highly distinguished candidates, \" Block said. \"Dr. Guo was at the top of that list, and we are proud to name him as the first to hold the London professorship and continue the legacy of scientific achievement established by Drs. London and Blumberg. \" Dr. Guo is working on innovative therapeutic strategies for hepatitis B with the goal of finding a cure. He received his medical training at Lanzhou University School of Medicine in China and postdoctoral training with Dr. Christoph Seeger at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.

This summit is the largest assembly of hepatitis B community coalition leaders from across the country with over 60 participants in attendance from 31 member coalitions and national organizations that focused on ways to prevent and eradicate hepatitis B in the United States. From storytelling techniques such as the #justB campaign initiated by AAPCHO, to the power of data collection and coalition building, Hep B United members examined current strategies to eliminate hepatitis B and discussed future innovative practices. The issue of combating hepatitis B from more than a public health perspective to including a social justice framework was raised as a new paradigm for confronting hepatitis-B related stigma and discrimination. Throughout the meeting, participants discussed, \"What is the future of community-based hepatitis B screening? How can we complement and better integrate routine screening into health care systems?\" They considered how to educate providers about the new USPSTF hepatitis B screening recommendations, and evaluated the role of patient navigators for linking patients to appropriate medical care. Panel discussions with federal partners - HHS, US Office of Minority Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders - provided opportunities to hear updates about agency programs and their hepatitis B-related priorities. CDC leaders affirmed their commitment to the importance of HBV screening and linkage to care. Dr. Jonathan Mermin , director of the CDC National Center for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STDs and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), emphasized that \"With limited resources, the most important thing we can do is to make sure everyone with hepatitis B is diagnosed. \" Strengthening hepatitis surveillance at the state level and updating perinatal HBV recommendations to include management of infected moms was discussed by Dr. John Ward , director, CDC Division of Viral Hepatitis. In addition, Dr. Cynthia Jorgensen , CDC lead for education and training at the Division of Viral Hepatitis, presented new resources from the Know Hepatitis B campaign, co-branded with Hep B United , during the summit. A special highlight this year was a ceremony to honor four leaders with Hep B United's inaugural Hep B Champion Award s in recognition of their creative strategies to decrease the burden of hepatitis B in their local communities. The awardees were Thaddeus Pham , viral hepatitis prevention coordinator for the Hawaii Department of Health in Honolulu; Dr. Binh Tran , executive director of the Asian Pacific Health Foundation in San Diego, CA; the Dallas-Fort Worth Hepatitis B Project in Dallas, TX, led by medical students and represented by Mike Zhang , and; Nirah Johnson , director of the Hep B NYC Coalition. Overall the Hep B United summit was an exhilarating few days for relationship building, reviewing progress, brainstorming new solutions, and looking forward to increasing the collective impact on shaping community-based programs and improving national policies to successfully eliminate hepatitis B.More than 60 Hep B United coalition members met at its 3rd Annual National Summit.

Bariring \"There is no cure \u2014 you will have it for life.\" I'm a 31-year-old Filipino woman and I lost my job six years ago because of my hepatitis B infection. I will never forget that day. The clinic nurse said, \"You are not fit to work in this company because you are hepatitis B positive.\" I had never had health problems, and at that time I had absolutely no clue about hepatitis B. I had to keep working because my parents were counting on me. I asked her how I could get well. The nurse said: \"There is no cure; you will have it for life.\" I was devastated. I had no control over a situation I could not even understand. I had quit college at age 18 to help support my family. But now not only was I unable to study, I also was no longer employable. Almost all companies ask for a hepatitis B test. Where would I go? No one would hire me. The chance of work was taken away from me, along with the chance to dream. When you are poor, your dreams are simple \u2014 to get a decent job that will support your family's basic needs. I was denied this because I was hepatitis B positive. I tried to live a normal life because I did not want to upset my parents, but deep inside I was fighting the greatest battle of my life. For 13 years I carried that burden. I spent days thinking about nothing else but my disease and fighting the depression. My doctor told me that I should not get married because I would infect my child. So I chose to live my life alone. My doctor never told me about the vaccine! I realized that even if there was a cure, I would not be able to afford it, since I had no job. I cried every night and thought of ending my life. How would I explain my situation to others without being shunned or pitied? Gossip travels fast. I did not have anyone to talk to. These things hurt me. I am very thankful for friends and family who stayed with me despite this disease. They gave me the strength to carry on. I felt so blessed when I met the Yellow Warriors Society of the Philippines [a nonprofit organization for HBV and HCV patients in the Philippines]. Through them I gained a different outlook and was able to move on. I began to have faith in myself and my abilities. I started my own handicrafts business, making bags, slippers, and other products from water hyacinth. I have 50 people working under me, mostly out-of-school youth and women. I am happy that I am able to give them an alternative livelihood. I know what it feels like to have no opportunities. I hope to share my success story with other hepatitis B patients. It took me 13 long years of self-pity and anger to accept this disease that came from an unknown cause and with no known cure. Our government has no systems or programs for hepatitis B carriers like me. We have no access to jobs, information or education about our disease and no access to appropriate doctors and treatment. The system must change, so that no other Filipino will live a wasted life or live in hiding because of the stigma associated with hepatitis B. Now is the time for hope and change.

NONPROFIT ORG U.S. POSTAGE PAID PERMIT NO 38 DOYLESTOWN, PA World Hepatitis Summit Focuses on Elimination Continued from page 2 During the first World Hepatitis summit, leaders from the WHO leaders unveiled a draft global hepatitis plan, the first of its kind, with twin goals to reduce chronic viral hepatitis cases by 90%, and to reduce deaths from viral hepatitis by 65%. These are ambitious but technically possible goals if countries make the commitment and investment! The WHO global hepatitis plan includes the following by 2030: Immunize everyone at risk for hepatitis B, including all newborns Promote safe and sterile injection practices by healthcare providers Treat at least 8 million people living with chronic infections; that is, 5 million with HBV and 3 million with HCV The global hepatitis plan is supported by WHO's Director General Dr. Margaret Chan , who publicly promised to address viral hepatitis at next year's World Health Assembly, which will truly be historic. \"We're ready for a global hepatitis movement, \" said Charles Gore , president of the World Hepatitis Alliance. \"We must shift our energies from promoting just one day of awareness -- World Hepatitis Day -- to creating awareness every day so that we can all live in a world without viral hepatitis. \" With WHO taking a strong leadership position and launching its first global action plan, and more than 200 NGOs and patient advocacy groups around the world dedicated to eliminating viral hepatitis, there is hope that the global pressure will move policy-makers in highly affected countries to make the investment and finally take action to end viral hepatitis. 8 Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Fall 2015 hepb.org 2015 Oct. 4-8, 2015 30th Annual International HBV Meeting Coordinated by Hepatitis B Foundation Dolce Bad Nauheim, Germany HBVMeeting.org Nov. 13-17, 2015 AASLD: The Liver Meeting 2015 San Francisco, CA aasld.org Dec. 6-10, 2015 HepDart 2015 Maui, Hawaii informedhorizons.com/hepdart20152016 Feb. 20-24, 2016 APASL Conference Tokyo, Japan apasl2016.org April 8, 2016 25th Anniversary Crystal Ball Hepatitis B Foundation Warrington, PA hepb.org April 13-17, 2016 EASL: The International Liver Congress Barcelona, Spain ilc-congress.eu May 19, 2016 National Hepatitis Testing Day U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cdc.gov/hepatitis HEPATITIS B FOUNDATION 3805 Old info@hepb.org Find HBF on your favorite social media networks and join the conversation...
