For a complete clean beauty routine, it helps to also use makeup free from harsh chemicals. Check out our guide to the top [clean, non-toxic makeup brands for healthy skin](https://orbasics.com/blogs/stories/best-clean-non-toxic-makeup-brands). How can I tell if a perfume is non toxic? With the variety of perfumes on the market, it's not always easy to distinguish natural perfume from artificial ones. It's best to read the label carefully, but be aware that perfume industry is often not required to list all the ingredients. It's best to research the production and sustainability information before purchasing, and to critically question claims made by companies. The Federal Environment Agency also recommends looking for certain certifications, such as the Cosmos Organic Label for natural and organic cosmetics. Another way to check for harmful ingredients is the [IFRA Label.](https://ifrafragrance.org/policy/labelling-manual) Many labels for natural cosmetics also exclude the use of animal ingredients or animal testing, such as the Veganblume Label, cruelty-free international or PETA. How is regular perfume made and what is it made of? Perfume is made by dissolving aromatic substances in distilled water and alcohol. The alcohol serves to make the fragrance ingredients unfold better. But how much alcohol is in a perfume? Conventional perfume typically consists of at least 80% alcohol and 3-15% perfume oil. Generally, the more perfume oils, the higher quality it is considered to be. What substances in conventional perfume are harmful? Unfortunately, conventional perfume brands often use nature-made fragrances that have been [replicated or altered in the lab, that is synthetic ingredients](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/toxic-perfumes-and-colognes/). For example, a study by Eco Test found that harmful ingredients were present in 23 out of 25 perfumes. Similarly, a database investigation by Codecheck found that [highly potent allergens](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_073.pdf) and toxic chemicals were present as perfume ingredients in about 47% of all women's perfumes and 37% of all men's perfumes on the market. The most common include carcinogenic and [toxic chemicals ](https://alitura.com/blogs/skinsupport/the-top-10-toxic-chemicals-in-perfumes-and-cologne)such as: - synthetic musk - cashmeran - Lilal (Butylphenyl Methylpropional) - Phthalates - Styrene - and other toxic synthetic blends These substances are difficult to degrade and harmful to both nature and the human body. [According to the Federal Environment Agency,](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/health/environmental-impact-on-people/chemical-substances/fragrances) these harmful fragrances can enter the body through our breathing and distribute throughout the body, causing inflammation or allergic reactions. For example, animal testing has shown that Lilal can damage the reproductive system. In some cases, exposure to chemicals in synthetic perfumes has been linked to cancer risks. UV filters such as Benzophenone-3 or Ethylhexyl also pose a risk to health and can negatively impact the hormonal system. What perfume is safe or not harmful? Safe perfumes are usually made from natural fragrance oils and ingredients and contain no harmful chemicals. This includes natural perfumes and organic perfumes made from essential oils, plant absolutes, and resins. Natural perfumes also exclude harmful ingredients such as phthalates and synthetic musk, and they often have certifications such as the Cosmos Organic Label. What are natural non toxic perfume substances and why are organic perfumes and natural perfumes better? So what are the advantages of natural perfumes compared to conventional perfumes? Natural non toxic perfume completely avoids artificial ingredients and preservatives and instead relies on natural fragrance oils and essences, such as extracts from citrus fruits, spices, leaves, flowers, seeds, or resins. Synthetic perfume fragrances generally last longer, but you can apply organic perfume as often as you like, as it is completely free of chemicals. In addition, sustainable scents are becoming better in their fragrance quality and versatility due to the ongoing work of natural perfumers. No specific references were provided in the original text, but there is much research available on the topic of the potential health effects of synthetic fragrance ingredients.
