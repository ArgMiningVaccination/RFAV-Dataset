Could Your Brain Use a Reset? What we're doing with the chiropractic adjustment is resetting incorrect brain patterns that have developed because of stressors to the body. When the body is no longer able to adapt to a certain stressor, it creates an assisted pattern to push that stress to the side. By delivering a chiropractic adjustment, we're helping reset those signals in the brain back toward a normal state. Chiropractic and the Nervous System The purpose of chiropractic care is not the treatment of conditions or disease; rather, it is the restoration of normal body function. As chiropractors at Energy Matters, we work with the nervous system via gentle spinal adjustments. The goal is to reduce stress related interference to the nervous system, thereby enhancing overall body function. All the systems of the body \u2014 circulatory, digestive, eliminatory, hormonal, glandular, immunological, muscular, reproductive, respiratory, and skeletal - depend on the optimal function of the nervous system. Our Techniques [Dr. Caleb](/dr-caleb-caudill/)primarily uses this hands-on manual adjustment method with no drops.
