Let's Start with Eating Breakfast. Eating breakfast is how we nourish ourselves and garner fuel for the day ahead. Too often I see men starting the day with a coffee alone, or high intensity exercise and a coffee, without stopping to enjoy a proper breakfast. Doing this can initially make you feel energised and awake, but really means you are running on adrenal hormones and setting yourself up for an energy dip later in the day. Starting the day in this way can also heightened feelings of anxiety and stress. What to Include More of: Make sure you have protein with breakfast which will help you to feel fuller for longer, whilst also keeping blood sugar levels stable. Ideally, all meals should include a protein source and be well rounded with good quality carbohydrates and healthy fats. Some good examples include are: - Two eggs with sourdough toast and avocado - Smoked salmon on wholegrain bread - High protein yoghurt with fruit free low sugar muesli or nuts and seeds with berries - Smoothie with a scoop of protein powder or a pinch of nuts and seeds or nut butter Feed those Microbiome. There is a direct link between our gut health and our mental state, which you can read more about [here](https://www.selph.com.au/what-is-your-gut-bacteria-really-up-to/). It's incredibly important to feed the gut microbiome by making sure you're getting enough fibre from complex carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are often misunderstood, and can be utilised to promote good health and even weight loss. This is also the first line of therapy for lowering elevated cholesterol levels, which is something I see quite often in male clients. What to Include More of: The recommended daily intake of fibre for men is 30-38g for cardiovascular health, diabetes and cancer prevention. Choose whole grains such as breads with whole grains and seeds, rolled oats instead of quick oats, beans and legumes including black beans, chickpeas, pinto beans, lentils and kidney beans which are rich sources of protein and fibre. Fresh fruit and vegetables are also excellent sources of fibre. If you're not used to eating much fibre be sure to start by increasing a tablespoon per day and build it up from there. Be sure to stay hydrated and drink more water when increasing fibre intake. Superhero Supplements. Zinc is a great baseline nutrient for men's health; it's the second most abundant mineral in the body and is needed for over 300 biological processes. Zinc has a role in testosterone, sex drive, muscle and bone strength, prostate health and sperm quality and is also important for the immune system and a co-factor for many body systems including neurotransmitter production for mood and cognition. There's no need to rush out and supplement with zinc, but it is good to have your diet assessed to see if you are getting enough. Some key sources of zinc include pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, oysters and animal protein. Magnesium is also a key supplement which can aid in soothing muscles, improving mood, assisting in energy production and promoting relaxation and rest. Magnesium is also needed for over 300 biological processes, although the form of magnesium is crucial to its effectiveness and taking one that is well absorbed is very important. Taking magnesium before bed can be a great aid in relaxation and sleep, whilst taking it during the day can help with energy production. Consider if you're experiencing underlying issues. Most of my male clients are coming in to address issues with their quality of sleep, cholesterol levels, diet, digestion and stress. There seems to be a common theme surrounding feelings of burnout and high levels of pressure and stress that have been considered normal. I also hear a lot of men experiencing low motivation which is often a more digestible label for depression and overthinking or trouble sleeping which can reflect symptoms of anxiety. It's important that we recognise these things, begin to release the stigma surrounding them and ensure we are addressing underlying issues in a holistic and practical way.
