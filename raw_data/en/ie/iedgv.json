Since that time I have had a multi-disciplinary clinic here in Madison, Wisconsin since 2000 and work very closely with many of the local allopathic and alternative physicians, hospitals and universities. I also teach across the country to health care professionals and have had courses approved for CEUs and CMEs for nurses, medical doctors and chiropractors. The curriculum at the UNM is very comprehensive and prepares the students quite well for private practice. I would highly recommend the University of Natural Medicine to anyone wishing to pursue the highest standards for natural medicine education.\" "}
