Iran has become the first country in the Middle East to produce Sputnik V. The vaccine produced in Iran will be used in the national vaccination program. To date, Sputnik V has been registered in 67 countries globally with a total population of over 3.5 billion people. The data obtained by regulators of a number of countries during the vaccination of the population, including Argentina, Serbia, Bahrain, Hungary, Mexico and others, demonstrates that Sputnik V is one of the safest and most effective vaccines against coronavirus. Sputnik V is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors and uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, commented: \"RDIF and Actoverco are actively cooperating in the technology transfer process. Local production of the Sputnik V vaccine in Iran will accelerate the vaccination pace without logistics costs. Sputnik V is already playing an important role in protecting the country's population against the coronavirus, and domestic production will support Iran's efforts to combat the pandemic.\" Russian vaccine covid 19 Sputnik V has a number of key advantages: \u00b7 The Sputnik V russian vaccine against coronavirus Gamaleya Center is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors, which cause the common cold and have been around for thousands of years. \u00b7 Sputnik V uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots. \u00b7 The safety, efficacy and lack of negative long-term effects of adenoviral vaccines have been proven by more than 250 clinical studies over two decades. \u00b7 There are no strong allergies caused by Sputnik V. \u00b7 The storage temperature of Sputnik V at +2+8 C means it can be stored in a conventional refrigerator without any need to invest in additional cold-chain infrastructure. \u00b7 The price of Sputnik V is less than $10 per shot, making it affordable around the world. *** Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is Russia's sovereign wealth fund established in 2011 to make equity co-investments, primarily in Russia, alongside reputable international financial and strategic investors.
