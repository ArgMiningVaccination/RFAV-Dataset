Each stone holds a particular energetic vibration based on its unique crystalline structure, which is said to resonate with our individual energetic fields to create shifts in our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual states. While some crystals might manifest uplifting, positive, or motivational energy, others may be more helpful by absorbing negative energies, removing blockages, or helping us to heal the ways in which we limit our own growth. Crystals + Earth Energy Crystals offer us an opportunity to connect with the earth's own energy, which can feel very grounding and stabilizing. The process of selecting, connecting with, and utilizing crystals involves reflection upon the aspects of our lives we would like to change. They assist us in deepening our conscious understanding of what we are looking for to support that change. Many turn to crystal therapy when they are looking for a way to harness more energy, such as boosting focus and clarity of the mind, increasing alertness, upping physical strength and stamina, or revving up passion and creativity, and we have compiled a list of some of our favorite crystals to help you out. How To Use Crystals for Energy Note that crystals may be called upon for more than one thing, so if you feel drawn to one that isn't listed here, trust your instincts and roll with it! Spend time connecting your energy with the crystal, and set a clear, specific intention for each before you put it to use. For example, try holding it in your hand during a short meditation while you visualize how you would like the crystal to support you. Even the act of touching a crystal throughout the day\u2014whether it's in your pocket, on a necklace, or on your desk\u2014offers a helpful moment of mindfulness. Also, remember to [clear your crystals](https://hellonest.co/how-to-charge-crystals/) regularly, and give them a cleanse after you bring them home for the first time. 1.
