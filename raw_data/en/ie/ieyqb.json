A healthier body. A satisfying sex life. Valuing and feeling good about yourself. Having peace of mind. Positive and satisfying relationships. Avoiding sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also known as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Preventing unplanned pregnancies. These are just a few of the important benefits of good sexual health. Being sexually healthy means being able to enjoy a healthier body, a satisfying sexual life, positive relationships, and peace of mind. Being sexually healthy also means enjoying your sexuality and taking care of yourself and your partners throughout your life. Being free to talk about sexual health with your partner and health professional is key to your health. ACTION STEPS TO GOOD SEXUAL HEALTH There are five key steps you can take to help you achieve good sexual health. These steps apply regardless of your age or the relationships you choose to have: Value who you are and decide what's right for you Get smart about your body and protect it Treat your partners well and expect them to treat you well Build positive relationships Make sexual health part of your health care routine Value who you are and decide what's right for you. Sex is a natural part of life. Sex can bring you pleasure, intimacy, and joy. But it is up to you to decide when you want to have sex. First, think about what you want. Then, define your own values, desires, and boundaries. These might change depending on your stage in life. Get smart about your body and protect it. Learn about your body and how it works. Explore ways to express yourself sexually. Practice safer sex to protect yourself and your partners from many STIs and unplanned pregnancies. Condoms can prevent both STIs and unplanned pregnancies, while other contraceptive methods only prevent pregnancy. For extra protection, some people use condoms along with their chosen method of birth control. Treat your partners well and expect them to treat you well. Be with someone who makes you feel good about yourself, comfortable and safe. Partners should respect your boundaries, and should not pressure or force you to do something you don't want to. You should also respect your partner and don't force them to do anything they don't want to. Build positive relationships bhaving open and honest conversations about your relationship, desires, and sexual health. Respect each other and make decisions together. If health problems come up, discuss them openly and seek medical care. Seek help if your partner is violent, abusive, or pressures you or tries to control you. Talk to your health professional or find a program that helps people who are experiencing violence in their relationship. Make sexual health part of your health care routine . This will help protect your sexual health and well-being. Find a health professional who makes you feel comfortable and respects you. You have a right to good medical care. Talk openly with your health professional about how to stay healthy. Share any concerns or problems you may have with your sexual health. At your next visit, ask questions and get the services that are recommended for you. It's time to give sexual health the attention it deserves. To learn more go to www.NCSHguide.orgA GUIDE TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES 3 What are Preventive Sexual Health Services? A NOTE ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY If you are covered by your parent's or partner's health insurance, keep in mind that a list of the health care services you receive might appear on their routine insurance statements. Ask your health care provider if the sexual health care services you are getting will be reported, and make sure you are comfortable with their policy. A range of preventive sexual health services is available to help you stay healthy and detect and treat any problems early. These services are recommended by many leading medical organizations.* Most of these services are now available at no cost under the new health reform law, but check with your insurer to make sure your health plan covers them. Low-cost or free services might also be available at community health centers and family planning clinics. See the Where to Learn More chapter to help you find a provider or nearby clinic. Preventive services include: Screenings that test for sexually transmitted infections or diseases, whether or not you have symptoms Vaccines , such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which decreases your risk of getting the virus that causes genital warts, cervical cancer and some other cancers (anal, oral, and penile) Counseling to help you make healthy decisions. For example, you can learn about the best ways to protect yourself and your partner from getting sexually transmitted infections * The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and other national organizations recommend these services4 TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SEXUAL HEALTHWhat Sexual Health Services do Women Need? The following preventive services are recommended for most women. Your provider will help you decide which ones you need. Even if you don't have symptoms, screenings can detect many sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you do have an STI, the sooner you get treated, the better. Early treatment can often prevent serious problems from developing. Vaccines are also available that can protect you from getting certain STIs. You can receive many of these services during a regular wellness exam or a Well Woman visit. SCREENINGS Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) All sexually active women aged 24 and younger should be screened annually for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Women aged 25 and older who have risk factors for STIs, such as having unprotected sex (sex without a condom), a new partner, or multiple partners, should also be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea. Talk to your provider about being screened for syphilis. You may need to be screened if you have multiple partners, have HIV, have exchanged sex for money or drugs, or been in prison. All pregnant women should be screened for chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B during their first prenatal visit or within the first trimester. Pregnant women aged 24 and younger, as well as older women with risk factors for STIs, should also be screened for gonorrhea. Those who are at continued risk for STIs should be retested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV in their third trimester. HIV Testing You should be tested for HIV at least once as part of your routine health care, even if you think your partner only has sex with you. You should also be tested if you aren't currently having sex, but you have had sex in the past. You should be tested at least once a year if you have unprotected sex, have had an STI or have a partner who has, have multiple partners, share drug injection equipment (including needles or syringes), or have a partner who engages in any of these behaviors. Cervical Cancer Screening Most women aged 21-65 should have a Pap test every three years. You may need to be screened more often if you've had an abnormal result. If so, talk with your provider. The Pap test looks for cells on a woman's cervix that could become cancer. A Pap test alone does not test for STIs, nor does it test for other cancers of the reproductive system. Some women over age 30 can safely go up to five years between cervical cancer screenings. To do so, ask your provider to also test you for HPV (human papillomavirus). The cells collected for the Pap test will also be tested for HPV. If it shows that you don't have HPV and you have a history of normal Pap tests, you can go five years between screenings. Even though you may not need annual screening, you should still see your provider regularly for checkups. For more information, visit www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/ screening.htm A GUIDE TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES 5 WOMEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH WOMEN If you are a woman who has sex with women, you still need many of these preventive services. You can get chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, and other sexually transmitted infections from your female partners. You also need to be tested for HIV, especially if you or your partners had sex with men in the past or still do. The HPV vaccine will help protect you from getting cervical cancer, which is caused by the human papillomavirus. Hepatitis B Screening You should be screened for hepatitis B if you are pregnant, have a partner who has hepatitis B, have multiple partners, have had an STI, share drug injection equipment (including needles or syringes), or live with a person who is infected with the hepatitis B virus. You should also be screened if you were born in a country where hepatitis B infection is common (Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, parts of South America) or were born in the United States to parents from one of those countries. Hepatitis B is a virus that attacks the liver. It is spread through infected body fluids, including blood and semen. Infection can either be acute (short-term) or chronic (long- term). People with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick, but can still infect others. Chronic hepatitis B infection can often be treated, but not cured. To learn more, visit www.cdc.gov/ hepatitis/hbv/index.htm . Hepatitis C Screening All women born between 1945 and 1965 should be screened once for hepatitis C. Many \"baby boomers\" have hepatitis C and don't know it. They may have engaged in risky behaviors or received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before national screening for the virus was in place. Most people become infected with hepatitis C by sharing drug injection equipment. If you inject illegal drugs, you should be screened periodically for hepatitis C. You should also be screened if you've been in prison, have HIV, or have ever injected illegal drugs. The risk of getting hepatitis C from having unprotected sex is low, but it is possible. You are at higher risk if you have HIV or another STI, have multiple partners, or engage in rough sex. Hepatitis C is a virus that attacks the liver. It can cause severe illness and permanent liver damage. However, it can often be cured, especially if the infection is detected early. To learn more, visit www.cdc.gov/ hepatitis/hcv/index.htm . Intimate Partner Violence If your partner is sexually, verbally, or physically abusing you, or forcing you to do things against your will (such as get pregnant, not use birth control, or engage in unsafe sex), speak up and let your provider know. They can refer you to a program or mental health professional who can help you. 6 TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SEXUAL HEALTHVACCINES Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine This series of three shots is recommended for girls aged 11-12 before they've been exposed to HPV, but may be given up to age 26. Some women over age 26 may also benefit from being vaccinated. Talk to your provider to see if you're eligible. HPV is extremely common. Although most infections go away on their own, some types of HPV cause cancer (mainly cervical, but also anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oral) and other types cause genital warts. Two different vaccines (Cervarix and Gardasil) are available that can protect girls and women from the types of HPV that cause cancer. However, only Gardasil protects against both cancer and genital warts. For more information, visit www. cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/public/index.html . Hepatitis B Vaccine This three-shot series is recommended for all unvaccinated teens. Teens who have started, but not finished, the series should get the remaining doses in order to be fully protected against the hepatitis B virus. Unvaccinated women should get this vaccine series if they have multiple partners, a partner who has hepatitis B, have been diagnosed with HIV or another STI, have unprotected sex with a partner whose health status they don't know, share drug injection equipment (including needles or syringes), or have a partner who injects drugs. If you were born in a country where hepatitis B is common (Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, parts of South America) or were born in the United States to parents from one of those countries, talk to your provider about being vaccinated. You may be given the first dose and tested for the virus at the same time. Hepatitis B is a virus that attacks the liver. It is spread through infected body fluids, including blood and semen. Infection can either be acute (short-term) or chronic (long- term). People with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick, but can still infect others. Vaccination is the best protection against hepatitis B. Not sure if you've been vaccinated? If you were born in the United States in 1991 or later, you were most likely vaccinated as an infant. Before 1991, the vaccine was only given to high-risk adults. Hepatitis A Vaccine This two-shot series is recommended for all unvaccinated teens. Teens who are missing the last dose should complete the series in order to be fully protected against hepatitis A. Women should get this vaccine series if their partner or someone they live with has hepatitis A, or if they use illicit drugs. The hepatitis A virus attacks the liver. There is no treatment for hepatitis A. While most people recover without permanent liver damage, they will probably feel very sick for a while. Not sure if you've been vaccinated? Routine vaccination began in 1999 so older teens and most adults have not been vaccinated. For more information, visit www. cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/aFAQ.htm . How Do I Know if I'm at Risk? Your sexual health is at risk if you answer \"yes\" to any of the following questions:: Have you had unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex (sex without a condom)? Do you have multiple partners? Do you have an STI, including HIV? Have you shared injection drug equipment, including needles or syringes? Do you exchange sex for drugs or money? Do you have a partner who answers \"yes\" to any of these questions or whose health status you don't know?A GUIDE TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES 7 IT'S YOUR BODY! You know your body better than anyone. Always tell your health care provider about any changes in your health. Speak to them about any concerns you may have about conditions, diseases, or issues related to sexual functioning or performance.COUNSELING Contraception Talk with your provider about your plans for having, or not having, children. He or she can then provide information on the best contraceptive methods for you. Long-acting reversible contraceptives - the intrauterine device (IUD) and the implant - are among the easiest and most reliable methods for all women who want to prevent pregnancy. Other available methods include injections, birth control pills, the vaginal ring, the patch, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap, and male and female condoms. Condoms are the only contraceptive method that prevent both pregnancy and STIs. If you're done having children or know you don't want any, permanent contraception (e.g., tubal ligation) may be right for you. Natural family planning methods and abstinence (not having sex) are other options. Your provider can also tell you about emergency contraception (EC), or the \"morning after pill.\" EC can prevent pregnancy if taken within a few days of having unprotected sex. EC is available to anyone without a prescription at family planning clinics and pharmacies. STI Prevention Using a male or female condom every time you have sex is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of getting many STIs, including HIV. Other effective ways to protect yourself include abstinence (not having sex) or only having one partner who you know does not have an STI. If you have sex without a condom, have an STI or recently had one, or have a new partner and are unsure of their health status, talk to your provider or a health educator. They can counsel you on ways to protect yourself and your partner from STIs, including whether medicines to prevent HIV infection are right for you. People who do not have HIV but are at high risk of becoming infected can stay healthy by taking PrEP (pre- exposure prophylaxis). PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) might be prescribed if you think you've been exposed to HIV. Also, consult the resources at the end of this guide for more information about preventing STIs.8 TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SEXUAL HEALTHRECOMMENDED PREVENTIVE SEXUAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN Sexual Health Service Adolescent (13-18 years) Adult (19+) Cervical cancer screening Not recommendedThose aged 21-29 every 3 years Those aged 30-65 every 3-5 years Not recommended for those aged 66+ Chlamydia screeningThose who are sexually active (screen annually) or pregnantThose aged 24 and under (screen annually) Those over age 24 who are at risk Those who are pregnant Contraceptive counseling Those who are sexually activeThose who are sexually active and/or of childbearing age Counseling to prevent sexually transmitted infections Those who are sexually active Those who are at risk Gonorrhea screening Those who are sexually active or pregnantThose aged 24 and under (screen annually), including those who are pregnant Those over age 24 who are at risk, including those who are pregnant Hepatitis A vaccine Those not vaccinated as children Those who are at risk and are unvaccinated Hepatitis B vaccine Those not vaccinated as childrenThose who are at risk and are unvaccinated Those born in a country where the hepatitis B virus is common Hepatitis B screeningThose who are pregnant Those who are at risk and are unvaccinated Those born in a country where the hepatitis B virus is common Those who are pregnant Those who are at risk and are unvaccinated Those born in a country where the hepatitis B virus is common Hepatitis C screening Not recommended Those born between 1945 and 1965 Injection drug users HIV testingThose who are or have been sexually active (test at least once) Those who are pregnantThose who are or have been sexually active (test at least once) Those who are at risk (test at least annually) Those who are pregnant HPV vaccine Those not vaccinated at age 11 or 12 May be given through age 26 (and to eligible adults over age 26) Syphilis screening Those who are pregnant or at risk Those who are pregnant or at risk You're at risk if you have had unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex (sex without a condom), have multiple partners, have an STI (including HIV), share injection drug equipment (including needles or syringes), exchange sex for drugs or money, or have a partner who answers \"yes\" to any of these questions or whose health status you don't know.A GUIDE TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES 9What Sexual Health Services do Men Need? The following preventive services are recommended for most men. Your provider will help you decide which ones you need. Even if you don't have symptoms, screenings can detect many sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you do have an STI, the sooner you get treated, the better. Early treatment can often prevent serious problems from developing. Vaccines are also available that can protect you from getting certain STIs. SCREENINGS Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Men who have sex only with women: You might consider being screened for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis if you have unprotected sex, have multiple partners, or have a new partner and do not know her health status, even if you do not have any symptoms. Men who have sex with men: If you are sexually active, you should be screened at least once a year for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Men who have sex with men often have chlamydia and gonorrhea infections in their rectums and throats but don't know it. Depending on the kinds of sex you have, you may need additional screening to find these infections. You should be screened every 3-6 months if you have unprotected sex, have had an STI or have a partner who has, have multiple partners, use illicit drugs, or have a partner who engages in any of these behaviors. HIV Testing Men who have sex only with women: You should be tested for HIV at least once as part of your routine health care, even if you think your partner only has sex with you.

You should be tested every 3-6 months if you have unprotected sex, have multiple partners, use illicit drugs, share drug injection equipment (including needles or syringes), or have a partner who engages in any of these behaviors. Hepatitis B Screening Regular screening for hepatitis B is recommended for men who have sex with men and those who share drug injection equipment (including needles or syringes), especially if they have not been vaccinated. If you have a partner or family member who has hepatitis B, have multiple partners, or have had an STI, you should be screened as well. Others who should be screened include those who were born in a country where hepatitis B infection is common (Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, parts of South America) or were born in the United States to parents from one of those countries. Hepatitis B is a virus that attacks the liver. It is spread through infected body fluids, including blood and semen. Infection can either be acute (short-term) or chronic (long- term). People with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick, but can still infect others. Chronic hepatitis B infection can often be treated, but not cured.

Intimate Partner Violence If your partner frequently threatens you, constantly accuses you of doing something you didn't, tries to control what you do or where you go, refuses to have safe sex, or hits, slaps or kicks you, talk to a health professional. Although your provider will probably not ask you about abuse in your relationships, if you let them know they can refer you to programs that can help you. VACCINES Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine This series of three shots is recommended for boys aged 11 or 12, before they have been exposed to HPV. If not vaccinated as a teen, all males through age 21 should get the HPV vaccine. All men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune systems (including HIV) should be vaccinated and can do so up to age 26. If you are between the ages of 22 and 26, talk to your provider about being vaccinated. Gardasil (the HPV vaccine for boys and young men) protects against the most common types of HPV that cause genital warts and some cancers of the anus and throat. For more information, visit www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/ public/index.html . Hepatitis B Vaccine This three-shot series is recommended for all unvaccinated teens.

Always tell your health care provider about any changes in your health. Speak to them about any concerns you may have about conditions, diseases, or issues related to sexual functioning or performance.COUNSELING Contraception If you and your partner want to avoid pregnancy, learn about birth control methods both of you can use. The most effective options for men are using condoms correctly and consistently, abstinence (not having sex), and vasectomy (permanent contraception). Your female partner has many more options to choose from. By learning about her preferred method, you can support her choice. Also learn about emergency contraception (EC), or the \"morning after pill,\" that she can use to prevent pregnancy if you had unprotected sex. EC can prevent pregnancy if taken within a few days of having unprotected sex. It is available to anyone without a prescription at family planning clinics and pharmacies. STI Prevention Using a male or female condom every time you have sex is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of getting many STIs, including HIV.

How do I bring up the topic? Talking about your sexual health might make you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. However, if you talk openly and honestly with your provider about your body and concerns, he or she can give you better care and advice. You have the right to get full and accurate information about sexual health. And, remember, it is your provider's job to help you take care of your whole body. Ways you could start the conversation are: \"I just saw an article about high rates of sexually transmitted infections. What can I do to protect myself?\" \"I know I'm here to get a check-up, but can we talk about my sexual health for a few minutes? I have some questions.\" \"I'm in a new relationship, and I'm not sure about the best ways to protect myself from infections and getting pregnant.\"What kinds of questions should I ask? The questions you might ask can cover a range of topics, including: the best forms of contraception, STI screening and treatment, preventing STIs, protecting your fertility, and issues related to sexual functioning or performance. Sample questions you might ask during your visit: Screening and Testing What tests are you giving me? How are they done? When and how will I get my results? Sexually Transmitted Infections Based on my history, should I be tested for STIs, including HIV? Which ones? How often should I be tested for STIs? Should my partner get tested, too? Are there any vaccines I should get to protect myself from STIs? How can I protect myself from getting STIs? If I have an STI, can it be treated? Contraceptives What are the most effective forms of birth control? What are the best options for me? What are the side effects of different contraceptives? How and where can I get affordable contraceptives?IF YOU ARE TRANSGENDER Many of the preventive services in this guide will help you stay healthy. Although finding a provider who can address your unique healthcare needs may be challenging, it is important to get tested regularly for HIV and other STIs, and vaccinated against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and HPV (if you're eligible). Use condoms and practice safer sex to protect you and your partners. For more in-depth guidance, see the resources listed at the end of this guide. A GUIDE TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES 15Partner Issues I want my partner and I to get tested for STIs before we have sex for the first time. How should I bring up the topic? How do I tell my partner if I test positive for an STI? What if my partner doesn't want to use a condom? I'm married and I assume my spouse is only having sex with me.

Your provider might ask you questions that seem personal, but don't take it personally. They generally ask all of their patients the same questions. Answering these questions will give your health care provider information to help keep you healthy and safe. Health care professionals might ask you the following questions about your sexual history and current behaviors: Are you sexually active? If no, have you ever been? Do you have sex with men only, women only, or both? Do you have anal, oral and/or vaginal sex? How many people have you ever had sex with? In the past six months? In the past 12 months? What are you doing to protect yourself from STIs? Have you been tested for STIs, including HIV? Would you like to be tested? Have you or your partner ever tested positive for an STI? If so, which one(s), and where was the infection found? Were you and/or your partner treated? Are you or your partner trying to get pregnant? Are you concerned about getting pregnant or getting your partner pregnant? Are you or your partner using contraception? Do you need any information about types of contraceptives? Are you happy with your sex life? Do you have any concerns or questions about your sexual functioning ? Have you ever been coerced or pressured to have sex or do something you didn't want to do? Do you or your partner use alcohol or illicit drugs when you have sex? 16 TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SEXUAL HEALTH What to Look For in a Sexual Health Care Provider TAKE CHARGE You can do many things to take charge of your sexual health.

Schedule an appointment and get the services and advice you need to take care of your entire body, and to help you enjoy good sexual health for a lifetime.Remember, a health care provider who takes good care of your sexual health should: Have a friendly and welcoming staff Speak clearly and use words you understand Put you at ease and listen to any sexual and reproductive health issues that are important to you Answer your questions and address your concerns in a helpful, respectful way Ask permission before performing any tests Explain what they're doing and the reason why Keep your conversations confidential Support your right to make decisions about your sexual health care, based on your own values and what you believe is best for yourself A health care provider should NOT : Assume to know your sexual behaviors or preferences without asking Be judgmental in response to your questions or concerns Be disrespectful of your sexual orientation or preferences Deny you care or treatment because of your sexual choices If you feel uncomfortable with your health care provider for any reason, listen to your feelings.
