The U.S government is working with state and local partners to carry out a [national strategy](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html) to vaccinate and protect people at risk for mpox (formerly monkeypox). This operational planning guide is provided to aid state, tribal, local and territorial, health officials in their planning and response efforts. Please note that new information has been added throughout the document and updates have been made for clarity and consistency. Revisions include updates to future JYNNEOS availability via a threshold approach including requests for supplemental product above a threshold, reporting requirements, virus and disease nomenclature, and where relevant any anticipated changes due to the Public Health Emergency (PHE) expiration. On June 28, 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced an enhanced nationwide vaccination strategy to mitigate the spread of mpox. The strategy describes vaccination for people who are at risk for mpox infection, and prioritization of vaccines for areas with higher numbers of cases. Under the strategy, agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have collaborated to rapidly expand access to hundreds of thousands of doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for prophylactic use against mpox. These efforts allow HHS to distribute vaccines more quickly and equitably to jurisdictions across the country. HHS declared mpox a PHE on August 4, 2022. The PHE declaration brought expanded authorities that facilitated a more robust HHS response to the spreading mpox outbreak. Although the PHE expired on January 31, 2023, HHS remains committed to making JYNNEOS vaccine available to people in the U.S. who may be exposed or at risk for exposure to mpox in order to prevent or minimize a resurgence in domestic mpox cases.
