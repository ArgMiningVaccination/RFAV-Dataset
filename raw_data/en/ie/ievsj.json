Hands-on healing, color, light and sound, vibrational/homeopathic remedies, nutritional guidance greatly speed healing for you. Full Spectrum Energy Medicine is grounded in the holistic perspective: we are body, mind and spirit. Healing cannot occur unless we address all three aspects, clearing energetic blockages, negative beliefs, and restoring harmony to our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual being. Once rebalancing occurs, personal and spiritual growth can resume. I believe that each person is unique and deserves individualized care. Protocols are less important than identifying the modalities which optimally benefit each person. Brennan Healing Science, Informational Medicine, CranioSacral, Lymph Drainage, Anti-Aging, EFT, Color, Light, and Sound Therapy open the invisible subtle energy pathways to healing.
