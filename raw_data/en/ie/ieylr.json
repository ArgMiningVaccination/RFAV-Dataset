Contrary to typical medications that are effective only as long as the chemicals remain in the body, vaccines help stimulate your body to develop long term resistance to these microbes and are available only for certain diseases. Vaccines are usually administered by injection, although there are some vaccines given through other routes. Some vaccines require just one dose, while others may require multiple doses given at specific time intervals to build up an effective level of protection. After the vaccine is administered, your body begins to make antibodies and memory cells against the weakened or killed microbes contained in the vaccine. These antibodies and memory cells stay active in the body for many years and help to recognize and fight the actual disease should you ever become exposed. There are slight risks in receiving vaccines, but these are generally considered very low when compared to the amount of protection that is provided. If you are ill, pregnant, or have a compromised immune system, please consult your doctor as certain vaccines may cause complications. Shanghai East International Medical Center offers vaccine services. During your consultation, our medical staff can also answer your questions and concerns about vaccinations. To make an appointment, please call us during regular working hours at (86 21) 5879-9999. Vaccines for Children & Teenagers Most countries develop their own national vaccination schedule for children and teenagers which indicates what vaccines are recommended and when they should be given. The timing and types of vaccines chosen will depend on what infectious diseases are present in a particular country or what a particular country wants to prevent. These vaccinations are often mandatory and are a prerequisite for school admission. Parents will also need to consider relevant foreign vaccination schedules for any children living or studying abroad. Links to vaccination schedules for selected countries are provided below. If the schedule you need is not listed, you should search online at your home country's public health authority or disease prevention center.

These factors can include lack of prior vaccination, age, environment, overall health condition, occupation, lifestyle, and work or travel outside your home country. For those who are relocating long-term, it is advisable to find out what vaccinations are typically given in your new country of residence, and to speak with your doctor about whether these are appropriate for you.
