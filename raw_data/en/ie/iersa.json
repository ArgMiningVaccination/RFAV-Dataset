The thought is scary, especially after the recent Coronavirus pandemic, but with the right precautions, we can be knowledgeable and stay safe in the event that these currently rare diseases become more widespread. In this article, we'll break down one of the diseases that is appearing more and more in the news due to an increase in cases, though outside of the United States, in 2023: The Marburg Virus Disease. What is the Marburg Virus Disease? The Marburg Virus Disease, commonly referred to as simply \"Marburg\", is an infectious and quick-spreading disease that causes hemorrhagic fever. A hemorrhagic fever is a type of fever that interferes with the blood's ability to clot. The Marburg Virus Disease is rare, with only 474 confirmed cases through 2022, according to the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/outbreaks/chronology.html) (CDC), since the disease was first discovered in 1967. However, it is extremely contagious and very serious, with an 88% fatality ratio according to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/marburg-virus-disease#tab=tab_1) (WHO) and a 23-90% fatality ratio according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/symptoms/index.html). WHO states that the disease is spread through direct contact with blood, secretions, or other bodily fluid, such as through broken skin or mucous membranes. Symptoms of the Marburg Virus Disease According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/marburg-virus-disease#tab=tab_2), symptoms of the Marburg Virus commonly include: - Abrupt Fever - Severe Headache - Extreme Malaise and Lethargy - Muscle Aches - Cramping - Nausea and Vomiting - \"Ghost-Like\" Features and Deep Set Eyes - Non-Itchy Rash - Bleeding, Often From Multiple Areas - Confusion - Irritability - Aggression - Severe Blood Loss - Death As the [CDC states](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/symptoms/index.html), an important note is the lengthy incubation period, which means that you can have the virus for 2-21 days before it becomes onset and begins showing symptoms. Medical Treatment for the Marburg Virus Part of the danger of the Marburg Virus is that there are no proven medical treatments, according to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/marburg-virus-disease#tab=tab_3). There is a range of potential treatments that are being experimented with on non-human primates, but none that have ever been tried on humans, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/treatment/index.html). Triple-A Detox: Natural Remedy for Prevention of the Marburg Virus While instances are rare, the [ American Society for Microbiology](https://asm.org/Articles/2023/March/Marburg-Virus-Disease-Emergence-An-Update) calls for a spotlight to be put on the issue and for preparation to be taken for potential pandemics. With this call and the lack of licensed treatments, it is important to consider how one can take steps with their natural health to prevent contracting the virus. To help keep yourself safe, it is good to rid yourself of toxins that make your body more susceptible to viruses and the mutations of viruses. The expert staff at Herbs Etc has put together the Triple-A Detox, which is a three-month protocol meant to be repeated a number of times, depending on your exposure to toxins, environmental history, and mineralization quality. The three steps target Aluminum, Antimony, and Arsenicum. Throughout the three steps of this program, there is an additional toxin that will be repeatedly targeted called glyphosate. This is a particularly difficult toxin to avoid, since it's present in drinking water, in food, and in the air you breathe, which is why it calls for such consistent attention throughout the detox. Month 1: Aluminum Detox Aluminum can enter your body through a number of sources, including many brands of deodorant, baking products, and some water sources. The following list of minerals and remedies works to separate aluminum from the brain tissue, nerve tissue, cells, and general biology before being removed along with all other unwanted metals. The daily protocol will include: - Iodine - Selenomethionine - Super Natural Boron - Vitamin D3 - Vitamin C - Probiotic Eleven - Fulvic/Humic Minerals liquid - Good fats/omegas (NSP Barlean's Fish or Flax oil) - Silica liquid - Heavy Metal - Homeopathic Aluminum antidote Month 2: Antimony Detox Antimony is found in a number of sources, including rubber, textiles, paints, batteries, and more, but the biggest source is plastic. That means plastic containers for food and drinks. This element is a factor in hormone disruption, weight imbalances, blood sugar problems, cancers, and other chronic diseases. The importance here is that concentrations of antimony in the body can lead to the body becoming more susceptible to viruses. The daily protocol will include: - Iodine - Selenomethionine - Super Natural Boron - Vitamin D3 - Vitamin C - Probiotic Eleven - Fulvic/Humic Minerals liquid - Good fats/omegas (NSP or Barlean's Fish or Flax oil) Homeopathic Antimony antidote Month 3: Arsenic Detox You may have heard of arsenic being incredibly toxic. Despite that, it appears in our drinking water, as well as in cosmetics, cigarettes, and in the air, as a direct result of industrial air pollution. The amount of arsenic found in each of these sources is considered to be \"acceptable\", but, like all other heavy metals, it accumulates over time in the body. This means that small amounts of unavoidable arsenic add up over a long period of time. The daily protocol will include: - Iodine - Selenomethionine - Super Natural Boron - Vitamin D3 - Vitamin C - Probiotic Eleven - Fulvic/Humic Minerals liquid - Good fats/omegas (NSP or Barlean's Fish or Flax oil) - Kidney Drainage liquid - Urinary Maintenance Arsenic colloquially known as Roundup, is an herbicide that is commonly used on the food we eat. While eating organically as much as possible can help reduce exposure, its wide usage has made it impossible to truly avoid. The daily protocol will include: - Iodine - Selenomethionine - Super Natural Boron - Vitamin D3 - Vitamin C - Fulvic/Humic Minerals liquid - Good fats/omegas (NSP or Barlean's Fish or Flax oil) - Liquid ION Gut Health - Homeopathic Glyphosate/RoundUp antidote Vitamins and Minerals to Focus On In order to ensure that you are getting the right nutrients to achieve holistic natural health that prevents illnesses, like the Marburg Virus Disease, focus on ensuring that you get the right amount of these vitamins and minerals: - Vitamin C: In a study by [The National Institutes of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3783921/), it was found that Vitamin C is effective in protecting immune cells and protecting tissue integrity. Vitamin C strengthens the immune system, especially in cell-mediated response, which is a type of immunity that does not involve antibodies. - Vitamin D3: While this vitamin is known for helping bones and muscles, a study by [Harvard Medical School](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/02/study-confirms-vitamin-d-protects-against-cold-and-flu/)found that Vitamin D also helps prevent respiratory illnesses, such as colds and cases of flu. - Zinc: [The National Institutes of Health](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/)reports Zinc as being crucial to fighting off bacteria and viruses, making this a critical nutrient for your immune system. As with any virus, the key is to focus on your holistic natural health, keeping every aspect of your body working at peak efficiency to minimize the potential of contracting any diseases. These three vitamins and minerals are some of the most important for shielding off potential viruses.
