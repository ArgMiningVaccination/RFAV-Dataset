Bretous, MD, MPH Medical Epidemiologist Enhanced Avian Influenza A Surveillance The CDC and SC DHEC continue to encourage 'enhanced'surveillance for patients with influenza like illnesses (ILI)who are at increased risk for avian influenza A. Riskpatients include those with recent travel history, within 10days of respiratory symptom onset, to an H5N1 affectedcountry. The medical community needs to maintainvigilance in the clinical setting and consider the followingactions: 1) Consistently obtain international travel history and other exposure risk information for persons with thefollowing symptoms and circumstances: -Fever of >38C -One of more of the following: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath -History of contact with poultry, suspected or known human case in an H5N1 affectedcountry. 2) Obtain rapid diagnostic laboratory tests for patients who are at risk for avian influenza 3) Rapidly implement infection control measures, as listed on the CDC website. 4) Immediately report the suspected case to the local health department for consultation and assistancein obtaining the appropriate testing. Please note thatall suspected cases of human avian influenza mustbe reported to the local health department, whichthen consults with CDC. Current Status of Confirmed Human Avian Influenza A Cases Reported to the WHO According to the WHO (World Health Organization), as of September 19, 2005, the cumulative number of confirmedhuman cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) are: 91 in VietNam, 17 in Thailand, four in Cambodia and two in Indonesia.Immunization Update Jesse E. Greene, MSN, RN, Director DHEC Immunization Division Influenza Vaccines News of FDA's licensing of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK)influenza vaccine and the company's announcement tosell about 8 million doses in the U.S. this season, coupledwith Sanofi pasteur's 50 to 60 million doses andMedImmune's 3 million doses of FluMist , has produced a brighter outlook for the nationalInfluenza vaccine supply for the2005-06 season. If Chiron securesFDA approval, company officialsindicate they plan to produce 1826 million doses for use in the U.S. (Continued on page 2 )MedImmune still has quantities of its FluMist available for pre- booking and Sanofi Pasteurcontinues to pre-book orders for itspediatric influenza vaccine in syringes.

The entire document may befound on the following website: www .cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5408a1.htm Persons at increased risk for influenzacomplications are again the focus of this year'sinfluenza vaccination strategy. Influenza vaccineis being distributed to providers' offices. Pleasenote that the live attenuated influenza vaccine(LAIV) FluMist cannot be stored in a dorm-stylerefrigerator. On September 2, 2005, CDC announced, \"Given the uncertainties in doses and distribution, CDCrecommends that the following priority groupsreceive inactivated influenza vaccine until October24, 2005. Beginning October 24, 2005, all personswill be eligible for vaccination\". This documentmay be found on the following website: http://www .cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ mm5434a4.htm Persons aged 65 and older, with and without chronic health conditionsResidents of long-term care facilities Persons aged 2-64 years with chronic health conditionsChildren aged 6-23 months Pregnant women Health-care personnel who provide direct patient careHousehold contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children aged <6 months It should be noted that vaccination with the live, nasal-spray flu vaccine (FluMist) is always an option for healthypersons aged 5-49 years who are not pregnant. Thisvaccine is not subject to prioritization and can be given tohealthy 5-49 year olds at any time. Meningococcal Vaccines In 2005, a tetravalent Inc.,was licensed for use among persons aged 11 - 55 years.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)published revised recommendations of the AdvisoryCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regardingthe Prevention and Control of Meningococcal Disease http:// www .cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5407.pdf on May 27, 2005. Due to rapid increase in demand for this vaccine, themanufacturer has introduced order limits in both the publicand private sectors. As a result, CDC placed caps onmonthly MCV4 allocations to states. These allocationswill be relaxed as the manufacturer increases productionof MCV4. Therefore, during initial implementation of thisnew vaccine, vaccine providers are reminded that therecommendations for the routine vaccination ofadolescents with MCV4 prioritize: 1. Adolescents at the 11- to 12-year health-care visit, and2. Adolescents prior to high school entry (approximately aged 15 years), if they have not previously received MCV4. Routine vaccination is also recommended for certainpersons who have increased risk for meningococcaldisease. Use of MCV4 is preferred among persons aged11 - 55 years; however, use of tetravalent polysaccharidevaccine (MPSV4) is recommended among children aged2 - 10 years and persons aged >55 years. If MCV4 isunavailable, MPSV4 is an acceptable alternative forpersons 11 - 55 years. The following persons are at increased risk for meningococcal disease: College freshmen living in dormitories Microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis Military recruits Persons who travel to or reside in countries in which N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged Persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies Persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia Due to both federal and state funding deficits, DHECimplemented meningococcal vaccines through the S.C.Vaccine Assurance For All Children (VAFAC) Immunization Partnership as VFC-only. This means that VAFAC providersmay order meningococcal vaccines for those children andadolescents under age 19 years, for whom the vaccine isrecommended by ACIP and prioritized in the descriptionsabove, and who are either Medicaid enrolled, Uninsured(no insurance), American Indian or Alaskan Native.Additionally, the Under-insured (insurance plan does NOTcover the vaccine) are VFC-eligible if vaccinated inFederally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) or Rural HealthClinics (RHC). For additional information contact the DHEC Immunization Division at 1-800-277-4687. Antiviral Drugs for Prophylaxis and Treatment of Influenza Shirley Jankelovich, MD, Medical Epidemiologist At this time, there are no significant changes in CDCrecommendations for the use of anitvirals for prophylaxisand treatment of influenza. The latest guidance ispublished in the MMWR \"Prevention and Control ofInfluenza\", July 29, 2005, Vol 54, RR-8.

Belflower, MSPH Surveillance and Quality Assurance Epidemiologist Prior to the year 2000, 60,000 cases of invasive S. pneumoniae were reported in the U.S. each year with 40% of these infections being non-susceptible (intermediatesusceptibility or resistant) to at least one antibiotic. By2002, the number of annual cases of S. pneumoniae decreased to 37,000 reported cases due to the introductionof the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children.However, 34% of these infections were still non-susceptible to at least one antibiotic and 17% wereresistant to three or more antibiotics. Data from the CDCActive Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) Report for 2003shows national resistance percentages for variousantibiotics to invasive S. pneumoniae as follows : 17.3% of cases were resistant to erythromycin 17.0% to cefotaxime 0.3% to levofloxacin (CDC) The current 2005 South Carolina List of Reportable Conditions identifies Invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae as reportable within 7 days to SC DHEC. Reporting ofantibiotic resistance patterns is also requested for allcases. Currently, analysis of reportable disease data fromour Carolinas Health Electronic Surveillance System(CHESS) shows that only 33% of S. pneumoniae reports in SC include antibiotic resistance information. Fornational surveillance and monitoring purposes, it isThere have been a total of 59 confirmed deaths reported to the WHO. It is likely that influenza A (H5N1) infection among birds has become endemic to the Asian region and that humaninfections will continue to occur. So far, no sustainedhuman-to-human transmission of the influenza A (H5N1)virus has been identified, and no influenza A (H5N1)viruses containing both human and avian influenza virusgenes, indicative of gene reassortment, have beendetected. Influenza Culture Laboratory Surveillance Influenza laboratory surveillance will be the same as lastyear. The DHEC Bureau of Laboratories will continue toprovide influenza culture testing kits to providers andlaboratories already enrolled in the laboratory surveillancenetwork. If you would like to participate in the influenzaculture laboratory surveillance network, please contact Dr.Jennifer Meredith in the DHEC Bureau of Laboratories at803-896-0870. Positive Rapid Influenza Test Surveillance SC influenza rapid test reporting requirements are thesame this year as they were last year. Positive rapidantigen test results may be reported by summary numbersof positive rapid test results and type of influenza (A, B or A/B) that the test detects. No specific patient information isneeded. The health care provider may still use the DHECDisease Reporting Cards to report summary numbers ofpositive rapid tests OR a weekly summary worksheet provided by your local health department. These weekly summary sheets may be faxed or emailed at the end ofevery week to your local health department. Please note,reporting positive rapid antigen tests by summary numberdoes not replace the mandatory reporting of positiveinfluenza viral cultures by name with other personallyidentified information on the Disease Reporting Card toDHEC. Last year there was some confusion aboutreporting positive cultures to DHEC if the specimen wasprocessed at the DHEC Bureau of Laboratories. Pleasecontinue to report positive influenza culture tests to yourlocal health department via the DHEC Disease ReportingCards or phone, even if the specimen was processed at aDHEC lab. The DHEC Bureau of Laboratories does notreport positive culture specimens to local healthdepartments. For positive rapid antigen summaryworksheets, please contact your local health department. Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Sentinel Surveillance ILI Sentinel Provider Surveillance is a surveillance networkcomprised of volunteer providers from internal medicine,family practice, emergency medicine, OB/GYN, anduniversity health center practices. Enrolled providersreceive work folder packets and submit weekly reports toCDC via Internet or fax. Submitted reports consist ofnumbers of ILI patients seen out of the total number ofpatients seen in a week. ILI cases are only counted in theabsence of other known causes of illness. No influenzaculture is required for reporting ILI cases. Enrolledproviders receive complimentary subscriptions to theMMRW weekly and the Emerging Infectious DiseasesJournal. To enroll in the ILI Sentinel Provider network, contact your local health department and please specify'ILI' surveillance. Pediatric Influenza-related deaths surveillance Beginning in 2005, pediatric influenza-related deaths ofchildren up to 17 years of age was made a nationallynotifiable disease and mandated as reportable to SCDHEC. Physicians are to report such deaths to their localhealth department. Information required will includeprevious medical history, clinical history, laboratoryinfluenza testing results (both positive and negative), siteof medical care (inpatient or outpatient), and history ofcurrent influenza vaccine status.

The companion article presents and explains a change in DHEC's policyregarding tuberculin testing for persons at low risk for TB.TB is not spread uniformly throughout the state. In 2004eight counties reported more than 10 cases (York,Charleston, Richland, Florence, Horry, Berkeley, Greenvilleand Beaufort) while 7 counties did not report a single case(Abbeville, Barnwell, Fairfield, McCormick, Pickens,Saluda, and Union.) More detailed information regardingTB cases and case rates by county are available at theDHEC web site (4). Similarly, in 2004 TB was morecommon in men than in women (157 vs. 76 cases), inblacks than in whites (141 vs.73 cases [+ 19 cases inAsians]) and in adults than in children under age 18 (215vs. 18 cases). The relative rarity of TB in children (figure 2)indicates that TB is generally well controlled in SouthCarolina and that most cases currently diagnosed are theresult of transmission that occurred years or even decadesago. TB in the Foreign Born: In South Carolina in 2004, TB was diagnosed in 59 persons (25% of total cases) who wereborn in other countries. The most common countries oforigin for these were Mexico (22 cases), the Philippines(10 cases), and Honduras (8 cases). As TB continues todecrease in the native-born population, it is likely that TBin the foreign-born will progressively account for an evergreater proportion of cases diagnosed in the state. Thisis consistent with national trends, as in the United Statesas a whole over 50% of TB cases are now diagnosedamong the foreign-born. Despite the national picture anda slow increase in TB disease in the foreign-born in SC,tuberculosis remains primarily a disease of our minoritypopulations. TB and HIV: As was recognized in the 1980s at the very beginning of the AIDS epidemic, co-infection with HIV andM. tuberculosis spells \"double-trouble\". Patients whosecell-mediated immune system have been weakened byHIV and are co-infected with M. tuberculosis are atextraordinarily high risk of progressing from latent TBinfection (LTBI) to active TB disease. While the risk ofprogression from asymptomatic LTBI to disease is ~10%over the lifetime of persons with \"normal\" immune systems,this risk is of the order of 10% per year for persons withuntreated HIV infection. It thus remains essential for allpersons diagnosed with HIV infection to receive atuberculin skin test, preferably as soon as possible afterthe diagnosis of HIV has been made! Fortunately recentadvances in HIV anti-retroviral therapy have diminishedthe impact of HIV on the epidemiology of tuberculosis. In2004, 196 (84%) of the 233 TB cases reported in SC caseswere tested for HIV, and of these, 11 (6%) were found to beco-infected. Simultaneous treatment of HIV andtuberculosis is difficult because of complexpharmacological issues relating to tolerance, toxicity,multiple-drug interactions and pharmacokinetics (5,6). Ingeneral co-treatment of TB and therefore requiresreferral to an expert consultant. In 1999-2000 SCexperienced an outbreak of TB among persons infectedwith HIV which required extensive efforts to contain (7-9).Diagnostic Methods: For decades standard diagnostic tools for diagnosing pulmonary TB (other than the chest X-ray or other radiological imaging methods) included AFBsmears and cultures, and the tuberculin skin test (TST).These remain important but in recent years these havebeen supplemented by several newer \"high-tech\" methods.For example, the laboratory, whichprocesses approximately 9500 specimens per year, usesfully automated liquid media incubators to culturemycobacteria from clinical specimens, and DNA gene-probes and High-Performance Liquid Chromotography(HPLC) to identify M. tuberculosis and to distinguish it from other pathogenic mycobacteria. As a result, turnaroundtime for positive culture results has been greatly reducedin most cases. A technical revolution also appears to bein the making regarding the venerable TST as there arenow several FDA licensed methods to perform in-vitrolymphocyte-based immunological assays which,essentially, perform a tuberculin skin test in a test tube.These methods are not currently used by DHEC becauseof collection to processing time limitations, but are likelyto be used in the future as their sensitivity, specificity, utilityand cost-effectiveness in different settings is betterevaluated (10-12). Another exciting development in mycobacteriology has been the of \"TB Genotyping\" (commonlycalled \"DNA fingerprinting\"). Last year DHEC joined anational network under which all new SC isolates of M. tuberculosis will be genotyped. This new tool will allow for more refined analysis of patterns of transmission andevaluation of TB control efforts (13). Treatment of TB: While many of the broad principles of TB treatment have remained unchanged for decades (e.g.always treat TB with at least two drugs to which the patientsorganisms are likely to be susceptible; never add a singledrug to a failing regimen), many of the details continue toevolve. DHEC follows the most recent official guidelinesfor treatment of TB in the United States that are the productof a collaborative effort among the American ThoracicSociety, the Infectious Disease Society of America, andthe CDC (14). Aside from detailed information regardingtreatment regimens, drug dosages, and more, theguidelines also enunciate a basic principle that had beenwidely accepted for some time in the world of TB controlbut had never been so explicitly stated, namely that: \"The responsibility for successful treatment is clearly assignedto the public health program or private provider, not to thepatient.\" This principle follows from the fact that an infectious TB patient who fails to take his medicationsproperly may infect others with consequences which maybe disastrous both from a personal and from a publichealth point of view, (e.g. leading to fatal miliary ormeningeal tuberculosis in infants, or leading to acommunity or institutional outbreak). This new guidingprinciple thus provides a formal rationale for the use ofDirectly Observed Therapy (DOT) which has beendiscussed in the TB literature for many years (15) andwhich has gradually emerged as the \"standard of care\"towards which TB programs should aim.Epi Notes Page 5 Fall 2005 (TUBERCULOSIS cont'd from page 4 ) (Continued on page 6)Treatment of Latent TB Infection (LTBI): Worldwide, it is estimated that 2 billion persons (about 1 person in 3 onthe planet!) have LTBI. Estimates for the United Statesand for South Carolina may be of the order of 10-15 millionand 120,000-200,000 respectively. Fortunately personswith LTBI are not ill and do not transmit M. tuberculosis toothers, and only a minority of infected persons will everactually develop disease and thus become potentiallyinfectious. In poor countries, resources available for TBmust be used to treat persons with disease. In the USAand other industrialized countries, treatment of LTBI (TLTBI)is recognized as a useful adjunctive public health tool butis reserved in priority for certain subsets of persons withLTBI: most notably either (a) for infected persons at highrisk of progressing from LTBI to disease such as recentconvertors and persons with known medical risk factors(e.g. co-infection with HIV and M. tuberculosis), or (b)occasionally for healthy persons who though they may notintrinsically be at high risk, nonetheless live or work in asetting in which the consequences of their progressionfrom LTBI to TB disease would potentially be very serious(e.g. for a nurse who works in a newborn nursery) andwhere anticipated benefits of therapy exceed the assessedrisk of drug toxicity. Evidence based review of regimens for TLTBI were published by the CDC in 2003 and included a range ofoptions including (a) INH for either 6 or 9 months (giveneither daily or twice-weekly); (b) rifampin alone for 4months; and (c) regimens built around 2-months of rifampinand pyrazinamide (16). The latter seemed appealingbecause of their short duration, but subsequent reportsshowed that their toxicity, especially in HIV-negative (!)patients made them unacceptable (17). In DHEC TB clinicspatients treated for LTBI most commonly receive a 6-monthcourse of INH given either daily or twice-weekly (and,resources allowing, and for the highest risk patients, bydirectly observed therapy). However certain higher riskpatients are treated for 9 months, notably children andpatients co-infected with HIV. Drug resistance: An important issue for clinicians treating TB is the prevalence of drug resistance. Fortunately mostM. tuberculosis isolates available from South Carolina TBpatients are found to be susceptible to INH, rifampin,ethambutol and pyrazinamide, the most important \"first-line\" TB drugs (Table 1). Treatment of drug-resistant TBis complex and costly and requires treatment with 2 nd line drugs which are less efficacious, usually more toxic,produce more side effects, and are more costly in terms ofdrug cost and laboratory monitoring. Contact Investigation: Whenever indicated, DHEC performs an investigation of contacts surrounding newlydiagnosed cases. These investigations can (a) uncoverother cases in the source case's entourage, and (b) identifycontacts who were infected by the index case and whothus need to be treated for LTBI. Priority for investigationsincludes contacts of cases of smear- and culture-positivepulmonary tuberculosis (those most likely to have beeninfectious). Contacts to cases with forms of extra- pulmonary tuberculosis which are not infectious (e.g. TBosteomyelitis) would be of lower priority. However, contactsto a young child with any form of TB would always beexamined in the hopes of identifying the \"source\" of thechild's infection. Generally a concentric circle approach isused in which closest (e.g. household) contacts areexamined first. The need to proceed to wider circles ofcontacts is then determined by a review of results of theinitial investigation. Where indicated, investigations mayinclude not only \"household contacts\", but also \"workcontacts\" and contacts from \"leisure-time\" activities. Organization of TB Control in South Carolina: Tuberculosis services are organized around county health departmentsas well as along the lines of DHEC's former \"HealthDistrict\" and newer \"Health Region\" structures. Eachcounty health department has one (or more) designatedlead TB public health nurse who coordinates evaluation ofsuspects, care of known cases, investigation of contacts,provision of TLTBI, and liaison with key local professionalsand institutions also involved with TB Control (e.g. hospitalinfection control practitioners). DHEC also organizes anetwork of physicians who hold clinics and are responsiblefor medical management of patients from each county. Dr.Richard Ervin of Florence currently serves as the MedicalDirector for the program and oversees care in 13 counties.Other clinicians include Drs. Richard Ballew, formerMedical Director (14 counties), Arnold Denler (8 counties),Kathryn Arden (7 counties) Jay Prashad (2 counties), andLloyd Hayes (2 counties). DHEC's TB program in Columbiais directed by JoAnn Palmer and includes a staff of nursing,social work and program consultants as well as acomputerized registry of cases. TB resources: A variety of useful TB resources are available to physicians, nurses and other professionals.These include excellent web sites (18), numerousdocuments from the CDC (19), and several recentcomprehensive texts (20). With the support of the AmericanLung Association - Southeast Region, DHEC also offersan intensive 4-day \"TB Today\" course which is attended by30-40 professionals at each of the two sessions givenevery year. For matters relating to an individual patient, anentr\u00e9e into the DHEC TB Control system can always bemade through the \"TB Nurse\" in any county healthdepartment. More generally, consultation about publichealth or clinical matters related to TB, application forenrollment in the \"TB Today\" course, or requests for apresentation about tuberculosis (e.g. for a medicalconference) can be arranged by calling DHEC's Divisionof TB Control in Columbia at 803-898-0558.

Palmer, BA Eric R. Brenner, MD A tuberculin skin test issue in 1996 - Almost 10 years ago in these same pages we reviewed the question of whetherthe 40,000 odd \"routine tuberculin skin tests\" (TST) whichwere administered yearly to pre-school aged children inSouth Carolina did or did not contribute appreciably totuberculosis (TB) control efforts in the state. The reviewconcluded that these tests might detect about twoasymptomatic cases every year and might further preventone additional case from occurring during the next 80 yearsor so. As several hundred cases of tuberculosis arediagnosed in SC every year, this suggested that routineTSTs could not be expected to have any substantial impacton future TB trends (1). Accordingly, we subsequentlypublished new guidelines for skin testing of children inHealth Departments (2). Briefly, these advised that childrenseen in DHEC clinics did not routinely need to be skintested, but that skin testing was always recommended (a)for children being evaluated for an illness compatible withTB, (b) who were being evaluated as contacts to a recentlyidentified case of TB, and (c) for selected other childrenwith clear risk factors, for example those known to beinfected with HIV, or those from families who hadimmigrated within the past 5 years from high-incidenceTB countries. A tuberculin skin test issue in 2005 - In the last 18 months, DHEC's Division of TB Control has considered an issuereminiscent to that described above: whether DHEC clinicsought or ought not to skin test low-risk adults who mayjust \"walk-in-for-a-test\" (self-referrals) or who may evenhave been referred by a physician or employer for a\"routine skin test\". Several difficulties have beenidentified related to such tests. Low yield: Most people \"just dropping in\" have negative skin tests so that the yield of \"positivetests\" is very low. Low predictive value of positive tests - The few patients found to have positive TSTs may thentypically find themselves referred for furtherevaluation with a chest x-ray and subsequentlyfor prescription of a course of preventive therapywith isoniazid. However, as the prevalence oflatent TB infection (LTBI) is low in low-riskpopulations, many or most of the rare positivetests will in fact be false-positives and thus muchof this additional \"medical intervention\" may serveno personal health or public health purpose. Low priority activity yet time consuming for front-line TB nurses who must focus on high-priority activities - Current work loads for DHEC County TB nurses are high and require a focuson high-priority TB activities including: (a)supervision of therapy for proven cases oftuberculosis (often involving Directly ObservedTherapy as dictated by current standards of care);(b) evaluation of TB suspects (e.g. persons withfever, persistent cough, weight loss and with orwithout chest x-rays already shown to beabnormal) who need a prompt and thoroughevaluation for tuberculosis; (c) investigation ofcontacts to known cases of tuberculosis wherethe prevalence of TST positivity is known to behigh (of the order of 33% in DHEC investigations);(d) supervision of treatment of latent TB infectionfor high-risk infected persons (e.g. infectedcontacts; persons co-infected with HIV and M.tuberculosis, etc.) In this setting provision of TBservices to persons who are not cases, notsuspects, and not contacts is problematic anddetracts from the high-priority TB control activitieslisted above. Declining resources available for public health at the local level - As listed above, the rationales for needing to reduce testing of low-risk personsare epidemiologic, bio-statistical, andprogrammatic \"best practices\". Anadditional reality is that county health departmentscurrently lack the funding and staffing resources that were available only a few years ago, and this provides yet another reason for the need to reduce\"low-yield\" / \"low-priority\" activities. Guidelines for DHEC practice - When persons present to DHEC clinics requesting a TST, staff should initiallyproceed not with a TST, but rather with a \"risk assessment\"which includes questions about medical risk factors (e.g.presence of cancer, end-stage renal disease requiringdialysis, HIV infection etc) and questions about populationrisk factors (e.g. has recently lived in a homeless shelteror jail, previously unrecognized contact to a person withinfectious TB, etc). Persons who do not have any of these risk factors may be educated about the matter and discharged. A detailed algorithm has been provided toCounty Health Departments to assist them in conductingthese risk assessments. Continued role of tuberculin skin testing - The new guidelines notwithstanding, health departments and DHECTB nurses should continue to skin test: (a) all cases of TB(who may not have been tested prior to diagnosis), (b) allTB suspects being evaluated for TB disease, (c) all TBcontacts being investigated, and (d) all high-risk individuals presenting to TB clinic for any reason. Inaddition at both the county and state levels, DHEC supportsand promotes tuberculin skin testing programs as areneeded in a variety of high-risk (or potentially high-risk)settings (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, and prisons)where employees and/or residents need to be skin tested (Continued on page 8)Epi Notes Page 8 Fall 2005 (Continued on page 9)as part of a comprehensive institutional TB Control program. A look to the future - This new policy will be phased in gradually. Like other guidelines, these may be considered\"work in progress\" since future changes in theepidemiology of TB, especially at the local level, may inthe future provide rationale for change in practice.

Pertussis Deaths in Infants Shirley Jankelovich, MD, Medical Epidemiologist Two recent deaths in young infants in South Carolina due to pertussis highlight the need for greater vigilance byphysicians for this disease. In both cases, pertussis wasnot recognized in the infant. In both cases, the source ofinfection was a household member in whom pertussiswas not recognized. A recent study showed that householdmembers of infants with pertussis were the source ofpertussis in 75% of cases, with mothers being the mostfrequent source of infection (32% of cases) (1). Siblings, fathers and grandparents were sources of infection in 20,15 and 8% of cases, respectively. In the majority of thesecases, pertussis in the household member wasunrecognized. A very important point regarding recognition of pertussis is that the clinical presentation of pertussis may be atypicalin many infected infants, children and adults. Clinicalsymptoms are influenced by many factors including age,presence of antibody against pertussis (previous exposureto pertussis, previous immunization, presence of passivelyacquired maternal antibody), antibiotic administration andconcomitant infection. For example, very young infantsmay present only with a mild cough, apnea and/or hypoxia.Infants, children and adults with antibody against pertussismay have a brief or unrecognized catarrhal stage, absenceof a whoop, and a shorter duration of cough and noposttussive vomiting. Of all age groups, infants less than 4 months old are most likely to die from pertussis (2,3). Furthermore, the mortality rate in these young infants has been increasing. Of the 77pertussis deaths reported to the CDC in the 1980's,infants less than 4 months old accounted for 64% of deaths.In the 1990's, infants accounted for 82% of the 103 deathsreported. High pertussis infant mortality is most likely due to the severe complications of pertussis in this age group.Complications include pneumonia, apnea, hypoxia,seizures, encephalopathy and rapidly progressiverefractory pulmonary hypertension. Physicians have a very important role in protecting these vulnerable infants through recognition, treatment orprophylaxis of pertussis in infants and their householdcontacts. 1.

Human Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection Associated with Rodents Marcia Headrick, DVM, MPH, DACVPM, FACE Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) has been recognized as a pathogen in wild rodents, with occasionalspread to humans. Although many LCMV-associatedhuman illnesses are asymptomatic or mild, severeillnesses can occur, including neurologic damage anddeath, particularly to fetuses born to infected pregnantwomen, or those who have weakened immune systems.LCMV infection in pet rodents has also been recognized,most recently (May 2005) in relation to the fatal infection ofthree of four organ transplant recipients in Rhode Islandand Massachusetts (MMWR, 54:537-9, 2005]. In theirinvestigation of this incident, the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) identified an infection rateof approximately 3% among hamsters sampled at an Ohiodistributor that was the source of the organ donor's pethamster. In response to these findings, CDC issued Interim Guidance for Minimizing Risk for Human LCMV InfectionAssociated with Rodents [MMWR, 54: Dispatch, July 29,2005]. The facility of the distributor was quarantined until itcan be documented as free of LCMV infection. Tracebackefforts and records from the affected distributor did notindicate shipment of any rodents to SC. However,physicians should be aware of the potential hazardsassociated with pet rodents to their patients. A Q & A type fact sheet is available from CDC at http://www .cdc.gov/ healthypets/lcmv_rodents.htm.(PPD cont'd from page 7 )Epi Notes Page 9 Fall 2005 (LCMV cont'd from page 8) Continued on page 10)There is no definitive test for a live animal that can provide reliable answers about its LCMV status. Because of thepossibility that pet rodents in homes may be infected withLCMV, CDC recommendations should be followed for petrodent care, including precautions for pregnant womenand persons with weakened immune systems.Physicians should be aware that pet animals, includingrodents, can also carry other human pathogens such asSalmonella . Good husbandry, veterinary care, and hand- washing are important for preventing transmission ofmultiple diseases from pets to humans. PulseNet Julie H. Schlegel, MSPH Foodborne Epidemiologist The South Carolina Department of Health andEnvironmental Control (DHEC) is part of a national networkof local health departments, state health departments andfederal agencies submitting data to PulseNet, a Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention be used to distinguish strains of O157:H7, Salmonella , Shigella at the DNA level. PulseNet plays a vital role in surveillance for and theinvestigation of foodborne illness outbreaks that werepreviously difficult to detect. When similar patterns arefound through PulseNet, outbreaks can be detected evenif the affected persons are geographically far apart. Thisallows for a more timely and thorough outbreakinvestigation and prevention of further illness. In South Carolina, DHEC has used PulseNet data in many outbreaks. For example, PulseNet helps us identify casesthat are linked to nationally distributed food products orexposures. Food consumption and practices havechanged during the past 20 years in the United States. Weare observing a shift from the typical point source or \"churchsupper\" outbreak, which is relatively easy, to detect to themore diffuse, widespread outbreaks that occur over manycommunities with only a few illnesses in each community. Close collaboration between the private and public health sectors is critical to both the foodborne outbreakinvestigation process and the effectiveness of PulseNet.Individual physicians play a vital role in alerting the publichealth system about a potential foodborne outbreak byreporting illnesses to DHEC and by collecting stoolspecimens to aid in diagnosis. Laboratories play a vitalrole by testing and submitting isolates to the DHEC Bureauof Laboratories for further testing, including PFGE testingand submission information about the CDC's availableat: http://www .cdc.gov/pulsenet/ To report cases of reportable diseases, complete a DHECDisease Report Card. For questions or consultationregarding cases call your local county health departmentor the DHEC Division of Acute Disease Epidemiology at(803) 898-0861. Sources: http://www .cdc.gov/pulsenet/ Preventing Illnesses and Injuries Associated with Animal Contact Settings Marcia L. Headrick, DVM, MPH, DACVPM, FACE Venues where humans and animals commonly interact include public stables, petting zoos, traveling photoopportunities, schools, children's parties, livestock showsand animal rides. These activities normally increase inthe summer because of the general increase in outdooractivities and family vacations/outings. Although there isalways some risk involved when interacting with animals,awareness of the hazards and careful behavior willdecrease the chances of turning a routine activity into adisaster. Although enteric bacterial illnesses are the most commonly reported health risks associated with animalsin public settings, multiple other health risks are ofconcern. For example, allergies can be associated withanimal dander, scales, fur, feathers, urine, and saliva.Additional health concerns include injuries, rabiesexposures, and other infections. Both wild and domesticanimals are unpredictable and can cause serious injuries,particularly to small children. Also, animals infected withenteric pathogens (e.g., E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella , and Campylobacter ) frequently exhibit no signs of illness and may shed pathogens intermittently. InjuriesInjuries associated with animals in public settings include bites, kicks, falls, scratches, stings, crushing of the handsor feet, and being pinned between the animal and a fixedobject. These injuries have been associated with multiplespecies, including big cats (e.g., tigers), monkeys,domestic animals, and zoo animals. InfectionsMultiple bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents have been associated with animal contact. These organismsare transmitted through various modes. Exposure toanimal feces can result in infection with E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella , and Campylobacter. Infections from animal bites are common and frequently require extensivetreatment or hospitalization. Bacterial pathogens that are frequently associated with bite fever). Certain monkey species (especially macaques)that are kept as pets or used in public exhibitions can beinfected with herpes B virus, either asymptomatically orwith mild oral lesions. Human exposure through bites orfluids can result in a fatal meningoencephalitis. Becauseof difficulties with laboratory testing to confirm monkeyinfection and high herpes B prevalence, monkey bites canrequire intensive public health and medical follow-up. Skin contact with animals in public settings might also result in human infection. Ringworm infection caused byTrichophyton species and Microsporum gypseum have been documented among pet and livestock owners.Ringworm infection in 23 persons and multiple animalspecies were traced to a Microsporum canis infection in a hand-reared zoo tiger cub. Orf virus infections (contagiousecthyma or sore mouth) have occurred in goats and sheepat a children's petting zoo and in a lamb used for an Easterphoto opportunity. In 2003, multiple cases of monkeypoxoccurred among persons who had had contact withinfected prairie dogs either at a child care center or a petstore. Ecto- and endoparasites pose concerns when humans and exhibit animals interact. Sarcoptes scabiei is a skin mite that infests humans and animals, including swine,dogs, cats, foxes, cattle, and coyotes. Although humaninfestation from animal sources is usually self-limiting,skin irritation and itching may occur for multiple days andbe difficult to diagnose. Animal fleas bite humans, whichincreases the risk for infection or allergic reaction. Inaddition, fleas are the intermediate host for a tapewormspecies that can infect children. Multiple other animalhelminths might infect humans through fecal-oral contactor through contact with animals or contaminated earth. Tuberculosis (TB) is another disease of concern in certain animal settings. Twelve circus elephant handlers at anexotic animal farm were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and one handler had signs consistent with active disease after three elephants died of TB. Medicalhistory and testing of the handlers indicated that theelephants had been a probable source of exposure for themajority of the human infections. At a zoo, seven animalhandlers who were previously negative for TB testedpositive after a Mycobacterium bovis outbreak in rhinoceroses and monkeys. Zoonotic pathogens may also be transmitted by direct or indirect contact with reproductive fluids, aborted fetuses,or newborns from infected dams. Live-birthing exhibits,usually involving livestock (e.g., cattle, pigs, goats, orsheep), are popular at agricultural fairs. Although the publicusually does not have direct contact with animals duringbirthing, newborns and their dams are frequently availablefor petting and afterward. can be associatedwith contact with reproductive materials. C. burnetii is a rickettsial organism that most frequently infects cattle,sheep, and goats. The disease can cause abortion inanimals, but more frequently the infection is asymptomatic.During parturition, infected animals shed substantialnumbers of organisms that might become aerosolized.The majority of persons exposed to C. burnetii develop an asymptomatic infection, but clinical illness can range froman acute influenza-like illness to life-threateningendocarditis. A Q fever outbreak involving 95 confirmedcase-patients and 41 hospitalizations was linked to goatsand sheep giving birth at petting zoos. These petting zooswere in indoor shopping malls, indicating that indoor-birthing exhibits might pose an increased risk for Q fevertransmission. Chlamydophila psittaci infections cause respiratory disease (commonly called psittacosis) and are usuallyacquired from psittacine birds. For example, an outbreakof C. psittaci pneumonia occurred among the staff at a Zoo. Rabies ExposuresContact with mammals may expose persons to rabies through contamination of mucous membranes, bites,scratches, or other wounds with infected saliva or nervoustissue. Although no human rabies deaths caused byanimal contact in public exhibits have been recorded,multiple rabies exposures have occurred, requiringextensive public health investigation and medical follow-up. Persons have received rabies postexposureprophylaxis (PEP) after being exposed to rabid orpotentially rabid animal species (including cats, goats,bears, sheep, ponies, and dogs) at sites including petstores, county fairs, petting zoos, schools, and rodeoevents. Prompt assessment and treatment are critical forthis disease, which is usually fatal. (STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE cont'd from page 3 ) important to include antibiotic resistance to contribute to our knowledge of the developing and dynamic antibioticresistance problem in the United States. Also, due to citedgeographic variation of the prevalence of drug resistant S. pneumoniae (CDC), it is important to gather antibiotic resistance information for South Carolina specifically. For questions related to reports of S. pneumoniae , please contact your regional DHEC Public Health Office.

No longer can methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) be regarded as an exclusive nosocomial pathogen. With community associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), resistance and virulencehave converged with a clone not seen before 2000 with molecular analysis pointing to a community origin. Recent2001-2004 data from the Texas Children's Hospital revealed of the 3,586 community-associated staphylococcalinfections presenting to the Emergency Department, 2,661 were methicillin resistant (74%) with 95.9% skin and softtissue infections and 4.1% (110) systemic infections (osteomyelitis was the most common invasive CA-MRSA infection). The epidemiologic definition of CA-MRSA disease is the development of infection with MRSA in the outpatient setting in a person with a medical history who in the past year has had 1) NO admission to a hospital, nursing home, skillednursing facility, hospice; 2) NO dialysis or surgery; 3) NO history of MRSA infection or colonization and 3) NO permanentindwelling catheters or medical devices that pass through the skin into the body. Outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections have occurred primarily in persons who often have close contact and have included prison inmates, military recruits, soldiers and crewmembers of a naval ship, players of contact sports (wrestling andfootball team members), children in daycare, and men who have sex with men. CA-MRSA and health care associated MRSA (HCA-MRSA) infections have distinct clinical differences. While HCA- MRSA usually cause heterogeneous invasive infections, CA-MRSA infection is usually limited to skin and soft tissue butoccasionally may be invasive. CA-MRSA infections usually present as folliculitis, pustular lesions and furuncles/carbuncles/ abscesses. Many lesions are often mistaken for spider bites. Although the CA-MRSA epidemic spans thegamut of known skin and soft tissue infections from cellulitis to furuncles to frank abscess, a distinctive syndromeincludes rapidly progressive cellulitis. Several invasive CA-MRSA syndromes deserve special mention, as they appearto be novel or at least not found in the recent literature. Necrotizing pneumonia with or without pleural empyema withCA-MRSA strains has been implicated in a destructive pneumonitis with loss of pulmonary architecture, microabcesses,and pulmonary vasculitis. Although streptococcal infections are a well-known cause of necrotizing fasciitis, this syndromehas been recently recognized as one that can be caused by CA-MRSA. At Texas Children's Hospital, septicthrombophlebitis caused by CA-MRSA has been described with clinical features reminiscent of endocarditis withsustained bacteremia and multiple embolic infections includepyomyositis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, bursitis, and a new and devastating purpura fulminans syndrome. The increased ability of CA-MRSA to spread among contacts and cause severe invasive disease is thought to be due to a distinct cytotoxin, called Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) that is not found in HCA-MRSA. CA-MRSA isolates havea significantly different antibiotic resistance pattern from HCA-MRSA. The most important difference is that CA-MRSAisolates are not susceptible to B-lactam antibiotics because it harbors one of two novel methicillin-resistance cassettegene elements called SCCmec IV or V. However, CA-MRSA isolates are often susceptible to several non-B-lactamantibiotics that include vancomycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, gentamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), but are frequently resistant to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Currently, microbiology laboratories should routinely test S. aureus isolates for susceptibility to macrolides, clindamycin, and trimethroprim-sulfamethazole in addition to B-lactam antibiotics. Most CA-MRSA isolates are resistant to macrolidesbut remain susceptible to clindamycin. In vitro resistance to both erythromycin and clindamycin predicts clinical failurewith either agent. In vitro resistance to erythromycin but susceptibility to clindamycin by routine testing may not predictclinical effectiveness of clindamycin because of a property associated with erythromycin resistant CA-MRSA calledinducible resistance to clindamycin. Treatment failures with clindamycin have occurred with MRSA isolates that possessclindamycin-inducible resistance. Clindamycin inducible resistance can be detected by a special, but simple testcalled the D-test. If this test is not available in the laboratory, the clinician should ask the laboratory unable to performthe D-test to report MRSA strains that it determines to be resistant to erythromycin as clindamycin resistant also. The CDC recommendations for treating CA-MRSA infections are forthcoming. Interim recommendations are discussed below in an algorithm (Figure 1). In the September 2004 issue of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) News (Continued on page 12)Epi Notes Page 12 Fall 2005 (CA-MRSA continued from page 11) (www. aapnews.org) an expert opinion guideline is available, including an updated \"Management of skin and soft tissue infections: Principles\".Physicians should seek information from their clinical laboratories about the prevalence of CA-MRSA outpatient infectionsin their communities. Physicians should: 1) always culture purulent skin or soft tissue lesions before further management;2) always adequately drain abscesses at presentation and send material for culture and susceptibility testing (\"D\"-zonetesting is necessary if erythromycin resistance and clindamycin susceptibility are reported); 3) always determineseverity of infection at presentation and need for hospitalization and empirical antimicrobial therapy; 4) always providedischarge instructions emphasizing the need for return if no clinical improvement within 48 hours. Outbreaks of MRSA in group settings (e.g. childcare facilities, sports teams, residential institutions, etc.) should be reported to your local DHEC Epidemiology Office. During an outbreak, the molecular differences between CA-MRSAand HCA-MRSA permit distinction of isolates though a specialized molecular techniques called PFGE (pulsed field gelelectrophoresis). For certain MRSA outbreak situations, DHEC's Division of Acute Disease Epidemiology will requestPFGE on a sample of outbreak isolates from the DHEC Bureau of Laboratories. For more information on prevention and control, see the CDC web site http://www .cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/ARESIST/ ca_mrsa.htm. Specific measures to control an outbreak of CA-MRSA and for management of household contacts can be found on theCDC website (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/ARESIST/ca_mrsa.htm ). In areas where MRSA accounts for more than 10% of community associated S. aureus isolates, most authorities recommend considering modification for initial empiric therapy of severe infections most likely attributed to S. aureus . An increasing burden of MRSA disease, especially involving clones that cause more severe invasive infections, willhave an enormous influence on the clinical approach to suspected staphylococcal infection. At a minimum, vigilanceand a decrease in the threshold for obtaining cultures to document MRSA are warranted. Although an optimal managementapproach for CA-MRSA infections has not been established, the guidelines presented here represent the current viewof many authorities. Seriously ill, hospitalized patients with suspected staphylococcal infection and significant CA-MRSA risk should be treated empirically with an antimicrobial regimen including vancomycin, with future clinical trialsdetermining if another agent will displace vancomycin as the drug of choice. Also, with an increase in CA-MRSAinfections, clinical trials are needed to assess the precise role of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of uncomplicatedskin and soft tissue infections, to define agents most clinically effective and cost-effective. Pending future clinical trials,we hope these guidelines will be helpful in initiating empirical therapy for CA-MRSA infections, an identified publichealth challenge growing in our community.

(http://w w w .health.state.m n.us/divs/idepc/new sletters/dcn/index.htm l)12(CA-MRSA cont'd from page 12 )Revised School and Childcare Exclusion Lists Michelle L. Myer, MSN, RN, CPNP Epidemiology and Bioterrorism Nurse Consultant Each January SC DHEC is required to publish lists of those health conditions with which children and staff should not attend school or out-of-home childcare settings. These Exclusion Lists, which also address attendance for individuals exposed to certain communicable illnesses, are available on the DHEC Bureau of Disease Control's website, at: http://www .scdhec.gov/health/disease/exclusion.htm. The School Exclusion List applies to most students in grades 1-12. The Childcare Exclusion List applies to all children in out-of-home childcare, to children in 3-, 4-, or 5-year-old kindergarten, and to medically fragile students in grades 1-12. For the purposes of school exclusion, \"medically fragile students\" are those with special healthcare needs or developmental delays who require close assistance with feeding or other personal hygiene activitiesby which communicable illnesses may easily be spread. The 2005-2006 School and Childcare Exclusion Lists were revised in January 2005 , as well as in January 2004. Both revisions addressed specific concerns raised by the 2003-2004 Lists, which had been developed fromout-of-home childcare exclusion guidance found in the 2003 Red Book.Some changes and clarifications include: Exclusion standards for some conditions are now more clearly based on age or health status of students. For example, students six years of age and older with pediculosis may remain at school until the end of the schoolday. Children in kindergarten or childcare must be excluded as soon astheir head lice are discovered. For re-admission after some GI illnesses,younger children may require negative stool cultures; while older studentsmay return to school once symptoms subside. Conditions added to the Exclusion Lists: o Ringworm of the Body: Exclude for Tinea corporis that cannot be covered, until after initiation of oral or topical antifungal treatment. Additional exclusionmay be appropriate for some sports and physical education activities. o Ringworm of the Scalp: Exclude for Tinea capitis until after initiation of oral antifungal treatment. Topical treatments such as selenium sulfideshampoo (1% or 2.5%) decrease fungal shedding and may berecommended by schools or childcare providers to help curb the spread ofinfection. Conditions Removed. For the School Exclusion List, symptoms such as irritability, lethargy, and \"not feeling well enough to participate in activities\"were removed, since these are not reliable indicators of communicableillness in older students. Employees. Childcare exclusion rules for staff also apply to food-handlers working in out-of-home childcare settings. Both Exclusion Lists now address \"Do Not Exclude\" conditions such as common colds, warts, fifth disease, pinworms and non-purulentconjunctivitis. Because schools' reporting of outbreaks greatly facilitates local and state disease control efforts, information was added regarding mandated reportingof those excludable conditions that appear on the SC List of ReportableConditions. Parent Brochures were developed to help parents understand when children may need to be excluded from school or out-of-home childcareSC Law: Children with contagious diseases shall not attend school or childcare in out-of-home settings .
