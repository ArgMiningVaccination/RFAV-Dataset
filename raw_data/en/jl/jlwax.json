The initial public expectation was that China would contain the virus within its borders.However, this was not the case; the disease spread first to neighboring countries and the entire world. The disease ravage was hard on Italy, Spain, and France. Covid-19 wrath would then ravage Americans killing more people than any other part of the world. All governments across the globe instituted strict measures to contain the disease and protect its people. Among the measure to contain the disease was to develop a vaccine. Pharmaceutical research centers working around the clock to develop one within the shortest time possible.

What was supposed to be a global joy that finally we are protected elicited a mixed global reaction. A heated public debate arising over several issues regarding the vaccine; for instance, some questioned time taken to develop the vaccine, its side effect, safety, efficacy of the vaccine.
