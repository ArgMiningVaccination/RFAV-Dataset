A combination of herbal compounds, meditation, and cleansing, Ayurveda focuses on the health system as a whole: body, mind, and spirit. While Western medicine tends to treat specific health issues individually, the holistic Ayurvedic system seeks to create balance in the whole being. In Ayurveda, human anatomy begins with the five elements (air, space, water, fire, and earth). The interaction between these elements in the body form the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. All three doshas are present in all people, but the amount varies depending on lifestyle, diet, and genetics. Those practicing Ayurveda believe health and wellness is contingent on maintaining balanced doshas, and that the proportions are impacted by an individual's behavior and physical attributes. For example, an individual with a Vata dosha type is believed to be prone to dry skin and hair, have a slim body, and experience forgetfulness. By contacting an Ayurveda practitioner, you can learn your body type based on these doshas At the center of the Ayurvedic routine is living in harmony with nature, and this requires the practitioner to maintain a disciplined daily routine that's in sync with the rhythms of the earth. Stress, lack of sleep, and inconsistent eating habits all interfere with this routine. While some parts of the daily routine you may already be familiar with, like waking up early, bathing, and going to bed at a suitable time, Ayurveda also incorporates massage, meditation, and spiritual reading just before bedtime. These routines vary based on your dosha and the seasons. In Ayurveda, herbs are used to support health and wellness in many ways, from drinking teas and tonics, to use in beauty treatments, and simply enjoying an uplifted mood from their aromatic scents.
