[ATAGI](http://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-update-on-the-covid-19-vaccination-program) recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for individuals, if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose was 6 months ago or longer, aged 75 years and over. See the [FAQs](http://www.pharmacy777.com.au/our-services/covid-19-vaccinations#faq) for more details. A booster dose may be considered for the following individuals, if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, and regardless of the number of prior doses received, based on an individual risk benefit assessment with their immunisation provider: - All adults aged 65 to 74 years, and/or - Adults aged 18 to 64 years with severe immunocompromise. - Within the above groups, an additional 2023 COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be of most benefit for people who: -Have no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (and therefore are unlikely to have protection from hybrid immunity), -Have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs, or -Reside in a residential aged care facility. ATAGI continues to encourage all adults who were [recommended to have a COVID-19 vaccine dose in February 2023](http://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-2023-booster-advice), and who have not yet had one, to receive a vaccine dose as soon as possible (refer to Tables below). Haven't had your first booster dose in 2023? You may still be eligible to receive your first booster dose: Did you have your first 2023 booster dose 6 months ago?

If you have tested positive for COVID-19, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommends that all people should wait for 6 months after a confirmed COVID-19 infection, before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine dose. The next scheduled dose of COVID-19 vaccination should then be given as soon as possible after 6 months, and you should still have all the recommended doses. Vaccination is likely to enhance the protection induced by infection. The interval between infection and vaccination enhances the protection from vaccination by further boosting the immune response, including immune memory response, generated following infection. This change in recommendation applies to all people who are recommended to receive COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., from 5 years and above), regardless of how many COVID-19 vaccine doses they have received. For more information please visit the WA Health website [here](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance/additional-considerations#vaccination-after-testing-positive-for-covid19). - What about a booster dose? [ATAGI](https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-update-on-the-covid-19-vaccination-program) recommends a 2023 COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for individuals, if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer, aged 75 years and over. A booster dose may be considered for individuals aged 65 to 74 years, and/or individuals aged 18-64 years with [severe immunocompromise](http://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-statement-on-the-use-of-a-3rd-primary-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-individuals-who-are-severely-immunocompromised?language=en) without risk factors for severe COVID-19, and at-risk children and adolescents aged 5-17 years with medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19 or disability with significant or complex health needs , if their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or confirmed infection (whichever is the most recent) was 6 months ago or longer. - What is a 'bivalent' vaccine? A bivalent vaccine means it can produce an immune response against two different antigens (an antigen is any substance that can stimulate an immune response in the body e.g. bacteria, viruses, pollen etc). The two antigens in a vaccine may be two different viruses, or two variations of one virus. The Bivalent Original/Omicron vaccine consists of two variations of the COVID-19 virus, the original strain and the omicron strain. Studies found that the safety profile of the Bivalent vaccine is similar to the first or second booster of the original (ancestral virus-based) vaccine. All currently available COVID-19 vaccines are expected to boost neutralising antibodies and thereby provide additional protection against any infection and longer lasting protection against severe disease as a booster dose, however bivalent mRNA booster vaccines are preferred over other original (ancestral virus-based) vaccines. - What is the best timing interval between other vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines? The Department of Health have advised a COVID-19 vaccine can be given on the same day as an [influenza vaccine](https://www.pharmacy777.com.au/our-services/flu-vaccinations). For the timing between the COVID-19 vaccine and any other vaccines, please speak to your Pharmacist, GP or immunising health care professional about the most appropriate time to make your appointment. - Am I up-to-date with my COVID-19 vaccinations? Protection from a primary course (usually 2 doses) of COVID-19 vaccine wanes over time and protection is reduced against the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Because of this, all adults who have not received a recommended COVID-19 vaccine dose as per February 2023 guidelines are encouraged a booster dose as soon as possible to remain up-to-date. However, if you're aged over 75, you can receive your additional booster dose from 6 months after your last booster dose. For more information, see the What about a booster dose? FAQ above. - How can I prepare for my appointment? Please [read the factsheet](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-preparing-for-covid-19-vaccination) developed by the Australian Government Department of Health to prepare for your vaccination. For further support, please chat with your Pharmacist or GP. - How do I know when to book in a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine? It is recommended that you receive the two primary course doses of your COVID-19 vaccine as the same brand. We recommend planning ahead for two doses. Optimal protection against COVID-19 will not occur until about one to two weeks after your second dose. Comirnaty (Pfizer) Bivalent for children aged 12 years and over The recommended interval between dose 1 and dose 2 of the Comirnaty (Pfizer) Bivalent is 8 weeks. The interval between the doses can be shortened to a minimum of 3 weeks. Patients who have commenced their primary course with an original (ancestral) vaccine are recommended to complete the course with a bivalent vaccine. Spikevax (Moderna) Bivalent for children aged 12 years and over The recommended interval between dose 1 and dose 2 of the Spikevax (Moderna) Bivalent is 8 weeks. The interval between the doses can be shortened to a minimum of 3 weeks. Patients who have commenced their primary course with an original (ancestral) vaccine are recommended to complete the course with a bivalent vaccine. Comirnaty (Pfizer) for children aged 5 to 11 years The recommended interval between dose 1 and dose 2 of the Comirnaty (Pfizer) COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years is 8 weeks. Nuvaxovid (Novavax) The recommended interval between dose 1 and dose 2 of the Nuvaxovid (Novavax) vaccine is 8weeks. The interval between the doses can be shortened to a minimum of 3 weeks. Please talk to our Pharmacists if you need to confirm what the timing should be between the appointments. - Please ask your Doctor or Pharmacist for the latest specific advice about side effects. You can use the [COVID-19 vaccine side effects symptom checker](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-side-effect-checker) if you have concerns about any symptoms after your vaccine. The checker is also available through the National Coronavirus Helpline - 1800 020 080, 24 hours a day. If you think a COVID-19 vaccine has caused a side effect, you can report it. Reports of suspected side effects help the TGA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. Our pharmacy can report side effects to the TGA on your behalf, or you can report your side effects yourself. [Visit the TGA website](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/health-professionals/reporting-and-managing-adverse-vaccination-events) to find out how. - Why do I need to wait 15 minutes after my vaccination? If a serious reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine occurs, it will usually occur within 15 minutes of being vaccinated . It is important for you to wait in the pharmacy for 15 minutes after being vaccinated so you can be observed for any serious reactions. Pharmacists who deliver vaccinations are trained in first aid and CPR and know how to respond to an anaphylactic reaction. In the unlikely event of a severe reaction, the Pharmacist and other pharmacy team members will act immediately to provide emergency assistance. - What is happening with the COVID-19 Vaccination Program and pharmacy roll out? - What is Coronavirus and latest news affecting Australia? - How do I cancel my appointment?
