Before you apply, please review the basics to make sure you understand what to expect during the application process. Also, gather the information and documents you'll need to complete an application. The Basics About Disability Benefits The SSDI program pays benefits to you and certain [family members](/benefits/disability/family.html) if you are \"insured.\" This means that you worked long enough - and recently enough - and paid Social Security taxes on your earnings. The While these two programs are different, the medical requirements are the same. If you meet the nonmedical requirements, monthly benefits are paid if you have a medical condition expected to last at least one year or result in death. The Disability Application Process Whether you apply online, by phone, or in person, the disability benefits application process follows these general steps: - You gather the information and documents you need to apply. We recommend you print and review the [Adult Disability Checklist](/hlp/radr/10/ovw001-checklist.pdf).

Once You've Applied Processing time for disability applications vary depending on the nature of the disability, necessary medical evidence or examinations, and applicable quality reviews. Once we receive your application, we'll review it and contact you if we have questions. We might request additional documents from you before we can proceed. Look For Our Response When the state agency makes a determination on your case, you'll receive a letter in the mail with our decision. It generally takes three to six months for an initial decision. If you included information about other family members when you applied, we'll let you know if they may be able to receive benefits on your record.

Other Ways You Can Apply Apply With Your Local Office You can do most of your business with Social Security online. If you cannot use these online services, your local Social Security office can help you apply. You can find the phone number for your local office by using our [Office Locator](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp) and looking under Social Security Office Information. The toll-free \"Office\" number is your local office. Apply By Phone Call 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, to apply by phone.

Mailing Your Documents If you mail any documents to us, you must include the Social Security number so that we can match them with the correct application. Do not write anything on the original documents. Please write the Social Security number on a separate sheet of paper and include it in the mailing envelope along with the documents. Information for Advocates, Attorneys, and Third Parties If you are an Advocate, Attorney, or Third Party Representative and you are helping someone prepare an [online Social Security benefit application](/applyfordisability/), there are [some things you should know](/representation/). What do I need to know about Advance Designation? You should be aware of another type of representation called [Advance Designation](/payee/advance_designation.htm). Advance Designation allows capable adult and emancipated minors who are applying for or receiving Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, or Special Veterans Benefits the option to choose up to three people in advance who could serve as their representative payee, if the need arises. In the event that you can no longer manage your benefits, you and your family will have peace of mind knowing that someone you trust may be appointed to manage your benefits for you. If you need a representative payee to assist with the management of your benefits, we will first consider your advance designees. We must still fully evaluate them and determine their suitability at that time. You can submit and update your advance designation request when you apply for benefits or after you are already receiving benefits. You may do so through your personal [my Social Security](/myaccount/) account, contacting us by telephone at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), or at [your Support [The Faces and Facts of Disability](/disabilityfacts/) [Benefits for [Information for Representatives](/representation/) [Helping Someone Apply Online](/benefits/retirement/planner/thirdparty.html) [What You Need to Know About The Online Disability Application](/hlp/radr/10/global-report-works.htm) [Adults with a Disability that "}
