Should every child get them? Should it be mandatory? Are they safe? Why does my child need them? The big debate has always been the supposed link between autism and vaccines. My two boys are fully vaccinated, including a yearly flu shot. I believe in the need for vaccines and I do not believe that they contributed to my boys' autism. My children were already acting a bit \"odd\" before they had their MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine, which is supposedly the vaccine most parents target as the shot that \"gave\" their child autism. I did not believe it then and I still do not believe it now. I think vaccines are safe and effective. Are there risks? Of course, but any medical treatment comes with risk. Some children do become very ill from vaccines and some have even died. But the number of kids and chance of that happening are very low. Unfortunately, what we have now are numerous campaigns trying to scare parents into believing that vaccinating is too risky and it will cause autism. Show me the evidence. There is none. No child should become sick or die from preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, chicken pox, and whooping cough because parents are afraid of autism. There is no excuse for parents not to vaccinate ... or is there? The other side of the vaccination coin is this: what if your child is medically compromised or allergic to vaccine components? Then what do you do? I have friends who have had to deal with this situation for years. Their child is highly allergic to certain ingredients in vaccines. He almost died when he was 22 months old because of complications from a scheduled, routine vaccination. Since then, he has not gotten vaccinations and his parents struggle with finding doctors and schools that will accept him because he does not meet vaccination requirements they desire. His mother has become \"one of those moms\" who does not vaccinate. People are judgmental and rude to her sometimes because they do not know the whole story. Her child almost died! How much more of a right does she need to say, \"No, my son will not be vaccinated\"? I know another family whose son became very ill after getting the H1N1 shot. He now has a lifelong autoimmune disease that has had him near death. That family also has the right to say, \"No more.\" The vaccination world is not black and white. It is many shades of grey. Do not assume that because a parent does not vaccinate that they are harming their child, being lazy, being \"natural,\" or whatever other words you want to use. I believe that if your child is medically healthy and can tolerate the vaccines (remember, mild side effects are normal), then it should be done. If your child is not able to tolerate vaccines for whatever reason, then you should not get them. The risks of adverse effects do exist, but the good experiences outweigh the bad. I feel terribly sorry for the families that have had bad experiences and my heart is heavy for those that have lost children. As a nursing student, I strongly believe in preventative measures against disease and illness. Of course, you are free to choose what you will or will not do for your family. But just remember that the person next to you who might not vaccinate or be vaccinated has a story to tell. Until you hear it, be kind and do not judge.
