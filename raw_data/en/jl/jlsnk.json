As a music lover, I am reminded of a story told by Jonathan Cain, the keyboardist for the 70s and 80s hit band Journey. Cain was living in Hollywood and his dog was hit by a car. The vet bill was more than he could afford. He said: \"I had just called my dad for some money, for another loan. And I hated calling my dad for a loan. I said, 'Dad, should I just give up on this music thing and come home? Dad said, 'No, no, don't come home. Stick to your guns.

Although Southern California's Inland Empire did not experience the devastating losses seen in places like New Y ork and New Jersey, it was, nevertheless, forced to make widespread and drastic changes in order to contain the spread of the virus. LLUH's COPING WITH COVID-19 By Michaela Collins, BS asked our faculty and students to move to an all-online teaching environment literally overnight, and while the shift hasn't been perfect, it's gone remarkably well.\" One greater challenge for students was finishing rotations at clinical sites. Many sites cancelled student rotations, but LLUSP's Department of Experiential Education worked diligently to re-arrange schedules and help students complete their rotations on time. Each class experienced inconvenience, but the graduating Class of 2020 faced additional challenges with preparations for while community sites adopted new delivery and counseling processes, \"members of the pharmacy department along with physician leadership worked on developing treatment plans for our COVID-19 positive patients.\" LLUMC pharmacies have done everything they can to serve the community safely and effectively. Within our school, pharmacy students transitioned to distance learning in mid-March and were able to continue most activities via Zoom. School of Pharmacy Dean Michael D. Hogue was pleased with the transition, stating, \"W e the Board Exam as well as planning for graduation. Commencement was postponed to September 2020, and students were scheduled to take their boards starting in June 2020. Exams during the pandemic meant preparations would be completely virtual and collaborative studies with other students would be minimal. Associate Dean of Academic Affairs Dr. Kyle Sousa appreciates the way in which students at the School of Pharmacy responded: \"I want to commend our students for their patience, resiliency, and courage in facing these difficult times.\" For many students, managing home and family life, working in clinical sites or telehealth, and working toward their doctorate from home was barely feasible. Third-year pharmacy student, Arielle Thio, spoke on behalf of all students feeling overwhelmed and further explained that \"balancing work, studies, and class was difficult, especially when forced to make significant adaptations for each task.\" PY4 student Devin Cohen expressed his gratitude for the sense of normalcy and support provided during times of uncertainty. \"LLUSP staff and faculty continuously put forth a strong effort to show that we as students are their main priority.\" Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy has discovered how truly adaptable it is. Despite the ongoing negative consequences of this pandemic, Dean Hogue states, \"Out of adversity comes tremendous opportunity, and we are grateful for every blessing the Lord gives during this time as we look forward to the future.\" After overcoming challenges early on, the School of Pharmacy realized opportunities for growth, Dean Hogue reiterated. \"W e are now recognizing that we are capable of a great deal more and are thinking innovatively about what the future holds for pharmacy education.\" \"Out of adversity comes tremendous oppor - tunity, and we are grateful for every blessing the Lord gives during this time as we look forward to the future. \" \u2014Dean Hogue university, medical center, students, faculty, and staff were all affected in one way or another. Despite all of it, they showed remarkable resilience, compassion, and faith. Dr. Antony Gobin, LLUSP alum and Director of Pharmacy at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC), reported major adaptations both in the hospitals and in their outpatient locations. These issues stemmed from problems acquiring drugs used in critical care settings to altered workflows caused by reduced operating room volumes and a decreased hospital census. According to Dr. Gobin, SCHOOL NEWS SCHOOL NEWS6 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 7Relishing the Game of Pickleball, LLUSP's New Sport If you know how to dink1 in the kitchen2 and poach3 for a passing shot4, you might be a pickler , or a pickleball addict. One of the fastest growing sports in America, pickleball is quickly catching on at Loma Linda University (LLU). During Loma Linda University Health's Homecoming weekend, nearly 90 players from six of the eight schools on campus competed against each other during the third annual Pickleball T ournament. T eams comprised of students, alumni, faculty and staff battled for the trophy, which for the first two years of the tournament went to the LLU School of Dentistry. This year, however, the LLU School of Medicine dominated on the courts and took the trophy to be showcased in their dean's office. Pickleball players at the School of Pharmacy are not despairing, however. They are, instead, determined to rally together to win the tournament in the near future. The sport is relatively new to pharmacy students, and this was the school's first year entering the competition with a team made up entirely of school of pharmacy associates. It may be fair to say some pharmacy players underestimated the skill and practice it would take to earn a victory. But now, having seen what they're up against, the School of Pharmacy team realizes it will take dedicated, regular practice and perhaps additional pickleball instruction to take on their opponents at next year's Homecoming game. Most pharmacy players had never heard of pickleball until the Fall of 2018, when Director of Alumni Affairs Jen Mathew, a recent convert to pickleball herself, invited everyone from the School of Pharmacy to learn more about the sport. Knowing a Homecoming tournament was imminent, she hoped to recruit players to represent the school. She invited Ernie Medina, DrPH, Assistant Professor at the LLU School of Public Health and self- styled \"Pickleball Professor,\" to provide lessons to beginners at several LLUSP pickleball events for students, faculty and staff. Out of those sessions, several players from the school have grown to love the game. T ony Kim, PY3, served as captain of the School of Pharmacy team this year after attending LLUSP pickleball events. \"It's become a great way to take a break from studying and get to know other students and faculty,\" he said. \"What I appreciate most about the game is that it's easy to learn, even if you have never played other racket sports.\" As for Dr. Medina, so great is his passion for pickleball that he is eager to teach the sport to anyone, even those from LLU schools other than his own. He is, in fact, largely responsible for the growing popularity of the sport at the University as well as in the community. He was one of the first to play pickleball on the tennis courts at LLU's Drayson Center and was instrumental in the formation of the Loma Linda Pickleball Club. In a matter of months, so many from the Inland Empire purchased memberships to the Drayson Center in order to play pickleball that the gym, recognizing the financial advantages, resurfaced and repainted several tennis courts to make them regulation pickleball courts. In addition to revenue from increased memberships, the Drayson Center hosted three very successful tournaments. Because the Homecoming Pickleball T ournament continues to grow, it will, no doubt, continue to be a popular event during LLUH Homecoming W eekend. The School of Pharmacy team can win the trophy with the help of its alumni, so pick yourselves up a paddle and don't stop playing until you can hit a dillball4 and avoid a falafel5. 1 dink: a soft shot that arcs over the net and falls into the opposing non-volley zone 2kitchen: slang term for the non-volley zone 3 poach: movement by a player into a partner's court to return a ball that would normally be taken by the partner 4 passing shot: a volley or groundstroke shot that is aimed at a distance from the player and is designed to prevent return of the ball 5dillball: shot that is inbounds and has bounced once, a live ball 6falafel: \"dead paddle\" or a short shot due to hitting the pickleball with little or no powerBy Jen Mathew, MA It didn't happen like we'd planned, but on March 20, as he sat in his Shryock Hall office on a Zoom meeting, LLUSP Dean Michael D. Hogue, PharmD, FAPhA, FNAP was inaugurated as president of the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). The inauguration ceremony was scheduled during APhA 's Annual Meeting, which would have been held this year at the Gaylord National Resort in W ashington D.C. had a pandemic not reached the U.S., effecting the cancelation of all kinds of conventions, gatherings, and events in order to slow the spread of the virus. If things had played out the way they were planned, Dr. Hogue would have been sworn in at the conclusion of a policy session, and the following evening, a reception would have been held in honor of the incoming president. Instead, the entire conference was made virtual, and Dr. Hogue became president of the organization on a Friday afternoon, online, from the comfort of his office chair, while his wife, Dr. Heather Hogue, stood nearby to take pictures of the momentous occasion. The event was much anticipated, as Dr. Hogue was named president-elect in March 2019 and for the year that followed had been preparing for his term in office. He was voted president by the 60,000 members of APhA because of his vision for the organization and for the practice of pharmacy. His primary goal for the organization is to grow its membership, knowing there is strength in numbers and that those numbers will be necessary in order to bring about changes for the profession. Dr. Hogue, who moved to California from Alabama last year, is excited to bring some southern hospitality to the association. The theme for his term as president is \"W elcome Home,\" and he hopes to re-engage pharmacists with the association where they will find a welcoming place that meets their varied and growing needs. (T o this point, he even plans to give a packet of sweet tea and a pair of comfy socks to wear at home to each of the APhA board and staff members!) As president, Dr. Hogue's duties include serving as chairman of the APhA board, overseeing the operations and $40 million annual budget, and representing the organization both internationally and nationally. Domestically, he may be required on occasion to represent pharmacists to various governmental bodies and speak to Congress about concerns and issues related to the field of pharmacy. APhA was founded in 1852 and is the largest association of pharmacists in the United States. It exists to serve and protect the interests of the entire pharmacy profession. Its headquarters are located on the National Mall in W ashington D.C., and thus, Dean Hogue will be required during his year as president to make several trips to the capital. For Dr. Hogue, it is a tremendous honor: \"When I was elected, little did I know I'd hold responsibility for leading our profession through a pandemic emergency. I'm so proud of how pharmacists, student pharmacists and pharmacy technicians have responded, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.\"\"MR. PRESIDENT\"JUST CALL HIM \"When I was elected, little did I know I'd hold responsibility for leading our profession through a pandemic emergency. \"8 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 9 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 9SCHOOL NEWS ACT COLLABORATIVE DAY OF SERVICE By Jen Mathew, MA Loma Linda University's School of Pharmacy was one of five pharmacy schools in California that participated in the 2019 ACT National Day of Service. The event, which was established by the Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network (CPESN), was the first of its kind in the country. CPESN, a national pharmacy networking organization, is committed to leading community pharmacies towards more clinical practice. Members of CPESN view community pharmacies as more than dispensaries and patrons as patients rather than customers. CPESN promotes practices such as MTM (medication therapy management), blood pressure screenings, and dosage adjustments at independent pharmacy sites. CPESN leadership coordinated the ACT (Academia-CPESN Transformation) Pharmacy Collaborative to connect schools of pharmacy to clinically integrated community pharmacies, understanding that the most effective way to change pharmacy practice is to start with education at the University level. \"The work and events of CPESN are important because they demonstrate that community pharmacists are capable of doing more than dispensing medications and, therefore, they must be allowed to provide clinical services, including MTM, to patients,\" said Pharmacy Practice department chair, Alireza Hayatshahi, PharmD, BCPS, APh. He added, \"The collaboration between pharmacists and physicians is very significant as it will positively impact patient care.\" Between November 1 and 16, several pharmacies throughout California hosted an ACT Day of Service in collaboration with a nearby school of pharmacy. LLUSP's service day was held on November 14 at the W aterman Pharmacy in San Bernardino and the pharmacy at Loma Linda University Health Faculty Medical Offices. APPE students and preceptors volunteered to participate and provided patient care and blood pressure screenings to 40 patients throughout the day. Pharmacy students from W estern University, Chapman University, University of California San Diego, and American University also participated in the event in their respective regions. Dean Michael D. Hogue was eager for LLUSP to be one of the first schools in the nation to join the effort. \"Community pharmacy is the cornerstone of our profession. It's critical that schools and colleges of pharmacy engage with community pharmacy to expand towards the future of professional practice in the same way we worked with hospitals in the last 30 years,\" he said. \"W e are pleased to have been a part of the ACT Collaborative and to participate in the Day of Service as a tangible way to demonstrate our commitment to community pharmacy practice.\" PY4 students Calvin Lee, Maret Geragosian and Chinaza at Waterman Pharmacy. By Briana Pastorino, BA Loma Linda University and Sahmyook University signed an affiliation agreement that will give pharmacy graduates from the South Korean school priority admission to Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy's doctoral program. The agreement is the first of its kind for the School of Pharmacy. Ron Carter, PhD, Loma Linda University provost; Michael Hogue, PharmD, dean of the School of Pharmacy; and Jae W ook Y ang, PharmD, PhD, the representing official of Sahmyook University, penned the agreement at a ceremony on Loma Linda University's campus on October 10. Dr. Hogue said he is passionate about global education. \"Our world is growing smaller and smaller, and students are looking increasingly for opportunities to engage globally,\" he said. Dr. Hogue said the agreement with Sahmyook University, a Seventh-day Adventist organization located in Seoul, South Korea, has three core objectives: Establish a summer exchange program that will initially take pharmacy students from Loma Linda University, giving them a unique perspective on global pharmacy education. A similar program will also bring Sahmyook students to Loma Linda University for an exchange. Allow graduates of Sahmyook's bachelor of science in pharmacy program to transfer to Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy with advanced standing beginning in 2021. Provide preferred admissions status to the doctor of pharmacy program for Sahmyook University students who have fulfilled the pre- pharmacy requirements of Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. Pharmacy students from Loma Linda University currently have the opportunity to receive clinical training at hospitals in Seoul affiliated with Sahmyook University and travel for a summer training intensive, with as many as 20 students expected to travel by the end of 2020. Y ang expressed his appreciation to Loma Linda University for its dedication to global education. \"It is my hope that many students will come to Loma Linda University and successfully complete the program,\" Y ang said. \"This is a first step in the future collaboration and partnership between Loma Linda University and Sahmyook.\" Loma Linda University and South Korea's Sahmyook University Sign Preferred Admission Agreement for Pharmacy Students From left, Drs.

For ease of access from Centennial Complex to the south side of campus, a bridge was constructed over Stewart Street. Another helpful walkway was built over Campus Street connecting the P2 Parking structure to the employee hospital entrance. Loma Linda Market - Nustart Juicery The Loma Linda Market's juice bar, Nustart Juicery, opened around seven years ago and gained great popularity among students and employees in the last three years when it added acai bowls to the menu. This smoothie and juice bar is located just inside the Loma Linda Market off Anderson Street. New LLUH Hospital In May 2016, Loma Linda University Health broke ground on a new LLUH Adult and Children's Hospital in order to meet California's stringent seismic building codes for health care facilities. The hospital has now been built to its full height at 267 feet tall, the tallest building in San Bernardino County. NEW AT LLU! By Michaela Collins, BS LLU Church Family Ministries Building After starting construction in March of 2018, Loma Linda University Church expects to complete this project in August of 2020. The building is designed for shared space in church ministries and classes on Sabbath as well as classroom space for the University during the week. It includes a large auditorium for worship, space for a commercial restaurant/caf\u00e9, and spectacular outdoor amphitheater for outdoor concerts and events. LoMelinda's Buzz & Bloom Located just off of University Avenue in Loma Linda is LoMelinda's Buzz & Bloom, a coffee and flower truck. Owner and COO Melinda Hebbel started this small business in October 2019 and not only serves great coffee and beautiful flower arrangements but has also served our community by facilitating coffee donations to essential employees during the COVID-19 shutdown. Signage Throughout the last year, new signage has popped up all over campus. The most noticeable have been large directional signs that direct traffic as well as display important announcements. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 11 OUTREACH LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 13SCHOOL NEWS 12 THE CAPSULENEW CONTINUING EDUCATION OFFICE DEDICATED TO SERVING PRECEPTORS Continuing Education Specialist Mogi Pompe, MA describes the purpose and goals of her new charge The Office of Continuing Education (OCE) originated earlier this academic year as part of the Department of Pharmacy Practice in order to support the continuing professional development of our pharmacist preceptors at both LLUH and external clinical rotation sites. W e are committed to fostering their growth at the highest level, not only as healthcare providers, but in particular, as valued educators who train and mentor our student pharmacists in real-world clinical settings. Since its inception, OCE has been working with individual practice sites to discuss their professional development and experiential training needs, introduce them to resources and opportunities that we offer, and strengthen relationships. OCE currently provides continuing education for full- time faculty and all preceptors through live and online ACPE and/or CAPE accredited courses. Preceptors also have the opportunity to present such courses, if they are interested. In addition, we are now offering online ACPE accredited Pharmacy T echnician CEUs for technicians who oversee students at various practice sites. W e emphasize the importance of interprofessional collaboration by working with the LLUH Center for Interprofessional Education and Practice (CIPEP) to host ACPE accredited continuing education events with multiple healthcare professions. Because we appreciate their service to our students, all continuing education is offered at no cost to preceptors. T o support the work of our preceptors, OCE also provides preceptor training and resources such as access to electronic databases, teaching materials and equipment for optimal experiential education experiences, and so on. W e strongly encourage our preceptors who qualify to apply for adjunct faculty appointments with LLUSP . OCE seeks to continue to grow and explore new ways to support the continuing professional development of our preceptors, and in turn, to nurture excellence in the training of our students as outstanding pharmacist practitioners and integral members of the healthcare team. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 13 The LLUSP student chapters of the American Pharmacist Association (APhA) and the National Community Pharmacy Association (NCPA) jointly hosted a Drug T ake-Back event during the annual senior health fair at the LLUH Drayson Center. Third-year students Jonathan Mamahit, chair of Generation Rx within APhA, and Lacey Oana, president of NCPA, worked with the Drayson Center and San Bernardino Sheriff 's Department to coordinate an event which served two purposes: 1) to bring light to seniors in the community about proper medication disposal, and 2) to offer a site to dispose of any discontinued or expired medications. The event also provided students a different kind of community service experience by collaborating with local public service officers. Due to scheduling conflicts, second- and third- year students were not able to participate in the drug take-back, but several first-year students embraced the opportunity to provide public awareness and safe medication disposal. Through the event, students learned that it is common for seniors to have several medications. Information about how and where to dispose of old/expired medications and which medications are safe to flush was also reinforced in students' minds. PY1 student Udee Joy Nwosu learned something important during her experience: \"The simple act of giving individuals a proper place to dispose of their drugs when they were finished with them brought joy to many of the participants. In pharmacy practice, we must remember that the little things we do for the public should not be overlooked because those are the things that can provide great assistance.\" By the end of the Drug T ake- Back event, two large containers of unneeded prescriptions were collected for the San Bernardino Sheriff 's Department to destroy. For Beth Nyakundi, PY1, volunteering at the Drug T ake-Back booth was informative and enriching, not just for the community but also for her as a pharmacy student. \"I enjoyed pleasant conversations with many people, especially the elderly. I noticed how diligent they were in their adherence to the proper guidelines of their medications. It just really showed me knowledge is power, and people are willing to listen and comply with regulations so long as there is an outlet and platform to inform the community.\"Student Organizations Host First-Ever Drug T ake-Back EventOUTREACH OUTREACH14 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 15 BLESSINGS FROM MY TRIP TO THE PHILIPPINES I had the privilege of traveling to Palawan, Philippines, with my professors and classmates during the summer of 2019. I wanted to go on this trip because I plan to pursue mission work after graduation, and I saw that a great group of professors would be going along, including Dr. Ike de la Pe\u00f1a, Dr. Lisa Hong, and Dr. Huyentran Tran. I was thrilled and nervous to go to a place I had never been and wanted to learn more about the different culture and how pharmacists work with patients in that country. When we first arrived in the Philippines, we were welcomed with open arms by the staff of the Adventist hospital in Palawan. Most of the people could speak English but mainly spoke their native T agalog. When we toured the hospital, we learned that pharmacists held bachelor's degrees and that their By Donna Chong, Class of 2021OUTREACH OUTREACH16 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 17main duty was to fulfill the order of the doctors. Pharmacists did not perform medication counseling nor look for any drug interactions. They were eager to learn more about how we practiced and informed us that they are trying to move towards becoming clinical pharmacists. Their site worked as both an inpatient and outpatient pharmacy where nurses came to the windows and retrieved medications for patients. They used some medications that are not available in the States, and some names for medications were different. My eyes were opened to how different work as a pharmacist can be in other parts of the world. Our team of students was scheduled to give nightly presentations at the church located in a high school amphitheater. I was assigned the topics of Malaria and Dengue Fever. From this experience, I learned how to speak when I have a translator as well as how to engage an audience by asking them questions. I also learned how to adjust a topic for a different culture. For example, the product they use for insect repellent had different application techniques and ingredients from those in America, so I had to make sure the information I presented was relevant. I wanted to be as accurate and detailed as possible, without providing unnecessary information that did not apply to the public. My favorite part of the mission was visiting elementary and middle schools to teach about healthy habits, dental hygiene, and hand washing. The students excitedly gathered in crowds around us. They asked many questions and giggled, trying to communicate in English. Each school visit was followed by a great feast that the teachers prepared for us in their classrooms. The food was amazing, and I was grateful for the time they spent preparing each dish for our team. For the teachers in the school, we offered blood pressure readings, blood glucose checkups and medication management. I observed that most people had blood sugars under control, but hypertension was common. Their diets included a lot of salted fish, and they added more salt to their dishes, which may have contributed to their high blood pressure. W e counseled on non-pharmacologic options, such as exercising and limiting salt intake. On our second Sunday there, we hosted a health fair offering free checkups, dental extractions, and circumcision. Because I knew that pharmacists in the Philippines do not give recommendations to doctors about medication, I was hesitant to talk to the doctors when we got a prescription for a patient. However, I soon worked up the courage to ask the doctors to change medications to a different class if we thought it would benefit the patient. For example, for patients over the age of 60, we were concerned about kidney function and suggested acetaminophen rather than ibuprofen and amlodipine over losartan. Many patients could not follow up with a doctor because of distance and transportation issues, so we had to keep that in mind with each person. I was pleased to have the opportunity to write prescriptions for patients in the dental clinic and calculate the doses for children. I was hesitant at first because I had never written a prescription, but I ended up My favorite part of the mission was visiting elementary and middle schools to teach about healthy habits, dental hygiene, and hand washing. looking it up on my Lexicomp app and confirming the correct doses with Dr. Hong. W e had a scale to measure weight for the children and were able to calculate weight-based dosing for those younger than 18. After a couple of prescriptions, I became more familiar with the medication doses. The trip was a blessing. I marveled at how the people of the Philippines were so polite and eager to learn. Also, I was able to hone my presentation skills and practice being a pharmacist by offering medication recommendations as well as writing prescriptions for patients. The field of pharmacy in the Philippines is developing, and I see potential in the future for pharmacists to play a bigger role in patients' lives. I hope to go back to the Philippines someday to see the children, eat the delicious food, and see how pharmacy has changed.My eyes were opened to how different work as a pharmacist can be in other parts of the world. OUTREACH OUTREACH18 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 19 By Brianna Calderon, Class of 2021 Last summer, I had the pleasure of being a part of Loma Linda University's mission trip to Peru. I immersed myself in its culture and environment by hiking Machu Picchu and surviving the extreme altitudes of Rainbow Mountain. One part of the Peruvian culture that made an impression on me was their common saying that things are \"just around the corner.\" During the second week of our trip, we were scheduled to install solar panels on the homes in the village of Hanansaya in Palccoyo. W e were told the installation would be up the mountain, past the school where we had set up a health clinic. It took about two hours of travel time because of the twisty roads of the mountain. It seemed like the homes were not \"just around the corner\" as we thought. When we finally arrived, we were introduced to the president of the village. W e were welcomed by the many individuals from the village who were eager to help us carry the solar panels to the right location. As we walked up more mountainous terrain, our group leaders would laugh and say, \"Don't worry; it's just around the corner!\" PERU, Where God Was Just Around the Corner During this mile-and-a-half walk, I was surprised at the villagers' positivity and eagerness to help us. The villagers had houses made of brick, dirt, and rocks with limited roofing material and needed the solar panels to provide light in their homes. When I surveyed the homes, I realized that it is important to appreciate everything we have, even if it's something as simple as power for light. After the installation, the president made a short speech thanking us for coming and helping the people of his village. His words were so powerful and inspiring! He told us he was grateful for our group and that even though his people felt forgotten by their own country, we helped them remember the power of human connection and compassion. W e received handmade gifts from the women of the village, said our goodbyes, and made our way down the mountain. I still think frequently about the influence we had on the villagers and how a little does go a long way. This experience will always hold a special place in my heart as I think of the presence of God surrounding us and the villagers. I felt at peace knowing that we made a difference for this community and that God was constantly with us during our time in Peru. I will never forget the important lesson from this trip: that even when we have to walk up mountains that may make us weary, God will always be \"just around the corner.\" As we walked up more mountainous terrain, our group leaders would laugh and say, \"Don't worry; it's just around the corner!\" OUTREACH OUTREACH 20 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 21It's difficult to find the right words to describe the impact and my emotions from my experience in Mozambique. I did not know what to expect, as this was my first international mission trip. It was wonderful, challenging, humbling, and life changing. Before arriving in Mozambique, our trip leaders told us to be adaptable. It was the best advice they could have given us. One week before arriving, our health fair site got changed to a new location. On the first day of the health fair, there were hundreds of people waiting, but the tents were not up. But this minor setback opened up another amazing opportunity: I was able to go into the local village, visit with families, and discuss their health with them. It was one of the highlights of my trip. These families live with no running water, and if they do have water, it is not clean. They have no roof and no electricity, but nonetheless, they were always smiling and so happy to see us. I was the only pharmacy student from Loma Linda, so I was very busy! I worked side by side with our primary care team, updating them with what medications we had and the ones we didn't have, giving them recommendations, and counseling patients on their medications. Counseling patients was a very interesting experience. The primary language in Mozambique MOZAMBIQUE By Alex Cannon, Class of 2021MISSION TO is Portuguese, but they also have a native language called Shangalla, which is spoken more by the elderly population. I do not know how to speak either language, but the Mozambican pharmacists taught me how to say \"T ome tres vezes ao dia, pela manha, tarde,e noite.\" Even though I said it with an American accent, the locals had a good laugh with me but still understood what I was trying to say. It was amazing! The best advice I can give to anyone contemplating whether or not to go on a mission trip is: just go! It's an experience everyone should have. It is important for us to get out of our comfort zones and see how other people live. I met amazing people from Mozambique, and even from Loma Linda. I have life long friends from the Loma Linda University schools of medicine, dentistry, and public health, as well as other pharmacy students and pharmacists from Mozambique. Y ou will come back humbled, you will have some incredible experiences, and you will enjoy so much fun (like a safari!). I can't wait to go back to Mozambique! Obrigado !The best advice I can say to anyone contemplating whether or not to go: just go! It's an experience everyone should have. STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS22 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 23 I remember sitting in the hotel room in Stockton, contemplating whether or not I should submit my application for an elected position as the American Pharmacists Association - Academy of Student Pharmacists (APhA-ASP) Regional Delegate. Fear was the only culprit of my hesitation. I took a deep breath, hit the \"send\" button, and off went my application to the inbox of the APhA-ASP President. Fast forward to today, I feel I could not be happier, sitting here, writing this article about the incredible journey I have had these past couple of years in Policy and Advocacy. How did God know exactly what my heart wanted, give me the courage to choose faith over fear, and guide me in the right direction every single time? Under the APhA-ASP , I served two terms as the 2018-2020 Chapter Policy Vice President and one term as the 2019-2020 Region 8 Regional Delegate, and I was recently appointed to serve on the 2020-2021 National Policy Standing Committee. All three leadership positions manage policies at the chapter, regional, and national level. Policy and Advocacy came into my world, unexpectedly, as I learned about provider status during my first year of pharmacy school. I began to read article after article about the successful advancement of pharmacy practice as well as current advancement issues that needed more support. The more I learned about the profession of pharmacy, the more I grew to love advocating for better patient care, helping the general public to recognize the value of our profession, and explaining to legislators our essential roles in The Road T o National Pharmacy Policy and Advocacy By Jenee Vo, Class of 2021 the health care team. I began to see that, even as a student, I could be involved in growing our profession. The Policy Standing Committee is a team of four student pharmacists, appointed by the National Executive Committee, to work closely with the ASP Speaker of the House and practitioners in the APhA Government Affairs Department. T ogether, we provide educational opportunities for student pharmacists from across the country regarding federal and state legislative priorities, regulatory updates, calls to action, and any policies across the nation that affect the ability of pharmacists to provide optimal patient care. Some of these issues include workflow, mental health, billing/fees, education, and practice advancement, to name a few. As I've connected with student pharmacists from everywhere in the country, I've been introduced to a group of colleagues with the same passion for pharmacy as I have, and this gives me a lot of hope for the future. One of my long-term goals is to build this passion for policy in future generations of pharmacists through awareness and education. It is imperative that our profession continues to grow alongside the constantly evolving health care system. I believe that passion can overcome obstacles. Instead of waiting passively, we can all work hard to provide advocacy efforts, strength, and momentum, for our profession to proceed in the right direction. There is still much work to be done, but the future of pharmacy is only as bright as the amount of work we put in to make it shine. Let's continue to work hard and with heart. I believe that passion can overcome obstacles. We can all work hard to provide advocacy efforts, strength, and momentum, for our profession to proceed in the right direction. STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS24 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 25Cross-Cultural Connections, Comprehensive Care, and Kampo: Finding Inspiration Abroad for Pharmacy Innovation The story of my pharmacy exchange began with an article not unlike the one written here. While studying in Shryock Hall one afternoon, I noticed a copy of the LLUSP's student publication, Rxperience, from a previous year lying on a table. I needed a break from studying, so I picked it up and flipped through it. Halfway through, a picture caught my eye. I didn't recognize the student, but the scenery in the background brought back memories from my days in undergrad studying abroad. I couldn't believe my eyes. \"Pharmacy students can study abroad? In Japan!? How do I sign up?\" Every year, the International Pharmacy Student Federation (IPSF) provides opportunities for over 900 students from around the world to experience their profession in a different country. Each country's Student Exchange Program (SEP) is managed by a student national pharmacy association, in our case the American Pharmacists Association - Academy of Student Pharmacists (APhA-ASP). Individual exchange sites are organized and led by local pharmacy students. Each site has unique programming, though most offer both experiences in pharmacy and opportunities to travel and learn about the country's culture. Aside from looking for an excuse to visit Japan again, there were several reasons I wanted to study pharmacy abroad. The first was that I wanted to get to know other pharmacy students from around the world. The SEP provides a unique opportunity to By Kirsten Vyhmeister, Class of 2021 not only get to know students from the country hosting the exchange, but also to meet students from other countries who are studying abroad as well. My SEP group in Nagoya, Japan was made up of five students-- one from Poland, one from Malaysia, one from T aiwan, and two (including me) from the US. While learning about pharmacy in Japan, we also discussed the differences between pharmacy practices, traditional medicines, and school in our home countries. My second reason for going was that I wanted to see firsthand the differences in pharmacy practice that stem from having a universal healthcare system. Japan's healthcare focuses heavily on preventative care, which impacts how pharmacists practice there. Community pharmacies are truly a part of the community; they hold monthly health and exercise classes, provide screenings for chronic conditions, and even do home visits for elderly and high-risk patients to check on their health and provide medication education. The focus on preventative medicine was most evident, though, at Nagoya City University Hospital. For an 800-bed hospital, they had a 10-bed emergency department. In comparison, our medical center here is roughly the same size but has at least five times as many emergency beds. Finally, I've been interested in learning more about herbal medicine ever since being prescribed an herbal cold remedy alongside antibiotics and antihistamines for an upper respiratory infection I got while studying abroad. During the exchange program, we had the opportunity to learn about Kampo , a derivative of Chinese medicine, and how it has been integrated with allopathic medicine in Japan. W e also attended a workshop on the principles of Chinese medicine and medicinal diets, which included an occasion to get in the kitchen and prepare a meal ourselves. Now more than ever, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of connecting and collaborating with pharmacy students and pharmacists around the world is clear. W e can learn a lot from our international peers who practice in different healthcare systems, different cultures, under different laws, and with different disease burdens.With the COVID-19 pandemic, the impor - tance of connecting and collaborating with pharmacy students and pharmacists around the world is clear. STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS FACULTY UPDATES During the summer of 2019, Nabhan Jankeel, LLUSP Class of 2021, completed a 10-week summer research fellowship with Dr. Kristopher Boyle, Associate Professor in the School of Pharmacy, and Dr. Marcelo V azquez, Associate Professor with the School of Medicine, Department of Radiation Medicine. Nabhan investigated the effects of combinations of proton radiation and chemotherapy upon glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, among the most dangerous forms of brain cancer. During his investigation, Nabhan discovered significant synergism between an experimental medication used to treat solid Pharmacy Student Explores Research and T reatment Options During Summer Fellowship tumors and proton radiation and quantified the lesser effects observed with chemotherapy agents currently used in the clinic for GBM. These studies are expected to result in a publication that will be submitted for review later this year. \"Nabhan is among the most talented and dedicated students I have ever had the pleasure to work with,\" said Dr. V azquez. \"His contribution to this project cannot be overstated.\" According to Dr. Boyle, faculty/student collaborations like these are a blessing and significantly enrich academic life at the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. Students are selected for the fellowship by submitting a competitive application with the support of a faculty mentor. The applications are then reviewed by a committee of faculty who choose the strongest candidates. Each year, only three or four students are accepted into the program. The summer research fellowship has existed for at least 10 years, and with outcomes like those of Nabhan's work, the school hopes to keep the program running for many, many more. Recent Graduate Lawrence Chui Earns LLUSP Dean's Award As a child, Lawrence Chui experienced an undiagnosed condition that forced him to be hospitalized every winter until the age of 10. But as a result, he developed an interest in and ambition to pursue an education in the healthcare field, and despite his circumstances, he exemplified determination and fortitude facing challenges that might have prevented him from reaching his goals. As a student at the University of California, San Diego, Chui pursued a Physiology and Neuroscience Bachelors of Science degree. During his years in undergraduate school, he studied abroad at the Chinese University of a reputation as a conscientious and diligent student. He also served as president of his class and role model to his peers. He is remarkably able to connect with those around him, demonstrating a calm demeanor that reflects thoughtfulness, confidence, and, above all, humility. This spring, Dr. Chui, Class of 2020, earned the LLUSP Dean's Award in recognition of his outstanding leadership and scholastic achievement. With a fully developed passion to serve as a community pharmacist, Dr. Chui looks forward to joining the workforce and providing optimal care to his future patients. Hong Kong and volunteered as a research assistant at the Prince of W ales Hospital. Upon returning, he obtained a position as a laboratory assistant at Pfizer where he assisted in researching novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors. While extremely satisfied with his position at Pfizer, his passion for service led him to join Phi Delta Epsilon Pre-Medical Fraternity where he participated in various charity fundraisers for the philanthropic organization Children's Miracle Network. After receiving his bachelor's degree, Chui worked for some time in e-commerce and developed his own business. Recognizing that his passion for healthcare had not yet been fulfilled, he decided to apply to and attend Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy and work as an intern pharmacist at Kaiser Permanente Fontana 24 Hour Pharmacy. Throughout his four years at the School of Pharmacy, Chui earned On October 19, 2019, the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists (CSHP) presented Caroline Sierra, PharmD, BCPPS with the 2019 New Practitioner Achievement Award during its annual meeting, held at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, CA. The award recognizes a new pharmacist who has already earned a reputation for excellence in pharmacy education, practice, and scholarly contributions. Dr. Sierra is not only an assistant professor at the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP), but also serves as PGY-1 Residency Coordinator and PGY-2 Pediatric Residency Director. Several of her research articles have been published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy and the Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics . In addition, Dr. Sierra helped to establish the Summer Research Fellowship Award for students at LLUSP . Her students and residents have expressed sincere appreciation for her teaching and support and have similarly commented on her passion for preparing them to be the best pharmacists of the future. Michael D. Hogue, PharmD, FAPhA, FNAP , Dean at LLUSP , is delighted to have an LLUSP professor recognized in such a way. \"Dr. LLUSP FACULTY MEMBER AWARDED HIGH HONOR AT SEMINAR At the start of 2020, Dean Michael Hogue announced that LLUSP's Department of Experiential and Continuing Education (DECE) would become an office under the Department of Pharmacy Practice (DPP). Furthermore, he appointed then Chair of the DECE Alireza Hayatshahi, PharmD, BCPS, APh as Chair of LLUSP's more encompassing DPP . The move makes sense as practice faculty deliver experiential education and clinical training to our students. By combining the departments of pharmacy practice and experiential education, faculty efforts and meetings are made more efficient. T o help with workload for Dr. Hayatshahi as he took on additional responsibilities, assistant professor Alireza Fakhriravari, PharmD, BCPS, AAHIVP was named Director of Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE). He will work alongside current Director of Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE), Farnoosh Zough, PharmD, BCPS. And as for the \"Continuing Education\" component of the former Department of Experiential and Continuing Education, it too became an office under the Department of Pharmacy Practice and is ramping up its efforts to provide quality continuing education sessions for pharmacy faculty and student preceptors.Departments Combine Under One Leader Sierra is an incredibly dedicated and diligent faculty member, and she certainly deserves this award. I am immensely proud of her, and I look forward to watching her career continue to flourish in the coming years.\" Outside of academia, Dr. Sierra has dedicated much of her time to volunteering at the local and state levels of CSHP . At her local chapter, the Inland Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ISHP), she served for three years as the New Practitioner Chair, and for three years has served as Continuing Education Chair. At ISHP , Dr. Sierra has organized several CE events, presentations, mixers and a forum for students and members. At the state level, she has served on CSHP's New Practitioner Executive Committee and continues to serve on CSHP's Editorial Advisory Board. \"I am humbled and honored to receive this award,\" said Dr. Sierra. \"Thank you to my family, friends, colleagues, and students who provide me with encouragement and support. Thank you also to CSHP - this organization is filled with committed and dedicated volunteers, and I am grateful for the opportunity to continue to serve this organization.\" LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 27 26 THE CAPSULEFACULTY UPDATES FACULTY UPDATES28 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 29 FACULTY OF THE YEAR/ MAN OF MODESTY DR. KHALED BAHJRI In the fall of 1999, Khaled Bahjri, MD, MPH, DrPH arrived as a student at the Loma Linda University (LLU) School of Public Health. Now, over 20 years later, he is named Faculty of the Y ear at LLU School of Pharmacy. During an interview with Dr. Bahjri, it became increasingly obvious that his remarkable journey to the U.S., to LLU, and to the teaching profession has been blessed. Let's start at the very beginning, Dr. Bahjri. Where are you from and how did you end up here? I was born in Ethiopia, but my family originates from Y emen. Out of our entire village clan\u2014and we have a huge family\u2014 my dad had the most education: high school. He emphasized that his children needed to pursue education, and he was willing to make great sacrifices to make it happen. So, he applied for us to attend schools in the United States. (Y ou know, the U.S. is THE destination for education.) It turned out that the cheapest place was Lincoln Memorial University in T ennessee. My dad had no idea where that was, but to him, anywhere in the U.S. would be great, so that's where he sent my brother and me. Unfortunately, he didn't realize that the U.S. education system is different from the British system, so my dad thought he was sending me to medical school. It was a surprise when I learned I had to earn an undergraduate degree before I could attend medical school. From Lincoln Memorial, By Jen Mathew, MAFACULTY UPDATES30 THE CAPSULEFACULTY UPDATES I transferred to the University of T ennessee, Knoxville, where I earned my pre-med biology degree. So, you intended to become a doctor? Y es, that was my plan for a long time. After undergrad, I applied to medical schools all over the U.S. and abroad. Back in the 1990s, I could get my medical degree in the Philippines for only $10,000, and they used the same textbooks as they did in the U.S. I don't like loans. In fact, I've never taken out a loan. So, for me, it was an obvious choice! The problem came when I needed to find a residency back in the States. One of my advisors suggested I return to the U.S. to get a Masters degree in Public Health and take my medical boards, which would give me time to find a residency program and then get back to medicine. Then would you say you accidentally became a teacher? What does Kung Fu Panda say? \"There are no accidents.\" I believe it was meant to be. Even when I was younger, I used to help my cousins with math, and I've always loved teaching. I think everything fell into the right places. I applied to schools all over the U.S. offering a masters in public health. The first program to respond was LLU, and I jumped on it. Again, my whole plan was to get this degree as quickly as possible and then return to medicine, but then things started taking me in a different direction. How did you start teaching? In my first quarter of the program, I performed well in the epidemiology course, and my professor, Dr. Knutsen, asked if I could tutor students in the course during the winter quarter. That's really when I started this teaching endeavor! Then, I guess I got relatively good reviews as a tutor, so when Dr. Knutsen decided to move to Norway in the spring, she asked me to teach the epidemiology course. When the School needed help with their Health Research Consulting group, I started working there, too. Then, in 2001, when I graduated with my Masters in Public Health, the school gave me an offer that led to long-term teaching responsibilities. The school said, \"Khaled, you've been doing well in epidemiology. What if we pay for you to get your DrPH?\" This was too good an offer! I loved teaching and I loved LLU, and then to have them offer to pay for my degree here and get my doctorate without going into debt?!?! It was almost too good to be true! That's when I switched paths from medicine to epidemiology. Do you have regrets about that? Not at all. It was meant to be that I would end up teaching epidemiology. It feels natural to me. I love teaching; when I'm teaching, I feel like I'm transported to another world. When did you begin teaching at the School of Pharmacy? I left the LLU School of Public Health to work as a biostatistician at New W ork Medical, Inc., a medical devices company for glaucoma in Rancho Cucamonga. But after working there one year, I realized I wanted to go back to academia. I was delighted to join LLUSP in March of 2018 to teach Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Pharmaceutical calculations. I'm so glad to know that although you are from another country and belong to another religion, you love being in Loma Linda. I've always been very happy and comfortable here. Now I've lived here longer than anywhere else, longer than I lived in Ethiopia! My wife and I started our lives together here, and this is where we've raised our four children. I play on a soccer league here at the University. I'm very involved in my mosque nearby. For us, Loma Linda is home, and it's my honor to be a part of the LLUSP family.I love teaching; when I'm teaching, I feel like I'm transported to another world.FACULTY UPDATES KYLE M.

LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 31FACULTY UPDATES FACULTY UPDATES32 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 33 In early January, Dr. Ike de la Pe\u00f1a received exciting news! His research proposal would be one of 16 in the entire nation to receive funding by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) New Investigator Award (NIA) in the year 2020. The NIA provides research start-up funding ($10,000) for the independent research programs of early-career pharmacy faculty. Dr. de la Pe\u00f1a is the first LLU School of Pharmacy investigator to win one of the highly contested awards. Dr. de la Pe\u00f1a's research, \"Novel Combination Therapy for Obesity-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction,\" began in March and is focused on what is considered \"the epidemic of the 21st century.\" Obesity leads to risk of not only diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, but also dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. Notably, obesity diminishes cognitive function throughout life, even in the absence of metabolic syndrome or diabetes. However, studies that examine the mental effects of obesity are very few in number. In addition, there are currently no treatments that directly assess obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction. Dr. de la Pe\u00f1a's project addresses the scarcity of studies on the mechanisms of and treatments for obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction. Ultimately, the purpose of his study is to introduce a new drug formulation that will not only produce enhanced weight loss, but also improve cognitive dysfunction in obese patients. In his research, he uses behavioral studies and anthropometric tools to measure the effects of a combined treatment to improve obesity-induced cognitive and metabolic outcomes in obese rats. Using electrophysiological recordings (a tool to measure electrical activity of brain cells), he hopes to determine the mechanism of action of the combination treatment. Preliminary data obtained from the study will be used to secure larger funding for his project in the future. The study is scheduled to last one year. W orking with Dr. de la Pe\u00f1a are several other researchers and assistants. Dr. Johnny Figueroa, Assistant Professor at the LLU School of Medicine, will help with creating the obesity animal model and conducting the behavioral studies. (Last year, he and de la Pe\u00f1a received LLU's Grants Research and Schools Partnerships AND THE RESEARCH AWARD GOES TO... By Jen Mathew, MA (GRASP) award for their study aimed at exploring the efficacy of pharmacological interventions to enhance cognitive resilience in obese animals.) Additionally, Dr. W ei Xing Shi, Professor at LLUSP , will serve as advisor for the study, and Erben Bayeta and Sara Solak, research associates in LLUSP's Department of Pharmaceutical and Administrative Sciences, will also help with conducting the study. The prospective findings of the study will be presented at the 2021 AACP Annual Meeting in Toronto, Canada. If successful, Dr. de la Pe\u00f1a's research will lead to the discovery of a popular, sought-after practical medication for long-term weight management. Restoring altered cognitive function in obese individuals could strengthen their dietary self-regulatory abilities and empower them to make better food and lifestyle choices. If successful, Dr. de la Pe\u00f1a's research will lead to the discovery of a popular, sought- after practical medication for long-term weight management.

How is it that so many of our alums have had the opportunity to work together, and how have they helped to grow the company? When Gerard Rivera, PharmD, speaks, he smiles in a way that is both cool and warm\u2014cool because he is confident and assured of himself and his place in life; warm because he immediately makes you feel at ease and glad to be in his company. Dr. Rivera, an alum of the LLUSP Class of 2011, is CEO of Pacific Pharmacy Group (PPG), and you immediately sense his passion for his work and the enterprise he leads. His enthusiasm for PPG and its independent pharmacies is probably what made him CEO. He didn't start at the top, but he raced up the ladder. It all began with a networking event. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP) invited its alumni to a gathering at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Los Angeles. It was there that Dr. Rivera was reunited with Sonal Patel, PharmD, Class of 2010. As they talked, she described her work at PPG, a company founded in 2007 when investors purchased a handful of pharmacies around Orange County and the Santa Clarita V alley. Each of the independent pharmacies had a long history in its community, and PPG hoped to preserve the valuable services they provided. As he heard more about the firm and learned there was an opening at one of its pharmacies, Dr. Rivera became 36 THE CAPSULEALUMNI NEWSALUMNI NEWS38 THE CAPSULEALUMNI NEWS increasingly interested. Though he worked at the time for CVS, he had always wanted to be a business owner. At the end of their conversation, Dr. Patel encouraged him to call the company and handed him a small piece of paper on which she had written a phone number. It turned out to be the number of the company's CEO. Rivera interviewed with him that same week. \"It was love at first sight,\" Rivera recalls, laughing. \"He became my mentor, and he is still a great friend.\" In 2012, Dr. Rivera began working at PPG's Newport Beach location as a pharmacist-in-charge (PIC). He admits he planned to stay at PPG only long enough to gain experience and then open his own independent pharmacy. But he soon realized he was hearing a different calling as he could serve patients in a bigger way if he stayed with the group. Within a year-and-a-half, he became Director of Pharmacy for the company. In this role, Dr. Rivera grew the company so rapidly that when the CEO decided to retire in 2017, he threw his full support behind naming Rivera his successor. \"It's been a wonderful ride!\" says Rivera. \"But it's also a lot of responsibility, and I take it very seriously.\" According to Rivera, a primary reason for PPG's success is its commitment to patients. He insists that patients are at the center of everything the company does, every decision it makes. PPG's leadership is passionate about helping patients and is constantly evaluating how the patient experience can be improved. Another very significant factor in the company's growth is its people. While Rivera was working his way up, he never forgot his friends and colleagues along the way. Because he started on the front lines as a staff pharmacist and advanced his career from there, he formed relationships with people in various roles in the company and considers all of them his dear friends. In fact, many of PPG's pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were recruited by him. Some he brought from his previous employer. Others, he remembered from his time in pharmacy school. One of his fellow LLUSP alumni coworkers is Stephen Hom, PharmD, Class of 2013. Rivera and Hom were not classmates but got to know each other through mutual friends from pharmacy school. Several years later, when Rivera was looking for help during PPG's rapid development, he asked for recommendations from Dr. Naomi Florea, a former professor at LLUSP with whom he remains close friends. She suggested he reach out to Hom. Rivera was doubtful Dr. Hom would join PPG because he had completed a residency and was working at Kaiser Permanente in San Diego; but knowing how well they would work together, Dr. Hom accepted the offer and is now the Director of Pharmacy for the company. Subsequently, nine other LLUSP alumni were hired to work in different positions and for varying lengths of time at PPG pharmacies. Currently, PPG employs four other LLUSP alumni in addition to Drs. Rivera and Hom. Jefmar Dickey, PharmD, BCACP , CDE, Class Director of Pharmacy; Lisa Pham, PharmD, MPH, Class of 2015, is a per diem staff pharmacist; Jason Y ang, PharmD, Class of 2017, is Pharmacist-in-Charge at PPG's V alencia Pharmacy at Henry Mayo Clinic; and Stephen Choi, PharmD, Class of 2017, is Pharmacist-in- Charge at V alencia Long T erm Care Pharmacy. Rivera and Hom didn't attend pharmacy school at the same time as several of their other LLUSP alumni colleagues, so how did the two of them know the others would be a good fit? Rivera explains, \"Our company's biggest affiliation with LLUSP is through education.\" Indeed, PPG is committed to giving back to the profession of pharmacy by providing quality educational experiences through student rotations and residency programs. It provides both IPPE and APPE rotations to pharmacy students. (In fact, based on students' positive feedback and evaluations, Dr. Hom earned the LLUSP Alumni Preceptor of the Y ear award in 2019.) Also, PPG offers PGY1 and PGY2 community pharmacy practice residencies. Recently, Dr. Rivera worked with Dr. Michael D. Hogue, Dean of LLU's School of Pharmacy, to secure a LLU-PPG PGY-1 Community Pharmacy Residency Program, for which Devin Cohen, LLUSP Class of 2020, was selected to start in July of this year. While students are on rotation or recent grads are in residency, oftentimes Rivera and Hom receive feedback from their preceptors and PICs. As they watch students and residents develop, they find some who go above and beyond, the real go-getters. These observations can then turn into hiring opportunities. But he also feels a very real sense of duty to his alma mater. \"I have a special place in my heart for Loma Linda, so it's natural for me to want to take care of my family. I'm like a papa bear watching out for my cubs.\" Hand-picking employees through employment and school affiliations has worked very well for Rivera and PPG. \"My work culture needs to be happy in order for me to be effective,\" Rivera reflects. \"W e've been able to recruit some of the brightest minds and people with good work ethics, and it's created a happy work setting, which has allowed us to excel.\" W orking with LLUSP alumni has some big advantages. Shared past experiences lead to comfortable relationships between colleagues, common ground, and inside jokes. While they get a great deal of work done, Rivera says they also have a lot of fun. They still use Dr. T afreshi's expressions and reminisce about peeking at notes for exams during chapel and good times spent in the student lounge. \"Because we feel so comfortable with each other, we feel we can spread our wings and maximize potential.\" \"Because we feel so comfortable with each other, we feel we can spread our wings and maximize potential. \"ALUMNI NEWS ALUMNI NEWS40 THE CAPSULE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 41During the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP) Homecoming Dinner in March 2019, Dr. Michael Hogue, Dean of the school, offered to visit the practice sites of any alumni who invited him. Several alums reached out, asking him to see the work they do. Thus began his tour of several pharmacies around Southern California over the next year.DEAN HOGUE'S TOUR DE SO CAL By Jen Mathew, MA 1Before leaving the Homecoming Dinner, Walanika Lum, PharmD, RPh, RN (Class of 2008) approached the dean to invite him to her practice site, Kaiser Permanente's Orange County Home Infusion Pharmacy. Dr. Hogue was very pleased to tour the facility and discuss the work of Dr. Lum, an Inpatient Pharmacy Specialist. 2Next, Dr. Hogue and Director of Alumni Affairs Jen Mathew visited Walter Wong, PharmD, APh (Class of 2010) and his wife Sylvia W ong, CPA, at Green V alley Pharmacy in Y ucaipa. Both LLUSP administrators were impressed by Dr. W ong's enthusiasm for the profession of pharmacy and helping his patients. 3Alumnae Noela Ndrekaj, PharmD (Class of 2009) and Ariana (Waworuntu) Choe, PharmD (Class of 2015) invited the dean to the Loma Linda Children's Hospital Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Clinic in San Bernardino. The work they do to bring healing to young patients and their families is amazing and touching. 4Shortly thereafter, Dean Hogue toured the impressive practice site of Greg Harrington, PharmD (Class of 2009) , Pharmacy Manager at CVS Specialty in Redlands. So big is its network that pharmacists at CVS Specialty hold licenses in multiple states to support their lines of business with states that require in-state licensing for Pharmacists-In-Charge. 1 2 3 45Just a stone's throw from Shyrock Hall is the Loma Linda University Health Community Pharmacy where Lisa Pham, PharmD, MPH (Class of 2015) practices as a Clinical Outpatient Pharmacist. Dr. Pham is involved with discharge pharmacy services and assists in the coordination of the Meds-to-Beds program. She also collaborates with the Managed Care Department and ambulatory care team to help with medication reconciliation and quality adherence measures. 6It just so happens that Dr. Pham also works a few shifts at the next stop on Dr. Hogue's tour. The dean met LLUSP alums Stephen Hom, PharmD (Class of 2013), and Gerard Rivera, PharmD (Class of 2011) at the Newport Lido location of Pacific Pharmacy Group, where Dr. Hom serves as Director of Pharmacy, and Dr. Rivera is CEO of the company. The three men hit it off as they spoke of innovations and dreams for the future of pharmacy. 7The dean's next visit was to the Emergency Department of Loma Linda University Medical Center where he met Scott Fitter, PharmD, BCCCP (Class of 2015) . Dr. Fitter described the work he does there as a clinical pharmacist specializing in emergency medicine. Much respect, Dr. Fitter! Dr. Hogue would love to visit more alumni practice sites in the future! If you are interested in meeting the dean and showing him how you practice pharmacy, please contact Director of Alumni Affairs Jen Mathew (jmathew@llu.edu ) to schedule a visit.8Dr. Suha Kilani, PharmD, MBA (Class of 2008) was the last to host a visit from the dean. Her practice site, Riverside Community Hospital, has seen tremendous growth recently. As Pharmacy Operations Manager, Dr. Kilani is making sure the pharmacy keeps up.Dr. Kilani's practice site, Riverside Community Hospital, has seen tremendous growth recently.

ALUMNI BABIES Rena Sackett (LLUSP Class of 2019) Selected for Esteemed Fellowship In March, the American Society of Health- System Pharmacists (ASHP) announced its 2020-2021 selections for the organization's Executive Fellowship in Association Leadership and Management. One of only two people asked to join the program was LLUSP alum Rena Sackett, PharmD, Class of 2019. After completing her PGY1 pharmacy residency at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) W estern Psychiatric Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Dr. Sackett moved to W ashington D.C. to join ASHP's elite, yearlong program, which began in July. \"I couldn't be more excited for this unique opportunity,\" says Sackett. \"I look forward to growing as a new practitioner by advocating for pharmacy practice advancement at the national level.\" According to ASHP CEO Dr. Paul W . Abramowitz, Dr. Sackett and her fellowship colleague were selected for their \"strong involvement as volunteer leaders and passion for serving members and advancing pharmacy practice.\" In fact, for the past few years, Dr. Sackett has been heavily involved with ASHP and its state-level associations. As a student at LLUSP , she completed an elective rotation with ASHP in national association management and served as a delegate for the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists (CSHP). Most recently, Dr. Sackett volunteered on the Membership Committee of the W estern Chapter of Pennsylvania Society of Health-System Pharmacists (PSHP). ASHP's Executive Fellowship in Association Leadership and Management was created in 1968 with the goal of preparing graduates to serve in leadership roles in associations and corporations, government, academia, and philanthropy. During her time as a fellow in the program, Dr. Sackett will receive training and experience under the guidance of ASHP administrators in non-profit organization leadership and management, including executive leadership, strategic planning, policy development, financial management, government relations, marketing and communications, member engagement, and other essential management functions. Remember when... Loma Linda University's School of Pharmacy was first housed in West Hall, along with the School of Nursing. And for at least a few years, the Office of Student Affairs hosted an annual Hawai- ian Luau, (sans the roasted pig, of course!). Students like Jenny Chun, Connie Elejalde, Eileen Lee, and Joon Lee (Class of 2012) donned leis and loaded up with foods to last them through the winter. The school moved to Shryock Hall in the fall of 2012, and we haven't had a luau since. But one thing hasn't changed\u2014we still love to eat and will look for any occasion to do so! ALUMNI NEWS44 THE CAPSULEALUMNI NEWS 45 Facing burnout at work, Andrew W aite, PharmD, RPh (LLUSP Class of 2014) decided it was time for a change. One of his brothers had recently retired from 24 years of active duty in the United States Air Force and after considering all he had accomplished, Dr. W aite began wondering what he could do as a pharmacist in the military. After looking further into the prospect and realizing it CATCHING UP WITH Andrew Waite By Jen Mathew, MA offered better job security and career advancement opportunities as well as student loan repayment assistance, Dr. W aite enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 2019. Because he joined the military having already earned his Doctorate of Pharmacy, he attained the rank of Captain upon commission. He was required to attend a four-week basic training course at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for direct commissioned officers. This course served as an introduction to the Army, soldier tasks, marching, and more. Thereafter, Dr. W aite progressed to a 10-week BOLC (Basic Officer Leadership Course) at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, T exas, which included, among other things, survival skills related to both healthcare and combat. At the end of training, Dr. W aite was joined by his family for his graduation from training at a ceremony very much like any other commencement, except that Army officers were dressed in formal uniforms and his entire \"class\" recited the Soldier's Creed and sang the Army Song. Dr. W aite is currently stationed at the Army Medical Center in Fort Gordon, Georgia. As a pharmacy officer, he manages the outpatient pharmacy and supervises civilian staff and enlisted soldiers who are technicians. Occasionally, he works as a staff pharmacist when the site is extremely busy or is short on staff. Most days, however, his work is of a more administrative nature. Every day, the job is rewarding, and Dr. W aite is certain his choice to serve as an army pharmacist was the right one. \"It gives me so many more prospects for increasing rank and branching out and even having a command of my own,\" says W aite. \"W e have the option to choose where we'd like to serve with the caveat that the area(s) on our wishlist must have openings to fill. In my case, I didn't get anything on my wishlist but was given a list of areas that had availability. Also, you have the ability to move every three years or so to a new duty station if you choose to remain active duty. So you're always on the move and always have the ability to grow and succeed.\" Ultimately, W aite's goal is to increase Every day, the job is rewarding, and Dr. Waite is certain his choice to serve as an army pharmacist was the right one. his expertise as a pharmacist and eventually retire from the Army. During his time as a student at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy, Dr. W aite took advantage of organization membership and leadership opportunities. He now believes those choices helped to prepare him for becoming an Army pharmacist where he can serve the nation in his own, unique way.
