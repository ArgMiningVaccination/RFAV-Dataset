Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) And Fertility The [American Psychology Association](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral) defines CBT as a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, and other severe mental illnesses. Mind-body therapies such as CBT are based on the premise that the way people think about their experiences and emotions affects their feelings and behaviors. It is no secret that infertility can have a significant impact on a person's mental health and well-being. The stress and anxiety associated with infertility can cause depression, low self-esteem, and a sense of isolation. This type of therapy can help individuals cope with the emotional and psychological challenges of infertility by identifying negative or irrational thoughts and beliefs and replacing them with more positive and constructive ones. Acupuncture And Fertility Acupuncture is among one of the oldest mind-body therapies, starting over 3,000 years ago in ancient China.
