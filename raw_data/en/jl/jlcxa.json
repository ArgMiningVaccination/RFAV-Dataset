This information is the basis of further pathogen discovery targets, viral disease surveillance strategies, and future vaccine development. | | Viral Genetics and Emerging Diseases Using advanced bioinformatics and epidemiologic information from viral epidemics and outbreaks, VDB provides early warning of emerging threats that may impact force readiness. VDB scientists investigate viral evolution and scan for mutations that may affect pathogen transmission, disease severity, and the efficacy of both new and licensed vaccines. | | Immunology for Vaccine Development VDB's immunology effort serves as a platform to measure cell-mediated immune responses and other biomarkers of the physiological response to pathogens to identify vaccine candidates and characterize their effectiveness.
