Our program is crafted to optimize a couple's ability to conceive through acupuncture, herbal medicine, vitamins and supplements, nutrition, and lifestyle. Developed by Blue Ova Clinical Director Robin Sheared through over 15 years of research and treating clients, the program supports both those looking to conceive and carry naturally, as well as those seeking to complement their current medical fertility treatments. Our program has been crafted to be implemented with a combination of virtual consults + in-person acupuncture, herbs, and supplements, and at-home lab draw kits. Why 4 Months? The Blue Ova Fertility Prep program is constructed around the four-month period that it takes for an egg to mature. During that time our program focuses on creating healthy follicles and better egg quality; balancing hormones and regulating your menstrual cycle, and get your body as a whole in the best condition for conception to occur. WHO IS THE IDEAL CLIENT FOR THIS PROGAM? This method was designed for both people just starting to prepare to conceive all the way through to those who have been trying to conceive for years. It is structured for both those trying to conceive naturally or with reproductive assistance including IUI and IVF (egg retrievals, embryo transfers). If you become pregnant during the 4 months, the program works to support and carry during the first trimester and onwards. Core facets of the 4 Month Fertility Prep Program: Testimonial I'm forever grateful to Robin and the incredible team at Blue Ova. In 2016 I arrived, pretty distraught and hopeless after 2 back to back miscarriages. Robin took an extensive thoughtful medical history and offered a lot of genuine compassion and support along the way. She's an amazing listener. She not only provided supplemental advice and gentle acupuncture treatments, but helped teach me how to be an advocate for myself in the OB/Gyn realm. I asked for certain blood tests, learned how to track my cycle, and in turn was able to provide Robin with helpful data so we were able to work together to proactively help my body be more likely to be able to support another life. This was incredibly life changing and empowering as I was previously told by my medical Dr. there was nothing I could do but wait until I had 3 successive miscarriages, and then fertility treatments could begin.... Two months later I was pregnant. - Heather "}
