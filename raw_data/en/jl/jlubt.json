Collier, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Editor, U NDERGRADUATE BULLETIN The University at Albany, State University of New York, is the senior campus of the SUNY system. One of SUNY's four university centers, UAlbany offers undergraduate and graduate education in a broad range of academic fields at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree levels. Three traditional responsibilities guide UAlbany: teaching, research, and service. Instructional excellence is assured through the quality of the faculty and a design of academic programs that affords students the greatest opportunity for intellectual growth. A challenging curriculum al so provides students with thorough training for meeting career objectives. Students are encouraged to challenge themselves, to explore the world about them, and then to accept the responsibility that comes with scholarship and freedom. An active research program reflects aware-ness of the responsibility of contributing to the expansion of knowledge and understanding, and to enhancing the economic vitality of the state and region. The University assists and encour-ages undergraduate students as well as faculty to participate in scholarly and creative research and to make their results widely available. UAlbany enjoys a Carnegie Research Extensive University rating. Last year, the campus received approximately $193 million in external funding through its Research Foundation and Health Research, Inc. The University also understands its special role as an intellectual, economic and cultural resource for the region. Faculty and student scholars are encouraged to share their intellectual expertise as speakers and consultants, and the University regularly invites the community to use its resources and facilities, and to attend the many seminars, exhibits and events that fill the UAlbany calendar. To meet each of these responsibilities, UAlbany maintains a wholehearted commitment to excellence. The University is ranked 17th in research and scholarship among the nation's top public universities. (Source: The Rise of American Research Universities .)

University at Albany 2 Description: The University at Albany, the largest of 15 colleges in the Capital Region, enrolls approximately 17,000 students, including more than 5,200 graduate students. More than two-thirds of the University's undergraduate students pursue post-baccalaureate study. The University now awards more than 150 doctorates a year in disciplines in the arts and sciences and professions. Nationally and internationally renowned scholars are among the more than 920 faculty members who are committed to maintaining the high academic standards which have characterized Albany since its founding in 1844. A large number of our faculty have earned the rank of Distinguished Professor, the highest academic honor for a faculty member in the State University of New York System. Additionally, many of the academic departments have gained national prominence. Finally, many of the faculty are integrally involved in meaningful community service efforts in the Capital Region and throughout the state. Accreditation: The University is chartered by the Board of Regents of New York State, which has registered all of its degrees and programs and fully approved its professional programs through the State Education Department. Albany is also a member of the Council of Graduate Schools in the United States. It is fully accredited by: The Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools American Psychological Association Council on Rehabilitation Education The Council on Social Work Education The American Chemical Society The American Library Association The American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business The American Board on Counseling Services, Inc. Its graduates are recognized by the American Association of University Women. Organization: The University enrolls students in nine degree-granting schools and colleges. The College Arts and Sciences, the College of Computing and Information, the Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy, and the Schools of Business, Criminal Justice, Education, and Social Welfare offer undergraduate and graduate programs. The School of Public Health offers graduate programs only. Several opportunities exist for joint degrees between schools and with other graduate programs. In 2004 Albany established its new College of Nanoscale Sciences and Engineering, which began offering graduate degree programs in Fall 2004. The Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Office of the Vice President for Research jointly work with the academic units in curricular and research areas. On the undergraduate level, the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for the coordination of the academic experience of undergraduate students and works closely with the deans and faculty of the individual schools and colleges in developing, coordinating, and implementing undergraduate academic policy and curricula. Nondegree study at the undergraduate level is coordinated by the Office of General Studies. The Campus: The Uptown Campus, de- signed by noted architect Edward Durell Stone and completed in the mid 1960s, is located on the western side of the city. The setting is highlighted by the \"Academic Podium:\" 13 academic buildings on a com-mon platform, all connected by a continuous roof and a lower-level corridor. In recent years, an aggressive program of new construction has expanded the Uptown Campus. An additional library and new buildings for environmental science and technology management, the life sciences, and sculpture, as well as residence halls have recently been completed or are under construction. Several schools and departments are located on the Downtown Campus, a classic Georgian-style complex, recently renovated, that served from 1909-66 as the main campus. In 1996, Albany expanded to Rensselaer County with the opening of the 58-acre East Campus. It is home to the School of Public Health, the Center for Comparative Functional Genomics, and a burgeoning business incubator program. In addition to the Uptown Campus's classrooms and laboratories, there are two University Libraries and the Performing Arts Center \u2014 boasting several theatres, recital halls, and rehearsal instructional space. The Fine Arts Building houses one of the finest museums in the Northeast. The new sculpture building opened in 2002. Five residence quadrangles on the Uptown Campus, each housing approximately 1,200 students, include eight three-story halls and a 23-story tower. Each quadrangle has lounges, recreation areas, and dining facilities. Nearby Freedom Quadrangle has apartment-style living, and Empire Commons provides single-room apartment-style living for 1,200 students. Housing is also available on Alumni Quadrangle, located near the Downtown Campus. Other special facilities on the campus include a National Weather Service meteorological laboratory, a Computing Center, and a linear accelerator for physics research. The hub of student activity is the Campus Center and its new extension, opened in September 1994. It includes lounges, meeting and dining rooms, a ballroom, a cafeteria, a barbershop, banking facilities, a convenience store, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, a computer store, and a variety of fast-food eateries. Outdoor recreation facilities include 24 tennis courts (12 with lights), 4 basketball and 6 volleyball courts, an all-weather running track, and several multipurpose playing areas. Indoor athletic facilities are dominated the Recreation and Convocation Center (RACC). With an arena seating capacity of nearly 4,800, the facility is home to NCAA Division I Great Dane basketball, and also houses a running track, a modern fitness center, a fully equipped athletic training complex with whirlpools and other rehabilitative equipment, four handball/ racquetball courts, four squash courts, two main locker rooms, and ten smaller team locker rooms. All facilities are handicapped accessible and have designated seating areas for handicapped spectators. In the Physical Education Center are a pool, locker rooms, and several basketball, handball and squash courts. Libraries: The University maintains three libraries. Two located on the Uptown Campus, the University Library and the New Library Building, and on the Downtown Campus, the Dewey Graduate Library.

A university is above all a place where intellectual life is central and where faculty, staff, and students strive together for excellence in the pursuit of knowledge. It is a particular kind of community with special purposes. Moreover, this academic community, if it is to support our broader ideals, must also be just. \"There is no definitive theory of justice. The differences in these theories are to be respected. However, among all democratic theories of justice, the principles of equality and liberty are basic. These principles are no less central to a free university. \"In a just community, the dignity of the individual and respect for diversity are fundamental. Members of a just community are committed to raising awareness of common ground and to the principles of respect, integrity, innovation, openness, justice and responsibility. \"Equality is a necessary part of any univer-sity that claims to be a democratic institution. Distinctions based on irrelevant differences are ruled out. Ascriptive characteristics including but not limited to race, religion, gender, class, disability, ethnic background, sexual orientation, age or disability determine neither the value of individuals nor the legitimacy of their views. Only the merit of the individual as a participant in the life of the academic community is worthy of consideration. Bigotry in any form is antithetical to the University's ideals on intellectual political, and moral grounds and must be challenged and rejected. \"Liberty is an equally precious academic principle because the free expression of ideas is the central part of university life. To sustain the advancement and dissemination of knowledge and understanding, the University must allow the free expression of ideas, no matter how outrageous. Protecting speech in all its forms, however, does not mean condoning all ideas or actions. The University sets high standards for itself and denounces the violation of these standards in unequivocal terms. Harassment and other behavior that intrudes upon the rights of others are unacceptable and subject to action under the guidelines of the institution. \"There is no guarantee that the principles of justice, once stated, are realized. The University must constantly remind itself that its mission and ethos must evolve within the context of justice. A just community is always on guard against injustice, always struggling to move closer to the ideals of justice, always asserting its dedication to justice. The assertion of justice takes place in every part of the community: in the classroom, the lecture hall, the library, the residence hall, wherever members of the University come together. It is the responsibility of all faculty, staff and students to keep the ideals of justice uppermost in the minds of the members of the University so that they may be achieved.\" (Approved 1990; revised April 3, 2001 - University Senate) KEY DATES 1844 Founded as the New York State Normal School 1909 Downtown campus opened 1935 First residence halls opened, Pierce and Sayles 1962 Designated SUNY University Center 1967 Uptown campus opened 1976 Renamed University at Albany 1983 NYS Writers Institute established 1992 Recreation and Convocation Center opened 1996 University Foundation acquires new East Campus for School of Public Health, biotechnology and high-tech start-up businesses For more information concerning the rich history, traditions and achievements of the University at Albany, please visit the University's web page: www.albany.edu University at Albany 4 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS Admission to the University is based on evidence of high school graduation or the equivalent, quality of high school program, record of achievement, and desirable personal characteristics without regard to age, sex, race, color, creed, disability, marital status, or national origin. The University welcomes inquiries from qualified high school students, students interested in transferring from another college or university, and adults who wish to begin or resume their undergraduate program. Students who wish to obtain additional information about the University or the admission processes a nd policies described below should call 518-442-5435 or write the Undergraduate Admissions Office, Administration Building, Room 101, University at Albany, State University of New York, 1400 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York 12222 or e-mail at UGADMISSSIONS@ALBANY.edu. Group information sessions and tours are available 7 days a week when classes are in session. Please call (or e-mail) the Admissions Office to make arrangements. Interviews: A personal interview is not required as part of the admissions process. In exceptional cases, those for whom the interview is required will be notified by letter. Application Procedure: Admission to most programs is granted for the fall, spring, and summer terms. Application materials are available in the fall preceding any of these admission dates and can be received by contacting the Admissions Office. Application forms are also available in all New York State high schools and State University of New York two- and four-year colleges. Candidates may also apply on-line at www.albany.edu/admissi ons/undergraduate/ap plying. The University at Albany's application is a two-part process. Once a candidate submits a completed Part I the Admissions office will send a supplemental form (Part II) to be completed by the applicant. The Part II requests subjective information and an essay that provides the admissions committee with additional information about the candidate. Freshman Admission The undergraduate program is designed for students with well-defined interests or career objectives, as well as for those who wish to explore a variety of fields before deciding on a major. All accepted students are admitted to the University and are enrolled in an open major, (undeclared), or they can declare an intended major. Academic Preparation and Achievement High School Preparation: Candidates for admission to all undergraduate programs must present a minimum of 18 units from high school, acceptable to the University, in a college preparatory program. Within that background, freshman applicants are generally expected to demonstrate the following to be competitive for admission: four units of English or the equivalent; completion of the Course B curriculum in Math (for students graduating from New York State high schools) or the equivalent (for students from high schools in other states or nations); at least two units of laboratory science; three units of social science, including one of U.S. History; at least one year of foreign language; two years or more of foreign language is strongly r ecommended. In addition students should show electives that offer enrichment (e.g., fine or performing arts) or advanced study in a particular discipline. Admission Decision: The decision on an application for admission will be based on a holistic review of the following: High School Record Since academic performance in high school is considered to be the best predictor of academic success, the high school record will be examined in light of one's overall high school average as reported by the secondary school, courses taken, end-of-course Regents Examination grades and average (for New York State resident s), and rank in class. Acceptance is granted upon satisfactory completion of three years of high school. An acceptance is conditional upon continued success in the fourth year, proof of graduation, and the submission of a complete and satisfactory medical form to the Student Health Service. Standardized Test Scores In addition to an evaluation of an applicant's high school record, the University also uses the SAT or ACT standardized test results. (Special tests are available for handicapped applicants. Also, Albany has alternate admissions criteria for handicapped applicants who are unable to take the required tests.) A ll students graduating from high school in 2006 and thereafter are required to submit the results of a national writing component as part of their standardized tests. Standardized Test Policy: In all categories of admission, standardized test scores are considered as merely one of several academic variables used in the decision making process. Standardized test scores are used in concert with high school average, the quality of the academic program, and the student's rank in class. The University at Albany will continue to use the highest critical reading (formerly verbal) and mathematics score from the SAT to insure that these scores, in most cases, will benefit the applicant in the admissions process. In order to fully understand the appropriate use of the new writing component requirement in the evaluation process, the scores will not be used initially in the evaluation of applicants. The University realizes that standardized test scores represent the results of a test battery taken on a single day, while the high school record of an applicant represents academic commitment and achievement over a period of three years. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is aware of this difference and incorporates it into the decision making process. Questions about the use of standardized tests at the University may be directed to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 518-442-5435. The University generally receives these scores on computer tapes directly from the exam sponsors, and matches them to other application data. Each applicant is encouraged, therefore, to have the results released to us by the exam sponsors. These are to be received in the admissions office generally by mid February. Ability to Contribute to the University Community The University at Albany believes that a student body that represents diverse geographic, cultural, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds creates an educational environment that benefits all students. Therefore, in evaluating applicants, the University may also consider non-academic characteristics including involvement in school or community; leadership potential; community service; a student's ability to contribute to a diverse educational environment as evidenced by his/her geographic, cultural, racial/ethnic, or socioeconomic background; special talents; work experience; and information about the applicant's ability to overcome obstacles, hardship, disabilities, etc. Recommendations of the applicant's counselor, teacher, and/or employer are welcome, but generally are not required. However, counselor comments that will assist the Admissions Office in its review of the acad emic credentials should, of course, be submitted. Note: A decision as to admissibility cannot be made until all required materials are submitted. Although it is the responsibility of the applicant to see that all required credentials are submitted on time, the Admissions Office will send periodic reminders concerning missing credentials. Non-Binding Early Action Policy: The University at Albany no longer offers the traditional Early Decision program, but rather a much more equitable early notification option referred to as the non-binding Early Action program. The University at Albany's non-binding Early Action option allows students to apply to as many institutions as they wish and students admitted under this program need not finalize their enrollment decision until May 1 st. The non- binding Early Action program has an application deadline of November 15th and Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 5candidates meeting this deadline may expect an admission decision before the first of the year. Candidates who wish to receive an early notification from the University at Albany must submit a completed application along with their $40.00 fee to the Application Services Center and indicate on the application their intent to participate in the Early Action program at Albany. They must submit an official high school transcript and their SAT or ACT test scores. Further, it is recommended they complete and return to the Admissions Office the Part II- Supplemental Form as soon as possible. This new option allows students to hear from all the schools to which they apply as well as receive their financial aid notices before having to make a decision on which institution to select for their undergraduate program. The University Scholars Programs: The University Scholars Programs, including Presidential Scholars, Frederick Douglass Scholars (for underrepresented minority groups), and College Scholars, are designed to recognize and nurture outstanding students and offer participants the chance to study with other highly qualified high achieving undergraduates. Scholars are eligible for merit scholarships and honors housing. To be considered for these programs, students must first apply for admission to the University at Albany. Students with the strongest academic credentials are then invited to participate in the University Scholars Programs. Invitations are based on the applicants' high school performances and combined SAT scores. For further information regarding the program, contact the Director of Undergraduate Admissions at 518-442-5435. Presidential Scholars Program: The Presidential Scholars Program is designed to recognize and nurture outstanding students; it offers participants the chance to study with other highly qualified undergraduates. To be considered for the program, students must first apply for admission to the University at Albany. Students with the strongest academic credentials are then invited to participate in the Presidential Scholars program. Invitations are based on the applicants' high school performance and combined SAT scores. For further information regarding the program, contact the Director of Undergraduate Admissions at 518-442-5435 or 1-800-293-7869. Frederick Douglass Scholars Program: The Frederick Douglass Scholars Program is designed to provide direct aid funding for undergraduate students who have demonstrated high academic achievement and are from underrepresented minority groups. The program is limited to undergraduates who are members of historically underrepresented minorities (African American/Black, Hispanic, Native American, or Alaskan American) including permanent resident aliens, enrolled in a degree program who have demonstrated high academic achievement. For further information, contact the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30 (518-442-3950). Educational Opportunities Program (EOP): Freshman and transfer applicants judged to have high capabilities and motivation for college study, yet whose financial, cultural, and social backgrounds have not allowed them to compete effectively for regular admission to the University, may be admitted into the EOP program. All students must have earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Admission to the program is based on high school performance, recommendations, and a formal assessment of financial eligibility according to legislated guidelines. Support services available to accepted EOP students include devel opmental courses in the basic skills areas, such as reading, study skills, English, mathematics, and developmental science; academic and personal counseling; tutoring; and financial assistance. Students carry a full load of regular and/or basic skill courses and are considered full-time University students. The application procedure should begin as early as possible so that academic and financial evaluations, recommendations, and other arrangements can be completed well before the student wishes to begin study. Transfers are eligible for EOP admission only if they have been enrolled previously in an EOP, HEOP, College Discovery, SEEK, or EOP-type program elsewhere and meet all other transfer requirements. Early Admission (Admission Prior to High School Graduation) The University is w illing to enroll a limited number of early admission students. The guidelines for admission require the following: Each applicant will be required to present a minimum of 18 units of high school course work acceptable to the University, including laboratory science, math ematics, and foreign language study. It is expected that these students will have pursued both an enriched and accelerated secondary school program and will present courses in keeping with their expressed goals in the college program. Each applicant must have achieved at an outstanding level, generally considered to be in the area of a 90 percent or better high school average, with a corresponding rank in class within the top 10 percent. Those applicants who do not meet these qualitative guidelines must present convincing evidence that they possess a special talent and/or extraordinary ability in their chosen field of study. Each applicant must present standardized admissions test results at or above the 90 th percentile. The high school guidance counselor must support the applicant's request for \"early admission\" and must certify to the school's willingness to grant the high school diploma upon successful completion of the freshman year. Courses necessary for fulfilling high school graduation require ments must be so designated by that counselor, and the student must agree to pursue such course work during the freshman year. Transfer Admission A sizable number of undergraduates transfer into the University from other colleges and universities each year. The University welcomes applications from all students who are completing work at other two- and four-year colleges. Academic Preparation and Achievement To be favorably considered one should have at least an overall C+ (2.5) average for all college work attempted. The cumulative average necessary for admission will vary, depending on the program and the quantitative background of the applicant. Admission to certain programs (majors) is competitive and is based not only on a required grade point average (GPA) but also on completion of a certain set of prerequisite core courses. The required GPA varies from year to year but generally a B is required for applicants to the accounting, business administration, criminal justice, and social welfare programs. GPAs are computed using grades earned in all courses attempted. Applicants who lack in the high school program described in the section entitled \"High School Preparation\" may present an academic experience as a transfer student that is comparable in its totality, demonstrating breadth and achievement and the potential to compete successfully at the University at Albany. Students enrolled in EOP or EOP-type programs at other colleges are encouraged to apply for transfer admission to our EOP program. In addition to submitting the basic application and supplement form, transfer applicants must also submit official transcripts of all work taken at any college or university since high school graduation, whether or not they expect to receive transfer credit. Where only one transcript is offered, such a transcript should include at least one year's grades. Transfers may be University at Albany 6 admitted also on the basis of one semester of college course work, provided their high school preparation meets the quantitative and qualitative requirements for freshman admission. The transfer applicant is not expected to take an admissions examination. A decision as to admissibility cannot be made until the previously noted items are received. If there are gaps in an applicant's educational sequence, the applicant will be asked to provide a brief list of activities during that period. Ability to Contribute to the University Community The University at Albany believes that a student body that represents diverse geographic, cultural, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds creates an educational environment that benefits all students. Therefore, in evaluating applicants, the University may also consider non-academic characteristics including involvement in school or community; leadership potential; community service; a student's ability to contribute to a diverse educational environment as evidenced by his/her geographic, cultural, racial/ethnic, or socioeconomic background; special talents; work experience; and information about the applicant's ability to overcome obstacles, hardship, disabilities, etc. An estimate of the total number of credits accepted for transfer will be made when admission is granted. When the student registers for the first time, he or she will be provided with a tentative evaluation of course credits. The tentative evaluation is subject to final approval and modification following the initial advisement and programming session. Transfer students are strongly urged to take advantage of the Planning Conference where a review of the evaluation of course work is offered. TRANSFER GRADES : Courses are accepted for transfer credit provided that a grade of C- or higher has been achieved. a) For students who matriculated before Fall 2000, credit earned with a grade of D or the lowest passing grade will transfer only if such credit is balanced by a B or A at the same institution. D grades earned in courses within the major/minor must be balanced by grades of B or A earned within the major/minor at the same institution. b) For students who matriculated Fall 2000 through Summer 2001 , prematriculation credit earned with a grade of D or the lowest passing grade will transfer only if such credit is balanced by a B or A at the same institution. D grades earned in courses within the major/minor must be balanced by grades of B or A earned within the major/minor at the same institution. Postmatriculation credit graded D will not transfer.* c) For students who matriculate Fall 2001 and thereafter, no credit graded D from another institution will transfer.* * Except for the University's writing requirements, for which a grade of C or higher or S is required, transfer work graded D+, D or D- in a course that applies to one or more of the University's General Education requirement s may be applied toward fulfilling the requirements, even if the student receives no graduation credit for the course. All transfer applicants are strongly encouraged to indicate the major they plan to pursue once admitted to the University. Since Albany students, with few exceptions, are required to declare a major by the time they have accumulated 42 graduation credits, and may declare a major after accumulating 24 graduation credits, incoming transfer students with 24 or more credits are usually assigned to major departmental advisers for their initial programming. The prospective transfer student should consult the section of this bulletin entitled \"Declaration of Major\" for a list of those majors that have specific restrictions, and then consult the departmental description of the admission requirements for that program. The transfer student's designated class standing (class year) is determined by the number of credits accepted for transfer (see the \"Class Standing\" section of this bulletin). However, for many majors (combined major/minors in the sciences, for example) overall class standing should not be construed to mean that the student is necessarily on schedule within the major/minor sequence. This is especially true for students who transfer to the University from technical and applied programs, or for those who change major interest and/or career goals at the time of transfer. The prospective transfer student should examine closely those sections of this bulletin that deal with minor requirements, residence requirements, the General Education Requirements and with the Writing Requirement. These are graduation requirements in addition to those stipulated by the major. For the B.A. and B.S. degrees, the maximum number of transfer credits from a two-year college, a four-year college, or from a combination of two-and four-year schools are 90. TRANSFER ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS The University at Albany has transfer articulation agreements with a number of New York State community colleges. Those articulated programs provide the best possible vehicle for transferring to the University because they were designed to provide transfer students with a course-specific four-semester outline of courses, which not only best prepares them for study on this campus, but also serves to maximize their transferable credits. Students attending the community colleges where these agreements exist shoul d make early contact with their Transfer Counseling Office for information and guidance. Please note that the University offers prospective students the opportunity for joint admissions with several SUNY community colleges. Please see section on Joint Admissions. JOINT ADMISSIONS Under the Joint Admissions Program, students are admitted to the SUNY community college and acknowledged by the University as firs t year matriculants, with conditional acceptance to the University after completion of their Associate's in Arts or Associate's in Science degree. Students are assured that if they achieve the stipulated academic proficiency and distribution require ments as detailed in the Transfer Guide of the student's first institution, it will be possible to complete their baccalaureate degree at the University at Albany in four additional semesters (or equivalent for part-time students). Candidates selected for the program will receive a letter of acknowledgement from the Director of Admissions at the University at Albany. Students accepted through the Joint Admissions Program should work closely with a transfer counselor at their community college. The students in the Joint Admissions Program are expected to enroll at the University at Albany in the semester following completion of the associate degree. Students must confirm their intent to enroll at the University by submitting a Joint Admissions Supplemental Application and official transcript to the transfer counselor at their community college early in the semester immediately prior to transfer to the University at Albany. Students who enroll at a third institution lose their automatic transfer and must have their total academic record reviewed for transfer consideration. Requirements for the bachelor's degree will be those in effect at the time the student transfers to the University. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 7Second Bachelor's Degree: The University encourages students who have already earned a bachelor's degree and/or an advanced degree to pursue graduate studies in virtually all instances. Occasionally, when reasons can be demonstrat ed as to why a second bachelor's degree is preferred and educationally sound, individuals could be admitted as matriculated students to an undergraduate program. In these limited cases, such requests will be reviewed by the Admissions Office in accordance with regulations of the Undergraduate Policy Manual . Students who have been approved to obtain a second bachelor's degree from the University at Albany must be admitted as a matriculated student by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours as a matriculated student in residence at the University at Albany. Admission as a Nonmatriculated Student The University at Albany may enroll individuals who are not seeking admission into an undergraduate degree program as nonmatriculated. The minimum requirement for non-degree admission is a high school diploma. Visiting students from other college s as well as high school seniors may also apply for non-degree study. All admissions falling within this category are on a term-by-term basis. Please refer to the Office of General Studies section of this Bulletin for details. College and University Students: see next section, Office of General Studies. Admission of International Students The University at Albany seeks to enroll international students with the academic and personal background to benefit from and contribute to its academic and co-curricular programs. Admission of undergraduate international students is available for all academic terms. Applicants will be required to provide evidence of academic preparation at a level comparable to domestic applicants and proof of English language competency (for students whose native language is other than English.) Students who desire admission to the undergraduate programs and are citizens of other countries should begin the application procedure as early as possible so that all necessary arrangements can be completed before the term begins. Contact the Admissions Office to receive the special application materials required for those applying as international students. Candidates must demonstrate successful completion of high school in the United States or the equivalent in the native country of the applicant. Academic preparation must include the equivalent of the core academic subjects described in the section entitled \"High School Preparation\". SAT or ACT exams will be required of graduates of U.S. high schools. Students whose native language is other than English are required to submit proof of English language competency through submission of the scores of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Exam administered by the Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Early in the preparation for admission, a careful investigation of the fina ncial requirements should be made with the Admissions Office. All undergraduate international applicants must provide documentation demonstrating the ability to support themselves financially. Required amounts of support will be determined by the University each year, and students must provide original financial documents from a financial institution. Satisfaction of the financial requirement will allow for an I-20 to be issued to the student. It may be necessary to rescind an acceptance if the University finds that a student is no longer financially independent to the extent certified on the formal application. Medical Record After acceptance and prior to registration, each candidate will be required to file with the Student Health Service a complete and satisfactory medical record. Credit by Examination Students may be granted advanced placement and/or credit at any time that they can demonstrate the requisite proficiency. The programs described here represent a variety of opportunities for receiving credit for college courses by examination prior to or while enrolled at the University. Some of the testing programs offer examinations in the same or similar academic areas. Duplicating examinations, like duplicating courses, should be avoided. Credit for a course by examination will be awarded only once, regardless of how many different exams for the same course are taken. As a matter of policy, the first examination pursued takes precedence over subsequent tests. Advanced Placement Tests: The University grants advanced placement and/or credit to qualified participants in the College Entrance Examination Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Examination Program. Current University policy is to award advanced placement with credit to those students who submit an official AP score report with a score of 5, 4, or 3 on the AP examination. Inform ation about AP can be obtained from a student's high school guidance counselor or by writing to the Director, Advanced Placement Program, College Entrance Examination Board, 45 Columbus Avenue, New York, New York 10023. College-Level Examination Program: The College Entrance Examination Board has developed a program containing Subject Examinations and General Examinations known as the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). This program en ables individuals who have acquired their education in nontraditional ways to demonstrate their academic achievement. The University at Albany participates in the CLEP program and curre ntly will award credit and/or placement for Subject Examinations and General Examinations i. that are equivalent to courses currently acceptable for transfer to the University at Albany, and ii. on which the student has scored at or above the 50 th percentile (i.e., equivalent to the grade of C.) Students seeking to gain CLEP credit should be aware that the following three (3) restrictions apply: First, CLEP credit will not be awarded to students who have satisfactorily completed a course and then pass a CLEP examination covering substantially the same material. Second, CLEP credit will not be awarded for CLEP examinations if the student has satisfactorily completed more advanced courses in the same field. Third, since the General Examinations and Subject Examinations are designed to test lower-division study, students who have completed either their sophomore year and/or 56 credits of undergraduate study cannot earn credits from either the General Examinations or the Subject Examinations. EXCEPTIONS : A student seeking an exception to this policy must petition the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. In that petition, the student must include an explicit recommendation from the academic department that grants the credits. In addition, the student must provide a compelling educational rationale detailing the reasons why an exception should be considered. NOTE: This policy applies to all students who matriculate at the University at Albany in fall 1999 and thereafter. Further information concerning CLEP can be obtained either from the Admissions Office at this University or by contacting the Program Director, College-Level Examination Program, Box 6600, Princeton, NJ 08541-6600. The International Baccalaureate A secondary education program with origins in Europe, the International Baccalaureate Program now being offered in some American high schools is an upper-secondary-level program with a core curriculum and distribution requirements leading to a diploma or one or more certificates of examination. Similar to the British \"A Level\" examinations and the French Baccalaureate, the IB program is a system of syllabuses, or course descriptions, University at Albany 8 and examinations based on the concept that general education at the upper-secondary-level should encompass the development of all the main powers of the mind through which a person interprets, modifies, and enjoys the environment. With these principles in mind, an international group of educators has designed a program which requires that each student become proficient in language and mathematics, the two most important tools of communication and analysis; become familiar with at least one subject that exemplifies the study of human behavior and with another that involves scientific inquiry; develop an acquaintance with aesthetic and moral values; engage in creative, aesthetic, social service, or physical activities; and participate in a common course that reflects upon the truth, criteria, values, and inter-relations of the subjects under study. The six areas studied at the eleventh- and twelfth-grade level in the American high schools which employ the program are (1) Language A (first language); (2) Language B (second language); (3) Study of Man; (4) Experimental Science; (5) Mathematics; (6) Art, Music, Classical Language. A seventh course known as Theory of Knowledge is also included, and through it each student engages in creative, aesthetic, or social activities. Three of the six subjects have to be offered at the Higher Level and three at the Subsidiary Level. Courses are graded on a scale from 0 to 7. The University at Albany will consider for credit and/or placement on a course-by-course evaluation those IB subjects completed at the Higher Level in which a score from 4 (satisfactory) to 7 (excellent) is earned. Because of the comprehensive nature of the courses in the IB program, and since it has been the University's experience that exact course equivalents are difficult to identify, credit is generally awarded on an elective basis. United States Armed Forces Institute/Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support The United States Armed Forces Institute (USAFI), an educational division of the Department of Defense, once provided educational opportunities at various levels for personnel on active duty with all branches of the military. College-level courses culminated in USAFI Subject Standardized Tests and End-of-Course Tests. In 1974, in an administrative move, the Department of Defense discontinued the USAFI program and created the DANTES program, which is very similar in nature and purpose to USAFI. The guidelines used for USAFI courses are also used for the DANTES program. The University will award appropriate credit for Subject Standardized Tests on which a percentile score of 50 or higher was earned and for End-of-Course Tests for which a rating of S (Satisfactory) or D (with Distinction) was assigned, provided the courses are considered equivalent to courses currently acceptable for transfer to this University. Information on acceptable courses, score levels, and amounts of credit can be obtained from the Admissions Office. Credit for Work Done at Noncollegiate Institutions In 1974, the New York State Education Department (SED) began a systematic evaluation of the formal learning experiences sponsored by noncollegiate institutions; that is, organizations whose primary focus is not education. They include private industry, professional associations, labor unions, voluntary associations, and government agencies. The publication A Guide to Educational Programs in Noncollegiate Organizations describes the available courses offered by each organization and includes SED's credit recommendation. The University will awar d transfer credit for work done through noncollegiate institutions if: 1. The course is listed in A Guide to Educational Programs in Noncollegiate Organizations 2. The course meets all present criteria and standards for transferability, is comparable to a University at Albany offering, and is collegiate in nature 3. The course is approved by the appropriate University academic department, school, or college Requests for transfer credit should be made initially to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The student making the request must provide the Admissions Office with a course syllabus, an extended course outline, and any other supplementary material on the course that might be required by the academic department, school, or college. If a course receives departmental approval, it will generally be eligible for transfer credit in the future, but will be subject to periodic review by the approving department, college, or school. Readmission Procedure A former student who wishes to be readmitted as an undergraduate should refer to the section on readmission policies and procedures under \"Undergraduate Academic Regulations.\" OFFICE OF GENERAL STUDIES Non-degree Status The Office of General Studies offers extraordinary educational value by allowing admission into almost all undergraduate courses offered at the University for academic credit. General Studies applicants must be high school graduates or hold a high school equivalency diploma and must be in good academic standing for any college work done during the 12 months prior to registration. General Studies applicants can also be degree-seeking students from a college or university other than Albany. Finally, General Studies applicants may be high school seniors who excel in their high school coursework. Any student who was formerly matriculated at the University at Albany who has not received a baccalaureate degree is not permitted to register through General Studies and should refer to the section in this bulletin on Readmission Procedures. Individuals who already have a baccalaureate or higher degree may also register in undergraduate credit courses as a non-degree student through the Office of General Studies. However, those wishing to obtain a second bachelor's degree must be admitted as a matriculated student by Undergraduate Admissions in order to comply with the 30 credit hour in-residence policy. Credit hours earned in General Studies may not apply towards this requirement. Admission Information The Office of General Studies normally requires a campus visit to complete a simple application and registration process each term. Since non-degree applicants may be American citizens, permanent residents or nonresident aliens, this office requires that nonresident aliens visit the Office of International Student Services to obtain written authorization to be admitted and registered prior to visiting our office. General Studies Students: Those wishing to register for undergraduate courses but who are not currently attending college may apply for admission through the Office of General Studies. The applicant must possess at least a high school diploma or the equivalent in order to be admitted. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 9Visiting Students: College students wishing to register for undergraduate coursework and that are from an institution other than the University at Albany may apply for admission through the Office of General Studies as a visiting student. Visiting students are expected to return to their home college or university to complete their degree program. It is the visiting students' responsibility to ensure that the coursework taken at Albany will transfer back to their home institution and be credited to their degree program at their home school. The Registrar's Office will provide verification of visitor status to officials at the students' home institution in order to assist them in the credit approval and/or financial aid certification. High School Students: Students attending high school and in good standing can undertake University course work on a part-time, nonmatriculated basis concurrent with their grade 12 secondary school program. Summer coursework between grades 11 and 12 is also allowable. High school students should apply for non-degree study through the Office of General Studies. To apply, the visiting high school student must: --obtain a Visiting High School Student Application from the Office of General Studies. --attach to the application a current high school transcript. --attach written support from the guidance counselor, who will be expected to: attest to the student's emotional and intellectual readiness for college coursework state rank within the student's class report standardized test results (preferably PSAT or SAT scores, but Regents grades and other testing results will suffice) that indicate that the student can reasonably be expected to compete academically with university students. --Meet any and all stated prerequisites for the course(s) in question. -- Home-schooled students are bound by the same guidelines as visiting high school students. Registration Information Upon admission, non-degree students can review course selections with an academic adviser who is available in the Office of General Studies. The non-degree adviser may guide students through general inquiries. However, program specific questions or those regarding possible matriculation criteria should be directed to the appropriate offices. All course prerequisites and any other special criteria or restrictions for course registration apply to General Studies students. Evidence of previous college coursework may be required for registration. Upon completion of initial admission or readmission, the University's web-based student service system (MyUAlbany) will become available for use for all non-degree students. This system will enable students to register or perform any schedule adjustments they may require. Prior to using MyUAlbany, students must obtain an Advisement Verification Number (AVN) from the Office of General Studies. There are two academic semesters (fall and spring) each year, and a summer session. Students are encouraged to early register for the coming term, which can occur as early as March for the summer and fall terms and October for the spring semester. Admission and registration is done on a first-come, first-served basis. A General Studies student who fails to complete the courses in which he/she is enrolled and to maintain a 2.0 cumulative grade point average each semester may be subject to dismissal. After a student has accrued or attempted two terms as a General Studies student, the University reserves the right to rescind continued enrollment privileges for failure to maintain sufficient academic progress which shall be defined as falling below a 2.0 cumulative grade point average or not completing coursework in which the student is enrolled. Matriculation to Degree Status Each year, many General Studies students apply for admission to degree programs and are accepted by the Undergraduate Admissions Office. Credits earned as a nonmatriculated student may be applied toward graduation requirements for specific majors. Requirements for admissi on to specific majors vary from department to department (see appropriate academic department listings in this bulletin). Applicants must apply to the University formally through the Office of Undergraduate Admissions in accordance with procedures outlined in the Admissions section of this bulletin. Applicants must submit official transcripts from all other colleges previously attended. Standardized admission test scores are not required. Mini mum requirements for admission include a high school or equivalency diploma and at least two units of academic mathematics (see Transfer Admissions section in this bulletin). Services The Office of General Studies staff admits and registers students falling in the non-degree status, offers basic a dvisement information, assists students with w ithdrawals, conveys and interprets University policies, regulations and procedures, encourages and works with nonmatriculated students in applying for degree status and refers students to other University offices and services. The General Studies staff is strongly committed to the needs and concerns of traditional as well as nontraditional students and are available for phone and in-person consultation at convenient times throughout the year. Hours and services are announced in the General Studies newsletters and publications as well as on the University website. All General Studies students may obtain a University identification card and are entitled to many of the same privileges as other University students, including use of the libraries, athletic facilities and campus services. Location The Office of General St udies is joined with Summer Sessions and is called the Office of General Studies and Summer Sessions. This office is located on th e University's main campus in LI 85. The office can be accessed via the stairway between the Library and the Business Administration Building or the stairway in front of the Library's main entrance. For more information on non-degree study, visit, write or call the Office of General Studies and Summer Sessions, LI 85, 1400 Washington Avenue, Albany, Albany 10 FINANCIAL AID The Office of Financial Aid administers federal, state, and certain institutional student financial assistance programs for undergraduate and graduate students. In addition to overall college financing and financial aid advisement, the office manages a variety of funds, including the Federal Stafford and other federal loan programs, Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal Work-Study employment, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program and Educational Opportunity Program, and University at Albany Benevolent Association Scholarships. It also coordinates the Emergency Loan Fund. Advisement services are available to all members of the University Community. The Office of Financial Aid is located in the basement of the Campus Center, Room B52, (518/442-5757, 442-5480). The University at Albany is committed to the concept of helping students obtain the resources necessary to meet their educational expenses. A variety of grants, loans, and student employment opportunities are available from various sources. The application procedures and descriptions of the various types of financial aid included in this section were accurate at the time of publication. It should be kept in mind that financial aid programs are frequently modified by legislation. Most student financial assistance is awarded on the basis of financial need. Simply stated, financial need is: Estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) -Expected Family Contribution (EFC) =Financial Need The total cost of attendance is an estimate of the student's direct and indirect educational expenses for an academic year. Direct expenses are tuition, f ees, room and meals for students who live on campus and only tuition and fees for students living off campus. The budgets also include allowances for estimated expenses for books and supplies, personal items, transportation, and living expenses for off-campus students. Se veral different budgets are used to take differences among students into consideration. The following are examples of two budgets used to determine eligibility during the 2004-2005 academic year: Cost of Attendance 2005-2006 Dependent Student Independent Student Living On campus Living Off campus Tuition and Fees* $ 5,770 $ 5,770 Room and Board* $ 8,050 NA Living Expenses NA $ 8,900 Books $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Personal/Travel $ 1,672 $ 1,672 Total $15,400 $17,100 *Institutional charges subject to change every year. Out-of-state tuition is an additional $6,260 for full-time undergraduate students. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) towards educational expenses is computed from the information students and, if applicable, their families provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The EFC is shown on the Student Aid Report (SAR) sent to applicants after the FAFSA has been processed by the federal processor. APPLICATION PROCEDURE D EADLINES The University has established February 1, 2006, as the final deadline for the submission of the 2005-2006 FAFSA information to the federal processor for the 2005-2006 academic year. In addition, the Office of Financial Aid must receive a valid Student Aid Report by March 15, 2006. The Office of Financial Aid will not process FAFSA information received after these deadlines. EW STUDENTS N New students must be accepted for admission to the University prior to being considered for financial aid. In order to receive priority consideration for assistance administered by the University, all information required by the Admissions Office should be submitted on a timely basis. In additi on, students wishing to apply for financial aid should submit the following forms: 1. The FAFSA is the only form that initially must be submitted to be considered for financial assistance at the University. Students who file the FAFSA online will be able to apply for a New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) award at the same time. The FAFSA should be completed as soon as possible after January 1 regardless of whether or not the applicant has heard from the Admissions Office. The Office of Financial Aid will begin making awards to new students accepted for admission beginning in February or March. Awards are made on a rolling basis throughout the spring and summer as financial aid files become complete. 2. New York State resi dents should complete the Express TAP Application (ETA). The Exxpress TAP Application serves as an application form to receive New York State financial assistance. When you file the FAFSA form electronically, you may have been linked directly to NYSHESC to complete the Express Tap Application electronically. If not, students will need to complete the ETA at www.tapweb.org. 3.

INSTITUTIONAL AID University at Albany Scholarships-The Office of Financial Aid does not award scholarships. However, the University offers a number of merit scholarships to unde rgraduate students. They are called Presidential, Achievement and College Scholarships and are awarded to new students by the Admissions Office and renewed by the Office of the Undergraduate Dean. Eligibility requirements and award amounts vary. Undergraduate students who have been awarded merit scholarships will have received information about the awards from the Office of Admissions. Athletic Scholarships are awarded by the Department of Athletics and Recreation. STATE FINANCIAL AID Academic Criteria for State Awards 1. You must be matriculated in an eligible degree program at the beginning of your course of study. In addition, to be considered matriculated for State financial aid purposes, the New York State Education Department requires that the student declare a major no later than the beginning of the junior year if enrolled in a baccalaureate program. 2. You must be enrolled full-time (twelve or more credits) by the TAP certification date, which is one day after the 100% tuition liability date each semester. Courses added after the certification date do not count towards full-time status. 3. If students repeat courses for which they received passing grades and the course schedule does not indicate that the course can be re-taken for credit, the courses will not count towards satisfactory academic progress or pursuit of program. Satisfactory Academic Progress: In order to retain eligibility for New York State scholarship and grant awards, students must be in \"good academic standing\", which is comprised of two components: \"satisfactory academic progress\" and \"pursuit of program\". In order to make satisfactory progress towards a degree, students must accrue graduation credits each semester and have the cumulative grade point average shown on the academic progress chart in this section. Although the academic progress standards allow ten semesters for completion of a bachelor's degree, the maximum award period at the undergraduate level is four years, except for students enrolled in approved five-year degree programs or the Educational Opportunity Program. Satisfactory Academic Progress Chart New York State Grant and Scholarship Programs Before being certified for a semester's payment , a student must have accrued a certain number of credits and have a minimum grade point average at the end of the semester, as shown in the following chart. Payment Credits Minimum GPA First 0 0.00 Second 3 0.50 Third 9 0.75 Fourth 18 1.20 Fifth 30 2.00 Sixth 45 2.00 Seventh 60 2.00 Eighth 75 2.00 Ninth 90 2.00 Tenth 105 2.00 Program Pursuit: In addition to meeting the criteria outlined on the academic progress chart, State regulations require students who receive New York State awards to be enrolled on a full-time basis and complete a minimum number of credits each semester with grades of A, B, C, D, E, S, U, or I. Students receiving a New York State award for the first time must complete six credits each semester the first year of receipt of an award, nine credits each semester of the second year, and a minimum of twelve credits in semester of the third and fourth years. Students who do not complete the minimum number of credits in a given semester are ineligible for New York State financial aid for the following term or until additional credits are completed to reach the minimum level. Grades of \"I\" must be completed within one semester to have the credits counted for New York State grant and scholarship purposes. Waivers of the Progress Standards: Students who fall below the minimum criteria stated previously may be eligible to receive one waiver of the satisfactory academic progress or pursuit of program criteria during their undergraduate career. In addition, students who lose TAP eligibility because they do not have a \"C\" average after receiving four TAP payments may request a waiver of the satisfactory academic progress standards. Sufficient and documented reasons must be presented for the student's inability to meet the minimum standards. Pr ocedures for granting waivers will follow University policies relating to the appeals procedure for academic dismissal from the University . If granted, the waiver becomes part of the student's financial aid record and the student is expected to make minimum progress thereafter. New York State Grant and Scholarship Programs 1. Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) This grant program for New York State residents who are full-time undergraduate students currently provides for annual awards ranging from $500 to $5,000 or tuition, whichever is less. Awards are based on the family's New York State net taxable income. If more than one member of the family is attending an approved post secondary educational institution on a full-time basis, the net taxable income figure is reduced by $3,000 for the second person when the applicant's TAP award is computed and $2,000 for each additional student. Undergraduate students may receive TAP for four years of full-time study. Students enrolled in approved five-year programs or in State sponsored opportunity programs may receive undergraduate aid for five years. Graduate students may receive awards for four years, but no student may receive awards for more than a total of eight years of undergraduate and graduate study. 2. Vietnam Veterans/Persian Gulf Veterans Tuition Awards In order to be eligible for this award, a student must have served in the United States armed forces in Indochina between December 22, 1961 and May 7, 1975 or in the Persian Gulf from August 2, 1990 to the end of such hostilities as evidenced by the receipt of the Southwest Asia Service Medal, been discharged from the service under other than dishonorable conditions, and be a New York State residents.

The College of Arts and Sciences provides all undergraduates with study in most of the disciplines within the lib eral arts and sciences. Those students wishing to explore any of these areas in depth may beco me majors within the college. Graduates of the College of Arts and Sciences may apply for graduate-level teacher certification preparation programs in the School of Education. The School of Business offers programs in accounting and business administration. Admission to these programs is competitive, open only to the best-qualified students who have completed 56 or more credits, including specific courses outlined in the School of Business section of this bulletin. The School of Criminal Justice offers a multi- disciplinary degree program, focusing on the study of criminal behavior and society's response to it. Students take courses in criminal justice, as well as in a disciplinary field related to criminal justice. Admission to this major is highly competitive, and students must complete specific requirements before applying for admission. The new College of Computing and Information supports education for undergraduates throughout the University in computer science, information science, and information technology. It houses the departments of Computer Science and Information Studies (formerly the School of Information Science and Policy), as well as a campus-wide Informatics Faculty that focuses on interdisciplinary aspects of computing and information. The College offers General Education and advanced courses, and several major and minor programs, including a Faculty-Initiated Interdisciplinary Major with a Concentration in Information Science hosted by the department of Information Studies. The Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy offers undergraduate degree programs in political science and public policy. These programs focus on issues of politics, public policy and management in the public service in the local, state, federal and international arena. The program in public policy is a combined major and minor sequence, where students design an area of concentration. The School of Public Health offers undergraduate electives in public health and medical informatics. The School of Social Welfare offers a combined major and minor sequence that prepares students for beginning social work. This program serves the liberal education needs for students interested in the social sciences and human services professions. Admission to this major is competitive, and students have complete specific require ments before applying for admission. The Interdisciplinary Studies Committee of the Undergraduate Academic Council works with the academic colleges and schools to develop and approve Faculty-Initiated Interdisciplinary Majors and Minors. The approval of student-initiated majors and minors is also under the jurisdiction of this committee. In addition, the committee recommends and monitors University-wide independent study, internships, special projects, and interdisciplinary topics courses. Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies The Dean of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for the coordination of the academic experience of undergraduate students at this University. The dean works closely with the deans and faculty of the individual schools and colleges and with the Undergraduate Academic Council in developing, coordinating, and implementing undergraduate academic policy and curricula. The dean also supervises the Advisement Services Center /Undergraduate Studies. Project Renaissance, Faculty Mentor Program, and Tutoring Program are some of the many programs that the dean oversees. The Office of Undergraduate Studies also provides coordination of and advisement for independent study, student-initiated interdisciplinary majors and minors, and interdisciplinary courses including Washington, NYS Senate and Assembly and other University-wide internships; implements undergraduate academic policies; and edits and publishes the Undergraduate Bulletin. This office also provides assistance and counseling to undergraduate students who are contemplating leaving th e University, who seek to take a Leave for Approved Study at another college or university, or who wish to re-enter the University after having been away from the University for a semester or more. It also coordinates the degree in absentia process. We are eager to help all students who wish to explore academic issues and concerns. Students may contact the dean in LC 30 (518-442-3950). Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies (ASC/US) The Advisement Services Center/ Undergraduate Studies (ASC/US) serves undergraduate students at the University through direct advisement services and by assisting faculty who work with students in an advising relationship. The primary responsibility of ASC/US is to provide for the academic advisement of freshmen, all students who have not yet declared a major, and those undergraduates not yet accepted into restricted majors. In addition to providing individual academic advisement, ASC/US currently has the following responsibilities: 1. Serving as an academic advisement resource center for all undergraduates, faculty, and staff; 2. Providing preprofessional (law and health careers) advisement and support services; 3. Coordinating the Hudson Mohawk Association of Colleges and Universities' Cross-Registration Program for undergraduates who wish to study at other schools in the association; 4. Coordination of 3+3 Albany Law program, 3+2 engineering programs, early assurance medical program, and early admission dental and optometry programs. Students who need assistance regarding their academic concerns are encouraged to contact the Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies, LI-36 (518-442-3960), or visit their web page at www.albany.edu/advisement . The Office of Academic Support Services The following seven programs support new undergraduates as they make their transition into the University at Albany community. These comprehensive support services include the study groups, academic early warning program, university tutors, independent tutoring program, faculty mentoring programs, study skills workshops, and the Educational Opportunities Program . Also, other Office of Academic Support Services programs, include Project Excel, Ronald McNair/AGEP/LSAPM/C-Step Program, the Academic Talent Search Program and the Youth Construction Initiative Program. Study Group Plan In 24 freshman classes, the Office sponsors study groups free of charge to all students. A study group consists of several students in a given course who decide to meet on a regular basis for discussions, analysis, and reviewing of course material. Participation in a study group can be an excellent way to prepare for exams, since participants must organize their thinking about course topics and present, or defend, their individual perspectives before the group. Study groups emphasize the student's active involvement with course material. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 19Participants are encouraged to re-examine concepts, to question or to challenge each other with respect to course topics. Study groups can also help to maintain a high level of interest and enthusiasm towards course work and allow students to examine ways in which the course is personally meaningful or relevant to their college goals. Coordinated by a graduate student who serves as a facilitator, the objectives of the student group concept are: 1) to clarify course material through restatement or illustrations, using familiar terms and concepts, and 2) to assist study group members in learning course material and achieving success in the course. University Tutors Each study group, in addition to the facilitator, will have two University Tutors on hand to assist with questions and problems. These tutors, who are undergraduate honors students, will at times also offer individualized assistance to those study group students who seek special attention. Academic Early Warning System The main objective of this Academic Early Warning System is to have professors identity students experiencing problems and to encourage them to utilize available academic and advising supportive services in order to overcome their difficulties. This warning is in lieu of a mid-semester grade. The designated university courses include the following: A Bio 110, 111; A Chm 120, 121, 216, 216; A Psy 101, 210, 211; I Csi 101, 201; A Soc 115, 221; A Eco 110, 111; A Mat 100, 101, 106, 108, 111, 112, 113; and B Acc 211, 222. During the fifth week of the semester, this composite list of potential failures will be circulated to the academic advisers of these students so that they can encourage the following help: 1) conference with faculty member of particular course; 2) consultation with academic/faculty adviser; 3) participation in respective study group (all of the Academic Early Warning System courses are an integral part of the study group plan); and 4) involvement with an independent tutor. Also, a staff member from the Office of Academic Suppor t Services will contact the students, advising them of their options. Independent Tutoring Program The Office of Academ ic Support Services provides the student community with an updated listing of academically successful students who are available to tutor students on a one to one basis. These independent tutors have taken the course in which they tutor and have received a B+ or higher. These independent tutors must have at least 3.0 cumulative academic average, secure faculty recommendations, pass the personal interview, and complete a tutoring orientation. Faculty Mentoring Program Matriculating students at the University at Albany are eligible to participate in one of the faculty mentoring programs. If enrolled in a program, it is expected that the student be willing to interact with a faculty or professional staff member in a mentoring partnership. University mentoring programs take many forms and address different groups including the following: Presidential Scholars; academic probationers; multicultural recruitment students; special talent admits; and other students, especially incoming freshmen seeking support. For a new freshman or a continuing student with academic needs, family or personal problems, the value of a trusted friend, confidante, guide and role model is obvious. For mentors, a one-to-one relationship can be an opportunity to give another person the guidance and support they once received from their own mentors. Mentoring is not an easy job; it is not a job quickly accomplished. Yet helping and guiding a young person may be the most important work a volunteer will ever do. Study Skills Workshops Study skills workshops are offered free of charge to all students, especially freshmen. These one-hour sessions provide an opportunity to acquire skills vital to achieving academic success. Titles of workshops include time management, textbook mastery, learning from lecture, memory enhancement, listening skills, examination preparation, examination strategies, multiple choice examination skills, and final exam preparation. The Registrar's Office The Registrar's Office manages the process by which courses, classrooms, academic space, and final examinations are scheduled; grades are recorded; students are registered and enrolled; degrees are cleared and diplomas are prepared. Records are maintained with accuracy and security and issued to internal and external sources in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The office is responsible for assuring that academic policy is carried out and that data concerning registration and enrollment are collected and distributed to appropriate campus offices. It works with appropriate campus offices in the development and implementation of student information systems. Finally, it communicates with clientele both on and off campus by clarifying policy, verifying enrollment and status, and by referring students and staff to the appropriate person or office at the University or elsewhere. The Registrar's Office is located in the Campus Center, Room B-25, (518-442-5540). Academic Advisement Academic advisement services for undergraduate students are coordinated by the Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies (ASC/US). Freshmen, students who have not declared a major, and students intending to pursue a restricted major are advised either by the staff of ASC/US or by the staff of the Educational Opportunities Program (EOP). All students who are admitted to the University through the Educational Opportunities Program receive academic advisement from EOP counselors until they declare a major or are accepted in a restricted major. Freshmen and sophomores are encouraged to work closely with their academic advisers. ASC/US staff are in regular contact with the University's academic departments and programs to insure that advisers have pertinent and up-to-date information about school and college offerings. The adviser is therefore able to assist each student to plan and select a course of study that is consistent with the student's abilities, interests, achievements, and future plans. Information about courses, academic study at other institutions, interpretation of the University's academic policies, and referral to other University Offices and persons for assistance with the student's concerns are part of the services provided by academic advisers. Students may \"declare\" their major at any time after earning 24 credits and completing any other requirements for admission to that major. It is easiest to complete all requirements if a major is chosen by the end of the sophomore year. Some financial aid programs require that a student declare a major by the junior year. Once a major is declared, students receive academic advisement from faculty in the major department. Students are encouraged to meet with their advisers on a regular basis. Together the student and adviser can evaluate the student's academic experiences and goals, and formulate appropriate educational plans. To complement faculty advisement, ASC/US serves as an advisement resource for both faculty and students needing clarification or interpretation of University academic policies, procedures, and programs. Health Careers Advisement Approximately 35 students from the University apply annually for admission to medical, osteopathic, dental, optometry, podiatry, chiropractic, and veterinary schools. There is little variation in the basic requirements for admission to the professional schools. The majority of these schools require the General Biology sequence and one full year of study in chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, mathematics, and English. Many health profession schools now strongly recommend or require that students complete humanities and/or social science courses as well. There is no University at Albany 20 special major for preprofessional health careers students, and the require ments for admission can be met through a variety of majors available at the University. The Pre-Health Advisory Committee assists students through formal meetings and counseling by preparing the Committee Evaluation during the spring semester prior to application. Currently th is committee consists of four faculty members and five professional staff members. Resource materials, admission statistics, admission test applications, and procedural information are available for University students by contacting the Pre-Health adviser in the Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies, LI-36. Pre-Law Advisement There is no single \"best\" program of study in preparation for law school, and students are encouraged to consider a variety of alternatives. The Association of American Law Schools recommends a broad-based liberal arts curriculum and considers the prescription of particular courses unwise. Students interested in law school should watch for meetings of the Student Pre-Law Association and on-campus visits of law schools. Additionally, the Pre-Law adviser maintains a listserv for all pre-law students to disseminate timely information about workshops, tests, guest speakers, etc. Special seminars are offered each semester to provide assistance on applications, test preparation and planning for law school financing. Written information, such as law school catalogs, The Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools , LSAT applications, and admission statistics for Albany students, is available in the Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies, LI-36.

Only students with an admissions status of \"FRESHMAN\" ( not transfer students) are eligible to participate. Students following joint degree programs shall be held to the same requirements that apply to students completing their entire degree on campus. This means that students need to complete 30 of their last 69 credits on this campus (residency requirement). 2. All Albany requirements need to be completed by the time the bachelor's degree will be awarded. Therefore, students pursuing these degree programs can continue to take courses, on campus or off, that apply to the requirements they need to complete at Albany (in compliance with residency and transfer limit policies). For example, in the summers following the student's third and fourth years, the student can return to Albany to take additional coursework. Additionally, requirements at Albany might be satisfied by particular coursework at the partnering institution. Combined Bachelor's/Master's Degree Programs Combined Bachelor's/Master's Degree Programs: Undergraduate students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity have the opportunity of fulfilling integrated requirements of bachelor's and master's degree programs within a rationally designed and effective framework at the beginning of their junior year. Combined programs require a minimum of 138 credits and up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to the requirements for the baccalaureate. Students may be admitted to these combined programs at the beginning of their junior year, or after the successful completion of 56 credits.. A grade point average of 3.20 or higher and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required. In some cases, with careful planning, students may complete both their Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 21bachelor's and master's degrees within nine semesters. Clarification to Students in Combined Baccalaureate/Masters Programs As noted above, \"Students are considered undergraduates until they have accumulated 120 credits, satisfied all degree requirements and been awarded the baccalaureate degree.\" However, although students who have failed to satisfy \"all degree requirements\" will not be granted the baccalaureate degree until all undergraduate requirements are met, please be aware that for determining such matters as whether students pay undergraduate or graduate tuition, the following policy applies (highlighting added): \"Although admitted to an integrated degree program, students will be considered as undergraduate students for purposes of tuition, financial aid, and headcount identification until completion of 120 credits of satisfactory work. Upon meeting that requirement, students will be considered graduate students for purposes of tuition, headcount identification, and eligibility for graduate assistantships, fellowships, and loans.\" (Accepted by University Senate, February 2, 1981) The following bachelor's/master's programs are currently registered by the State Education Department: atmospheric science, biology, chemistry, computer science, computer science and applied mathematics/computer science, computer science and applied mathematics/mathematics, criminal justice, economics/public administration, English, French, geography, geology, history, linguistics/teaching English to speakers of other languages, mathematics, philosophy, physics, political science, political science/public administration, psychology/counseling, psychology/ rehabilitation counseling, public policy, rhetoric and communication, Russian, sociology, sociology/public administration, Spanish, theatre, women's studies, and any undergraduate major (except accounting)/library science.

The work is supervised and evaluated by a faculty member and culminates in a significant paper or report. Most academic units offer independent study courses with a variable credit option dependent on the extent of the intended project. If students have intended projects not clearly falling within one academic discipline, they may receive independent study and research credit through U Uni 397. This university-wide offering requires approval of the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee. Students interested in doing independent and creative study are encouraged to discuss with faculty members their ideas and the feasibility of earning credit. Since the appropriateness and need for a student to pursue independent study and research is an individual matter, there are no further guidelines on this study. At times, U Uni 397 has encompassed cross-disciplinary work cosponsored by faculty members from more than one academic unit. At other times, the U Uni 397 course has been used to enable a senior to pursue an extensive, major research topic for which the student's academic department or school independent study courses would not carry sufficient academic credit. Supervised Research Supervised research for sophomores and juniors enables undergraduates to work with a member of the University faculty as a research apprentice. The work is supervised and evaluated by a member of the teaching faculty and culminates in a research paper or report. Information on U Uni 180, \"Supervised Research\" is available from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. See also the A Cas undergraduate research and research methods courses in the College of Arts and Sciences sec tion of this bulletin. Internships Internships give students an opportunity to acquire practical \"hands-on\" experience in a field or area that interests them. Internships differ from independent study in that an internship involves off-campus participation in the work of an agency, institution, or corporate body other than the University. The work is supervised and evaluated by a designated individual in the agency, institution, or corporate body providing the internship. This supervisor provides an evaluation of the student's work to the Albany faculty member responsible for the final evaluation and assignment of the appropriate academic grade. Internships are open only to qualified juniors and seniors who have an overall grade point average of 2.50 or higher. Students interested in correlating their academic study with practical experience are encouraged to explore the feasibility of participating in an internship. Some majors, such as social welfare, require fieldwork as part of their major requirements, and these opportunities are open only to students who have been admitted in the major program. In other cases, many academic departments and school s offer internships involving experiences related to the academic focus of the unit. These courses include opportunities in various aspects of the performing arts (A Arh 490, A Art 490, A Mus 490, A Thr 415), anthropology (A Ant 400), classics (A Cla 490), planning (A Pln 490), computing (I Csi 490), atmospheric science (A Atm 490), business (B Bus 497, 498) communication (A Com 390), sociology (A Soc 490), public affairs (R Pub 498; R Pos 338, 434), news writing for papers or radio or television stations (A Jrl 400), archaeological fieldwork (A Ant 338), etc. The University also offe rs a total of 15 credits for students participating in the following special, formalized internships: Senate Session Assistant Program (U Uni 391), Assembly Session Intern Program (U Uni 392), Operational and Applied Communication Theory (A Com 392, 393), and the Empire State Youth Theatre Institute (A Cas 390). These latter established internships take advantage of Albany's location in the state's capital. Albany is also affiliated with the Washington Center (see U Uni 393, WCLA Internship). Through U Uni 390 (1-15 credits), students have obtained approval for full- or part-time internships in a very wide variety of areas. For these pursuits, it is assumed the student will secure the opportunity on his or her own, find appropriate faculty sponsorship, and then apply to the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee for approval of the desired credit. The range of possible internship opportunities is too great to list here. The more common internships pursued by previous students through U Uni 390 have included work with: U.S. Congress, federal judiciary and numerous federal executive agencies, various state agencies (Lt. Governor's Office, Attorney General, Correctional Services, Division of Criminal Justice, etc.), the New York Public Interest Research Group, the Civil Liberties Union, the Environmental Planning Lobby, Albany Medical Center, stock brokerage firms, law firms and media internships with local and national television stations and corporations. Further information and application forms for U Uni 390 may be obtained from the Office of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. In addition to the credit-bearing internships, there are also many opportunities for noncredit internships, mostly during the summer, some of which pay the participants a stipend. Information on many of these programs and their application process is available through the Career Development Center. Community and Public Service Through a community and public service program offered by the School of Social Welfare, undergraduates may earn up to 6 credits through enrollment in R Ssw 290 and 390. Through the program, students participate in volunteer work for a minimum of 100 hours per semester (about 7 \u00bd hours per week) in one of many public or private agencies involving different types of service to the community. A community and public service component is also a feature of the Project Renaissance Program. Study at Other Institutions Since not all courses are acceptable for transfer credit, matriculated students wishing to take courses at other institutions for credit toward the degree at this University should have prior approval in writing from their academic advisers. Such written approval must be filed with the Office of the Registrar, and an official transcript of work satisfactorily completed at the other institution(s) must be received before credit will be awarded. Credit may be earned through one of the following formally established programs. Cross-Registration: University at Albany undergraduate students ma y cross-register for courses at other campuses within this area while enrolled at this institution. Cross-registration enrollments elsewhere must be in courses not available through the University at Albany's curriculum. This program is available in fall and spring semesters only. Cross-registered students must be full-time undergraduate, matriculated students, and at least one-half of the credits for which a student is registered during a cross-registration semester must be from course work offered on the Albany campus. No extra tuition charge is assessed, but students are responsible for any fees that may be required by the host institution for a particular course. Credits earned through cross-registration are recorded on the transcript with a cross-registration course entry and the appropriate number of credits earned recorded in the \"graduation credit\" column. Grades earned at the other institutions are not recorded on the Albany transcript. Students seeking more information about the participating institutions and the courses available should contact the Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies, LI-36. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 23Office of International Education: Study Abroad and Exchanges Undergraduates may earn academic credit for a semester, an academic year, or a summer in one of many study abroad programs in most cultural or geographic regions of the world. A description of the programs currently offered by The University at Albany is presented in the section \"International Education.\" Study abroad and exchanges information is available in LI-66, by phone at (518) 442-3525, or by e-mail at intled@uamail.albany.edu (Web: http://www.albany.edu/studyabroad/ ). ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Corps) Albany undergraduate students have the opportunity to enroll in the Air Force ROTC program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute or the Army ROTC program at Siena College through the Hudson-Mohawk Association of Colleges and Universities' Cross-Registration Program. Military Science classes may provide valuable management and leadership instruction applicable in both the military and civilian environment. Leadership laboratory offers the essential elements of physical fitness in the context of dynamic and challenging leadership training activities. Students should contact the appropriate military science department on the two campuses for precise information regarding course content, sequencing and summer expectations.

UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC REGULATIONS As one of the Councils of the University Senate, the Undergraduate Academic Council recommends policy concerning undergraduate academic programs and regulations. To assist in academic governance, individual schools and colleges have collateral committees that can recommend academic policy to this council. It is the responsibility of each undergraduate student to be knowledgeable concerning pertinent academic policy. The University encourages students to accept the widest responsibility for their academic programs. For clarification and interpretation of the regulations contained in this section, students should contact the Office of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Policy Exceptions In rare cases and for extraordinary reasons, exceptions to University, college, school, and department academic regulations may be granted to individual students. A student who wishes an exception to an existing regulation should, in the case of a college, school or department regulation, consult with the head of the unit in question for the approved procedure for submitting an appeal. For exceptions to University regulations, students should contact the Committee on Academic Standing through the Office of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30). Standards of Academic Integrity Throughout their history, institutions of higher learning have viewed themselves and have been viewed by society as a community of persons not only seeking truth and knowledge, but seeking them in a truthful and ethical fashion. Indeed, the institution traditionally trusted by the public and the one to which it most often turns when unbiased, factual information is needed is the university . Thus, how a university behaves is as important as what it explores and learns. The University at Albany expects all members of its community to c onduct themselves in a manner befitting this tradition of honor and integrity. They are expected to assist the University by reporting suspected violations of academic integrity to appropriate faculty and/or administration offices. Behavior that is detrimental to the Univ ersity's role as an educational institution is unacceptable and requires attention by all citizens of its community. These guidelines, designed especially for students, define a context of values within which individual and institutional decisions on academic integrity can be made. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 29It is every student's re sponsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at the University. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. The following information, supplied by University Libraries ,provides additional information. You have access to many other research and information literacy resources here at the University at Albany. Take an information literacy course. These courses will help you to locate and evaluate information effectively \u2014skills that will help you not only with your studies, but also in the workplace. For more information, check the list of courses ( http://www.albany.edu/gened/inflit.html ) that meet the General Education Information Literacy Requirement. The University Libraries offer two such courses, one targeted towards the sciences. More information is available on both courses at: http://library.albany.edu/usered/unl205/index.ht ml Check out helpful tip sheets and other tutorials ( http://library.albany.edu/usered/ ). The University Libraries provide a wide array of guides and other instruction to answer your research-related questions . These include help on the research process, citation tip sheets, explanations of types of resources, information on how to locate a wide range of materials and how to evaluate them effectively, and much more. You will also find up to date Internet Tutorials ( http://library.albany.edu/internet/ ) that will help make you a pro at searching the Web! The University Libraries homepage ( http://library.albany.edu/ ) will provide you with access to all sorts of resources for doing research, including the online catalog and a wide variety of research databases. You will find links to contact librarians and to ask for help, and a great deal more. Take a look! The following is a list of the types of behaviors that are defined as examples of academic dishonesty and are therefore unacceptable. Attempts to commit such acts also fall under the term academic dishonesty and are subject to penalty. No set of guidelines can, of course, define all possible types or degrees of academic dishonesty; thus, the following descriptions should be understood as examples of infractions rather than an exhaustive list. Individual faculty members and the judicial boards of the University will continue to judge each case according to its particular merit. Plagiarism Presenting as one's own work the work of another person (for example, the words, ideas, information, data, evidence, organizing principles, or style of presentation of someone else). Plagiarism includes paraphrasing or summarizing without acknowledgment, submission of another student's work as one's own, the purchase of prepared research or completed papers or projects, and the unacknowledged use of research sources gathered by someone else. Failure to indicate accurately the extent and precise nature of one's reliance on other s ources is also a form of plagiarism. The stude nt is responsible for understanding the legitimate use of sources, the appropriate ways of acknowledging academic, scholarly, or creative indebtedness, and the consequences for violating University regulations. EXAMPLES OF PLAGIARISM INCLUDE : failure to acknowledge the source(s) of even a few phrases, sentences, or pa ragraphs; failure to acknowledge a quotation or paraphrase of paragraph-length sections of a paper; failure to acknowledge the source(s) of a major idea or the source(s) for an ordering principle central to the paper's or project's structure; failure to acknowledge the source (quoted, paraphrased, or summarized) of major sections or passages in the paper or project; the unacknowledged use of several major ideas or extensive reliance on another person's data, evidence, or critical method; submitting as one's own work, work borrowed, stolen, or purchased from someone else. Cheating on Examinations Giving or receiving unauthorized help before, during, or after an examination. Examples of unauthorized help include collaboration of any sort during an examination (unless specifically approved by the instructor); collaboration before an examination (when such collaboration is specifically forbidden by the instructor); the use of notes, books, or other aids during an examination (unless permitted by the instructor); arranging for another person to take an examination in one's place; looking upon someone else's examination during the examination period; intentionally allowing another student to look upon one's exam; the unauthorized discussing of test items during the examination period; and the passing of any examination information to students who have not yet taken the examination. There can be no conversation while an examination is in progress unless specifically authorized by the instructor. Multiple Submission Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit more than once, without the prior explicit consent of the instructor(s) to whom the material is being (or has in the past been) submitted. Forgery Imitating another person's signature on academic or other official documents (e.g., the signing of an adviser's name to an academic advising form). Sabotage Destroying, damaging, or stealing of another's work or working materials (including lab experi ments, computer programs, term papers, or projects). Unauthorized Collaboration Collaborating on projects, papers, or other academic exercises that is regarded as inappropriate by the instructor(s). Although the usual faculty assumption is that work submitted for credit is entirely one's own, standards on appropriate and inappropriate collaboration vary widely among individual faculty and the different disciplines. Students who want to confer or collaborate with one another on work receiving academic credit should make certain of the instructor's expectations and standards. Falsification Misrepresenting material or fabricating information in an academic exercise or assignment (for example, the false or misleading citation of sources, the falsification of experimental or computer data, etc.). Bribery Offering or giving any article of value or service to an instructor in an attempt to receive a grade or other benefits not legitimately earned or not available to other students in the class. Theft, Damage, or Misuse of Library or Computer Resources Removing uncharged library materials from the library, defacing or damaging library materials, intentionally displacing or hoarding materials within the library for one's unauthorized private use, or other abuse of reserve-book privileges. Or, without authorization, using the University's or another person's com puter accounts, codes, passwords, or facilities; damaging computer equipment; or interfering with the operation of the computing system of the University. The Computing Center has established specific rules governing the use of computing facilities. These rules are available at the Center and it is every student's responsibility to become familiar with them. Penalties and Procedures for Violations of Academic Integrity When a faculty member has information that a student has violated academic integrity in a course or program for which he or she is responsible and determines that a violation has occurred, he or she will inform the student and impose an appropriate sanction. A faculty member may make any one or a combination of the following responses to the infractions cited above: University at Albany 30 Warning without further penalty; requiring rewriting of a paper containing plagiarized material; lowering of a paper or project grade by one full grade or more; giving a failing grade on a paper containing plagiarized material; giving a failing grade on any examination in which cheating occurred; withholding permission to withdraw from the course after a penalty has been imposed; lowering a course grade by one full grade or more; giving a failing grade in a course; imposing a penalty uniquely designed for the particular infraction. If a faculty member announces a failing grade in the course as a possible result of academic dishonesty, the student receiving such a penalty will not be permitted to withdraw from the course unless the grievance or judicial system rules in favor of the student. Any faculty member encountering matters of academic dishonesty in an academic program or class for which he or she has responsibility may, in addition to, or in lieu of, the actions cited above, refer a case to the University Judicial System. After considering the case under the procedures provided by the University, the appropriate University judicial body will recommend the disposition of the case that can include disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion from the University. Faculty members are expected to report in writing to the Offices of Graduate or Undergraduate Studies, as appropriate, all sanctions they impose, along with a brief description of the incident. A copy of the report is to be given to the student. These offices will maintain a copy of such reports for the duration of a student's enrollment at the University. Upon graduation or separation of the student from the University, these confidential reports will be destroyed. Violations of academic integrity by graduate students are reported by faculty directly to the Office of Graduate Admissions and Policy for appropriate action. This office replaces the Office of Undergraduate Studies in all matters involving graduate student violations of academic integrity. Students who feel they have been erroneously penalized for an academic integrity infraction or think that a penalty is inappropriate may grieve these issues through procedures developed for each college, school, program, or department of the University. Copies of the procedures are maintained in Deans' offices, in the Office of Undergraduate Studies or Graduate Studies, and in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. A copy of the disposition of any grievance arising in matters of academic dishonesty will be attached to the faculty correspondence in the Offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Studies. When a student violates academic integrity in more than one academic exercise, whether those infractions occurred during the same or different periods of time or in the same or different courses, the University regards the offense as an especially serious subversion of academic integrity. The matter becomes particularly severe when the student has been confronted with the first infraction before the second is committed. Whenever the Office of Undergraduate or Graduate Studies receives a second academic integrity report on a student, the Dean will request a hearing before the University Judicial System. The Director of Libraries or the Computing Center, upon a finding of theft, damage, or misuse of facilities or resources, will forward all such cases to the University Judicial System for review and disposition, which can include suspension or expulsion from the University. The Director of the Library or the Computing Center may, in individual cases, limit access to the library or computing center pending action by the University Judicial System. In all other cases of academic dishonesty that come to the attention of any staff, faculty, or student, it is expected that the Dean of Undergraduate Studies will be notified of such infractions. The Dean of Undergraduate Studies will process all such alleged matters of academic dishonesty and refer them to the University Judicial System. The University Judicial System was established by the governing bodies of this campus and is administratively the responsibility of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Any questions about the procedures of the University Judicial System may be secured by inquiry to that office. Policy for Freedom of Expression The University reaffirms its commitment to the principle that the widest possible scope for freedom of expression is the foundation of an institution dedicated to vigorous inquiry, robust debate, and the continuous search for a proper balance between freedom and order. The University seeks to foster an environment in which persons who are on its campus legitimately may express their views as widely and as passionately as possible; at the same time, the University pledges to provide the greatest protection available for controversial, unpopular, dissident, or minority opinions. The University believes that censorship is always suspect, that intimidation is always repugnant, and that attempts to discourage constitutionally protected expression may be antithetical to the University's essential missions: to discover new knowledge and to educate. All persons on University-controlled premises are bound by the Rules and Regulations for Maintenance of Public Order, which deal in part with freedom of expression (adopted by the Board of Trustees of the of the State University of New York June 18,1969; amended 1969,1980). Members of the University community should familiarize themselves with those rules and regulations. In addition, University faculty are protected by and bound by Article XI, Title 1, Sec. I of the Policies of the Board of Trustees (adopted January 1987), entitled \"Academic Freedom.\" University officials or other members of the University community in a position to review posters, publications, speak ers, performances, or any other form of expression may establish legitimate time, place, and manner regulations for the maintenance of an orderly educational environment; however, they may not prohibit expression for any reason related to the content of the expression, except as permitted in those narrow areas of expression devoid of federal or state constitutional protection. Speakers invited to campus by University groups or individuals, and other speakers who may be legitimately present on campus, will be given the utmost protection to communicate their messages without disruptive harassment or interference. Opponents to those speakers enjoy the same protections for expressing their dissent. All members of the University community share the duty to support, protect, and extend the commitment to the principle of freedom of expression, and to discuss this commitment with groups or individua ls who seek to take part in University life. While all persons may seek to peacefully discourage speech that may be unnecessarily offensive to particular individuals or groups, speech that may be antithetical to the Univ ersity's values, those persons must support the legal right of free speech. Under Section 1.5 of its charge, the Council on Academic Freedom and Ethics will serve as a hearing body available to those members of the University community who feel their freedom of expression has been unfairly suppressed. The Council will report its findings to the President for further review and action. Notification of Rights under FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights are: 1) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, or head of the academic department [or appropriate official] written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 312) The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify th e part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3) The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is defined as a person employed by the University in an admini strative, supervisory, academic, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or assisting another school official in performing his or her ta sks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. 4) Upon request, the University discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. 5) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Washington, DC 20202-4605 Release of Student Information by Registrar The following is the policy of control of student academic information to released by the Office of the Registrar: 1) Only the following information may be released to any outside source not officially connected to the State University of New York or one of its agents: a) Any information listed as \"directory information\" by the University. b) Dates of attendance c) If the student received a degree, and if so, which degree. 2) Any office of the State University of New York or its agent may have released to it any information kept on a student on a \"need-to-know\" basis 3) No further information will be released without the written consent of the student. Absolutely no transcript of students' records will be released outside the University without their signed authorization. Official Notifica tions to Students Official University notifications to students are sent to their permanent addresses on file with the Registrar. Students are responsible for insuring that their permanent addresses are kept up-to-date by reviewing and changing as appropriate their address information on MyUAlbany. School or College Enrollment Most students are advised in the Advisement Services Center/ Undergraduate Studies during their freshman year. When students have been accepted to a major, they are enrolled in the school or college offering study in the desired major field, these are the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Business, Criminal Justice, Public Affairs, and Social Welfare. In line with policy developed by the Committee on Academic Standing, a particular department, school or college within the University may permit a student to enroll as a major who has not completed a minimum of 24 graduation credits. Upon approval of the Committee on Academic Standing of the Undergraduate Academic Council additional conditions of initial and continued enrollment as a major may be required by individual departments, school s, or colleges. Class Standing Students are classified by the Registrar's Office on the basis of graduation credits, as follows: Freshmen Fewer than 24 crs Sophomore 24-55 crs Junior 56-87 crs Senior 88 or more crs Attendance and Timely Compliance with Course Requirements Students are expected to attend all classes and all examinations and to complete all course requirements on time. Faculty have the prerogative of developing an attendance policy whereby attendance and/or participation is part of the grade. As noted in the following section, \"Sy llabus Requirement,\" instructors are obliged to announce and interpret all course requirements, including specific attendance policies, to their classes at the beginning of the term; an instructor may modify this or other requirements in the syllabus but \"must give notice in class of any modification\" and must do so \"in a timely fashion.\" Students will not be excused from a class or an examination or completion of an assignment by the stated deadline except for a compelling reason . Students who miss a cl ass period, a final or other examination, or other obligations for a course (fieldwork, required attendance at a concert, etc.) must notify the instructor or the Dean of Undergraduate Studies of that compelling reason and must do so in a timely fashion. Although the Office of Undergraduate Studies provides letters to instru ctors asking that students with compelling reasons be granted consideration in completing their work, faculty are strongly encouraged to use their best judgment when students have appropriate documentation for legitimate absences and not to rely on Undergraduate Studies when it is not necessary. If the student foresees a time conflict in advance that will prevent attendance at a class or examination or completion of an assignment, the student is expected to bring this to the attention of the instructor or the Dean of Undergraduate Studies as soon as the c onflict is noted. In the case of an unforeseen event, the student is expected to notify the instructor or the Dean of Undergraduate Studies at the student's first opportunity to do so after the fact. This timeliness is important since if the reason cited by the student is not considered a sufficient excuse, the student will need to know this as soon as possible. Even if the reason warrants granting the excuse, a student's delay in contacting the instructor or the Dean of Undergraduate Studies may make it more difficult for the University to assist the student with acceptable options of making up the work that was missed. Although University officials will consider each student's request on its own merits and not attempt to define ahead of time the validity of all the possible reasons a student might give for missing a class or an examination, there are three types of reasons for which excuses will generally be granted: (a) illness, tragedy, or other personal emergency; (b) foreseeable time conflicts; and (c) religious observance. It shall be the student's responsibility to provide sufficient University at Albany 32 documentation to support any request. (In this context, it should be noted that fraudulent excuses are considered violations of academic integrity and are grounds for academic or disciplinary penalties,) a. ILLNESS AND EMERGENCIES : If the cause is documented hospitalization or other significant medical reason, a tragic or traumatic experience, or other personal emergency, the student should contact the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30) as soon as the student is able to do so. Depending on the nature of the problem, the student may be requested to provide additional documentation. If the Dean grants the student an excuse, the Dean will no tify the instructor(s) involved of this fact and of the date(s) for which the student has been excused. An instructor in this case may not penalize the student academically for the absence and is expected to provide reasonable assistance to the student concerning instruction and assignments that were missed. If an examination was missed, the instructor must administer a make-up examination or offer an alternative mutually agreeable to the instructor and the student. Any conflicts between student and faculty in accepting the alternative may be presented for resolution to the Chair of the department in which the course is offered. b. COMPELLING TIME CONFLICTS : If the cause of the absence is a major academic conference at which the student has a significant participation, a varsity athletic contest (excluding practice sessions and intra-squad games), a field trip in another course, or some other compelling time conflict, the student must notify the professor involved as soon as possible, providing verification of the conflict. When a student clearly would have been able to notify the instructor well in advance of the conflict, the student is required to do so. If an excuse is granted, the instructor is expected to provide, if at all possible, an alternative by which the student will not be penalized as a result of the conflict. Any conflicts between student and faculty in accepting the alternative may be presented for resolution to the Chair of the department in which the course is offered. c. RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE : Absences for religious observance are covered by Section 224-a. of the Education Law: \"Students unable because of religious beliefs to register or attend classes on certain days.\" 1. No person shall be expelled from or be refused admission as a student to an institution of higher education for the reason that he or she is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to register or attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day or days. 2. Any student in an institution of higher education who is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to attend classes on a particular day or days shall, because of such absence on the particular day or days, be excused from any examination or any study or work requirements. 3. It shall be the responsibility of the faculty and of the administrative officials of each institution of higher education to make available to each student who is absent from school, because of his religious beliefs, an equivalent opportunity to register for classes or make up any examination, study, or work requirements which he or she may have missed because of such absence on any particular day or days. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the said student such equivalent opportunity. 4. If registration, classes, examinations, study, or work requirements are held on Friday after four o'clock post meridian or on Saturday, similar or makeup classes, examinations, study or work requirements or opportunity to register shall be made available on other days, where it is possible and practicable to do so. No special fees shall be charged for these classes, examinations, study or work requirements or re gistration held on other days. 5. In effectuating the provisions of this section, it shall be the duty of the faculty and of the administrative officials of each institution of higher education to exercise the fullest measure of good faith. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his availing himself of the provisions of this section. 6. Any student who is aggrieved by the alleged failure of any faculty or administrative official to comply in good faith with the provisions of this section shall be entitled to maintain an action or proceeding in the supreme court of the county in which such institution of higher education is located for the enforcement of his rights under this section. 6-a. It shall be the responsibility of the administrative officials of each institution of higher education to give written notice to students of their rights under this section, informing them that each student who is absent from school, because of his or her religious beliefs, must be given an equivalent opportunity to register for classes or make up any examination, study or work requirements which he or she may have missed because of such absence on any particular day or days. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to such student such equivalent opportunity. 7. As used in this sec tion, the term \"institution of higher education\" shall mean any institution of higher education, recognized and approved by the regents of the University of the state of New York, which provides a course of study leading to the granting of a post-secondary degree or diploma. Such term shall not include any institution which is operated, supervised or controlled by a church or by a religious or denominational organization whose educational programs are principally designed for the purpose of training ministers or other religious functionaries or for the purpose of propagating religious doctrin es. As used in this section, the term \"religious belief\" shall mean beliefs associated with any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes, which is not disqualified for tax exemption under section 501 of the United States Code. As amended by Laws of 1992, chapter 278 Syllabus Requirement The instructor of every section of an under graduate class at the University at Albany shall provide each student in the section a printed or web-published copy of the syllabus for that section distributed during the first week of the class (preferably on the first regularly scheduled day the section meets) This syllabus must contain at least the information defined below. Each instructor retains the right to modify the syllabus and give notice in class of any modifications in a timely fashion. Students are responsible to apprise themselves of such notices. This requirement becomes effective with the fall 2002 semester. MINIMUM CONTENTS OF A CLASS SYLLABUS : Catalog number and title of the course Term and class number of the section Location(s) and meeting times of the section Instructor's name and title If applicable, name(s) of teaching assistants in the class Instructor's contact information (e.g., e-mail address, office phone number, office location, fax) Instructor's office hours Course description, overview and objective(s) If applicable, General Education category/categories met by the course and how the course fulfills those General Education objectives Prerequisites of the course The instructor should specifically indicate those prerequisites that are critical to success in the class and that are enforceable. Grading scheme Whether the course is A-E or S/U graded Overall method by which grades will be determined (\"weights\" of exams, class participation, etc.) Course requirements, including but not limited to: Required textbooks Other required materials, purchases; fees (when applicable) Projected date and time of class exams, papers, projects, midterm, and final Attendance policies for the class General paper, project, and test requirements Requirement of Internet for course work, when applicable Safety policies (when applicable) The course syllabus may also include such additional information as the instructor deems appropriate or necessary. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 33Course Enrollment Students ordinarily enroll in courses at the level appropriate to their class. Individual departments have the authority to require a C or S grade in courses that are prerequisite for advanced courses in that area. Senior Enrollment in 100-Level Courses: Students with senior status (credits completed plus credits in progress equal to or exceeding 88) shall be allowed into courses at the 100 level only during the Program Adjustment period as defined by the University Calendar. This restriction does not apply to Music Performance courses and any summer session courses. Other exceptions may be granted by the Office of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30). Graduate Courses for Undergraduate Credit: A senior with a superior academic record may register for a 500-level course for undergraduate credit with the approval of the major department chair and the course instructor. In exceptional circumstances, seniors may be authorized to register for 600-level graduate courses provided they have completed most of the upper division undergraduate and other courses essential to their major and require a graduate course to strengthen it. To qualify for such enrollment the senior must have a superior record, particularly in his or her major field. To register for a 600-level course, students must have the approval of their adviser and obtain the written consent of their department chair and the instructor offering the course. The department chair should arrange for copies of these consents to be distributed to the persons involved and to be filed in the student's official folder. Graduate Courses for Graduate Credit: Seniors of high academic standing in the University may receive graduate credit for graduate courses taken in excess of undergraduate requirements in the last semester of their senior year provided not more than 6 credits are needed to complete the student's undergraduate program. Consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies is required and must be obtained in advance of registration to receive such credit. Seniors who are perm itted to take courses for graduate credit in their last semester also must make formal application for admission to a graduate program and be accepted as a graduate student before registering for study in the final semester. Auditing Courses Informal Audit: This category of audit permits any student or resident of the state to visit any course (except those listed here). The informal auditor visits courses without tuition, fees, examinations, grading, or credit; and no record is maintained. The inst ructor determines the level of participation of the informal auditor. A student matriculated at Albany confers with the instructor of the course and requests consent to visit the course. An individual not matriculated at this University must first contact the Office of General Studies and then obtain consent of the individual instructor of the course. NOTE: Info rmal Audit is not allowed during Summer Session. Formal Audit: This category of audit allows any student to formally audit any course (except those listed here ). The formal auditor pays regular tuition and fees, and the course is entered on the transcript of the student with the grade of N (noncredit) or W (withdrawn) according to 6. as follows. Exceptions: Generally, the following types of courses cannot be formally audited: practica, internships, research and independent study cour ses, field courses, clinical courses, workshops, and foreign study programs. Students who feel they have an extraordinary need to audit these courses must prepare a written rationale and submit it to the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Formal audit of graduate-level courses is restricted as outlined in 3. below. If a course is filled and has auditors in it, a student wishing to take the course for credit may displace the auditor. Formal Audit Policies 1. The student must register for the courses during the program adjustment period. 2. Students must pay the regular tuition and fees based on their academic status. Fees and tuition will be based on the student's total load, including courses formally audited. Credits taken by formal audit will not count toward full-time status for the purposes of academic retention. 3. Registration for the formally audited course must be approved by the student's academic adviser (for nonmatriculated students, either the Office of General Studies or the Office of Admissions) and the course instructor. A senior with a superior academic record may formally audit a 500-level course with the approval of the academic adviser, the major department chair, and the course instructor. In exceptional circumstances, a senior may be authorized to formally audit a 600-level graduate course provided the student has completed most of the upper-division undergraduate and other courses essential to the major field. To formally audit a 600-level course, students must have the approval of their adviser and obtain the written consent of their department chair and the instructor offering the course. The department chair will arrange for copies of these consents to be distributed to the persons involved and to be filed in the student's official folder. 4. A student may not change from credit to audit or from audit to credit after the last day to add a course. 5. The formal audit option is limited to a maximum of two courses per term for each student. 6. An individual who formally audits a course must participate in appropriate ways as determined by the instructor. It will be the responsibility of the student to ascertain from the instructor the degree of participation required. The course will appear at the end of the term on the transcript of the student with a grade of N (noncredit). A formal auditor may withdraw from a course not later than one week after the mid-semester date as stated in the academic calendar and be assigned a W. A student failing to participate satisfactorily will be withdrawn and assigned a W. 7. Although not recommended, formally audited undergraduate courses may be taken for graduation credit at a later date. Formally audited graduate cour ses may not be taken again for graduate credit. Adding Courses All students must drop and add courses on the Web via www.albany.edu/myualbany . From the first class day through the sixth class day of the semester, enter myualbany on the web and enter the class number of the course. If the course is closed or restricted, a Permission Number from the instructor is also necessary. From the seventh class day through the tenth class day of the semester, a Permission Number from the instructor is required for all adds. Enter myualbany on the web, enter the class number and the Permission Number for the course. Subject to the approval of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, after the tenth class day of the semester, a Section Key Number from the instructor must be obtained before the Program Adjustment can be accepted by the Registrar's Office. After the tenth class day of the semester, all late adds must be done in person at the Registrar's Office, CC-B25. A fee will be charged for this Program Adjustment. In the event permission to late add a course after the tenth day of class is denied, a student may appeal that decision for any reason to the Committee on Academic Standing of the Undergraduate Academic Council. University at Albany 34 A \"class day\" is here defined to be any day from Monday through Friday in which classes are in session and the Registrar's Office is open. The above methods of adding a course apply to quarter (\"8 week\") courses and summer se ssion course work on a prorated basis, determined by the length of the course in question. Dropping Courses All students must drop and add courses on the Web via www.albany.edu/myualbany . From the first class day through the tenth class day of the semester, enter myualbany on the web and enter the class number of the course. During this time, a dropped course will be removed from the student's record. A \"class day\" is defined as in \"Adding Courses\" above. After the tenth class day through the \"last day to drop a course\" (as specified in the Academic Calendar) a student may drop a course entering myualbany on the web and entering the class number of the course. During this time, a dropped course will remain on the student's record and an indicator of W will be entered in the grade column. The W will be entered regardless of whether the student has ever attended a class. If a faculty member announces a failing grade in the course as a possible result of academic dishonesty, the student receiving such a penalty will not be permitted to withdraw from the course unless the grievance or judicial system rules in favor of the student. A student still enrolled in a class after the \"last day to drop\" is expected to fulfill the course requirements. The grade recorded for the course shall be determined on this basis. A student who re gisters for a course but never attends or ceases attendance before the tenth class day, as reported by the instructor, yet does not officially drop the course shall have an indicator of Z listed in the grade column on his/her record. The above methods of dropping a course apply to quarter (\"8 week\") courses and summer session course work on a prorated basis, determined by the length of the course in question. Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Committee on Academic Standing of the Undergraduate Academic Council. Note: Students receiving financial assistance through state awards should refer to Academic Criteria for State Awards in the Financial Aid and Estimated Costs sections of this bulletin before withdrawing from courses. Policies to Deregister Students Failure to Attend Class Beginning on the seventh class day, instructors may deregister students who fail to attend class, explain absence, or officially drop within the first six days of classes of a term unless prior arrangements have been made by the student with the instructor. The policy to deregister students is limited to the add period at the beginning of the semester. For courses that meet only once each week, including laboratory courses, the instructor may deregister students who do not attend the first scheduled class. The above policy also applies to quarter (\"8 week\") courses and summer session courses on a prorated basis, depending on the length of the course in question. A \"class day\" is defined as in \"Adding a Course\" above. Beginning with the Spring 2000 semester: For courses that meet only once each week, including laboratory courses, the instructor may deregister students who do not attend the first scheduled class. WARNING : Not all faculty exercise this prerogative. The fact that you didn't attend doesn't guarantee that your professor dropped you from the course. Students must take the responsibility for dropping a course on the Web via www.albany.edu/myualbany .if they wish to avoid an E or U in that course. Lack of Prerequisite(s) Students may be deregistered who lack the prerequisite(s) of the course at any time within the term or quarter the course is being taught. The Registrar will assign students who have been deregistered after the program adjustment period a grade of W for the course. Transfer of Credit After Matriculation Since not all courses are acceptable for transfer credit, students wishing to take courses at other institutions for credit towa rd the degree at this University should have prior approval in writing from their academic advisers. Such written approval must be filed with The Registrar's Office, and an official transcript of work satisfactorily completed at the other institution(s) must be received by that office before credit will be awarded. Full-Time, Part-Time Defined A student registered for a minimum of 12 credits within the semester is classified as a full-time student. Students registered for fewer than 12 credits are classified as part-time students for the semester. Credit Load A normal semester load is 15 credits . The maximum number of credits for which a student registers in a semester is an individual matter. The maximum credit load for a student in a given semester is determined with the advice and consent of that student's academic adviser. It is incumbent upon students to present a rationale to their academic adviser for registration for more than 15 credits. No undergraduate may register for more than 19 credits. The Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30) may authorize students to register for more than 19 credits. Students must present compelling academic justification and have the approval of their academic adviser or major department for a request to exceed 19 credits to be considered. Repeating Courses Courses that can be repeated for graduation credit are so indicated within the course descriptions contained in this bulletin. The following shall apply to students who enroll more than one time in a course that cannot be repeated for credit: 1. Appropriate registrations in the course, as of the last day to add a course in a term as specified in the academic calendar, shall be listed on the student's Academic Record; all A-E grades for such courses will be computed in the average. 2. The total graduation credit applicable toward the student's degree shall only be the credit for which that course has been assigned; i.e., graduation credit for the course can only be counted once. Repeating Courses to Meet Program Admission Requirements For the purposes of calculating admissions requirements into restricted majors or programs, once a student has received the grade of B- or higher in a course, no future grade in that course or its equivalent will be used in determining the student's average for admission to that major or program. An \"equivalent\" course, for purposes of this policy, is any course for which the student cannot receive credit by virtue of his or her having satisfactorily completed the original course. Final Examinations General Policy: In many courses, final examinations are an integral part of the learning and evaluative process. Some courses, by virtue of the structure, material, or style of presentation, do not require a final examination. The following policy in no way requires an instructor to administer a final examination. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 35Final examinations in semester-long undergraduate courses in the University are to be given only during the scheduled final examination period in accordance with the official schedule of ex aminations as published by the Registrar's Office. The term \"final examination\" as used here shall be defined as any examination of more than one-half hour's duration that is given in the terminal phase of a course. As defined, \"final examinations\" may be either comprehensive, covering the majority of the content of a course, or limited to only a portion of the content of a course. No examinations of more than one-half hour's duration are to be given during the last five regularly scheduled class days of a semester. Instructors seeking any exceptions to the above policy must submit a written request through their respective department chair to their college dean, or directly to their dean in those schools with no departmental structure. If the dean approves the exceptions, the instructor must notify the class of the new scheduled final examination date at least three weeks before the last regularly scheduled class day of the semester. At the end of each semester, each college and school dean must submit to the vice president for academic affairs a summary of all exceptions granted to the final examination policy. The above regulations notwithstanding, the instructor in any course should always retain the freedom to reschedule a final examination for an individual student should such a student present a case of unquestionable hardship in his or her scheduled examinations. Such rescheduling should, however, be done in the final examination period if at all possible. Three Finals on One Day: If a student has three examinations in one day as a result of a departmental exam or of the official rescheduling of an examination after the initial final examination schedule has been published, then that student has the right to be given a makeup examination for the departmental or rescheduled examination. The request for such an exam must be made to the instructor in the appropriate course no later than two weeks before the last day of classes of the given semester. If possible, the makeup examination should be given within the final examination period. Retention of Exams: Each instructor shall retain the final examination papers in his/her courses for one semester so those students wishing to see their papers may do so. This regulation does not apply in those instances in which the instructor chooses to return the papers to the students at the end of the course. Grading The undergraduate grading system for the University will include the following grades: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, E. The normative grading pattern is A-E. However, students may receive S/U grades in two circumstances: In sections and/or courses that have been designated by depart ments or schools as S/U graded. In courses normally graded A-E in which the student selects S*/U* grading. Students who matriculated in fall 1991 and thereafter are limited to a maximum of 2 courses of S* by student selection, and these courses must be below the 300-level . These 2 courses of S* may be in addition to all S grades received in department or school designated S/U graded sections or courses. Note: in specific courses approved by the UAC Curriculum Committee, a department, school, or program may require A-E grading for majors. See also \"Grading Option Deadline\" below. A-E grades are defined as follows: A- Excellent, B-Good, C-Fair, D-Poor, and E- Failure. The grade of E is a failing grade and cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements. For students matriculating before Fall 1997: The grade of D can be used to fulfill graduation requirements only if it is balanced at the same institution by credit with the grades of A or B. Note that, for each credit of B one credit of D is balanced, and for each credit of A two credits of D are balanced. For balancing purposes, pluses and minuses associated with a grade are ignored. Beginning with the Fall 1997 semester , the grade of S is defined as equivalent to the grade of C or higher and is acceptable to fulfill graduation requirements. The grade of U (C- or lower) is unsatisfactory and is not acceptable to fulfill graduation requirements. Transfer D Grades: 1. Students matriculating before Fall 2000 can transfer in D's if they are balanced at the same institution by a grade of B or better, whether the transfer course was taken before or after they matriculated. 2. Students matriculating in Fall 2000 through Summer 2001 can transfer in balanced D's from prematriculation course work, but they cannot transfer any D's for postmatriculation transfer courses. 3. Students matricul ating in Fall 2001 and thereafter cannot transfer in any grades of D. 4. However, except for the University's writing requirements, for which a grade of C or higher or S is required, transfer work graded D in a course that applies to one or more of the University's General Education requirements may be applied toward fulfilling the requirements, even if the student receives no graduation credit for the course. Additionally, the following grades may be assigned: I Incomplete. No graduation credit. A temporary grade requested by the student and assigned by the instructor only when the student has nearly completed the course requirements but because of circumstances beyond the student's control the work is not completed. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor, but may not be longer than one month before the end of the semester following that in which the incomplete is received. The instructor assigns the appropriate academic grade no later than the stated deadline, or extends the existing incomplete grade to the next semester. Any grade of I existing after the stated deadline shall be automatically changed to E or U according to whether or not the student is enrolled for A-E or S/U grading. Except for extenuating circumstances approved by the Office of Undergraduate Studies, these converted grades may not be later changed. (Students receiving financial assistance through state awards should refer to Academic Criteria for State Awards in the expenses and financial aid section of this bulletin before requesting grades of I.) N Noncredit. W An indicator assigned by the appropriate administrative officer indicating a student withdrew from the Un iversity, withdrew from an entire course load for a summer session, or dropped a course after the last day to add. For information and completeness, the W is placed on the permanent academic record. The W is not used in any computation of quality point or cumulative average totals. Z An indicator assigned by the appropriate administrative officer indicating a student enrolled in a course, never attended or failed to attend after the last day to add, and took no official action to drop the course. For information and completeness, the Z is placed on the permanent academic record. The Z is not used in any computation of quality point or cumulative average totals. Grade Changes An instructor may not permit students in an undergraduate course to submit additional work or to be reexamined for the purpose of improving their grades after the course has been completed. Also, The Registrar's Office may not enter a change of grade without the approval of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, except, of course, for changes of I to a final grade. A grade of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, E, S, or U may not be changed to a grade of I. On a case-by-case basis and for good cause, the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies continues to have the power to allow grade changes for reasons deemed legitimate. University at Albany 36 Grading Option Deadline Students may change their option (A-E or S/U) for courses not departme ntally designated for S/U grading until two weeks after the last day to add courses. Changes in grading selections cannot be authorized beyond the date specified. The grading option may be changed by filing the appropriate form with The Registrar's Office by the date specified in the academic calendar. When discussing with an instructor their progress in a course, students should inform the instructor if they are taking the course S/U. Academic Average The grades of A, A- B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, and E shall be the only grades used to determine an average. Grades shall be weighted as follows: A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ =3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0, C- = 1.7, D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, D- = 0.7, and E = 0.0. The student's academic average is the result of the following calculation: 1. The number of credits for courses receiving A-E grades is totaled. 2. Each grade's weight is multiplied by the number of credits for the course receiving that grade. 3. The results of these multiplications are totaled to yield a weighted total. 4. The weighted total is divided by the total number of credits receiving A-E grades to yield an academic average. Student Academic Record A student's official progress records are maintained by the Registrar's Office. Grades for the semester are available to the student via MyUAlbany following the posting of grades by the Registrar. Academic Retention Standards Since the University requires that students have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 and an average of 2.0 in the major and the minor in order to earn a bachelor's degree, the grade point average is an important indicator of the ability to achieve a bachelor's degree. Thus, the following policies are in effect for students whose performance indicates that they are in danger of failing to meet the conditions necessary to earn a degree. IMPLEMENTATION NOTE : Although these revised policies have been implemented for all undergraduates, entirely replacing the former Academic Probation, Terminal Academic Probation, and Academic Dismissal standards for both non-EOP and EOP students, no student who matriculated prior to fall 2000 shall be dismissed or deregistered under the new standards if that student's record under the former standards would not have resulted in dismissal or deregistration, respectively. Academic Warning A student whose semester grade point average falls below a 2.0 (but above a 1.0) will receive an Academic Warning from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, with a copy sent to the academic adviser. This action will not subject the student to any further penalty but is intended to remind the student of the University's po licies as well as to inform the student of the resources available to ensure good progress in achieving an undergraduate degree. Academic Probation 1) A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on Academic Probation for the following semester. A student placed on academic probation will be notified by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, with a copy sent to the academic adviser, and will be advised of the resources available to assist students in improving their academic standing. 2) Students on Academic Probation will be expected to improve their academic performance immediately. They must raise the cumulative GPA to at least 2.0 to be removed from academic probation. Students who fail to meet this condition will be placed on Terminal Probation in the following semester. Terminal Probation 1) A student will be placed on Terminal Probation for the following semester if either of the following occur: the student's semester GPA is below 1.0 the student has a cumulative GPA below 2.0 for a second semester 2) Students on Terminal Probation for a semester are in danger of academic dismissal at the end of that semester . Therefore, as a condition of continuing their enrollment at Albany, they must complete an \"Academic Improvement Plan\" to improve their academic performance in consultation with their academic adviser, and must file this plan with the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies by the end of the Add/Drop period. (Failure to file this form could result in immediate deregistration from the University.) 3) If the student achieves a semester GPA and cumulative GPA of at least 2.0, the student will be removed from Terminal Probation. 4) If the student's semester GPA is at least a 2.0 but the cumulative GPA remains below 2.0, the student will remain on Terminal Probation and must continue to meet the conditions described in section 2) above. The student must raise the cumulative GPA to at least 2.0 to be removed from Terminal Probation. 5) If the student earns a semester GPA below a 2.0 while on Terminal Probation, the student will be dismissed. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal will occur only if a student has been on Terminal Probation and fails to earn a semester GPA of at least 2.0. The student's record will have the notation \"Academic Dismissal. \" Students who have been academically dismissed have the right to seek reinstatement to the University by submitting a written petition to the Committee on Academic Standing through the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Academic Dismissal Policy for Educational Opportunities Program Students Students enrolled at the University through the Educational Opportunities Program will be granted an additional semester on Academic Probation before they are subject to Terminal Probation, even if their cumulative GPA is below a 2.0. Good Academic Standing The term \"in good academic standing\" (satisfactory academic standing) means that a student is making satisfactory progress toward a degree and is eligible or has been allowed to register and take academic course work at this campus for the current term. Students placed on \"Academic Probation\" or \"Terminal Academic Probation\" are considered to be in good academic standing since they are making satisfactory progress toward a degree and are still authorized to continue studying toward their degrees. Academic Probation only serves as an academic warning that a student is in danger of not meeting minimum academic retention standards and being terminated from the University. Only those students who are officially terminated from the University are considered not to be in good academic standing. (The above definition should not be confused with the academic standing criteria for eligibility for New York State financial awards as detailed in the Financial Aid section of this publication.) Academic Grievances The Committee on Academic Standing of the Undergraduate A cademic Council is responsible for insuring and reviewing procedures for individual student academic grievances at the school and college level. Most academic grievances are expected to be resolved at the school or college level. However, if (1) the student feels due process was not followed at the school or college level or if (2) the student feels the decision rendered at the school or college level warrants further review, the student may address a petition to the Committee on Academic Standing of the UAC for a review of the case The action of this committee is final except in grievances Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 37arising out of grades assigned due to violations of academic integrity. CAS action on academic integrity grievances will be reviewed by and must be approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs before implementation. If the case has also been submitted to the student judicial system for University action, the Vice President for Academic Affairs will consult for the Vice President for Student Affairs before rendering a final decision. Each school and college shall have established procedures for considering student academic grievances. Copies of the established procedures shall be available to students upon request . Students should contact the office of the dean of the academic unit involved if further information is desired or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Students challenging an academic grade must first discuss their grievances with the instructor involved. If not resolved to the student's satisfaction at this level, the grievance must then be discussed with the appropriate department chair. Failure to obtain satisfactory resolution at this level shall lead to the school or college review as stated in its procedures. Any such requests on the school or college level must be appropriately reviewed and a decision rendered. Leave for Approved Study 1. Students may appl y for permission to pursue a Leave with th e Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30, 518-442-5821. That office shall ascertain that the student has been informed of University residency requirements, including major, minor and senior residency minima. Students interested in pursuing an approved leave must submit an application and other necessary paperwork prior to the beginning of the semester following their departure from the University. Completion of the semester prior to the commencement of the leave is required. 2. Study must be in an approved program at another college or university. 3. A leave for approved study is granted for only one semester and can be granted for a maximum of two semest ers. A request for a leave implies an intent to return to the University in the next successive semester after completion of the leave. 4. Adviser approval is necessary for the leave to be approved. If the student was admitted through the EOP program, approval of the EOP director is necessary. 5. A student may pursue part-time or full-time course work during the leave. 6. A student who has satisfied the previous conditions and whose University at Albany cumulative average, as well as the GPA in the major and minor, is at least 2.00 at the time the proposed leave would begin will be granted a Leave for Approved Study. 7. A student who has satisfied the previous conditions and whose University at Albany cumulative average is less than 2.00 at the time the proposed leave would begin has the right to seek prior approval for a Leave for Approved Study by written petition to the Committee on Academic Standing. 8. Academically dismissed students are not eligible for leaves for approved study. Withdrawing from the University Students may voluntarily depart from the University up to and including the last day of classes in a semester as indicated by the academic calendar. The date of departure is generally defined as the date the student signs a departure form in the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Studies (LC 30). For students seeking to depart due to medical/ psychological reasons, the date of departure will be set by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, in consultation with the University Health Center or University Counseling Center, as appropriate. Drops will be done for each currently registered course reflecting the departure date. After the last day of classes, the appropriate academic grade will be assigned by the instructor for each registered course, regardless of class attendance. Academic retention standards will be applied. Departures due to medical/ psychological reasons must be recommended by the University Health Center or University Counseling Center upon review of documentation supplied by a licensed health care practitioner or treatment facility. In order for action to be taken on an application for readmission submitted by a student who departed for medical/psychological reasons, clearance must be granted by the University Health Center or University Counseling Center. POLICIES CONCERNING WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY The following are the withdrawal policies and procedures currently in effect for matriculated undergraduates: a. A student withdrawing from an entire semester's course load must complete a Departure Form in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. b. Students who voluntarily leave the University with a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or above may automatically return within six semesters from the date of departure. c. Students who voluntarily leave the University with a cumulative grade point average of less than 2.00 will be withdrawn effective with the date they initiate their departure. d. A student with a cumulative grade point average of less than 2.0 who withdraws from the University more than 15 class days after the mid-point of the semester is not eligible for readmission for the following semester. Should the student wish to petition for readmission for the next term, the petition must be submitted to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies no later than the last day of finals as published in the Academic Calendar for the semester in which the withdrawal was initiated. (See Academic Calendar.) e. Grade assignment will be based on the following: If the departure drops occur by the last date to drop without receiving W's, no grade will be recorded. If the departure drops occur after that date, a grade of W will be assigned for each currently registered course through the last day of classes for the semester. After the last day of classes, the appropriate academic grade will be assigned by the instructor for each registered course, regardless of class attendance. Academic retention standards will be applied. f. Retroactive departure/drop dates normally will not be granted. Requests for exceptions will be considered by the Undergraduate Dean's Office (LC 30) only for extraordinary, fully documented circumstances . g. A student who registers and receives grades of \" Z\" for all course work for the semester will incur full financial liability. h. Departures from the University due to medical reasons, active military duty and disciplinary suspensions or disciplinary dismissals must be administered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30) i. A student eligible for an automatic return who fails to register after a period of six semesters will be administratively withdrawn by the University. Such action will require submission of a readmission application should the student wish to return at a future time. University at Albany 38 Questions regarding financial obligations or refunds as a result of leaving the University should be directed to the Office of Student Accounts in CC 26 or by calling (518-442-3202). Students living in residence halls who find it necessary to leave the University must contact the Office of Residential Life in State Quad, or call (518- 442-5875). Return/Readmission Procedure Formerly matriculated undergraduates who left the University with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 may automatically return within six semesters from the date of departure. Students who were academically dismissed or whose University at Albany cumulative grade point average is less than a 2.00 must petition the Committee on Academic Standing as part of the readmission process. Applications for readmission as well as petition forms are available from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduates Studies, LC 30 (518-442-5821). The appropriate subcommittee of the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standing will make a recommendation concerning the readmission of any student who was dismissed for academic reasons and/or whose cumulative grade point average at the University is less than 2.00. The admitting officer of the University may find it necessary to deny readmission to a student for whom there has been a positive recommendation, but the admitting officer of the University shall not readmit any student contrary to the recommendation of the subcommittee of the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standing. Readmission is based upon the student's prior academic record as well as recommendations from other involved offices. Returning students who left on academic probation, terminal probation, or who were on special conditions at the time of departure will return to the University under the same academic probationary conditions. Students who resume study within a six semester period of time will meet degree requirements indicated in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect upon their initial matriculation. Students who resume study after a six-semester period of time will meet degree requirements as indicated by the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect when they return. Students with previous holds or obligations to the University should take measures to clear these obligations as soon as possible. Returning students who have not been dismissed and who left the University with a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or better return to the same major being pursued at the time of departure, unless a change of major is initiated. Formerly matriculated undergraduates who have not yet completed a Baccalaureate degree may only return to the University as matriculated undergra duates. Any requests for exception to this policy will be considered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Degrees in Absentia Formerly matriculated undergraduates who have almost completed their degree and cannot return here to finish remaining requirements may appl y for permission to finish their degree in absentia. Their cumulative University at Albany grade point average, as well as their GPA in the major and minor, must be at least a 2.00. In addition, a waiver of residence requirement(s) and de partmental support may be necessary. An application as well as other necessary forms for this process are available upon request by calling 518-42-5821 or writing the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30).

Graduation Application Degrees are awarded during the fall, spring and summer terms. The student must file a degree application with the Registrar's Office (CC B 25) in accordance with the date specified in the official University academic calendar for the term in which all degree requirements will be completed. All incomplete grades and grades not reported must be resolved before the degree can be awarded. If reasonable attempts to contact the instructor fail, the student with an incomplete or \"blank\" (not reported) grade may appeal to the Committee on Academic Standing or, if that body is unable to meet to resolve the issue in timely fashion, to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. A degree review will be conducted at the end of each term for those students who have properly applied for graduation. The Registrar's Office will notify the student in writing if the degree is not awarded because the degree requirements have not been met. If the student has completed all requirements for the degree, a confirming postcard will be sent verifying the diploma has been ordered. Waiver of Requirements In rare and exceptional cases, a waiver of the requirements listed in this section may be granted to an individual student. Petitions for waiver of major or minor requirements should be addressed to the academic unit offering the major or minor. Petitions for waiver of any other requirements in this section should be addressed to the Committee on Academic Standing of the Undergraduate Academic Council and submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Classification of Courses, Credits To graduate from the University at Albany, a student must have at least 120 graduation credits, fulfill the requirements of the major(s)/minor(s) chosen by the student, complete all General Education requirements that apply to the student, and fulfill the University, major and minor residence requirements. For a Bachelor of Arts degree, a minimum of 90 credits in courses designated \"liberal arts and sciences\" must be completed; for a Bachelor of Science degree, a minimum of 60 credits in courses designated \"liberal arts and sciences\" must be completed. Courses may be classified as \"liberal arts and sciences\" or as \" non-liberal arts and sciences\" or as a course carrying no credit applicable to graduation. LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES COURSES University at Albany undergraduate courses classified as \"liberal arts and sciences\" have a content, either formal or systematic, that provides the student with an appreciation for and knowledge of the arts and wr itten and spoken expression, humanities, world cultures and language, biological and physical sciences, social and behavioral sciences, mathematics and statistics, computing and information literacy, history, philosophy, or religion, or interdisciplinary studies involving one or more of these areas or otherwis e contributing to the student's understanding of the social or physical environment. The University definition of \"liberal arts and sciences\" also extends to the skill, technique and methods courses, performance and practicum courses, internships, and service learning that serve to enhance a student's abilities and appreciation for study in these areas. In accordance with this definition, the majority of undergraduate courses taught at the University at Albany (as well as comparable courses transferred from another institution or offered in an Albany graduate program) are considered \"liberal arts and sciences.\" NON-LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES COURSES Each Albany college and school offering undergraduate courses determines whether its courses are \"liberal arts and sciences\" or \"non- liberal arts and sciences\" and submits to the Curriculum and Honors Committee of the Undergraduate Academic Council a rationale for excluding one or more of its courses from its \"default\" classification. By request of a department or program to the Committee, a course's classification may later be changed. A department or program may also modify the classification of one of its courses or a transferred course in its discipline for an individual student upon petition to the department or program. The \"default\" classification for each college and school and the list of courses that are exceptions to the college's or school's default classification shall be printed in the Undergraduate Bulletin . In addition to the \"non-liberal arts and sciences\" courses mentioned, the following three categories of courses are also classified as \"non-liberal arts and sciences\" courses. University at Albany 40 ROTC COURSES Students may apply towa rd their undergraduate degree requirements up to a maximum of twelve credits for ROTC courses completed successfully at the University at Albany and/or from other accredited institutions. All ROTC credit is designated \"non-liberal arts and sciences.\" PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSES Although the University no longer offers physical education courses for credit, students may apply toward their degree a maximum of six credits of physical education activity credits. These and credit for courses in coaching, recreational studies, etc., will ordinarily be designated \"non-liberal arts and sciences\" credits. APPLIED ELECTIVE COURSES The term \"Applied Elective\" designates a transfer course of a relatively non-theoretical and predominantly \"skill\" or \"application\" nature only tangentially connected to the objectives or study of the liberal arts and sciences. Such courses typically are intended to prepare a student for a specific vocational pursuit rather than for future academic, graduate or professional study or practice. Students may apply toward their undergraduate degree requirements up to a maximum of twelve credits from transferred \"applied elective\" courses. (Cf. \"Types of Transfer Credit\" section below.) COURSES YIELDING NO GRADUATION CREDIT The following types of courses do not carry credit applicable toward graduation at the University at Albany: a. Developmental courses offered by the Educational Opportunities Program or their transfer equivalents b. Written and oral language skills courses offered by the Intensive English Language Program or their transfer equivalents. c. Mathematics courses at or below the level of the New York State \"Course B\" Regents Examination in Mathematics (algebra and geometry, trigonometry, probability and statistics). However, in some cases such courses may fulfill the \"Mathematics and Statistics\" requirement in the General Education Program. d. Introduction to typing/keyboarding or shorthand, driver education, or other courses of an elementary manual skill nature with little or no theoretical content. e. Some religious studies courses: \"Religious studies courses transfer if they are not doctrinal, confessional, or sectarian in nature. Religious studies courses from public institutions transfer without special review; religious studies courses from all other institutions will be evaluated by the appropriate departmental faculty.\" (Quoted material was adopted from the University of Minnesota's policy on transfer credit and is used with their permission.) f. Courses from institutions or programs determined by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions as not acceptable as a source for transfer credit to the University Types of Transfer Credit EQUIVALENT TRANSFER COURSES A department, school or program may designate a course taken elsewhere as equivalent to one of its courses. It is considered \"liberal arts and sciences\" if the Albany equivalent is so considered; it is considered \"non-liberal arts and sciences\" if the Albany equivalent is so considered. DEPARTMENTAL ELECTIVES A department, school or program may designate a course taken elsewhere as \"departmental elective credit.\" For example, an English course may be designated AENG000 (an English course not applicable to the major or minor in English), AENG010 (a lower division English course) or AENG030 (an upper division English course). Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Undergraduate Bulletin , such credit is considered \"liberal arts and sciences\" credit if that is the Albany college or school's default classification; it is cons idered \"non-liberal arts and sciences\" credit if that is the Albany college or school's default classification. APPLIED ELECTIVES A department, school or program may decide whether a transfer course that is in its discipline should be designated as an \"applied elective.\" Courses that are not represented by comparable study in the University at Albany's colleges and schools are generally designated \"applied electives\" (engineering, architecture, agricultural sciences, pharmacy, legal assistant, etc.). However, courses that appear roughly comparable to arts and sciences offerings (engineering courses comparable to physics, architecture comparable to art history or drawing, etc.) may be designated as \"liberal arts and sciences\" or may have their designation changed to \"liberal arts and sciences\" based on a student's appeal. A student may receive a maximum of 12 credits for transferred applied electives. Limits on Transfer Credits The following limits and restrictions apply whether or not these credits are taken pre-matriculation or post-matriculation. MAXIMUM LIMIT ON TRANSFER CREDIT Since Albany requires at least 30 credits to be completed at the University, the most transfer credit that can be applied toward graduation is 90 credits. (Since some SUNY and other technical and community colleges now award baccalaureate degrees, the University no longer distinguishes between \"two-year\" and baccalaureate-granting institutions in determining the maximum credits that may be transferred.) NON-LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES CREDITS Bachelor of Arts degree programs require a minimum of 90 credits in \"liberal arts and sciences.\" Therefore, for students pursuing the B.A. degree the most credit from \" non-liberal arts and sciences\" courses that can apply to the degree is 30 credits. Bachelor of Science degree programs require a minimum of 60 credits in \"liberal arts and sciences.\" Therefore, for students pursuing the B.S. degree the most credit from \" non-liberal arts and sciences\" courses that can apply to the degree is 60 credits. Of a student's transfer credits in courses that are designated \" non-liberal arts and sciences,\" no more than 6 credits may be in physical education activity courses, no more than 12 credits may be in ROTC courses, and no more than 12 credits may be in courses equated to \"applied electives.\" Although credits successfully completed at other institutions after the student has matriculated will appear on the student's record, the limits and restrictions mentioned above will determine whether or not the student is able to apply all of those credits toward the minimum 120 credits needed for graduation . Graduation Credits A student must earn a minimum of 120 acceptable graduation credits to be eligible for graduation from the University. Acceptable graduation credit is as follows: 1. Credit accepted by transfer. 2. Credit earned through approved proficiency examinations. Such credit may be awarded on the basis of a student's performance on such external examinations as CLEP, RCE, AP, USAFI, etc., or an examination established for this purpose by a University at Albany department, school or program. Proficiency examination credit shall be clearly distinguished as such on a student's academic record, and shall have no bearing on a student's academic average. Proficiency examination credits sha ll not count within a semester load, hence shall not be counted when determining whether a student is full-time or part-time, and shall not be applied to University, major or minor residence requirements or semester retention standards. Any academic unit at the University may award proficiency credit by examination provided it does so openly and applies standards consistently to all students seeking credit. In no case may award of credit be contingent upon auditing a course (formally or informally), private tutelage (paid or otherwise), or participation in University or extracurricular activities or productions; however, the payment of a modest fee may be charged for administering the examination. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 413. Credit completed with the grades of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- or S. An academic unit may award credit with an A-E or S/U grade only in a University at Albany course for which the student was formally registered in a fall or spring semester or summer session in accordance with established registration and program adjustment procedures and deadlines. 4. Some transfer D grades, in accordance with the following policies: For students who matriculated before Fall 2000, credit earned with a grade of D or the lowest passing grade will transfer only if such credit is balanced by a B or A at the same institution. One credit earned with the grade of B balances one credit earned with the grade of D, and one credit earned with the grade of A balances two credits with the grade of D. For students who matriculate Fall 2000 through Summer 2001, prematriculation credit earned with a grade of D or the lowest passing grade will transfer only if such credit is balanced by a B or A at the same institution. D grades earned in courses within the major/minor must be balanced by grades of B or A earned within the major/minor at the same institution. Post matriculation credit graded D will not transfer. For students who matriculate Fall 2001 and thereafter , no credit graded D from another institution will transfer. Major and Minor Credits For students matriculating fall 1997 and thereafter: A University at Albany grade of D- is minimally acceptable for graduation credit in the major and minor. Note, however, that a 2.0 average within each major and minor is a requirement for graduation. For credits acquired at other institutions and for University at Albany credits for students matriculating before Fall 1997: A student may fulfill the requirements of a major or a minor or a combined major and minor by earning graduation credit as defined previously, except that credit with the grade of D may be used to fulfill the requirements of a major, minor, or combined major/minor only if balanced at the same institution by credit with grades of A or B earned within the major, minor, or combined major/minor respectively. Students matriculating in Fall 2000 through Summer 2001 can transfer in balanced D's from prematriculation course work, but they cannot transfer any D's for postmatriculation transfer courses. Students matriculating in Fall 2001 and thereafter cannot transfer in any grades of D.

University at Albany 44 REGULATIONS CONCERNING MAJORS The University offers majors in the General Program through the schools and colleges indicated here. In addition, there currently exist unique departmental program majors in art, music, and theatre that complement the regular University major options in each of these areas. Some majors are available through an honors program or a combined bachelor's/master's degree program. Approved faculty-initiated interdisciplinary majors are also include d in the University's curricular offerings. In addition, students may design their own interdisciplinary major in accordance with procedures established by the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee of the Undergraduate Academic Council. Declaration of Major Freshmen and transfer students are admitted to the University and not to a particular department, college, or school. Normally, students are expected to declare their intended major when they have earned 24 graduation credits. By the time they have accumulated 42 graduation credits, students must have officially declared a major or have applied for admission to a restricted major. For mo st majors, students need only complete a Declaration of Major form with their advisers and a minimum of 24 graduation credits to be officially enrolled in the school or college offering their major. Other majors, however, are restricted in the sense that students must be granted formal departmental or school approval or satisfy stated admissions criteria before being officially classified as that major. Currently, admission to the following majors is restricted: accounting, bus iness administration, criminal justice, mathematics, psychology, rhetoric and communication, and social welfare. In addition, students must obtain approval to enter the Faculty-Initiated Interdisciplinary Majors in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Information Science, and the special departmental program majors in art or music. Selection to these restricted majors will differ depending on the degree of competition generated by other applicants and/or the completion of specific c ourse requirements. For further details on the specific requirements and selection processes for each of these majors, please refer to the appropriate department or school description in this bulletin. Multiple Majors Students may elect more than one major, designating which is to be considered the \"first major,\" the \"second major,\" etc. The first major listed shall be from the department from which the student elects to receive advisement. The faculty of the school or college that offers the first major shall recommend the student for the appropriate degree. For example, a student completing the three majors Geology, History, and Philosophy would receive a B.S. degree if the first major were Geology or a B.A. degree if the first major were History or Philosophy. For each major, students must complete the major requirements as outlined in this bulletin. However, for a student with two or more majors, a specific course that is applicable to more than one of the majors may be applied toward each of the majors to which it is applicable. For example, a student with two majors in Accounting and Economics may \"double count\" calculus and some economics courses, applying the credits toward both majors; if the student also had a third major in Computer Science, the calculus course A Mat 112 would \"triple count,\" applying to all three majors. NOTE: The display of more than the first and second majors on the student's official transcript will not be possible before fall 2005. Until the full listing becomes possible, st udents desiring to declare a third or subsequent major must do so in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Once satisfactory completion of the third or additional majors has been verified, a separate official document will be issued by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies verifying which additional majors (beyond the first two) have been completed. The Student-Initiated Interdisciplinary Major In addition to existing majors offered by the University's departments, schools and programs, a \"Student-Initiated Interdisciplinary Major\" option is available through the Undergraduate Academic Council's Interdisciplinary Studies Committee. This option is designed to allow highly motivated students to meet special educational goals not available from the many existing majors at the University. In the development of an Interdisciplinary Major the student and prospective faculty sponsors are asked to insure its intellectual merit by considering the following questions: Will the proposed major make it possible to undertake future disciplined inquiry such as that which is found in graduate or professional study? Will the plan promote mastery of the methodological tools relevant to the subject matter? Are there sufficient bodies of scholarly literature to allow for in-depth study in the major's disciplines\" Will the plan allow for gaining significant knowledge to read and evaluate professional and scholarly literature in the major's disciplines? The following information will assist in the formulation of a major. Non-Duplication of Existing Majors: The proposed major must involve course work in at least two different departments or schools. Moreover, the proposal must not duplicate or nearly duplicate opportunities available to University at Albany students through existing major programs. Coherence: The proposed major must consist of a coherent, integrated program of studies. As with any other major, there must be some relationship between courses to be undertaken as well as sufficient depth of study in the area under consideration. It would also be helpful to know if models exist on other campuses for the proposed major. This information will assist the student in constructing a program of studies and the citation of an existing program, will support the application for such a major. Credits : The proposed major must consist of at least 36 but not more than 66 credits. If the major includes fewer than 54 credits, the student will be applying for a major only and will need a separate minor to meet minimum gradua tion requirements. If the major includes 54 or more credits, the student will be applying for a combined major and minor program and, therefore, no separate minor will be needed. Upper Division Course Work: At least one half of the credits in the proposed major must be at the 300 level or above . Independent Study: The proposed major may include a maximum of 25% of independent study course work. B.A. or B.S. Degree: The course work in the Interdisciplinary major, will normally dictate the type of bachelor's degree to be earned by the student. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 45Faculty Sponsorship: The proposal must have a primary and a secondary faculty sponsor. The primary sponsor must also agree to serve as the student's major adviser for the proposed program. The two sponsors must be members of the teaching faculty and must come from two different academic units (depar tments or schools) offering courses included in the major. Student who believe they might like to construct their own major should begin plans as soon as possible, but the application for the major cannot be filed until the student has completed at least 30 graduation credits. Once a student has tentatively decided on the theme for the proposed study, the Undergraduate Bulletin should be reviewed to verify that no existing major encompasses that theme. The Bulletin and the Schedule of Classes should also be used to identify possible courses which might be included in the proposed major and, based on the courses they teach, possible faculty who might be willing to serve as sponsors for the major. Before deciding on all the details of the proposed major, the student should speak with several faculty for the following reasons: (a) to determine the likelihood of finding two faculty sponsors for the program; (b) to solicit suggestions on how to further refine, limit, or expand the chosen theme; (c) to solicit further suggestions of individual courses or sequences of courses which might be included in the major; and (d) to determine whether or not the student's goals in creating the major are likely to be met by the combination of course chosen. Further information and application procedures and forms may be obtained by contacting Mr. Richard Collier in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30 (518-437-3747). REGULATIONS CONCERNING MINORS Minors Defined, Titles A minor consists of 18-24 graduation credits which must include a minimum of 9 graduation credits of \"advanced course work\" (defined as course work requiring at least one prerequisite course and/or courses at or above the 300 level.) No student may use a minor title that is the same as the title of the student's major. Only the following are acceptable minor titles to appear on the academic record: \"Combined with Major\" for approved combined major and minor programs Titles approved by the Curriculum Committee or by the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee of the Undergraduate Academic Council \"Interdisciplinary\" if approved by the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee of the Undergraduate Academic Council Students Required to Complete a Minor: A student is required to complete a minor if the student has only one major and that major is neither an approved \"combined major and minor\" nor an approved \"departmental major.\" If the student with a single, non-combined, non-departmental major has only one minor, the same course may not be used to fulfill the requirements of both the major and the discrete minor. I.e., no \"double counting\" between the major and minor is allowed. However, if that student has two or more minors, the same course may be \"double counted\" toward the major and one of the minors. (\"Double counting\" among minors is never allowed.) Students Not Required to Complete a Minor: A student with two or more majors or a major that is either an approved \"combined major and minor\" or an approved \"departmental major\" is not required to have a discrete minor, but the student may elect to have one or more minors listed on the academic record. If the student does elect one or more minors, the same course may be \"double counted\" toward the major (or even more than one of the majors) and toward one of the minors. (\"Double counting\" among minors is never allowed.) Similarly, if the student in a \"combined major and minor program\" elects one or more minors, the same course may be \"double counted\" toward the \"minor\" requirements of the combined major and toward one of the minors. Naturally, students in a combined major and minor program who complete one or more discrete minors nevertheless must comp lete all requirements in the combined major program. NOTE: For students with two or more majors, the display of more than the first and second majors on the student's official transcript will not be possible before fall 2003. Until the full listing becomes possible, students with multiple majors desiring to declare one or more minors must do so in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Once satisfactory completion of the minor(s) has been verified, a separate official document will be issued by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies verifying which minor or minors have been completed. Multiple Minors Students may declare two or more minors, but the same course may not be applied to more than one of the minors. (I.e., \"double counting\" among minors is never allowed.) However, the same course may be applied to one of the minors and to one (or more) of the applicable majors. NOTE: For students with one major and more than two minors, the display of more than the first and second minors on the student's official transcript will not be possible before fall 2003. Until the full listing becomes possible, students with one major desiring to declare a third or subsequent minor must do so in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Once satisfactory completion of the additional minor(s) has been verified, a separate official document will be issued by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies verifying which additional minor or minors have been completed. [For students with multiple majors and multiple minors, see the note at the end of in the preceding section \"Students Not Required to Complete a Minor.\"] University at Albany 46 APPROVED MINORS Listed here are the minor titles that have been approved by the Undergraduate Academic Council.

University at Albany 50 THE GENERAL EDUCATION PROGRAM The General Education Program applies to all students admitted to the University with basis of admission \"FRESHMAN\" in fall 2000 and thereafter and with basis of admission \"TRANSFER\" in fall 2002 or thereafter if the transfer student first matriculated at a college or university in fall 2000 or thereafter. Students who transferred to Albany before fall 2002 or who matriculated at Albany or elsewhere before fall 2000 are required to fulfill the upper division Writing requirement but are not required to meet the other requirements of the General Education Program. The General Education Program at the University at Albany proposes a set of knowledge areas, perspectives, and competencies considered by the University to be central to the intellectual development of every undergraduate. The Program is divided into thr ee areas-Disciplinary Perspectives, Cultural and Historical Perspectives, and Communication and Reasoning Competencies. The General Education Program is intended to provide students with a foundation that both prepares them for continued work within their chosen major and minor fields and gives them the intellectual habits that w ill enable them to become lifelong learners. Courses within the program are designed not only to enhance students' knowledge, but also to provide them as well with new ways of thinking and with the ability to engage in critical analysis and creative activity. Courses in the area of Disciplinary Perspectives emphasize multiple perspectives, enabling students to understand that subjects may be approached in a variety of ways and that different disciplines approach subjects in different ways. These courses prepare students for careers that will put them into contact with persons from different disciplinary backgrounds. Courses in the area of Cultural and Historical Perspectives are designed to help students develop an understanding of their own identity and of their relation to various communities, and to increase their ability to interact effectively with persons from different cultural and regional backgrounds. Courses that focus on U. S. History and U.S. Diversity and Pluralism en able students to explore the U.S. as a nation, how it has developed, and how it relates to other areas of the world. Courses that focus on cultures, regions, and nations beyond the U.S. and on global and cross-cultural issues enable students to recognize the complexity and interconnectedness of the larger world. Finally, courses in the area of Communication and Reasoning Competencies are designed to provide students with an enhanced ability to communicate with others, both through the written and spoken word, and to enable them to take advantage of computing technology as a medium of communication. Courses in this area are also designed to develop students' ability to reason in a variety of symbolic systems and contexts. Students are encouraged to reflect on their General Education Program, to explore the relation of requirements to each other, to measure any given course against the stated goals for its specific category and for the program, and to use the experience of General Education to develop their own understanding of what constitutes a meaningful university education. The characteristics of and the rationale and goals for the specific requirements of the General Education Program are discussed in greater detail below. Characteristics of General Education Courses The General Education Program as a whole has the following characteristics. Different categories within the Program emphasize different characteristics. General education offers explicit understandings of the procedures and practices of disciplines and inte rdisciplinary fields. General education provides multiple perspectives on the subject matter, reflecting the intellectual and cultural diversity within and beyond the University. General education emphasizes active learning in an engaged environment that enables students to become producers as well as consumers of knowledge. General education promotes critical thinking about the assumptions, goals, and methods of various fields of academic study and the interpretive, analytic, and evaluative competencies central to intellectual development. The General Education Program at the University at Albany consists of a minimum of 30 credits of coursework in the following areas: disciplinary pers pectives, cultural and historical perspectives, and communication and reasoning competencies. The General Education Program is summarized in the following table: Requirements of the Program Disciplinary Perspectives: Arts (min. 3 crs) Humanities (min. 3 crs) Natural Sciences (min. 6 crs) Social Sciences (min. 6 crs) Cultural and Historical Perspectives: U.S. Historical Perspectives (min. 3 crs) Europe (min. 3 crs) Regions beyond Europe (min. 3 crs) Global and Cross-Cultural Studies (min. 3 crs) U.S. Diversity and Pluralism (min. 3 crs) Communication & Reasoning Competencies: Information Literacy (min. 1 course) Oral Discourse (min. 1 course) Written Discourse: Lower-level Writing (min. 1 course) Upper-level Writing (min. 1 course) Mathematics and Statistics: one semester of collegiate study, or the equivalent, of mathematics at or above the level of pre-calculus and/or probability, statistics, and data analysis Foreign Language: two semesters of collegiate study, or the equivalent, of a foreign language While the majority of General Education courses are at the 100 and 200 level, particularly in the category of Disciplinary Perspectives, the General Education Program at the University at Albany is conceived as extending throughout the four years of undergraduate study. Indeed, certain requirements, such as those in U.S. History, Global and Cross-Cultural Studies, and Oral Discourse, may be more appropriately completed during the junior and senior year. Students are encouraged, however, to complete the requirements in the category of Disciplinary Perspectives during their first two years. In addition, the Information Literacy and the lower-level writing requirement are expected to be completed within the freshman or sophomore year. Students may not use the same course to fulfill both the Arts and the Humanities categories. Otherwise, if a course fulfills more than one category, students may use the course to fulfill all of those categories. Although such \"double counting\" may reduce the number of credits needed to fulfill General Education, to graduate from the University each student must have satisfactorily completed a minimum of thirty (30) graduation credits in courses designated as General E ducation requirements. If a course fulfilling a General Education category also meets a major or minor requirement, there is no prohibition against counting the course toward General Education and the major or minor. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 51Overview of the General Education Categories The humanities and arts, natural sciences, and social sciences are commonly considered to be the core of a liberal arts education. Courses in the category of Disciplinary Perspectives are designed to familiarize students with the objectives, assumptions, subject matters, methods, and boundaries of knowledge organized in terms of academic disciplines. Requirements in this category seek to introduce students to a broad range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives and areas of knowledge. Equally central to a liberal arts education is an understanding of history\u2014the recognition that the world we inhabit today had its origins in and has been shaped by the events of the past, and that to understand our current situation we must try as best we can to understand the past. Of similar importance is an understanding of the origins, development and significance of human cultures, and the recognition of cultural distinctiveness and multiplicity. Courses in the category of Cultural and Historical Perspectives are designed to increase students' understanding of the history of this nation (U.S.), of its cultural diversity (U.S. Diversity and Pluralism), of histories and cultures that have played a major role in the development of the U.S. (Europe), and of cultures and histories beyond those of the U.S. and Europe (Regions beyond Europe). In addition, these courses seek to introduce students to the complex intersections of the local and global, and to the different perspectives that emerge from a focus on the national, the regional, the global, and the cross-cultural. 21 st century students will inhabit an environment increasingly characterized by global dynamics in which decisions made in the United States will affect the lives of people elsewhere and decisions made elsewhere will affect the lives of people in the United States. Moreover, they will inhabit an environment increasingly shaped by forces that transcend national borders and that are reconfiguring the globe's regions and cultures in the service of various economic and political interests. Courses a pproved for Global and Cross-Cultural Studies provide students with an opportunity to examine the global forces that give rise to and shape nations, cultures and regions, and to explore the larger perspectives that emerge from cross-cultural comparisons. The Foreign Language requirement is also designed to enhance students' global awareness and to expand their knowledge of different cultures. The U.S. Diversity and Pluralism requirement reflects the University at Albany's long-standing commitment to respect for difference, to civic dialogue as a means of negotiating conflicts in cultural and political values arising from human diversity, to understanding the relation of cultural pluralism to political democracy, and to the development of socially responsible citizens. Courses in this category are designed to introduce students to the diversity of cultures that make up the United States, as well as to the historical, political, and economic forces that have led these cultures to develop differently and to be accorded different significance. Approved courses frequently focus on key issues of current concern (e.g., the gay rights movement), setting these issues in the context of how a democratic society defines majorities and minorities and understands the rights and responsibilities of each. The General Education Program is designed to provide students with a set of competencies essential both for academic success and for becoming effective citizens of the 21 st century, including the requirement in Mathematics and Statistics , the Information Literacy requirement, and the Written and Oral Discourse requirements. Definition of Each General Education Category DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES CATEGORIES THE ARTS: Approved courses provide instruction in or about a medium of creative expression. Courses may focus on the physical practice and techniques of the medium, on its critical and theoretical interpretation, on its historical development, or on a combination of these approaches. Courses explicate the methods used to study and critique the medium as a vital element of personal or cultural expression and exchange. Approved courses generally fall into one of four categories (for majors and/or non-majors): Courses about the development and interpretation of a medium: (1) introductions to the disciplines; (2) introductions to subfields in the disciplines; Courses on the physical practice of a medium (studio art, creative writing, music composition or performance, dance, and theatre acting, directing or stagecraft): (3) instructional courses on the skills and methods required and their critical evaluation; (4) courses focused upon performance. Note: The requirement calls for three credits. In the case of categories 3 and 4 (skills and performance), where approved courses may bear only one or two credits, the requirement may be fulfilled through two or three courses with a minimum total of three credits. HUMANITIES : Approved courses are concerned with defining and disputing that which is understood to be quintessentially \"human\": studying language, texts, thought, and culture; their definition, interpretation, and historical development; and their reflection of human values, beliefs, and traditions. Courses in a variety of disciplines explicate the underlying assumptions, methods of study, practices, theories, and disputes appropriate to those disciplines. Approved courses generally fall into one of three categories (all open to majors and non-majors): (1) introductions to basic materials and methods in the disciplines; (2) introductions to subfields or groupings of materials in the disciplines; (3) literature and culture courses taught in a foreign language higher than the third- semester level. NATURAL SCIENCES : Approved courses show how understandings of natural phenomena are obtained using the scientific method, including data collection, hypothesis development, employment of mathematical analysis, and critical evaluation of evidence. Courses provide an overview of major principles and concepts underpinning a discipline's current base of knowledge and discuss major topics at the current frontiers of disciplinary knowledge. Courses show how answers to fundamental questions in science can change the world in which we live and often explore how social issues can influence scientific research. Opportunities for scientific inquiry within laboratory and/or field settings may be provided. Approved courses generally fall into one of three categories: (1) introductions to scientific disciplines, designed for majors, non-majors, or both; (2) introductions to disciplinary subfields, designed for majors, non-majors, or both; (3) courses open to majors and non-majors on broad topics that are addressed by one or more scientific disciplines and which may focus on the application of science to practical issues. SOCIAL SCIENCES : Approved courses provide theory and instruction on the role of institutions, groups and individuals in society. The focus of these courses is on the interaction of social, economic, political, geographic, linguistic, religious, and/or cultural factors, with emphasis on the ways humans understand the complex nature of their existence. Courses include discussion of skills and practices used by the social sciences: data collection, hypothesis development, employment of mathematical analysis, and critical evaluation of evidence. Opportunities to experience social science methods in the field may be provided. University at Albany 52 Approved courses generally fall into one of three categories: (1) introductions to the various disciplines of the social sciences; (2) introductions to disciplinary subfields, designed for majors, non-majors, or both; (3) courses open to majors and non-majors on broad topics that are addressed by one or more social scientific disciplines. CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES CATEGORIES U.S.: Approved courses focus on specific narratives or themes in the historical unfolding of the United States, including political, economic, social, cultural and/or intellectual dimensions. All courses will feature an explicitly historical organization; deal with topics of national, as opposed to regional or local, import; and consider a topic of sufficient specificity for the course to be coherent, but over a period long enough to ensure that the historical dynamic is clearly visible. Students should acquire knowledge of substance and methods for comprehending the narratives or themes presented. Certain of these courses will balance topical focus and chronological breadth. A student who has achieved a score of 85 or above on the Regents Examination in \"United States History and Government\" will be considered to have fulfilled the chronological breadth criterion. Therefore, such a student has the choice of fulfilling the requirement by completing a course chosen from the basic list available to all students or from a list of more specialized courses. Each of the more specialized courses covers to some extent a knowledge of common institutions in American society and how they have affected different groups, provides an understanding of America's evolving relationship with the rest of the world, and deals substantially with issues of American history. EUROPE : Approved courses focus on the development and distinctive features of the institutions, economies, societies, and cultures of Europe. Approved courses offer either an explicitly historical approach or emphasize the narratives whereby European cultures have come to gain their specific identity. Preferably, approved courses will have a broad cultural or historical perspective; courses with a more narrow chronological focus or a more specialized narrative topic will relate these interests to larger issues in the history and cultural development of Europe. REGIONS BEYOND EUROPE : Approved courses focus on specific cultures (other than those of the United States and Europe) or the world's regions. Courses emphasize the features and processes whereby cultures and regions gain their specific identity. Approved courses will balance topical focus with chronological breadth. Courses may also engage students in considerations of the \"local\" as opposed to the \"global.\" GLOBAL AND CROSS -CULTURAL STUDIES : Approved courses e ngage students in comparative and integrative analyses. Courses offer global perspectives on historical or contemporary events; comparisons between societies, regions, or nations; or models for engaging in global and cross-cultural study. Courses emphasize the dynamic interaction between and among cultures, regions, and nations, and the global forces that give rise to and define cultures, regions, and nations. U.S. DIVERSITY AND PLURALISM : Approved courses focus primarily on contemporary experiences in the United States. Courses offer students perspectives on the diversity and pluralism of U.S. society with respect to one or more of the following: age, class, disability, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, and sexual orientation. Given that categories of diversity and pluralism intersect, approved courses will, wherever possible, deal with more than one category. Approved courses provide students with substantial knowledge of diversity and pluralism as expressed through social, political, ideological, aesthetic, or other aspects of human endeavor. Drawing on the experience of specific groups, courses explore the theories, dynamics, mechanisms, and results of diversity and pluralism, including the sources and manifestations of controversies and conflicts. Opportunities for student writing and discussion are central to the objectives of the courses in this category. Whenever possible, courses will include at least one writing component, discussion sections, breakout sessions, in-class groups or comparable mechanisms permitting discussion. COMMUNICATION AND REASONING COMPETENCIES CATEGORIES INFORMATION LITERACY : Approved courses introduce students to various ways in which information is organized and structured and to the process of finding, using, producing, and distributing information in a variety of media formats, including traditional print as well as computer databa ses. Students acquire experience with resources available on the Internet and learn to evaluate the quality of information, to use information ethically and professionally, and to adjust to rapidly changing technology t ools. Students must complete this requirement within the freshman or sophomore year. Approved Criteria for Information Literacy Courses: Courses that satisfy the Information Literacy requirement will have three characteristics: Classroom activities on finding, evaluating, citing, and using information in print and electronic sources from the University Libraries, World Wi de Web, and other sources. Courses should address questions concerning the ethical use of information, copyrights, and other related issues that promote critical reflection. Assignments, course work, or tutorials that make extensive use of the University Libraries, World Wi de Web, and other information sources. Assignments should include finding, evaluating, and citing information sources. At least one research project that requires students to find, evaluate, cite, and use information presented in diverse formats from multiple sources and to integrate this information within a single textual, visual, or digital document. WRITTEN DISCOURSE : Students must satisfactorily complete with grades of C or higher or S a lower division Writing Intensive course, which is expected to be completed within the freshman or sophomore year, and a Writing Intensive course at or above the 300 level, normally completed within the student's major. These courses use writing as an important tool in the discipline studied and are not designed primarily to teach the technical aspects of writing. The emphasis is on using writing as a means of sharpening critical thinking in and understanding of the subject. Approved courses must meet each of the following four criteria: A Substantial Body of Finished Work : This is generally expected to be a total of 20+ double-spaced pages in at least two, preferably more, submissions. It may be in a variety of forms\u2014journal, reports, essays, research papers, etc.\u2014not all of which need to be graded. Opportunity for Students to Receive Assistance in Progress : Such assistance may take several forms, from visits to the Writing Center (HU-140) to conferences with the instructor. Opportunity to Revise Some Pieces : As revision is an essential characteristic of good writing, students should be able to revise some portion of their work. Response to Student Writing : Such response may take several forms\u2014from extended comments from the instructor to peer evaluation in student groups. It is expected, however, that the instructor will respond in detail to some extended work of the student. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 53Note: Transfer students who enter the University with credit for an \"English Composition\" course or a two-semester combined literature and writing course will be considered to have completed the lower-level writing intensive requirement at this University. ORAL DISCOURSE : Approved courses provide opportunities for students to develop the oral communication skills they need to participate more effectively in public and academic debates and discussions. Courses offer opportunities to participate in a variety of communication contexts and to reflect on the principles and theory relevant to specific oral communication activities. Approved course s include instruction on presentation, as well as feedback and evaluation of oral performance. Feedback can occur in various forms, including peer evaluation in student groups, but it is expected that the instructor will also provide feedback to students on their performance. To fulfill both the spirit and the letter of this requirement, wherever possible courses should have no more than 25 students enrolled. Approved courses generally have a minimum of two exercises in which oral performance is required and graded. An oral performance exercise can be accomplished in any of the following activities, either live or in a crafted recording: A discussion within a group, where each member will be required to make 3-5 \"paragraph-length\" contributions in the course of the discussion A question and answer dialogic process where the student fields a succession of questions or asks a succession of questions that build on and comment upon prior answers A rehearsal theatrical presentation or interpretive reading A stand-up monologue presentation of a minimum of 3-5 minutes A debate where each participant speaks for a minimum of 3-5 minutes Students will be made aware of the criteria that will be used for evaluation of their oral performances Examples of criteria that may be used include persuasi veness, organization, presentation of evidence, validity of argument, contact with the audience, vocal punctuation and expressiveness, oral langua ge style suited to the exercise, appropriate volume and pace of speech, poise and comfort, vocal fluency, eye contact, and active listening.. The final grade in oral intensive courses will include the grade for oral performance as a key component. MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS : Approved courses introduce students to or extend their knowledge of pre-calculus, calculus, discrete mathematics, probability, statistics and/or data analysis. Courses may be offered in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and in other department s that have expertise in quantitative reasoning and data analysis and that offer appropriate courses, particularly in statistics or discrete structures. A student who has achieved a score of 85 or above on the Regents \"Math B\" Exam (former \"Mathematics Course III\" Exam) or on a recognized standardized examination indicating readiness to enter pre-calculus will be considered to have fulfilled this requirement. FOREIGN LANGUAGE : Basic proficiency in the understanding and use of an ancient or modern human language other than English as demonstrated by: the satisfactory completion of the second college semester (i.e., level Elementary II) of foreign language study or its equivalent; or passing a Regents \"Checkpoint B\" Examination or a Regents-approved equivalent with a score of 85 or above; or demonstration of competency in a language other than English, including languages not currently offered for formal instruction at this university; or satisfactory completion of at least one college semester in a study abroad program in a country where English is not the primary language of instruction. Transition and Implementation A. Students admitted to the University whose basis of admission is \"FRESHMAN\": The requirements will apply to all students whose basis of admission is \"freshman\" who matriculate at the University in Fall 2000 or thereafter . B. Students admitted to the University whose basis of admission is \"TRANSFER\": The requirements do not apply to students whose basis of admissi on is \"transfer\" who matriculated at an accredited college or university prior to Fall 2000; these students instead are required to meet the \"Continuing\" (1992) General Educa tion requirements for transfer students. The requirements will apply to all other students whose basis of admission is \"transfer\" and who matriculate at the University in Fall 2002 or thereafter. For at least the next few years, the Office of Undergraduate Studies will provide through the print and web versions of the Undergraduate Bulletin and through other media as deemed necessary, a full description for both the 1992-2000 and the 2000+ general education requirements. Students who feel their placement within either system of general education requirements is inappropriate to their circumstances or may cause undue hardship may appeal to the General Education Committee through the Office of Undergraduate Studies. In accordance with the Trustees' policies, if a student from a SUNY state-operated campus or SUNY community college has fulfilled, as determined by the policies of the other SUNY campus, one or more of the Trustees-mandated general educational categories, the University at Albany will also consider the student to have fulfilled that category or those categories. This is true even if 1) Albany requires more credits or courses for the given category; 2) the requirement is fulfilled by a course whose Albany equivalent does not fulfill the same requirement; 3) the student received a non-transferable but minimally passing grade in the course; 4) due to limits on total transferable credits, the student is unable to include that course among those transferred to Albany; 5) the student was waived from the requirement based on hi gh school achievement or other standards different from those employed by Albany; or 6) the student was covered by a blanket waiver of the requirement by the SUNY Provost because the other SUNY campus was not yet able to implement the given requirement. The same principle of reciprocity should apply to students who transfer from non-SUNY schools. If a course approved for transfer from a non-SUNY school is deemed to be equivalent to a University at Albany course that meets a general education requirement, the student shall be considered to have fulfilled the Albany general education category represented by that course. This is true even if 1) Albany requires more credits or courses for the given category; 2) the student receives a non-transferable but minimally passing grade in the course; or 3) due to limits on total transferable credits, the student is unable to include that course among those transferred to Albany. The foregoing conditions only apply to prematriculation credits. The only exception to the policies outlined above are the University's Global and Cross-Cultural Studies requirement, the U.S. Diversity and Pluralis m requirement, and the upper division Writing Intensive requirement. These requirements shall be considered \"local\" campus requirements, independent of the SUNY Trustees' system of General Education, and shall be required of all students whose basis of admission is \"transfer\" who matriculate at the University in fall 2002 or thereafter. Students may continue to present credit for courses the University deems equivalent to these requirements, but for the transfer course to fulfill the upper division writing requirement it must be completed with a grade of C or better or a grade of S. Students who feel they have not been appropriately accorded equivalence for any given course or courses are encouraged to consult with their academic adviser; if the academic adviser determines that the student has not been awarded appropriate equivalency, the student or the adviser may then appeal the decision through established procedures. University at Albany 54 Students who believe their transfer work or academic circumstances may justify a waiver or substitution for part of the general education requirements may appeal to the General Education Committee through the Office of Undergraduate Studies (LC 30). As the requirements are implemented, the units considering transfer equivalencies should, if there is demonstrable ambiguity, decide in favor of the transfer student. C. Transfer Credit D Grades: Except for the University's writing requirements, for which a grade of C or higher or S is required, either pre- or post matriculation transfer work graded D+, D or D- in a course that applies to one or more of the University's General Education requirements ma y be applied toward fulfilling the requirements, even if the student receives no graduation credit for the course. Administration of the Program The Dean of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for the administration of the program, including interpretation of legislation, assessing the number of seats required and communicating that information to Deans, evaluation of courses, faculty development and program assessment. The Dean shall also have the explicit authority to grant waivers and make appropriate substitutions for individual students, and to decertify courses that do not meet the program's standards. The Dean shall have sufficient material and human resources to meet these responsibilities. The General Education Committee, appointed by the Dean, will advise th e Dean on these matters. The General Education Committee shall have between 12 and 15 members, with broad representation across the University, and shall be chaired by the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies with specific responsibility for the General Education Program. Course proposals originate in departments or programs, pass through college and school curriculum committees where appropriate, and are reviewed by the General Education Committee. It is the re sponsibility of the Dean and of the General Education Committee to insure that course proposals meet the values and criteria of the General Education Program. New course proposals must also be approved by the Undergraduate Academic Council of the University Senate; revisions to existing courses designed to qualify them for the general education program will be reviewed only by the General Education Committee. The General Education Committee will review approved courses on a regular cycle of three years. At the end of the review process, the committee will continue the course for another three-year cycle, suggest revisions necessary for its continuance, or designate the course to be discontinued as a general education course, effective at the end of the spring term of the next academic year. Any decision to discontinue a course must provide sufficient opportunity for appeal and revision. General Education Courses The most up-to-date information on courses approved for General Education categories can be found on the General Education website's \"General Class Schedules\" capability also allows students to search for courses in a term that fulfill one or more of these General Education categories. This same search capability exists from the University's homepage: http://www.albany.edu/schedule_of_classes/ to find courses that meet one or more of the General Education requirements. In addition, sections of courses that fulfill the categories Writing Intensive, Oral Discourse, and Information Literacy can be identified by the suffix of the course number: Information Literacy A section of a University at Albany course will fulfill the Information Literacy requirement if the course number ends in the suffix X or V or U or T. Oral Discourse: A section of a University at Albany course will fulfill the Oral Discourse requirement if the course number ends in the suffix Y or W or U or T. Writing Intensive A section of a University at Albany course will fulfill the Writing Intensive requirement if the course number ends in the suffix Z or W or V or T. A 100- or 200-level course with one of those suffixes may be used to meet the lower division requirements; a 300-level or above course with one of those suffixes, the upper division requirement. NOTE: More than one printed and electronic version of approved course lists for the New General Education Program appeared in the past year. Students who believed they were fulfilling a requirement by taking a course that no longer appears on the list for that requirement category should bring this to the attention of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, LC 30. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 55PROGRAMS AND COURSES Information concerning specific programs of study may be found by referring to the sections in this bulletin head ed University-Wide Offerings, College of Arts and Science, School of Business, School of Criminal Justice, School of Education, Educational Opportunities Program, Office of General Studies, College of Computing and Information, Office of International Programs, Nelson A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, School of Public Health, and School of Social Welfare). Unit of Academic Credit Generally, one credit represents the equivalent of one hour of lecture or recitation or at least two hours of laboratory work each week for one semester or the equivalent in honors study. The number following each course title; e.g., (3), indicates the credits offered for that course. Significance of Course Number Each course offered by the University is assigned a designation and a number according to a plan that is outlined here. The specific course designation and number appears in the bulletin directly in front of the course title. Each course designation consists of three separate units: (1) the school designation; (2) the subject or departmental designation; and (3) the course number. The school or college offering a course is identified by a single letter as noted here. A College of Arts and Sciences B School of Business C College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering D former Division of Physical Education, Athletics, and Recreation E School of Education G International Studies H School of Public Health O Educational Opportunities Program R School of Criminal Justice, School of Information Science and Policy, Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, and School of Social Welfare T former General Education Honors Program Honors Tutorials U University-Wide Offerings X Regional Cross-Registration The subject or departmental designation consists of three letters representing an abbreviation for the subject or the department offering the course. Course Levels Students ordinarily enroll in courses at the level appropriate to their class. The course number is a three-digit number assigned to the course by the academic unit offering the course. The first digit reflects the level at which the course is taught. Some courses are given the designation a or b after the course number, indicating the first and second half, respectively, of a two-semester sequence. The level designations are noted here. 000-099 Noncredit courses [Exception: transfer courses having no counterpart at the University are sometimes evaluated as AHIS010, AENG030, etc., meaning 100-level History elective, 300-level English elective, and so on.] 100-299 Lower-division courses, with 200- 299 primarily for sophomores. Courses designed to present a large body of information without expecting a mastery of detail (e.g., survey courses in history or literature) or to present general theoretical or methodological approaches (e.g., foundation courses in the social, natural and physical sciences) or to teach skills or techniques at an introductory level (e.g., general physical education) are considered to be lower division. Lower-division courses may be expected to include elementary and may include intermediate levels of subject matter competency but not advanced levels. 300-499 Upper-division courses, with 400- 499 primarily for seniors. Courses offered primarily for those who are in the third and fourth years of their university education. The content should go beyond the introductory or survey level and, in the judgment of the faculty, will require prior academic achievement and experience. 500-599 First-year graduate courses (open to seniors with appropriate background and consent of major department chairs and the course instructors). 600-699 First-year graduate courses (open to superior seniors with the approval of their advisers and the written consent of their department chairs and the course instructors). 700+ Advanced graduate courses ordinarily beyond the master's degree and open only to graduate students. Letter Suffixes for General Education Courses The General Education Program employs the suffixes T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z to identify writing intensive courses. At the end of course descriptions in this bulletin, the following abbreviations are used, within brackets, to indicate any of the New General Education Re quirement categories met by the course: [AR] = Arts [BE] = Regions Beyond Europe [DP] = U.S. Diversity and Pluralism [EU] = Europe [FL] = Foreign Language [GC] = Global/Cross-Cultural [HU] = Humanities [IL] = Information Literacy [MS] = Mathematics/Statistics [NS] = Natural Sciences [OD] = Oral Discourse [SS] = Social Sciences [US] = U.S. History [US*] = U.S. History expanded list [WI] = Writing Intensive Equivalent Courses If a course is cross-listed (considered equivalent) with a course from another department or school, the equivalent course is listed in parentheses after the course number with an equals sign. Therefore, if a course fulfills a requirement for a major, minor, or general education category, all courses cross-listed with that course shall be considered to fulfill the same requirement. Students who have received graduation credit for a cross-listed course may not also receive graduation credit for the equivalent courses(s) listed in parentheses. If a course has had its number changed within the past four years, the prior number is listed in parentheses after the current course number. Unless expressly allowed to do so in the course description, students who have received graduation credit for a course under a previous course number may not also receive graduation credit for the same course under a new course number. Repeatable Courses If a course may be repeated for graduation credit, this will be indicated in the course description. Sometimes the repeatability is restricted and this is also indicated in the course description: \"may be repeated once for credit,\" \"may be repeated if topic differs,\" etc. If the description does not indicate the course can be repeated for credit, then a student who takes and passes the same course more than once will only receive graduation credit for that course once. University at Albany 56 THE UNIVERSITY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM Gregory I. Stevens, Ph.D., Director Karen L. Chico Hurst, M.B.A., Associate Director The University in the High School Program, under the direction and sponsorship of the College of Arts and Sciences, is a partnership program between the University at Albany and participating secondary schools throughout New York State. The Program allows qualified students to earn college credit while still in high school.

Rosenbaum University at Albany Alice D. Stark, Ph.D. Yale University Adjuncts (estimated): 9 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 18 Anthropology is the study of humankind, of ancient and modern people and their ways of living. From its firs t establishment as a professional discipline, anthropology has been defined in terms of its holistic, cross-cultural, and evolutionary approaches. By systematically analyzing differences and similarities among human groups over time and space, anthropologists achieve the fullest possible understanding of human nature, human diversity, and the forces that govern change in cultural and biological characteristics. The Anthropology Department provides undergraduates with a wide variety of courses, field and laboratory experiences, and guided research in each of the four major subfields of the discipline: archaeology, biological (physical) anthropology, ethnology (cultural anthropology), and linguistics. The department offers two majors: a B.A. in anthropology and a Faculty-Initiated Interdisciplinary Major with a concentration in human biology (in conjunction with the department of Biological Sciences). Students are offered special opportunities for the study of past and present cultures in Mesoamerica, North America, and elsewhere through the research programs of the anthropology faculty. The major prepares students for graduate studies in anthropology (the department has M.A. and cognate M.A. programs, and a doctoral program), as well as laying a broad scientific and liberal foundation for entering the professions, arts, or other occupations in the modern world. Many new career opportunities are developing in addition to traditional anthropological careers in college teaching, museum curation, and public archaeology. For example, the diverse ethnic composition of American society is making cross-cultural awareness a matter of increasing importance for careers in business, law, journa lism, medicine, public policy, and primary and secondary education. The B.A. degree in anthropology also offers excellent preparation for careers in international business, public health, politics, and diplomacy. Moreover, many local, state federal, and international agencies are seeking personnel who have sensitivity to cultural diversity. Anthropology also provides a holistic perspective of and systematic training in the impact of human activity and values on the environment. The study of cross-cultural factors affecting the delivery of health care can be important to a career in health services. Finally, a degree in biological anthropology is a good foundation for graduate work in genetic epidemiology and other specialties within the field of public health. Special Programs or Opportunities Programs in archaeological, bio- anthropological, and ethnological fieldwork are available, with the Northeast and Mesoamerica being the most frequent locations. The archaeology program provides intensive training and/or research opportunities through research programs in Mexico, Belize, and New York State. Laboratory research experience, both in formal courses and as independent projects, is available in archaeology and biological anthropology. Degree Requirements for the Major in Anthropology General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits in anthropology including A Ant 110, 104, 108 or 108Z, and 106 or 220. Of the 24 additional credits in anthropology, no more than 6 may be at the 100 level and at least 12 must be at the 300 level or above. Honors Program Outstanding anthropology students are encouraged to consider the department's honors program, which is designed to give them the opportunity to work closely with members of the faculty on research and writing projects. Declared majors in anthropology are eligible to apply, provided that they have completed 12 or more credits in the department with a grade point average in the major of at least 3.50. They must also have an overall grade point average of at least 3.25. To participate in the program, students should contact their adviser during their junior year or at the beginning of their senior year. Students should plan their course work in consultation with their University at Albany 62 faculty adviser. Students in the honors program must fulfill the requirements for the major plus the following requirements: 1. Among the 36 credits of course work in anthropology required for the major, students in the honors program must complete at least one course at the 300 or 400 level in each of three different subdisciplines (archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, linguistics), for a total of 12 credits: Biological Anthropology: 310, 311, 312, 313, 319, 414, 416, 418.

Students must write an honors thesis based upon original research under the direction of an anthropology faculty member. Any anthropology faculty member knowledgeable in your topic may supervise a thesis project. A written proposal for the intended project must be formally approved by that faculty member and the departmental Undergraduate Affairs Committee during the semester prior to the semester in which the thesis is completed. Students will enroll in A Ant 482 and 482, \"Senior Honors Thesis Seminar,\" during the fall and spring of their senior year. The six credits from these courses can be counted toward the 36 credits required for the Anthropology major. 3. Research skill. Students will complete 6 credits of coursework in a research skill appropriate for anthropological research. Examples include, but are not limited to, foreign languages, statistics or other quantitative courses, and anthropological methods courses. The research sk ill courses must be approved by the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. To graduate with \"honors in anthropology,\" students must achieve an overall grade point average of 3.25 and a minimum grade point average of 3.50 in the major, in addition to the above requirements.

Syracuse University Adjuncts (estimated): 6 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 18 The Department of Art offers a 36 credit major in art, a departmental art major of 60 credits, and a 36 credit Faculty-initiated interdisciplinary major in art history. In addition students can minor in art or art history; the department also directs the interdisciplinary minor in Film Studies. The foundation of the studio art majors is a core curriculum in drawing, two- and three-dimensional design, and art history; areas of concentration are painting and drawing, sculpture, printmaking, and photography. The interdisciplinary major in art history offers a range of courses drawn from offerings in art history with the art department, and from other departments and programs in the College of Arts and Sciences, including classics, history, and East Asian studies. The University Art Museum offers a wide variety of exhibitions that enhance and extend the art department's offerings. Careers In addition to the traditional careers in fine art, commercial art, art history and criticism, students who immerse themselves in our art curriculum emerge with an understanding of visual literacy at a time when our culture as a whole is becoming increasingly dependent upon visual communication. Career paths include various positions in art museums and galleries, art conservation, art therapy, furniture design, industrial design, interior design, stage and costume design, graphic design, film production, TV production, medical and anthropological illustration, and animation. Degree Requirements for the Major in Art General Program B.A.: 36 credits, including at least 12 credits at the 300 level or above, to be distributed as follows: 18 credits are core requirements: A Art 105, 110, 115, 205 and A Arh 170 and 171; 18 credits are from electives with an Art prefix; 3 of these credits may be from any course that applies to the art history major (see below). Degree Requirements for the Departmental Major in Art General Program B.A.: 60 credits including a 27-credit core requirement consisting of A Art 105, 110, 115, 205, 220, 230, 240 or 242, 244 and 305; 12 credits in art history consisting of A Arh170 and 171 and 6 credits from courses that apply to the art history major (see below); 6 credits in studio art electives; and a 15-credit concentration in either painting and drawing, sculpture, printmaking, or photography. Admission to Departmental Major in Art The 60-credit art major is aimed at encouraging students who demonstrate both an unusual degree of accomplishment and potential. In the second semester of their sophomore year, or thereafter, students should submit from 12 to 20 works of art, in a portfolio or sheet of slides, to the Art Department for review. The portfolio should reflect a student's intended area of focus: painting and drawing, sculpture, printmaking or photography. The portfolio review is intended to give students an opportunity to demonstrate a maturing level of visual culture and the emergence of an artistic voice. Ultimately, an exemplary portfolio will display a high level of visual literacy and technical ability at the service of individual expression. This orientation will lead a student to further study at art school or at graduate school. Portfolios should be submitted to the art department secretary during the seventh week of the semester. If a student is accepted as a 60-credit art major, the student should seek advisement from the undergraduate adviser and the faculty member they work with most to determine a set of personal goals within their remaining course of study. Honors Program in the Departmental Major in Art The Honors Program is designed for the exceptionally talented and committed student of art. Successful completion of the program is excellent preparation for graduate work in the Fine Arts. Studio space for Honors Students is limited. Successful completion of the program earns an Honors Certificate in Art and a nomination for graduating with \"Honors in Art\" from the University. Students may present a portfolio for admission to the Honors Program to the Undergraduate Director in the second semester of their junior year or the first semester of their senior year. In order to be eligible for admission to the Honors Program, a student must be accepted as a 60-credit major and have completed at least 12 credits of studio course work. An applicant should have an overall grade point average of 3.25 or higher and a 3.5 or higher in all courses applicable toward the major. Applicants must submit a portfolio of 10 works in their area of concentration. The portfolio must demonstrate visual literacy, technical mastery, creative potential, and the drive and maturity to work independently in order to cultivate a distinctive personal direction. The Honors Committee may waive the entry requirements where appropriate. Decisions of the Honors Committee are final and are not subject to review or appeal. University at Albany 68 Students in the Honors Program are required to complete a minimum of 60 credits, meeting all the requirements of the major. In addition, students must complete an Honors Project for 6-12 credits of studio course work and complete A Art 496, the Mentor Tutorial.

Travis, Ph.D. Dartmouth College Suzannah Bliss Tieman, Ph.D. Stanford University Adjuncts (estimated): 45 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 24 The objective of the department is to provide the undergraduate student with a broad background in the biological sciences and adequate supporting strength in the physical sciences. Accordingly, most of the B.S. programs listed here are structured around a combined major/minor sequence. The department also offers programs leading to the M.S. and the Ph.D. in which the graduate student is able to obtain an in-depth professional education in one of several more restricted areas of biological sciences. Careers The B.A., which specifies the major only and requires a separate mi nor sequence outside science and mathematics, is designed with the aims of the liberal or fine arts students in mind and as such is not intended for the professional biologist or teacher. The B.S. programs provide a strong background for further study either in graduate school or medicine and prepare the student for secondary school teaching and a variety of careers in biology at the technical level. Graduates with a B.S. degree often find technical-level positions with pharmaceutical companies or as research assistants in grant-related positions. Those who go on to graduate or professional school have a wide array of career opportunities in research, health fields, and business. Degree Requirements for the Major in Biology General Program B.A.: Major sequence consisting of a minimum of 36 credits.

The progress of participants in the honors program will be reviewed at the end of the sophomore and junior years by the student's adviser a nd the departmental honors committee. Students not meeting academic and independent research standards may be precluded from continuing in the program during their senior year. These students may, of course, continue as majors. Combined B.S./M.S. Program The combined B.S./M.S. program in biology provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergraduate and master's degree programs from the beginning of the junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.S. and M.S. degrees within nine semesters. The combined program requires a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.S., students must meet all University and college requirements, including the requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minimum 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general education requirement s, and residency requirements. In qualifying for the M.S., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residency requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.S. and M.S. programs. While satisfying B.S. a nd M.S. requirements, students must complete a coherent sequence of courses in one of the two core areas: ecology, evolution, and behavior (EEB); or, molecular, cellular, developmental, and neural biology (MCDN). This sequence of courses begins with a 400-level course and includes a minimum of three graduate courses up to a total of at least 9 credits. In addition, the sequence should include two semesters involving a discussion of the current literature in the field of biology selected by the student (one of the following: A Bio 650 or A Bio 633). Although the Graduate Record Examinations are not required for this program, students are encouraged to take the examinations in their senior year with the expectation that they will continue graduate studies. Students may be admitted to the program at the beginning of the junior year or after the completion of 56 credits. Normally an application should be made at the completion of the sophomore year. Those students who are accepted into the program in their Junior year must complete at least three (3) semesters of research in the Bio 399-499 sequence. Seniors are not normally admitted into this program. However, students may be accepted if they have completed at least one semester of Bio 399 (for admittance at the beginning of first semester senior year) or one semester each of Bio 399 and 499 (for admittance at the beginning of second semest er senior year). A minimum grade point average of 3.20 is required and the application should be supported by a minimum of three letters of recommendation from faculty.

A major in Greek and Roman civilization (in English) is available through the general program with two concentrations: Mediterranean Archaeology and Art or Classical Literature and Culture . The Program also offers a minor in Greek and Roman Civilization. Careers The major concentrations in the department would be suitable preparation for teaching and for master's-level studies in classics or for professional programs in law, library science, theology, business administration or public administration. The department itself offers a master's degree with concentrations in Latin and classical archaeology. In the case of classical archaeology, several graduate programs would follow from this concentration, including conservation and preservation, museology, and Old World or classical archaeology. Special Programs or Opportunities There is a combined bachelor's/master's program which makes it possible to earn both degrees in a total of only five years. The department assist s students who seek placement in summer or academic-year programs in Greece or Italy (of which many are available) or who wish to participate in an archaeological excavation in Europe or the Mediterranean. All students in the Classical Art and Archaeology concentration are strongly urged to include archaeological fieldwork in their course of studies. Such a program is offered regularly during the summer session by both the Departments of Classics and Anthropology. Internships in archaeological documentation and conservation are also available at state agencies in the Albany area. Students who expect to enter a graduate program in classical archaeology are urged to pursue the study of Latin or ancient Greek.

These courses may be drawn from the department's regular offerings in \"Mediterranean Archaeology and Art\" or \"Classical Literature and Culture,\" depending on the student's concentration in the major. In addition, the student must complete a specifically designed three-credit junior- or senior-level independent study/research project under the close supervision of a member of the faculty. Finally, the student must complete at least 6 credits (but no more than 12) of intensive work culminating in a major project (or series of projects). This \"intensive work\" may take place in an independent study, a group tutorial, a workshop, archaeological field experience, special work in a seminar, and/or undergraduate research. The student must have written approval for the project from the honors adviser in the department at the outset of the project. The project will be formally evaluated at the end of the third quarter of the student's senior year and submitted in final form by the end of the fourth quarter. To be eligible for admission to the honors program, the student must have declared the Greek and Roman Civilization major and selected either of the two concentrations. The student must also have completed at least 12 credits of course work within the major. In the \"Classical Literature and Culture\" concentration, this would normally include two courses in Latin or Greek. In addition, the student must have an overall GPA of at least 3.25, and 3.50 in the major, both of which must be maintained in order to graduate with honors. Combined B.A/M.A. Program The combined B.A./M.A. program in Greek, Greek and Roman Civilization, Classical Archaeology, or Latin provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of the undergraduate and master's degree programs from the beginning of their junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees within nine semesters. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 87The combined program requires a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.A., students must meet all University and college requirements, including the requirements for the B.A. program described above, the minor requirement, the minimum 90-credit liberal arts and sciences requirements, general education requirements, and residency requirements. In qualifying for the M.A., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, or other professional experience where required, and residency requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.A. and M.A. programs. Students will be considered as undergraduates until completion of 120 graduation credits and satisfactory completion of all B.A. requirements. Upon meeting B.A. requi rements, students will automatically be considered as graduate students. Students ma y apply for admission to the combined degree program at the beginning of their junior year or after the successful completion of 56 credits, but no later than the accumulation of 100 credits. A cumulative grade point average of 3.20 or higher and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required for consideration.

Barberich, Ph.D. University of Pittsburgh William G. Husson, Ph.D. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Adjuncts (estimated): 6 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 12 The department specializes in studies of communication in each of three particular social contexts: first, communication on an individual level, involving interpersonal or intercultural relations; second, communication at the societal level involving large scale audiences, especially in regard to political action and democratic processes; and third, communication in organizations-whether business, governmental, or grass roots organizations--that affects either the organization's internal processes or external relations. All three of these areas have been significantly affected by new communication technologies, the study of which we incorporate into department course work. The undergraduate program in Communication has two primary goals. One is to educate students, and expose them to significant writings, about communication processes and media and the critical role they play in the conduct of social life and its quality among individuals, in organizations, and in the larger society. Our second goal grows out of the first; to help students become able to analyze and improve communication practices in particular settings and instances. This involves developing a basis for judging whether or not specific communication processes are meeting the needs of the people involved. It also involves learning about ways to measure the effectiveness of specific communication practices, and gaining experience analyzing and designing solutions to communication problems. Studies in the major are organized so that students enrolled in 100- and 200-level courses are exposed to foundational ideas and research findings in the field of Communication, as well as provided with research methods and analytic tools. Students are also required to become more practiced as communicators, either through a public speaking or debate course. Course work at the advanced (300 and 400) level is intended to provide students with in-depth knowledge of current research and theory about interpersonal/intercultural communication, organizational communication or public communication. Careers in Communication The program in Communication is intended to help students become knowledgeable about communication processes and their influences on the interpersonal, intercultural, organizational and political aspects of our societies. By focusing on development of analytical and critical skills, the program helps students become able to analyze and effectively participate in, and improve communication practices in diverse settings and instances. Having completed their degree in communication, the students will have a basis for judging whether or not specific communication processes are meeting the needs of the people involved. They will also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of specific communication practices, devise ways of improving them, and provide solutions to communication problems. These competencies have recognized value in the workplace as well as in one's personal life. Graduates of the Communication program have pursued careers in sales, media relations, marketing, training, commercial production, film, editing, media planning, publishing, journalism, financial advisement, budget analysis, legislative assistance, radio programming, advertising, television production, and internal communication in not-for-profit, governmental, and business organizations. Some have college teaching or advisement positions. Others have gone on to law school, or to work on their master's degree or doctoral degrees in Communication and related fields. Special Programs and Opportunities The department provides research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, a rigorous honors program, and an exceptional internship program. The department also provides a combined B.A./M.A. Program in Communication. We encourage all students to become active members of the local student club of the National Communication Association. We invite outstanding communication majors to be inducted into Lambda Pi Eta, the local chapter of the national honor society for communication. Internship Program The Communication Internship Practicum, which requires enrollment in both Com 392 for 9 cr. (these credits are general electives and do not apply toward the major or minor) and Com 393z for 6 cr., is a full-time internship offered in fall and spring for juniors and seniors who have an overall grade point average of 2.50 or higher. It includes a weekly seminar meeting, and places students in communication related professional settings including, but not limited to, radio, television, public relations, the state legislature, and corporate communication. If you are accepted in this internship, you are not allowed to take any other course work during the semester. Acceptance into the pr ogram is competitive. The part-time Internship in Communication (COM 390, for 1-3 lower-level credits) is for undergraduate majors and minors who wish to develop on-site experience in one of the communication professions. This part-time internship may be taken in fall, spring, or summer terms. There is no seminar component in this course, and the minimum number of hours at the host agency is proportionately less than the fulltime Internship Practicum. Admission Admission to the program in Communication is restricted. All students wishing to declare the major must complete an application and be formally admitted by the department. Applications can be made each semester. The deadline for submitting applications is the first day of class in the fall and spring semesters. Notification of admission or denial generally will be made within three business days by a posted list outside the department office, and afterwards by mail. Any matriculated student can apply for admission who has completed the following two courses with grades of C- or higher or S in each (See the section below for the policy on admission of transfer students to the major): University at Albany 90 (a) A Com 100, and (b) either a course in statistics (A Mat 108, B Itm 220, A Soc 221, R Crj 281, or A Psy 210), or a course in formal logic (A Phi 210 or equivalent). Students who apply and are not accepted can reapply in subsequent semesters. Note : A Com 100 course required for admission to the major must be taken on the Albany campus if the student does not already have credit for it prior to matriculation. An applicant will be guaranteed admission to the major whose grades in the two entry courses average to B or higher (in A Com 100, and either a statistics or logic course). Grades of S are counted as the equivalent of C for the purposes of this computation. Applicants whose grad es in the two entry courses average between B and C- will be admitted to the major on a space-available basis. Applications in this group are rank ordered each semester on the basis of a Composite Grade Point Average. This Composite Grade Point Average is computed by adding together the student's overall grade point average and the average of the grades in the two entry courses (A Com 100 and a statistics or logic course). Applicants in this group are accepted in descending rank order until all the spaces for new majors that semester are filled. However, no two applicants with the same Composite Grade Point Average will be treated differently: if one is accepted with that average, all others will be accepted with that average even if the total number accepted exceeds the available spaces that semester. Transfer students who have completed at least 3 credits in Communication courses, and a total of at least 6 credits in courses that count towards the major in Communication, will be admitted to the major automatically if their GPA in all transfer courses that count towards the major is 2.0 or higher. All other transfer students seeking admission to the major will have to meet the admissions requirements for matriculated students after they begin coursework on the Albany campus. Transfer students admitted to the major who do not have credit for A Com 100 or an approved statistics or logic course upon matriculation are still required to complete those courses with grades of C- or better. Transfer students whose grades in those two courses fall below that minimum are subject to being withdrawn from the major, pending an appeal and departmental review, but will automatically be readmitted if and when they meet the requirement. Advisement Majors in the Communication Department are encouraged to seek advisement each semester. Advisement is offe red by appointment between the end of the add-drop period and the beginning of the advance registration period. Majors who have been advised during that period are given priority for enrollment for the next semester's Communication classes. For students newly admitted to the major, attendance at an orientation meeting for new majors is required in order to get an advisement appointment. Advisement is under the direction of the Director of the Undergraduate Program. Advisement each semester is generally conducted by an advising staff composed of graduate assistants. However, undergraduate majors are encouraged to seek out a meeting with a faculty member when they begin their studies in the department to discuss their goals, and devise an overall plan of study supportive of those goals in the Department, in their Minor or Second Major, and in their General Education requirement courses and electives. Degree Requirements for the Major in Rhetoric and Communication General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits including: A Com 100; a computing course [all minors but business: A Cas 200 or B Itm 215 or I Csi 101 or I Csi 201 or I Ist 100 or I Ist 301] [business minors: B Itm 215 or I Csi 101 or I Csi 201]; a statistics course (A Mat 108 or B Itm 220 or A Soc 221 or R Crj 281 or A Psy 210) or logic (A Phi 210); A Com 265X; one course from either A Com 203 or 212; and 15-18 additional credits in the Department of Communi cation as advised (of which at least 12 credits must be at the 300-level or above); and 3-6 credits of supporting courses (outside the Department of Communication), as advised. A Com 265X is restricted to A-E grading after matriculation at Albany. Course offerings are listed below in grouping according to the following headings: 1.General Foundations, 2.Public Communication, 3.Interpersonal Interaction/Cultural Practices, 4.Organizational Communication, 5.Applied Studies. Courses in General F oundations offer students an introduction to the practice and social consequences of communication in a variety of settings, and an overview of traditional and contemporary thought on human communication. Courses in Public Communication create a basic understanding of the process of communication in the political process, and public life more generally. This includes attention to communication and media issues in political participation, legislative processes, social movements, and election campaigns. This also includes attention to the speaker-audience setting typical of argumentation and persuasion in social and political life. Courses in Interpersonal Interaction/Cultural Practices provide for a basic understanding of the process of communication in face to face interaction. These include attention to language use and strategy in personal relationships, health care, and work relationships of various kinds. Other courses include attention to cultural differences in face to face and group communication practices, and the role of communication in everyday life. Courses in Organizational Communication address communication processes within and between organizations that affect their internal operations, development, climate, productivity, and social acceptance. These courses include a concern for the effect of new information technologies on organizational communication. Applied Studies courses provide an opportunity for students who have achieved a grounding in the appropriate theoretical and research literature of the field, to apply this knowledge in independent projects or internships. Honors Program The honors program in Communication is designed to provide opportunities for the most talented and motivated students to work closely with each other and with the faculty. Students may apply for admission at any point during a semester and may reapply if rejected after the close of that semester or thereafter. Decisions of the Honors Committee on admission are final and not subject to review or appeal. Applications for admission will be approved if the student meets the following criteria: The applicant is a major in the department, with a 3.50 average in the required courses for admission to the major. The applicant has completed at least two full-time semesters of college study at Albany, with an overall average of at least 3.50, or the equivalent in the case of transfer students. Admission to the program will be on a provisional basis for any student with fewer than 12 credits in Communication. Upon completion of 12 credits, admission will be finalized. Students in the honors program are required to complete a minimum of 36 credits, meeting all Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 91requirements of the major, except for a special requirement among courses at the 300 level or above as follows: instead of 6 credits of electives at the 300 level or above, students in the honors program must complete either an honors project for 6 credits (A Com 499), or a senior honors project for 3 credits (A Com 499) plus 3 credits in a graduate course in Communication (for undergraduate credit) with approval of the undergraduate director. Students will be put on program probation by the Honors Committee at the end of any semester in which their cumulative average in the major falls below 3.50 or their term average that semester is below 3.30. Students will be dismissed from the program if they are placed on program probation in two consecutive semesters, or if they receive a grade below B in A Com 499. Students dismissed from the program cannot be readmitted unless the grades on which dismissal is based were in error and are officially changed. After completion of the requirements above, the records of candidates will be reviewed by the Departmental Honors Committee, who shall recommend to the department candidates for the degree with honors in Rhetoric and Communication. Combined B.A./M.A. Program The combined B.A./M.A. program in Rhetoric and Communication provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergra duate and master's degree programs from the beginning of the junior year. The program provides an integrated and focused curriculum in Communication that allows the upper-level student exposure to advanced knowledge in theory and substantive areas and opportunities for participation in research. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees within nine semesters. The combined program requires a minimum of 141 credits, of which at least 33 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.A., students must meet all University and college requirements, including the requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minor requirement, the minimum 90-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general education requirement s, and residency requirements. In qualifying for the M.A., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 33 graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar or thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residenc y requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.A. and M.A. programs. Students who have comp leted a minimum of 6 credits of course work in Rhetoric and Communication may apply for admission to the combined degree program in Rhetoric and Communication at the beginning of their junior year or after the successful completion of 56 credits, but no later than the accumulation of 100 credits. A cumulative grade point average of 3.20 or higher and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required for consideration.

Careers Graduates with a B.S. in geology or environmental science have found satisfying employment not only in jobs directly related to these disciplines but also in a wide variety of other activities. Students graduating with a B.S. in geology who pursue advanced degrees in geology, computer science, business administration, or geophysics have a competitive edge in the job market. Professional opportunities in jobs using geological expertise are much wider for graduates with master's degrees, in particular for employment with environmental service/consulting companies, oil and mineral resource companies, and with state or federal agencies having responsibilities involving geological matters (geological surveys, water supply, environmental c onservation, transport, etc.). Developing shorta ges of fossil fuels and raw materials for industry, along with an increasing need for professionals trained to understand complex environmental problems should provide a sustained demand for professional geologists and environmental scientists. Special Programs or Opportunities The Geology Program sponsors two weekly seminar series that provide students with a sampling of important topics in current geological research: (1) informal talks given by faculty and graduate students; and (2) formal seminars presented by outside speakers. The Program also sponsors field trips in New York, New England, and the Appalachians. Degree Requirements for the Major in Geology General Program B.S.: A minimum of 66 credits for the combined major and minor including: (Required) A Geo 100 or A Geo 100Z, 106, 210, 212, 222, 230, 231 (or 231Z), 330, 350, 400, , 470 ; A Mat 111 or 112 or 118, 113 or 119; A Phy 105 or 140 or 141, 106 or 145, 108 or 150 or 151; 109 or 155, A Chm 120 or 130, 121 or 131, 124, 125.

Departmental Honors Program Students who have achieved a GPA of 3.5 in the major, and an overall GPA of 3.25, may apply to the Department Chairperson not later than the end of their junior year to enter the Department Honors Program. Interested students should enroll in Geo 499, Seminar in Geology, in the spring semester of their junior year. In order to graduate with Honors, accepted students must take A Geo 498, Independent Honors Research (3 credits), and complete it with a grade of A or A-, as well as maintaining superior academic performance overall and in the major during their senior year. Proposals for research to be done in A Geo 498 must be approved in writing by the supervising faculty member and the Department Chairperson before the end of the spring semester of the student's junior year. The other three required credits for Departmental Honors will consist of a to tal of three credits of A Geo 499 Seminar in Geology, one in each of the last three semesters of the degree program. Combined B.S./M.S. Program The combined B.S./M.S. program in geology provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergraduate and maste r's degree programs from the beginning of the junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.S. and M.S. degrees within ten semesters. The combined program requires a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.S., University at Albany 94 students must meet all University and college requirements, including th e requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minimum 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general educational requirements, and residency requireme nts. In qualifying for the M.S., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residency requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.S. and M.S. programs. The following graduate courses may be substituted for required undergraduate courses: A Geo 517 for A Geo 470, A Geo 535 for A Geo 435, A Geo 550 for A Geo 450, A Geo 566 for A Geo 466,. A reading knowledge of a foreign language useful in the study of geology (French, German, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese) must be demonstrated before completion of the program, or satisfactory proficiency in a research skill such as computer programming may be substituted for the language requirement at the discretion of the department.

Adjuncts (estimated): 1 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 10 The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) provide the University with the state's largest program in atmospheric science and meteorology. The undergraduate program provides a broad background in three fundamental areas of atmospheric science: synoptic (observations and weather forecasting), dynamic (theory and computer modeling), and physical (lightning, acid rain, cloud physics, atmospheric chemistry). Because the department has a highly active research program in these areas, many opportunities exist for undergraduate research projects and part-time jobs. The first two years of the program provide basic training in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and introductory atmospheric science. All students are encouraged to take one or two 100-level courses for enjoyment and experience (these count as electives but not as courses for the major). In the junior and senior years, requirements in the fundamental areas of atmospheric science are combined with electives, including advanced courses on atmospheric physics, atmospheric dynamics, weather forecasting, tropical meteorology and hurricanes, solar energy, air pollution, climatology, and computer applications. Highly qualified students are eligible to enter an accelerated degree program in their junior year that leads to a combined B.S./M.S. degree. Many opportunities exist for students to become involved in department activities. Each semester, several students take part in an internship program with the on-campus office of the National Weather Service (NWS), gaining experience with weather forecasting and familiarity with the responsibilities of a NWS meteorologist. In addition, a weather forecasting competition is held in the department each semester while classes are in session. The forecasting, along with concurrent weather discussions led by a faculty member, are open to all undergraduate majors. Undergraduates hired part-time and during the summer through research grants have the chance to work closely with a faculty member while contributing to current meteorological research. The Eastern New York Chapter of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) meets regularly and provides speakers of general interest on a variety of meteorological topics. Through these and other activities, the department offers exciting and varied opportunities to any student curious about the science of the atmosphere around us. Atmospheric Science B.S. Careers Graduates obtain employment in weather forecasting, environmental engineering, radio and TV broadcasting, scientific consulting, and other private firms; in university departments and research laboratories; and in federal and state agencies such as the National Weather Service, U.S. Air Force, and NY State Department of Environmental Conservation. Graduate school and the pursuit of an advanced degree is an expected option for our graduates. (The department offers full financial support and a complete tuition waiver to most students accepted into our graduate program.) Degree Requirements for the Major in Atmospheric Science General Program B.S.: A combined major and minor sequence including A Atm 210 (or 210Z), 211, 320, 321, 333, 410, 411; at least 12 additional credits from A Atm 307 (or 307Z) and higher level courses as advised; A Phy 140 or 141, 145, 150 or 151, 240 or 241; A Mat 111 or 112 or 118, 113 or 119, 214, 311; A Chm 120 or 130, 124. No more than 6 credits from A Atm 490, 497, 498 or 499 may be applied toward the major requirements; furthe r, a maximum of 3 credits from A Atm 490 will apply. A solid foundation in physics and mathematics is recommended for all students planning to major in atmospheric science. It is recommended that all students considering this major meet with a representative of the department before each of the freshman and sophomore registration sessions. Departmental Honors Program Students who have by the end of their fourth semester attained a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.25 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in courses required of the major in atmospheric science may apply to the department chair for the program leading to a B.S. degree with honors in atmospheric science. Applications must be submitted before the end of the first semester of the student's junior year and must be accompanied by letters of recommendation from at least two faculty members. To be admitted to the program, a student must have completed three semesters of physics (A Phy 140 or 141, 145, 150 or 151, 240 or 241), three semesters of mathematics (A Mat 111 or 112 or 118, 113 or 119, 214), and must be enrolled in or have completed A Atm 333. These requirements may be altered, upon request, for qualified transfer students. At the end of the junior year, the student's program will be reviewed by the Honors Committee to see if satisfactory progress is being made. To be eligible for a degree with honors, students must complete a minimum of 74 credits specified as follows: (1) the physics, mathematics, and chem istry requirements of the major; (2) the core sequence in atmospheric science (A Atm 210 or 210Z, 211, 320, 321, 333, 410 and 411) plus any three A Atm courses at the 400 or 500 level; (3) a coherent core of three upper-division courses in any discipline besides atmospheric science; and (4) 6 credits of A Atm 499 taken over at least two semesters culminating in a significant undergraduate thesis and an honors seminar in the student's final semester. Students in the program must maintain both a minimum grade point average of 3.25 overall and 3.5 in atmospheric science courses taken to satisfy major requirements during the junior and senior years. Upon completion of the requirements, the honors committee will make its recommendation to the faculty to grant the degree with honors in atmospheric science based upon the candidate's (1) academic record, (2) research project report, (3) honors seminar, and (4) faculty recommendations. Combined B.S./M.S. Program The combined B.S./M.S. program in atmospheric science provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill simultaneously undergraduate and graduate course requirements in their senior year, thereby accelerating progress toward the M.S. degree. A carefully designed program can permit a student to complete the B.S. and M.S. degrees one year soone r than is otherwise possible. The combined program requires a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.S., students must meet all University and college requirements, including the requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minimum 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, the general education requirements, and residency requirements. In qualifying for the M.S., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits and any other Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 97conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residenc y requirements. Up to 9 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.S. and M.S. programs. In the summer following the senior year, the student will begin work on his or her graduate research. In preparation for this accelerated research program, the student will be required to take two semesters (6 credits) of A Atm 499, Undergraduate Research, during the junior or senior year. These 6 credits may be counted toward the undergraduate elective requirement from either of the following requirements: (1) from any four additional A Atm courses at the 400 or 500 level as advised or (2) from 6 additional credits in mathematics or sciences as advised. Students may apply for admission to the combined degree program in atmospheric science at the beginning of their junior year or after the successful completion of 56 credits, but not later than the accumulation of 100 credits.

It is also an excellent undergraduate background for study in professional schools of law, accounting, business administration, public administration, public policy, social work, and others. The department also offers the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in economics. Careers Graduates of the undergraduate economics program work as financial analysts, finance and credit officers for insurance companies and banks, economic analysts for corporations, policy and legislative fiscal analysts, and business officers for nonprofit and government organizations, as well as administrators and heads of businesses and government agencies. Admission Students may not declare a major in economics until they have completed both A Eco 110 and 111 with grades of C or better. For exceptional circumstances, students who do not meet these requirements may appeal by written petition to the department chair. Appeals received by the first day of classes each semester will be evaluated before the final date for adding semest er-length courses. Transfer students who have not completed both A Eco 110 and 111, or their equivalents, with grades of C or better will not be formally admitted to the major when they enter the University. Transfer students who are not admitted, but who want to major in economics, may declare their intention to major in economics and will be advised by the department as intended majors for one semester. After satisfying the admission criteria, students may be admitted to the major. Degree Requirements for the Major in Economics General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits as follows: A Eco 110, 111, 300, 301 and 320; A Eco 210 or A Mat 106, 111, 112 or 118; and 18 additional credits in economics at the 300 level or above.

For both the B.A. and B.S. programs, A Eco 300, 301, and 320 must be taken at the University unless completed elsewhere prior to matriculation. Honors Program The honors program is designed to provide capable and motivated students with a greater understanding of economics and to better prepare students for graduate and professional schools. Students may apply to the honors program after completing any two of A Eco 300, 301, and 320. To be accepted and to complete the program, the student must have an average of at least 3.40 in all courses applicable to the major and 3.25 in all courses taken at the University. Interested students shoul d see the department's Director of Undergraduate Studies even before completing the required courses, for advice on choosing elective courses and on meeting the other requirements of the honors program. The honors student must complete all requirements of the B.S. program in economics, including A Eco 499Z (the Senior Honors Research Seminar) as part of the program. In addition, the honors student must submit a senior honors thesis acceptable to the Economics Honors Committee. A plan for the senior honors thesis normally arises from consulta tion with faculty concerning a suitable topic and method of inquiry. The student, with advice and consent of the Economics Honors Committee, will choose a faculty adviser who will assist the student in completing the thesis. Work on the thesis may begin in the junior year, but it must be completed while the student is enrolled in A Eco 499Z. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 107If all requirements stated above are met, the department will recommend that the student be awarded the B.S. degree with honors in economics. Combined Bachelor's/Master's Programs Combined programs leading to a bachelor's degree in Economics and a master's degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.), Public Administration (M.P.A.), or Health Policy and Management (M.S.) provide students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity the opportunity to fulfill integrated requirements for the undergraduate and graduate degrees. With careful planning, it is possible to earn both degrees in five years. To qualify for the bachelor's degree (B.A. or B.S., as approved), students must meet all requirements for the unde rgraduate major and minor described previously, the minimum 90- or 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, the general education requirements, and the re sidency requirements. To qualify for the master's degree (M.B.A., M.P.A., or M.S.), students must meet all requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin including the completion of required graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residence requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to the bachelor's and master's programs. Students may be admitted to one of the combined degree programs at the beginning of their junior year, or after the successful completion of 56 credits, but no later than the accumulation of 100 credits. A grade point average of at least 3.3 (M.B.A.) or 3.2 (M.P.A. and M.S.) and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required.

Pipkin, Ph.D. (Collins Fellow) (Department Chair) Northwestern University Professors Ray Bromley, Ph.D. Cambridge University Floyd M. Henderson, Ph.D. University of Kansas Christopher J. Smith, Ph.D. University of Michigan Roger W. Stump, Ph.D. University of Kansas Associate Professors Gene Bunnell, Ph.D. London School of Economics Andrei Lapenis, Ph.D. State Hydrological Institute, Saint Petersburg James E. Mower, Ph.D. State University of New York at Buffalo Kwadwo A. Sarfoh, Ph.D. University of Cincinnati Assistant Professors Youqin Huang, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles Catherine T. Lawson, Ph.D. Portland State University David A Lewis, Ph.D. Rutgers University Adjuncts (estimated): 8 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 9.5 The Department of Geography and Planning offers programs leading to the B.A., M.A., and M.R.P. degrees, a combined B.A./M.A. program, and an Undergraduate/Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis. Undergraduate students can major or minor in geography and the department also offers a major and minor in urban studies and planning. Geographers study the characteristics of space, location and place in the broader context of how people interact with both physical and human environments. Geography can be classified as both a natural science and a social science as it examines people and their environment and serves as a bridge between the physical and cultural worlds. Planning is a discipline and professional practice that deals with the form, organization, and orderly development of cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Geographic information systems (GIS), computer mapping, remote sensing, and related technologies are central to the discipline of geography and are indispensable in many areas of professional planning practice. Teaching and research in the department emphasize urban, social, physical, and cultural geography; city and regional planning; urban design; remote sensing; cartography and geographic information systems; studies; climatology; computer and statistical models; area (regional) studies; urban and regional planning methods; economic development; small town and rural land-use planning. Members of the faculty have strong international links with China, Russia, Australia, and various countries in Africa, Latin America and Western Europe. Careers The undergraduate programs provide background suitable for entry into a wide variety of business, educational and government occupations, as well for graduate or professional study in geography, planning, business, public administration, forestry, landscape architecture and other environmentally oriented programs. Career possibilities include: cartographers, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (G.I.S.) specialists; location and market area analysts; urban, regional, economic, and transportation planners; environmental scientists; international development specialists; urban design professionals; industrial and real estate developers; soil scientists; marketing and distribution managers; journalists; and travel and recreation specialists.

Undergraduate Certificate Program in Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis This certificate program provides undergraduates with professional and technical training in geographic information systems (GIS) and associated techniques of spatial analysis. Geographic information systems are computer-based systems for storage, analysis, and display of spatial data. The disciplines of cartography, remote sensing and computer graphics are closely linked to the study of GIS. In conjunction with GIS, methods of spatial analysis may be used to study a wide range of problems, including resource management, land management for agriculture and forestry, urban planning, land use mapping, market area analysis, urban social analysis and a host of other applications. The certificate requires 20 credit hours of undergraduate course work: 20 credits of core course work, including A Gog 290, 385, 414, 485 (or 485Z), 496, and A Mat 108 (or an approved equivalent). Faculty-Initiated Interdisciplinary Major with a Concentration in Urban Studies and Planning The Urban Studies and Planning Major is designed for students interested in a liberal arts education focusing on urban and suburban environments, and on urban, community and neighborhood development. The program of study mixes conventional classes with fieldwork and computer-based learning, and it requires considerable awareness of international, multicultural and policy issues. Students with training in Urban Studies and Planning may enter careers in housing and community development, real estate, local and state government, local economic development, or local planning. They can pursue further study in graduate or professional schools to specialize in city and regional planning, public policy, real estate, architecture, or landscape architecture.

Gage, Ph.D. Pennsylvania State University Helen T. Ghiradella, Ph.D. University of California, Santa Barbara Lawrence M. Schell, Ph.D. University of Pennsylvania Assistant Professors Tom D. Brutsaert, Ph.D. Cornell University The Human Biology program is an interdepartmental (Anthropology and Biology) combined major/minor designed for students interested in a liberal arts education with particular focus on the human organism. It provides a strong background in human evolution, structure, function and behavior. This program is especially suitable for those seeking careers (e.g. medicine, forensics, public health, administration, business, journalism) that deal directly or indirectly with human health and welfare. Students interested in research and/or teaching careers in biological anthropology are especially encouraged to major in Human Biology. Most graduate programs in Anthropology require undergraduate coursework in at least three of the four traditional subfields of anthropology (archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology), and some also require linguistics as the fourth subfield. It is advisable, therefore, for those intending to do graduate work in an anthropology department to take at least one course in each of these subfields. Students who plan on graduate work and professional careers in Biology are advised to major in Biological Sciences. Degree Requirements for the Faculty- Initiated Interdisciplinary Major with a Concentration in Human Biology General Program B.S.: Combined major and minor sequence consisting of a minimum of 55 credits to be taken from: (a) Required courses (40 credits minimum): A Ant 110, 211, and any two of A Ant 311, 319, 312/A Bio 318; A Bio 110 or 110Z A Bio 111, A Bio 205 or 212, A Bio 410; A Chm 120 or 130, 121 or 131, A Chm 122; A Mat 108 or A Psy 210 or A Soc 221 or one semester of college mathematics exclusive of A Mat 100, 102, or 105; A Phy 105.

Combinations with particularly strong employment potential are French Studies and economics, political science and business. Special Programs and Opportunities The University maintains summer, semester and year-long exchange programs in France with the University of Montpellier, a program which provides students an opportunity to study French language at any level (no language prerequisite), literature and culture as well as business and economics in either French or English. An array of programs are available for study elsewhere in France, Quebec and other French-speaking parts of the world. The Office of International Programs provides students with guidance in choosing the right program. The program sponsors a \"Face to Face\" series which brings to campus an important figure in contemporary French thought, letters, film or art. Opportunities to use French and to exchange ideas outside of class are provided through Le cercle fran\u00e7ais, lecture and film series, and other activities.

The junior year is spent at the University of Montpellier where students take courses in French, European Economics, Management and Marke ting, International Management and Finance. They also participate in internship/community service projects. The fourth and fifth years focus on completing the requirements for the M.B.A. degree. Language Placement How do I know what level French is for me? Students wishing to enroll in French for the first time at the Univer sity at Albany should enroll in French 101 if they have never studied French before. Any student who has studied French in high school or at another university, or who has grown up in a French-speaking environment, must take the French placement test to determine which course to take. The placement test is given during summer advisement and during the first week of classes in the fall. Students without placement test scores should use the following guidelines in selecting the appropriate course. Please note that students taking a lower level course after having completed a course at a higher level will not receive graduation credits for that course. A Fre 101 Students who have no previous experience with French or whose experience is the equivalent of less than one year of high school level French; placement test score 0-279. A Fre 102 Students who have completed one year of high school level French or its equivalent; placement test score 280-340. A Fre 221 Students who have completed two years of high school level French or its equivalent; placement test score 341-394. A Fre 222 Students who have completed three years of high school level French or its equivalent. These students should see the Undergraduate Adviser to discuss the possibility of majoring or minoring in French; placement test score 395 and above. A Fre 301 Students who have completed four years of high school level French or its equivalent. These students should see the Undergraduate Adviser to discuss the possibility of majoring or minoring in French. Exceptions: 1) Students may elect to enroll one level higher or lower than the level suggested by the above guidelines. Factors which could be taken into consideration in making this decision are: the length of time which has elapsed since last formal study of French; additional travel or home experience with the language; quality of previous program of study; grades earned (overall performance) in previous study. Note, however, that the Language Placement rules of the Undergraduate Bulletin state that A Fre 101 may not be taken for credit by students who have taken three years of high school French or passed the Regents examination within the last five years. 2) Students who wish to be placed more than one level higher or lower than the placement suggested by these guidelines must have written permission from the Language Program Coordinator. 3) Students who have completed A Fre 200 or Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 143221 through the University in High School Program should enroll in A Fre 222; students who have completed A Fre 210 or A Fre 222 should enroll in A Fre 301. 4) Students who have received Advanced Placement (AP) credit should see the Language Program Coordinator to discuss their program of study. 5) Students whose experience with French has not been primarily through organized study in an American high school setting should consult with the Language Program Director or the Undergraduate Adviser for help in selecting an appropriate class. Students are strongly encouraged to see the Language Program Director if they feel they are in the wrong class or if they have any questions about placement. Decisions to change courses should be made no later than the fourth week of classes. Degree Requirements for the Major in French General Program B.A.: a minimum of 36 credits above A Fre 222.

Opportunities for occupations requiring Italian or bilingual background would also be enhanced. Graduates usually teach Italian or are involved with bilingual education. Others work for airlines that fly to Italy and with American companies doing business there. Occupational areas in which Spanish majors have been employed are teaching, public relations, state and federal service, foreign service of the U.S., airlines, travel agencies, and in businesses dealing with Spanish-speaking countries.

Rougle, Ph.D. University of Stockholm The study of Russian and other Slavic languages and literatures is offered not only for its intrinsic interest, but also as a means toward understanding the peoples and cultures of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Major programs lay a firm foundation for postgraduate study in diverse fields or for various professional occupations. Careers In addition to traditional careers in secondary-school and university-level, graduates are finding employment in business, the media, banking, the legal profession, as consultants in non-governmental agencies dealing with commerce, democratization, and the development of civil society in Russia and other post-Soviet states, as i nvestment fund analysts, travel agents, cultural exchange coordinators, exhibit guides, translators and interpreters, and in many other fields. Special Opportunities To provide access to the riches of Russian literature and culture to all undergraduates, regardless of their interest in language, the Slavic and Eurasian Studies program offers a wide range of courses in Russian literature, culture and film in translation. These courses assume no prior knowledge of the Russian language and are intended also for students who are not majoring in Russian. Students interested in these courses are advised to consult the program for current offerings and course descriptions. Opportunities to spend a semester in Russia are made possible through close cooperation between the SUNY and Moscow State University. Language Placement Experience indicates that students with one year of high school Russian will usually place in A Rus 101 or 102, with two years in A Rus 102, with three years in A Rus 102 or 201, and with four years in A Rus 201.

The major offers a liberal education that combines the approaches of the humanities, the social sciences and the sciences. It also provides appropriate preparation for those interested in pursuing graduate work in linguistics or related disciplines. The Program in Linguistics and Cognitive Science and the Department of Educational Theory and Practice offer a combined B.A./M.S. program leading to a bachelor's degree in linguistics and a master's in teaching English to speakers of other languages. Careers Linguistics majors compete favorably with those from other humanities and social science disciplines for entry-level positions in public relations, commerce, publishing and other fields requiring analytical, communication and research skills. Career opportunities for graduates also include computer programming, computer software development, editing, technical writing and dictionary-making. Students planning to undertake professional study in such fields as law, public administration, public policy, speech pathology and education will find that course work in linguistics provides valuable preparation in analytical skills as well as an understanding of the social implications of language and attitudes toward language. For suggested sequences of courses appropriate to specific areas of advanced study or careers, consult the undergraduate adviser. Special Programs or Opportunities The possibility of studying a foreign language not regularly taught at the University is provided by A Lin 289, Directed Study in Foreign Languages. This course is open to any undergraduate student in the University. For current offerings, consult the undergraduate adviser. The program also sponsors minors in Linguistics and Cognitive Science (See Approved Minors section of this bulletin for details). Degree Requirements for the Major in Linguistics General Program B.A.: 36 credits in the major field of study, including: A Lin 220, 321, 322, 421 or 422, 429; one year of a foreign language (or A Lin 423, Linguistic Structures)*, as advised; additional credits, as advised, including a minimum of 3 credits at the 300 level or above; these are to be chosen from courses offered by the Program in Linguistics and Cognitive Science and from approved courses in other departments. *This language should be of radically different structure from the foreign language chosen for the language proficiency requirement (See below.) Non-Indo-European languages are usually advised. Credits earned in A Lin 289 may be counted toward the 36-credit requirement only if used to fulfill this one-year language requirement. Other Degree Requirements Language Requirement: Majors are required to demonstrate competence in a foreign language equivalent to two years of study of skill courses in a foreign language at the college level. This requirement may be satisfied by course work or the passing of the appropriate examination. Credits earned for the proficiency requirement are additional to the 36-credit requirement described above. Courses in other depart ments approved for the linguistics major.

In addition to including the standard courses in pure and applied mathematics, our course offerings are unusually strong in statistics and actuarial mathematics. The department offers two majors: the major in mathematics and the major in actuarial and mathematical sciences. A third major, the major in computer science and applied mathematics, is offered jointly with the computer science department. Careers The objective of the department is to serve the needs of students aspiring to careers that require mathematical background: physical, biological, social, and management sciences; statistics, actuarial work, computer science, applied mathematics; secondary school teaching; graduate work; college and university teaching; and research in mathematics. In most cases, training beyond the bachelor's degree is desirable and can often be obtained after the graduate has secured employment. The department also welcomes students who wish to study mathematics as part of a traditional liberal arts education. Placement and Proficiency Credit The University awards up to 8 credits and advanced placement in its sequences of calculus courses based on performance on the advanced placement calculus examinations administered by the College Board. Details concerning the decisions on credit and placement are available from the Admissions Office. Admission Students may not declare a major in either mathematics or actuarial and mathematical science until they have completed at least one of A Mat 113, 119, or 214 with a grade of A, B, C, or S. Transfer credits and grades may be used to satisfy the requirement. The Mathematics Major Students majoring in ma thematics may choose to complete the requirements for either the B.A. or B.S. degree. Under any of the four program-degree combinations, a student may apply for admission to the honors program. Students considering a major in mathematics or actuarial minor are encouraged to visit the department office (ES-110) for advice. Information is also available at the web site http://math.albany.edu. Degree Requirements for the Major in Mathematics General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in course s numbered above 110, including A Mat 214, 220, and a 3-credit course numbered above 300 in each of these four areas: algebra, analysis, geometry/topology, and probability/statistics. General Program B.S.: A minimum of 36 credits from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in cour ses numbered above 110, including A Mat 214, 220, and two of the following four options: (1) A Mat 326 and 327, (2) either (a) both A Mat 314 and 315 or (b) any two of 312, 412, 413, or 414, (3) any two of A Mat 342, 441, or 442, (4) any two of A Mat 367, 368, 369, 464, 465, 467, 468. With departmental approval, other 400-level or 500-level courses may be substituted for the courses listed above. In addition, each student must complete: 6 credits in computer science from I Csi 101, 201, 203, 204, 205, 310; and a minor in atmospheric science, biology, business, chemistry, computer science, economics, electronics, geology, or physics. NOTE: The Statistics minor is not open to students with a major in mathematics. Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 165General Program Students, with suitable advisement, can design programs that will best meet their particular interests and career goals. Note, however, that those who plan to do graduate work in any mathematical field\u2014pure or applied\u2014should obtain as strong an undergraduate background as possible in the basic areas of mathematics: algebra, analysis, and geometry/topology. In particular, they should make every effort to include A Mat 413 and 414 (Advanced Calculus) in their programs. To guide students in their planning, a number of options, some of a general nature and others to meet specific career objectives, are presented here. 1. Liberal Arts (B.A.) Some professional careers and many jobs require a mathematical background characterized more by breadth than by concentration in any particular area of the mathematical sciences. The purpose of the B.A. program is to assure that the student acquires a broad view of mathematics and statistics. Each B.A. major is required to complete a 3-credit course numbered above 300 in each of these areas: algebra, analysis, geometry/topology, and probability/statistics. Th e following lists those courses that can be taken to fulfill that requirement: Algebra: A Mat 326, 326Z, 327, 327Z, 424 Analysis: 311, 409, 412Z, 413Z, 441, 442 Probability/Statistics: A 367Z, 368, 369, 464, 465, 465Z, 467, 468 Students are urged to explore in greater depth, preferably at the 400 level. Since students will have different goals, it is impossible to provide useful sample programs. Students are encouraged to devise their own plans in consultation with their advisers. However, if a student is to graduate on time, the calculus sequence and linear algebra should be completed during the freshmen and sophomore years. 2. Secondary School Teaching: Students planning to become mathematics teachers at the secondary level and would like to pursue the Teacher Certification Program after graduation need to fulfill the following requirements: 36 credits in mathematics as follows: A Mat 112, 113, 214, 220, 311 or 312, 326, 327, 331, 342, 367, 368. 6 credits in one science, one year of a language. use of graphing Calculator. GPA 3.0 or higher overall and in mathematics A suggested schedule of courses in mathematics is: Year Fall Spring Fresh. 112 or 118 113 or 119 Soph. 214 220 & 367(Z) Junior 326 & 368 327 Senior 311 or 312 & 342 331 Students are also encouraged to take Etap 201 in their Junior year. Seniors should contact advisors in the Academy for Initial Teacher Preparation of the Department of Educational Theory and Practice. 3. Graduate School Preparation The department offers excellent opportunities for students who plan to go on to graduate work in mathematics and statistics as well as other areas such as computer science, the natural sciences, and the social and behavioral sciences. Students whose goal is to obtain a graduate degree in mathematics should include in their programs as many of the following core courses as possible in each of the designated areas: Algebra: A Mat 326, 327, 424 Analysis: A Mat 413, 414 Geometry/Topology: A Mat 342 Probability/Statistics: A Mat 467, 468 Those hoping to do graduate work should also consider entering the honors program. 4. Applied Mathematics Although it is common to classify mathematics as either \"pure\" or \"applied,\" the division is often arbitrary. Some extremely abstract mathematics in recent years has turned out to be useful in areas outside mathematics. Students preparing for a career in applied mathematics would be we ll advised to acquire as strong a background as possible in the pure mathematical areas of analysis, algebra, and geometry/topology. On the other hand, students concentrating in pure mathematics should have some understanding of how to apply mathematical methods to other disciplines. Listed here are the mathematical subjects that are more commonly applied to problems in other fields along with the corresponding courses in which methodology or applications are treated. Applied algebra: A Mat 326, 372 Applied analysis: A Mat 311, 314, 315, 409, 412, 416 Numerical Methods: A Mat 313, 401 Probability/Statistics: A Mat 367, 368, 369, 464, 465 5. Statistics Statistics is a widely applied branch of mathematics and the demand for statisticians is high. Preparation for a career or for advanced study in statistics should include one of the following two combinations of courses: (1) probability (A Mat 367 or 367Z, 464) and statistics (A Mat 368 or 368Z, 369 or 369Z, 465 or 465Z), or (2) probability (A Mat 367 or 367Z, 464) and statistics (A Mat 467, 468). Sequence (2) is recommended as the more advanced and thorough treatment. A Mat 424 (advanced linear algebra) is highly recommended. Also useful are A Mat 401, 409, 413 or 413Z, and 414. Because computing is a close adjunct to statistics, students are strongly advised to include I Csi 201, 205, and 310 as a minimal introduction. Honors Program The honors program is designed for the talented and committed student of mathematics. Successful completion of the program is excellent preparation for graduate work in mathematics. Students entering the University with strong mathematical backgrounds should consider taking Honors Calculus, A Mat 118 and 119, in place of the standard Calculus, A Mat 112 and 113. A student may be admitted formally to the honors program at any time after the sophomore year, and then will be formally advised by the Director of the Honors Program. However, any student who is interested in the program should see the Director of the Honors Program as early as possible for informal advisement. To be admitted, the applicant must have an academic average in all University courses of at least 3.30, and an academic average in all mathematics courses of at least 3.40. Specific course requirements are: A Mat 413 or 413Z, 414, 424, and 9 additional credits from among A Mat 327 or 327Z, 416, 420, 425, 432 or 432Z, (max imum of 3 credits). To be recommended for graduation with honors, the candidate must write an acceptable honors thesis and also maintain an academic average of at least 3.30 in all University courses and at least 3.40 in all mathematics courses numbered 400 or above. The Actuarial Major The actuarial major is designed to prepare students for employment in the actuarial field and as preparation for the preliminary actuarial examinations. Past experience suggests that students who pass even one actuarial exam while in college are likely to secure employment in the field, and some students have secured actuarial employment before taking or passing any exams. The B.S. program in actuarial science exposes students to virtually all the material on the Course 1, 2, 3 exams and to most of the content of the Course 4 exam. University at Albany 166 The B.S. in actuarial science was revised in 2002 to reflect recent revisions (jointly made by the Society of Actuaries and by the Casualty Actuarial Society) of the actuarial examinations. The new actuarial major reflects the new examinations' greater emphasis on applied probability, stochastic modeling, economics, and finance. Actuarial majors whose first enrollment at the University at Albany was prior to September 2002 are responsible for fulfilling the requirements of the catalogue in effect when they first enrolled. Such students are encouraged to make approved course substitutions so that the courses they take are relevant to current actuarial exams. The actuarial exams are interdisciplinary, testing material from several courses. Some of the courses listed below as preparation for an exam are relevant to only a few questions on that exam. Students may reasonably decide to take an exam before taking all the courses listed as relevant. Actuarial majors are encouraged (but not required) to take A Mat 118 and 119, the honors versions of A Mat 112, 113. Students who do not take A Mat 118 and 119 are encouraged to take A Mat 312 during their junior year. Course 1 Exam: Mathematical Foundations of Actuarial Science. Students need A Mat 112, 113, 214, 367, and 368 (continuous probability) before attempting this exam. A Mat 467 and A Eco 110 will also be useful, but onl y for a few questions. Course 2 Exam: Interest Theory, Economics, and Finance. Topics: Interest Theory (A Mat 301/A Eco 351); Microeconomics (A Eco 110); Macroeconomics (A Eco 111); Finance (A Eco 466); Interest Theory/Finance (A Mat 301, A Eco 466); Finance/Economics (A Mat 301, A Eco 466). B Fin 300 may also be useful for the last two topics. Course 3 Exam: Actuarial models. Requires A Mat 301, 403, 464, and 465 (which in turn requires 368). Course 4 Exam: Actuarial Modeling. Requires A Mat 464, 465, plus some self-study on topics not normally covered in these course. Students are encouraged to adhere to the following schedule for required mathematics course. Year Fall Spring Fresh. A 112 or 118 113 or 119 Soph. 214 220 & 367(Z) Junior 301 & 368(Z) 464 Senior 465 & 467 403 and 469 (optional) Notes: (1) A 469 is an optional one-credit course that drills students on problems from the Course 1 actuarial exam. (2) Actuarial students are encouraged (but not required) to take the honors versions, A Mat 118 and 119 of A Mat 112 and 113. Students are advised to take A Eco 110 and 111 as freshmen, and in any even t, no later than their sophomore year. By doing so, students will not need to take more than one upper division economics course during any single semester. Most actuarial students will take A Mat 367Z or 368Z (instead of A Mat 367 or 368) in order to meet the University's upper division writing requirement. Degree Requirements for the Major in Actuarial and Mathematical Sciences General Program B.S. A combined major and minor sequence consisting of 63 credits as follows: 36 credits in mathematics: A Mat 112 (or 118), 113 (or 119), 214, 220, 301 (or A Eco 351), 367 (or 367Z), 368 (or 368Z), 403, 464, 465, and 467. 6 credits: chosen from I Csi 201, 203, 204, 205, and 310. 6 credits: B Acc 211, B Fin 300. 15 credits in economics: A Eco 110, 111, 300, 301, and 466. Note: Actuarial majors automatically fulfill the requirement for a minor in economics (since A Mat 301 is equivalent to A Eco 351). The requirements for graduation with honors for actuarial majors are included under the heading Honors Program. Combined B.A./M.A. and B.S./M.A. Programs The combined B.A./M.A. and B.S./M.A. programs in mathematics provide an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergraduate and master's degree programs from the beginning of their junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.A or B.S. and the M.A. degrees within nine semesters. The combined programs require a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.A. or B.S., students must meet all University and college requirements, including th e requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minimum 90- or 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general education requirements, and reside nce requirements. In qualifying for the M.A., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residence requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.A. and M.A. programs or to both the B.S. and M.A. programs. Students may apply to the graduate committee of the department for admission to either combined program in mathematics at the beginning of their junior year or after the successful completion of 56 credits, but no later than the accumulation of 100 credits. A cumulative grade point average of 3.2 or higher and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required for consideration. Combined Mathematics and Master of Business Administration Program: In this program a student is able to obtain a B.S. degree in mathematics and a M.B.A. degree in a total of five years by taking a coordinated program in mathematics and business administration during the senior year. Application should be made during the second semester of the junior year to the director of the M.B.A. program, School of Business.

Both as a major and a minor, the program offers a wide range of courses and a guide for anyone with a special interest in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It is especially recommended as a second major for anyone considering going on to graduate study in some aspect of medieval and Renaissance studies. Degree Requirements for the Faculty-Initiated Interdisciplinary Major with a Concentration in Medieval and Renaissance Studies General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits: 9 credits of the core history courses, 6 credits in literature and philosophy, 6 credits in art and music, and 15 elective credits chosen from courses approved for the program. If a student applies the credits from one or more of the approved courses of the program to the requirements of a minor (e.g., the 6 credits in literature,) he/she is absolved from fulfilling that particular requirement in the program and may substitute an equal number of credits from any of the elective courses to reach the required minimum of 36 credits. Majors are encouraged to have an elementary reading ability in Latin. In addition, it is strongly recommended that majors acquire at least an elementary reading ability in one modern Western language other than English.

A./M.A. program is available to qualified students. Through lectures, seminars, tutorials, guided research, undergraduate and graduate colloquia, a student philosophy club, interdisciplinary and special studies programs, and visiting philosophers, a challenging and balanced context for philosophical development is provided for major and nonmajor alike. Careers In pursuing philosophy, students develop their ability to solve problems, communicate effectively and organize ideas. Philosophy majors are successfully employed in many different areas of the private sector and government service\u2014as managers, administrators, journalists, etc.\u2014wherever a liberal education combining analytical skills with breadth of perspec tive is valued. Holders of the bachelor's degree in philosophy obtain jobs held by liberal arts graduates in newspapers, government, management, law, and computer-connected businesses. Degree Requirements for the Major in Philosophy Students are required to complete a minimum of 36 credits in philosophy, no more than 6 of which may be at the 100 level.

Honors Program The purpose of the honors program is to provide well-qualified students with close contact with faculty and fuller training in philosophical research and writing than are normally possible. Students may be admitted in the second semester of their sophomore year or during their junior year. To be admitted, students must have completed 12 credits of course work from the Department of Philosophy. In addition, students must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 overall and 3.50 in philosophy. Students must submit evidence of their written work, preferably a paper written for a philosophy course. A departmental honors committee administers the program, admitting students and evaluating their work. Students are required to complete a minimum of 42 credits. They must fulfill all regular requirements for the major, and in addition, take at least two 500-level courses in philosophy (8 credits), and A Phi 498, Honors Thesis (4 credits).

Students are graduated \"with honors in philosophy\" upon satisfactory completion of the curricular requirements with a grade point average of 3.50 in philosophy and a minimum 3.25 overall. Combined B.A./M.A. Program The combined B.A./M.A. program in philosophy provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergra duate and master's degree programs from the beginning of the junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees within nine semesters. The combined program requires a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.A., students must meet all University and college requirements, including the requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minor requirement, the minimum 90-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general education requirement s, and residency requirements. In qualifying for the M.A., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits, and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, or other professional experience and residency requirements.

Lee, Ph.D. Harvard University University Adjuncts (estimated): 12 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 25 The objective of the department is to provide students a solid foundation in both classical and modern physics. Students are prepared either to undertake graduate study in physics, to apply physics principles and techniques successfully for advanced work in other disciplines, to enter industry usefully, or to teach in the secondary schools. Along with courses in classical mechanics, electromagnetic theory, atomic and nuclear physics, and thermal physics, students learn modern experimental techniques, principles of quantum mechanics, and applications. Elective courses in other sciences and independent study and research with faculty members in the active research fields of the department are encouraged as part of the practical emphasis. Courses in environmental problems, astronomy and space physics, applications of nuclear physics, physics in the arts, and physical science for humanists bring physics concepts to the nonmajor. Careers Graduates holding the bachelor's degree in physics find employment as laboratory or theoretical research assistants in physics or engineering, high-level medical technicians, science writers and editors, computer programmers, and secondary school teachers. A bachelor's degree in physics can be an ideal background for advanced study in other sciences, engineering, and the business and medical professions. A graduate degree in physics opens a broad spectrum of opportunities in pure and applied research in academia and industry. Special Programs or Opportunities One-to-one student-faculty interaction is possible and is encouraged by the department. Computer use at all levels of instruction is afforded by means of terminals in the Joseph Henry Physics Building. Very modern e quipment is available in all laboratories. Opportunities for valuable experience, training, and financial support exist in the form of undergraduate assistantships in the research and teaching laboratories. The Society of Physics Students sponsors popular talks, tours to nearby laboratories, and social events. The society offers tutorial services, computer clinics, and has its own library. It conducts tours of our facilities for students and the general public. It also supplies information on opportunities after the B.S. degree. The department has a chapter of Sigma Pi Sigma, the national physics honor society. For students interested in engineering, there are available 3-2 programs with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Clarkson University, SUNY at New Paltz, a nd SUNY at Binghamton. Students in these programs spend their first three years at this campus and the last two at the other. The tuition is at the University at Albany rate for the first three years only.

Honors Program The honors program in physics is designed for outstanding students enrolled in the general program. Students may apply for admission to the honors program by submitting a letter of request to the department chair no later than April 15 of the sophomore year (for admission in the fall) or November 15 of the junior year (for admission in the spring). Junior transfers may apply at the time of their admission to the University. Primary emphasis will be placed on indications of academic ability and maturity sufficient for applicants to pursue with distinction a program involving independent research. The minimum requirements for admission follow: 1. Completion of A Phy 140 or 141, 150 or 151, 240 or 241, 250 or their equivalents; 2. An overall grade point average of 3.30; 3. A grade point average of 3.60 in physics courses required for the major; 4. Written recommendations from at least three faculty members, one of whom, preferably, should be from outside the Department of Physics. Students in the program must maintain both a minimum grade point average of 3.30 overall and of 3.60 in physics courses taken to satisfy major requirements during the junior and senior years. The progress of participants in the honors program will be reviewed at the end of the junior year by the Departmental Honors Committee. Students not meeting the st andards above at that time may be precluded from continuing in the program during their senior year. Students in the honors program are required to complete a minimum of 72 credits as follows: the 66 credits specified for the general program in physics; 3 credits of Honors Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 179Seminar in Physics (A Phy 498); and 3 credits of Research and/or Independent Study in Physics (A Phy 497). The independent study must include an honors research project culminating in a written report by the end of the student's last semester. After completion of the requirements above, the records of candidates will be reviewed by the Departmental Honors Committee. After consideration of overall academic record, performance and accomplishments in the independent study project(s), the quality of the Honors Seminar, and the evaluations of departmental faculty members who have supervised these activities, a recommendation for or against a degree with honors will be made by the committee to the departmental faculty. The final recommendation will be made by the departmental faculty and transmitted by the chair. Combined B.S./M.S. Program The combined B.S./M.S. program in physics provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergraduate and master's degree programs at the beginning of the junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.S. and M.S. degrees within nine semesters. The combined program requires a minimum of 138 credits, of which at least 30 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.S., students must meet all University and college requirements including the requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minimum 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general e ducation requirements, and residency requireme nts. In qualifying for the M.S., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 30 graduate credits and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, professional experience, and residenc y requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.S. and M.S. programs. A Phy 519 may be substituted for A Phy 335 or 335Z in meeting the B.S. requirements, enabling Phy 519 to be one of the graduate courses applied simultaneously to the undergraduate and graduate programs. Students may apply to the Graduate Committee for admission to the combined degree program in physics at the beginning of their junior year or after the successful completion of 56 credits, but no later than the accumulation of 100 credits. A cumulative grade point average of 3.20 or higher and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required for consideration.

The program is designed to prepare students for graduate study in psychology as well as a diversity of other fields requiring knowledge of ps ychological principles. The department expects its students to become well-versed in the theories, research, and applications of the discipline. The department offers a full program leading to the B.A.; a graduate program leading to the Ph.D. with several major areas of concentration and a clinical training program; and in cooperation with the Department of Educational Psychology and Statistics in the School of Education, the Certificate of Advanced Study and Psy.D. in school psychology. Careers With the B.A. degree, professional entry-level positions are possible in public and private human services systems (health, e ducation, social welfare, parole, probation, geront ology, youth, substance abuse); also, personnel administration, and general administrative work. Entry-level jobs could involve delivery of service, resear ch and/or program planning and development. Less traditional occupations include medicine, dentistry, law, optometry, urban planning, genetic counseling, and human factors research. Special Programs or Opportunities The department offers opportunities for independent study and research beginning in the sophomore year. Students involved in research activities have supervised access to the department's animal behavior laboratory, human research laboratories, and off-campus professional agencies. Admission Declaration of the major in psychology must be made by application to the department. Information on procedures for application is available from the Department Advisement Center (SS 370). Application may be made during any semester at any time prior to final exam week, or prior to August during summer sessions, but must be made before the student has earned 60 credits at the University at Albany. The criteria outlined below will apply to all course work completed prior to and including the semester during which application is made. The department will notify students of action on the application before the subsequent semester. A Psy 101, 210, and 211 may not be taken elsewhere after matriculation at Albany. I. Criteria for Students Admitted as Freshmen to Albany as of Fall 1991 and thereafter: 1. The student must have completed at least 24 hours of college credit (sophomore status). 2. The student's cumulative grade point average for all course work at the University at Albany must be 2.00 or higher at the time of evaluation of the application. 3. The student must have a grade point average of 2.50 or higher for all course work completed in the University at Albany Psychology Department at the time of evaluation of the application. 4. The courses A Psy 101 or 102, A Psy 210 and A Psy 211 must have been completed with a minimum grade of C- in each. Students may be conditionally admitted to the major after completion of the requirements for A Psy 101 and A Psy 210. A Psy 211 must be completed in the next semester following conditional acceptance to be admitted to the major. II. Criteria for Transfer Students Admitted to Albany as of Fall 1992 and thereafter: For purposes of declaration of the major, the department recognizes three categories of transfer students. The criteria for admission to the major are different for these three categories. Transfer students may not apply transfer credit for A Psy 101, A Psy 210 and A Psy 211 with grades of D toward the major. 1. Transfer students who enter the University with less than 42 transfer credits or without credit for A Psy 101 must fulfill the criteria specified in section I. above. 2. Transfer students who enter the University with 42 or more transfer credits, have transfer credit for A Psy 101 and 210 with a grade of C- or higher in each, and have a 2.5 average for all psychology courses will be conditionally admitted to psychology as a major and receive advisement in the psychology department. Such students must complete A Psy 211 in their first semester here with a grade of C- or higher or their admission to the major will be withdrawn. 3. Transfer students who enter the University with 42 or more transfer credits, have transfer credit for A Psy 101, A Psy 210 and A Psy 211 with a grade of C- or higher in each, and have a 2.50 average in all psychology courses taken may immediately declare psychology as a major. Appeals Students who do not meet the above criteria may retake courses in the A Psy 101, A Psy 210 and A Psy 211 sequence in order to achieve the minimum grade of C-. The criterion of a 2.50 average in psychology courses at the time of application to the major will be affected by duplicated enrollment in the following way: if courses are retaken, calculation of the average in psychology will use both grades. Students who are denied admission to the major may appeal the decision by petitioning the department chair. Such appeals will be evaluated at the beginning of each semester, prior to the final date for adding courses. The decision on the appeal will be made by the department chair and the University at Albany 182 director of the advisement center. Degree Requirements for the Major in Psychology General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits in psychology: including A Psy 101 or 102, A Psy 210, and A Psy 211; 15 credits in psychology from the following list: A Psy 203, 214, 270, 314, 327, 338, 380, 381, 382, 384, 385, 387; 12 credits of electives with an A Psy prefix. Courses not taken from the previous list may be used as electives. NOTE: within the 36 credits required for the major a student must complete at least 12 credits in courses numbered 300 or above. For psychology majors who satisfy the major requirements as outlined in this bulletin, A Psy 210 and 211 are restricted to A-E grading after matriculation at Albany. A maximum of 3 credits in independent study courses (A Psy 297, 297Z, 397, 397Z and 497Z) may be applied to major credit but may not be used to satisfy the 300-or-above requirement. No more than 6 additional credits in these independent study courses may be used for graduation credit. Honors Program A psychology major, or double major with psychology listed first, may file an application for admission with the Honors Committee as early as the second semester of the sophomore year or as soon as the minimum requirements for admission to the program have been satisfied. The duration of the program is three semesters and commences only in the fall semester. The minimum requirements for admission include completion of A Psy 101 or 102, 210 and 211. If the student has not been able to complete A Psy 211 by the first semester of the junior year, it is possible to obtain permission to take A Psy 211 concurrently with the Honors Seminar. A grade point average of 3.30 or higher overall for all course work taken for graduation credit at the University is required, as is a 3.50 grade point average or higher for psychology courses applicable toward the major. Honors students must complete 48 hours in psychology including A Psy 101 or 102, 210, 211, 310, 399, and 499 (6 credits). In addition, students must submit a senior honors thesis acceptable to the research sponsor and the Honors Committee. The program commences with the Honors Seminar (A Psy 399) in the fall semester of the junior year. A Psy 211 must be taken at this time if it has not already been completed. The seminar introduces that student to (advanced) issues of scientific method and experimental design. As soon as the student has a general idea for the research project, he or she is encouraged to discuss the project with a potential research sponsor, especially as regards feasibility. By the end of the seminar course, the student should be conversant with a problem area, have arranged a research sponsor and be ready to submit a research proposal. The Honors student will conduct the research in two project courses (A Psy 499) during the second semester of the junior and the first semester of the senior year. The Honors Thesis written by the end of the second project course will consist of a review of the literature, the hypothesis to be tested, an experimental design (from the research proposal), data collected, any statistical analysis, and a discussion. Students in the honors program are required to maintain an overall grade point average of 3.30 or higher during the junior and senior years and an overall grade point average of 3.50 or higher for all psychology courses applicable toward the major. The work of each candidate in the honors program will be reviewed at the completion of the junior year by the Departmental Honors Committee. Students not meeting the above-stated standards at that time may be precluded from continuing in the program for the senior year. Students who remain below the stated standards throughout their senior year will not be eligible for a degree with Honors. After completion of the above requirements, the records of the candidate will be reviewed by the Departmental Honors Committee who shall recommend, to the department, candidates for the degree with honors in psychology. Combined B.A./M.S. Programs The combined B.A./M.S. programs in psychology/counseling, psychology/ rehabilitation counseling, and health policy/psychology provide an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational matur ity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergraduate and master's degree programs from the beginning of their junior year.

New York University Professional Staff Jennifer Cobb John Knapp Teaching Assistant (estimated): 2 Laura Guildford The curriculum of the Theatre Department (which includes its production program) is designed to aid students to reason and write effectively, to acquire intellectual skills necessary to confront a changing world, to acquire proficiency in a core of theatre knowledge and practice, and to understand the self-discipline necessary to pursue a life in art. Theatre is a performing art. It is also a major area of study through which one may gain a liberal arts education. The Department of Theatre assumed these two views of the theatre to be mutually supportive. Design, direction, acting, writing, technology, history, theory, criticism, and dramatic literature are considered interdependent studies. However, a degree of specialization is expected of all students. Careers A major in theatre prepares students for specialized graduate study in dramatic art or conservatory training in performance or production. Thus they acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills transferable to a variety of career paths. In addition, theatre majors are prepared to pursue any career path requiring a broad liberal education. Our graduates are currently acting and directing in television, film, and on stage in New York, and in regional theatres. Graduates in design and technical areas have found employment in the New York theatre, in regional theatres, with touring theatrical and concert productions and with equipment manufacturers and distributors. Other graduates have gone into architecture, teaching, journalism, communications, the law, and business. Casting Policy Statement The Department of Theatre, University at Albany, State University of New York, has pledged itself to the goal of achieving cultural diversity in the casting of its productions.

Combined B.A./M.A. Program The Combined B.A./M.A. Program in theatre provides an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergra duate and master's degree programs starting from the beginning of their junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees within nine semesters.

In the creation of new knowledge, Women's Studies provides a critique of social, cultural, and institutional structures that include the traditional disciplines. Women's Studies sees itself as connected to the social and political environment outside the university. Opportunities are available for internships, independent study, and innovative teaching for undergraduates. Students may take a major or minor in Women's Studies or may enroll in individual courses. Careers A concentration in Women's Studies prepares students for graduate and professional training in a variety of fields. Like other B.A. gradua tes, Women's Studies majors may enroll in professional study at the graduate level in law, social welfare, education, public administration, and health care; they also find employment and continue on-the-job training in business, social services, public affairs, publishing, and private nonprofit organizations. Experience in critical thinking and writing and intensive reflection concerning issues of diversity and multiculturalism prepare Women's Studies graduates with qualities that employers actively seek. Some Women's Studies graduates find employment with community agencies (women's centers, counseling centers, battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, women's health centers, women's vocational agencies), in affirmative action and diversity education (in schools, government agencies, and business), and with campus-based women's programs.

All programs are accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business. All School of Business courses are preceded by the prefix letter B. The following School of Business courses are considered \"Liberal Arts and Sciences\" courses by the University: B Bus 250, B Law 200, B Law 220, B Mgt 341, B Mgt 343, B Mgt 465, B B Mkt 351, B Itm 215, B Itm 220.

The school is unable to accommodate all undergraduate students who wish to enroll as upper-division majors. University at Albany 208 a. b. Application and Admission The following guidelines have been developed as a means of selecting the best-qualified students to study accounting or business administration. Initial Admission of Freshmen to the School of Business: All students admitted to the University for summer 1995 or thereafter whose basis of admission is \"FRESHMAN\" can be admitted to the School of Business by declaring their major as \"School of Business.\" To do so, they must sign a School of Business major declaration form and submit this to their Advisement Services Center/Undergraduate Studies (ASC/US) or Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) academic adviser. Most students who declare a major in the School of Business do so during their initial meeting with their academic adviser at orientation. However, students who fill out the form by December 15 th of a fall semester or May 1st of a spring semester will also be considered during the next review for admission to junior standing in the School of Business. To remain a School of Business major during the freshman and sophomore years, each student must meet the retention standards set by the School of Business. These standards require students to maintain a B (3.00) overall average at the University at Albany and at least a B- (2.70) average for the designated admission core course categories taken at Albany. To remain a School of Business major, students must also have satisfactorily completed any five of the seven admission core course categories after three semesters at the University, and all seven (7) of the admission core course categories after four (4) semesters at the University. (Note: all core course categories not completed prior to matriculation must be taken at the University and graded on an A-E basis.) These categories are: (1) B Acc 211, (2) B Itm 215 or I Csi 101 or I Csi 201, (3) A Mat 108 or B Itm 220 or A Eco 320; (4) A Eco 110, (5) A Eco 111, (6) A Psy 101, and (7) A Soc 115Z or 115 or A Ant 108Z or 108. In addition, students must have completed a total of at least 56 degree applicable credits after four semesters at the University to remain a School of Business major. Students' records will be evaluated after their second semester, and those falling below the retention standards will receive a warning letter indicating they are in jeopardy of losing their status as a School of Business major. Students' records will again be evaluated after their third and fourth semester to determine that all of the above retention standards have been met. Students in the School of Business who have attained junior standing (i.e., 56 degree applicable credits) and who have met all the retention standards shall be eligible to enroll in the upper division School of Business courses. Initial Admission of Transfers with Sophomore Standing or Above to the School of Business: All students admitted to the University for summer 1995 or thereafter whose basis of admission is \"TRANSFER\" can be admitted to the School of Business by declaring their major as either Accounting or Business Administration at the time of their application to the Univer sity as long as they will have met the following criteria: Students must have completed a total of at least 24 degree applicable credits by the end of the spring semester preceding their summer or fall admission to the University, or by the end of the fall semester preceding their spring admission to the University. They must also have a final cumulative average of B (3.00) or higher and have maintained at least a B- (2.70) average in any designated core course categories completed elsewhere prior to matriculation. To remain a School of Business major, each student must meet the retention standards set by the School of Business. These standards require students to maintain a B (3.00) overall average at the University at Albany and at least a B- (2.70) average for the designated admission core course categories taken at Albany. To remain a School of Business major, students must also have satisfactorily completed all seven of the admission core course categories after two semesters at the University. These categories are: (1) B Acc 211, (2) B Itm 215 or I Csi 101 or I Csi 201, (3) A Mat 108 or B Itm 220 or A Eco 320; (4) A Eco 110, (5) A Eco 111, (6) A Psy 101, and (7) A Soc 115Z or 115 or A Ant 108Z or 108. (Note: all core course categories not completed prior to matriculation must be taken at the University and graded on an A-E basis.) They must also have achieved 56 degree applicable degree credits after two semesters at the University. Students in the School of Business who have attained junior standing (i.e., 56 degree applicable credit) and who have met all the retention standards shall be eligible to enroll in the upper division School of Business courses. Subsequent Admission to the School of Business: Students who did not declare their major as \"School of Business\" by the deadlines stated above but whose basis of admission is \"FRESHMAN\" or who were admitted to the University as a \"TRANSFER\" with fewer than 24 degree-applicable credits (freshman standing) may directly apply (or reapply) for admission to the School of Business once they have attained junior standing (i.e., 56 degree applicable credits) and have satisfactorily completed all seven of the admission core course categories. These categories are: (1) B Acc 211, (2) B Itm 215 or I Csi 101 or I Csi 201, (3) A Mat 108 or B Itm 220 or A Eco 320; (4) A Eco 110, (5) A Eco 111, (6) A Psy 101, and (7) A Soc 115Z or 115 or A Ant 108Z or 108. Applicants must have maintained a B (3.0) overall average at the University at Albany and at least a B- (2.7) average for the designated admission core course categories taken at Albany. (Note: all core course categories not completed prior to matriculation must be taken at the University and graded on an A-E basis.) Other \"TRANSFER\" students who were admitted with 24 or more degree-applicable credits but who were not initially admitted to the School of Business may still be considered for admission within the following guidelines: Students who can demonstrate that their previous transfer record would have qualified them for admission had they applied initially to the School of Business will be admitted under the conditions and criteria described above for other sophomore or junior transfers. Students who do not initially qualify for admission as a transfer student to the School of Business may contact the school for individual consideration. Some students may be granted conditional status, with admission to the school contingent upon satisfactory completion of a specific academic contract. Appeals: Special Admissions: Students not admissible by any of the established criteria but who believe they have extenuating circumstances may write a letter of appeal to the School of Business. Contact the Assistant Dean in the Office of Student Services, BA-361A for the procedure.

University of Pittsburgh Piyusha Singh, Ph.D. Carnegie Mellon University Adjuncts (estimated): 7 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 9 Even as crime declines from the high levels of the 1970's and 1980's, it remains an urgent social problem and policy issue. As welcome as the decrease in crime has been, it has prompted debate about the forces that produced it\u2014such as demographic and economic changes, or more effective policing and tougher sentencing\u2014and it has raised corollary questions about whether and how the trend can be sustained. Well-founded judgments and prudent policy choices about crime and justice require an understanding of crime, criminal behavior, criminal justice processes, and the law. The study of criminal justice at the University at Albany is concerned with these phenomena. The faculty are drawn from several academic disciplines, including criminal justice, public policy, sociology, psychology, political science, and law, and its members are nationally and internationally recognized for their research on delinquency, violence, sentencing, policing, capital punishment, and other topics. The School of Cr iminal Justice offers graduate programs that lead to the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy, and which are widely regarded as among the best in the nation. The baccalaureate program is a multi-disciplinary, liberal arts curriculum intended to develop students' capacities to think critically, communicate effectively, and engage in reasoned problem-solving. The major includes not only courses in criminal justice but also a concentration in a disciplinary field related to criminal justice, and majors are urged to take additional courses in history, English, and mathematics. Criminal justice majors acquire knowledge of: the nature, incidence, explanations, and individual and social consequences of crime and criminal behavior; the criminal justice process, including the social, psychological, organizational, and political influences on the discretionary decisions of criminal justice actors, and the effectiveness, equity, and responsiveness of criminal justice policy; the law and its application to criminal justice; and social science methodology. The School's graduates go on to graduate or professional education, or directly into positions w ith criminal justice or related agencies. Admission Requirements Criminal justice is a restricted major with limited enrollment. Applications for admission to the criminal justice major are reviewed by the School's Undergraduate Admissions and Awards Committee. Applicants must have completed at least 42 graduation credits prior to application and 56 credits at the time of admission, and they must have earned a B or higher in R Crj 203 (or A Soc 203), R Crj 201 or R Crj 202. Transfer applicants must have completed the equivalent of R Crj 201, or 202 or 203 with a grade of B or better.

Statement by student of reason for seeking to undertake a criminal justice major. It should be noted that because this program is not intended for persons interested in police science, criminalistics, etc., transfer students who have taken courses in such areas may expect such credits not to be transferable into the major.

Youth Construction Initiative Program Dr. Carson Carr, Jr., Statewide Director Marsha Mortimore, Assistant Statewide Director Introduction Commencing here at the University at Albany back in 1968, this 36 year old program seeks to provide admission opportunities for economically and educationally disadvantaged students who wish to enroll in one of many undergraduate departments at this University. Having the second largest EOP in the SUNY system with 700+ students being served, one objective of the EOP is to see that each student admitted is provided with all the services and assistance necessary for success in whatever degree program he or she seeks to complete. To this end, students enrolled in the Educational Opportunities Program are provided with supportive services designed to help students who need assistance in academic, financial, social, or personal matters. Specifically, the following services are provided to EOP students by a staff of professional counselors and departmental faculty members: z Developmental coursework in reading/writing, math and study skills z One to one personal/academic counseling z Free one to one tutorial assistance z Five week EOP mandatory Pre-College Summer Residential Program University at Albany 224 z Monthly EOP newsletter z Financial aid packaging z EOP Computer User Room and an EOP Writing Center z Peer tutorial and peer advisement services z Career and personal growth workshops z Study skills materials z Graduate school a dvisement and EOP graduate school tuition waiver. Project Excel: Providing academic supportive assistance designed to increase the retention and graduate rates of two hundred low-income, first generation, and disabled students is the primary intent of the Project Excel Program. Funded by a four-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education, Project Excel is a Student Support Services Program (A TRIO Program). Project Excel will strive to achieve its goal of a graduation rate of 80% of its participants by offering the following services: supplementary academic advisement, personal counseling, career planning, financial aid planning and information; peer mentoring; study skills workshops; instruction in pre-college biology; tutoring; professional and graduate school speakers; graduate school seminars; and field trips to local industries. Ronald McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement/AGEP/LSAMP/C-STEP Program: The premise of this pr ogram is to provide students from historically underrepresented groups (African-American, Latino, and Native American) and low-income backgrounds and who are first generation college students, with an opportunity to pursue M.D. and/or Ph. D. degree in science and technology. The program seeks to recruit second year undergraduate students who are majors in science and/or technology including (but not limited to) mathematics, chemistry, biology, pre-med, public health, physics, economics, or computer science with a cumulative GPA of at least a 2.8 or higher. These participants are provided with faculty research opportunities during the summer. In addition, there is other programming to assist students with their eventual goal of securing the undergraduate degree, as well as the Ph.D. Academic Talent Search Program: The Academic Talent Search Program, a federally funded TRIO project, provides lower income middle and hi gh school students and adults with programming to encourage them to attend school. Residents in the Capital District (Albany, Schenectady, and Troy) are eligible to participate. Programming includes tutoring in the schools, field trips to colleges, senior seminar series to prepare students for college, personal, academic and career advisement, SAT/PSAT review sessions, mentoring programs, cultural trip programming, and GED advisement. Youth Construction Initiative Program: The Youth Construction Initiative Program, funded by the New York State Department of Transportation, is a comprehensive partnership between the NYS Department of Transportation and the University at Albany. Its major goal is to prepare motivated high school students (11 th and 12th graders) for careers in highway construction. There are eight high school sites throughout the state and each has a site coordinator preparing these students. These pre-apprenticeship students are exposed to career counseling, computer and other technological training, summer job internships, field trips to the colleges of technology, safety training, study skills workshops, etc. Pre-College Summer Component Each summer, incoming EOP Frosh students participate in a 4-week residential experience on the college campus. The program begins in July and ends in early August. The full cost of tuition, fees, room and board, and books is paid for through an EOP Grant. Small classroom instruction is offered to remediate, enrich, and provide a better start for university courses that will be taken in the fall semester. Students are also exposed to numerous academic and nonacademic survival skills, extensive individual and group counseling sessions, and personal and educ ational advisement. Other priorities during the summer include extensive study skill enrichment and career awareness sessions. The summer instructional staff includes university lecturers who exclusively teach our EOP students during the academic year. The academic subjects involve pre-college work in writing, reading, and mathematics. EOP counselors who coordinate the extensive counseling sessions are experienced and trained. They develop a unique personal relationship with students, and this relationship continues during the matriculation years. In addition to the instructors and counselors, student assistants are also totally involved in the pre-college summer experience. These peer tutors and lay counselors not only live in the residential halls with the students, but also assist in the instructional process. EOP Supportive Service Unit It is the obligation of an educational institution to contribute to the development of the \"total\" individual. As such, the EOP staff insures that all channels of supportive service are available to the members of the EOP population. The EOP Office is the hub from which all EOP services radiate. Inherent in the agreement to accept students into the EOP Program is the understanding that the EOP staff commits its energies to the positive academic and social adjustment of the individual students who select the program. Academic Services The EOP Complex serves as the administrative unit through which academic assistance is provided to all EOP students. EOP seeks to promote scholarship and to insure the graduation of those students. The EOP Program incorporates basic social and educational techniques to meet the different needs. Developmental Course Programming Incoming freshmen admitted to EOP are evaluated, their wea knesses and strengths defined, and their special needs established. As mentioned above, the developmental course curriculum offers developmental courses in mathematics and writing. If needed, students are required to take a maximum of two levels of developmental courses during their pre-college summer program and during their first two semesters. During the academic year, along with the developmental courses, students also choose university courses. Although students receive transcript credit (not graduation credit) for enrollment in the developmental courses, the individual growth acquired can insure success in regular university courses. The curriculum in writing is designed to develop and increase student awareness of the value of writing, and to encourage participation in the experience through writing in various modes and across the curriculum. The course work consists of a two semester sequence in which students increase their confidence and fluency in writing, learn to cope with writing in the academic world, and learn the essentials of how to structure and write a college-level essay. Counseling Services EOP seeks to offer its students a multidimensional approach to individual development. Fundamental to each student's successful adjustment is the availability of comprehensive, competent counseling. Because the University at Albany presents a very demanding, competitive, and in most cases unfamiliar environment, the EOP staff counselors make every endeavor to reduce anxiety and to help students in adapting to Undergraduate Bulletin 2005-2006 225university life. Counseli ng staff members advise and counsel students in academic, social, emotional, and vocational areas in order to help resolve student problems. Consultation links are sustained between the EOP counseling unit, the Advisement Services Cent er, the Campus Health Center, and other university service offices. Peer Tutorial Program The tutorial program aims to provide a well structured peer tutorial support system to assist student academic progress in University at Albany course work. This tutorial program plays a vital part in contributing to the academic success of the University's EOP population. Recommended by university faculty members, upper-class and graduate students are selected to tutor undergraduates in the University's many departments. To insure more effectiveness, tutoring is usually done on a one-to-one basis. Although tutoring is optional, it is strongly urged that students take advantage of this service before any academic difficulty is incurred. Tu tors will usually work as many hours as needed. Other Student Services Computer Lab EOP students have access to the Office's own computer lab usage room. Staffed at all times with a computer specialist, EOP students can receive technical assistance for word processing purposes. Personal/Career Growth Workshops A number of personal growth workshops are held yearly to aid EOP students with career choices and personal enrichment. Facilitated by the EOP counselors and University personnel, these career workshops improve a student's understanding of the academic departments and of prospective career goals. Also, personal workshops focus on coping skills, study skills, time management, financial aid, and graduate school entrance. Liaison Relationships To assist the EOP staffers with a better understanding of individual academic departments, the EOP Office has a list of key faculty members who act as liaisons with EOP and that particular department. In addition, the faculty members periodically update the EOP staffers on departmental changes. University-Wide Services The EOP student is also encouraged to take full advantage of all academic and student services campus-wide. University Developmental Courses This instructional co mponent consists of university developmental courses and is open to any matriculated student seeking help in writing skills and mathematics skills. These courses do not carry graduation credit because they foster the development of skills required for regular university courses.

Bloniarz, Ph.D. (Collins Fellow) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Associate Dean for Informatics David F. Andersen, Ph.D. (Distinguished Service Professor) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Assistant Deans Rachel R. Baum Frances Reynolds The mission of the College of Computing and Information is to support world-class, discipline-based research, and educational programs related to computing and information. The college was formed in the spring of 2005 by the faculties of the Department of Computer Science (formerly in the College of Arts and Sciences), the Department of Information Studies (formerly the School of Information Science and Policy), and a new unit, the Informatics Faculty, which hosts an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in information science. The two departments currently offer undergraduate major and minor programs, as well as a variety of introductory and advanced courses including Information Literacy General Education courses. All three units support graduate education as well, offering undergraduates an opportunity to study in a research-oriented environment. In addition to the disciplinary perspectives found in its two departments, the College also provides the academic focus for the IT Commons, a University-wide program sponsored by the Division of Academic Affairs to support programs in information-related interdisciplinary studies throughout the campus. Through the IT Commons, a number of faculty in departments across the campus have joint appointments to the College's Informatics Faculty and contribute to educational programs both in their home department as well as in the College. For more information about these faculty and other campus courses relevant to computing and information, please see the IT Commons web page at http://www.albany.edu/ite.

Maniatty, Ph.D. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Adjuncts (estimated):3 Teaching Assistants (estimated): 21 Courses offered by the Department of Computer Science provide an introduction to the theory and practice of computing. Familiarity with computer languages and data structures is developed in appropriate courses by the completion of programming assignments related to course material. Students may elect a short sequence of courses in a particular aspect of computer science, complete a minor for broader competence, or obtain a foundation in both theory and practice by completing either a major in computer science or in computer science and applied mathematics. Among the majors that combine well with either elective course work or a minor in computer science are mathematics, any science major, economics, geography, linguistics, rhetoric and communication, psychology, and sociology. A major in business administration (such as the management science concentrations) would also be appropriate, but students should be aware that they will also have to satisfy the School of Business ad mission requirements. A familiarity with computers and their applications may also be obtained through noncredit \"Short Courses\" offered by Information Technology Services and through computation courses offered by College of Arts and Sciences, departments, and other Schools at the University. Students with a strong interest in the languages and progr amming techniques commonly used in business may wish to elect the sequence I Csi 101, 203, 205, and 410. The computer science majors combine advanced topics in computing practice with introductory material on the mathematical foundations of computer science including abstract models of computers and languages and the fundamental limits of computing. Students with a primary interest in the applications of computing may combine the major in computer science with a major or minor in other disciplines. Such combinations may be attractive to prospective employers because of today's wide range of computing applications. The B.A. in computer science requires that the student elect at least one minor from the list of approved minors described in a previous section of this bulletin. Students considering a minor in either mathematics or physics are advised instead to consider one of the B.S. programs described below. The two B.S. programs both combine a major with a minor and are recommended for those students who intend to pursue graduate programs in computer science or who wish to qualify for positions involving research or advanced development in computer systems design. The interdisciplinary B.S. major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics combines a strong sequence in computer science with those courses in mathematics particularly relevant to advanced work in computer science. The B.S. in computer science encompasses a two-course sequence in physics and a second two-course sequence in either more advanced physics or in a second science elected by the student. Degree Requirements for the Majors in Computer Science General Program B.A.: A minimum of 41 credits including I Csi 201, 310, 210, 333, 311, 402, 404; two additional I Csi courses numbered in the range 400-450 or 500-550; A Mat 111 or 112 or 118, 113 or 119, and 367; plus completion of an approved minor whose courses may not overlap with any of the courses used to complete the major. General Program B.S. (combined major and minor sequence): A minimum of 74 credits as follows: I Csi 201 310, 210, 333, 311, 300Z, 401, 402, 403, 404, 409, plus two courses from A Phy 353, A Phy 454, or any I Csi course numbered 300-450 or 500-550 for a total of 42 credits; A Mat 111 or 112 or 118, 113 or 119, 220, 367, plus three credits from any A Mat course at the 300 level or above; A Phy 140 or 141, 145, 150 or 151, 155; and one of the following pairs of courses: A Phy 240 (or 241) and 250, or A Phy 240 (or 241) and 315, or a two-course sequence in a second science as approved by the department. Program in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics The interdisciplinary combined major and minor program in computer science and applied mathematics is an integrated program providing a strong background in the theory and practice of computer science combined with those courses in mathematics which are most likely to be needed for advanced work in computer science, either in graduate study or industrial research and development. The program provides excellent preparation for the advanced Graduate Record Examination in computer science and will provide an attractive background for admission to high quality graduate programs in computer science. The mathematics portion of the program, with the appropriate selection of one or two electives, can provide a good mathematical background for work in operations research wh ich is an important area of computer application in business, or for numerical computation in a variety of areas related to the scientific and engineering use of computers.

To complete the honors program, the student must complete 12 credits of course work (to be determined by the department in consultation with each student) designed to ensure a rigorous mastery of the discipline, together with an Honors seminar (I Csi 487/487Z), and an Honors project of at least 6 credits, (I Csi 488Z). Consult the department for further information. Combined B.S./M.A. and B.S./M.S. Programs Two combined bachelor's/master's degree programs are available with the undergraduate major in computer science and applied mathematics. The combined B.S./M.A. program combines the undergraduate program in computer science and applied mathematics with the graduate program in mathematics. The combined B.S./M.S. program combines the undergraduate program in computer science and applied mathematics with the graduate program in computer science. Both programs provide an opportunity for students of recognized academic ability and educational maturity to fulfill integrated requirements of undergraduate and master's degree programs from the beginning of the junior year. A carefully designed program can permit a student to earn the B.S. and M.S. or the B.S. and M.A. degrees within nine or ten semesters. The combined programs require a minimum of 140 credits, of which at least 32 must be graduate credits. In qualifying for the B.S., students must meet all University and college requirements, including the requirements of the undergraduate major described previously, the minimum 60-credit liberal arts and sciences requirement, general education requirement s, and residency requirements. In qualifying for the M.S. or M.A., students must meet all University and college requirements as outlined in the Graduate Bulletin, including completion of a minimum of 32 graduate credits, and any other conditions such as a research seminar, thesis, comprehensive examination, or other professional experience and residency requirements. Up to 12 graduate credits may be applied simultaneously to both the B.S. and M.S. or the B.S. and M.A. programs. Students may apply for admission to either combined degree program at the beginning of their junior year or after the successful completion of 56 credits. A cumulative grade point average of 3.20 or higher and three supportive letters of recommendation from faculty are required for consideration, but admission of a student who meets the minimum requirements is not automatic.

The study of political science is designed to prepare the student for responsible and effective citizenship, political participation, and advanced academic or professional studies. The student of political science may gain an understanding and appreciation of political values, institutions and processes operating in American, foreign, and international systems. Careers While a major in the Department of Political Science may be used as preparation for graduate programs in law, public administration, public affairs or other professional study, the major can also lead to entry-level employment in government or industry training programs and the programs provide a basis for effective citizen participation in public affairs, whether or not a student pursues further professional training. The most common careers are in law, government service, teaching, business, and journalism. Special Programs or Opportunities Recognizing the fact that a lawyer must be politically knowledgeable, many prelaw students major in political science. Individuals engaged in the practice of law automatically are involved in \"political\" activities because of their dealings with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. The location of the Graduate School of Public Affairs in the capital city of the Empire State affords students of political science unusual opportunities to observe and study the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the state government, the second largest public employer in the United States. With a few exceptions, the principal office of each state department, division, and office is located in Albany. Internship opportunities are available for juniors and seniors to work in legislative and other governmental offices in Albany, and a new internship and educational program has been established for political science honors University at Albany 234 students in Washington, DC. See R Pos 338, 341, 342, and 495Z. Library resources to support research in New York State government are excellent. Students have access to the New York State Library, with one of the largest co llections in the world. State departments, divi sions and offices also have specialized libraries containing information not commonly housed in university or public libraries. Degree Requirements for the Major in Political Science General Program B.A.: A minimum of 36 credits in political science including R Pos 101 or 101Z and 102 or 102Z and 103 or 103Z; at least 18 credits from courses at or above the 300 level (including the concentration-see below); and at least 3 credits from courses at the 400 level that require a major research or writing project. Majors in Political Science must pick an upper-division area of concentration in American Politics, Global Politics, Public Law, or Political Theory and take at least four courses in this area of concentration at the 300 or 400 level. It is recommended, but not required, that students take the 400- level writing intensive course that is part of the major in their area of concentration. The list of courses for each area of concentration follows: American Politics R Pos 320 R Pos 321 (R Pub 321) R Pos 323 R Pos 324 (A Lcs 375) R Pos 325 (R Pub 325) R Pos 329 (R Pad 329) R Pos 331 R Pos 332 R Pos 334 R Pos 337 R Pos 339 R Pos 341 R Pos 365 R Pos 402Z (R Pub 402Z) R Pos 406Z (R Pub 406Z) R Pos 411Z (R Pub 411Z) R Pos 424 R Pos 430 R Pos 433 (A Wss 433) R Pos 433Z (A Wss 433Z) R Pos 435Z R Pos 438Z R Pos 439 R Pos 439Z R Pos 495Z Global Politics R Pos 349 R Pos 350 (R Pub 350) R Pos 351 R Pos 353 R Pos 354 R Pos 355 R Pos 356 R Pos 357 (A Lcs 357) R Pos 358 R Pos 359 (A Jst 359) R Pos 362 R Pos 364 R Pos 370 R Pos 371 R Pos 373 R Pos 374 R Pos 375 R Pos 376 R Pos 380 R Pos 383 R Pos 384 R Pos 395 (R Pub 395) R Pos 396 (R Pub 396) R Pos 398 (R Pub 398) R Pos 444 R Pos 444Z R Pos 450Z R Pos 452Z R Pos 469 R Pos 469Z R Pos 472Z R Pos 473Z R Pos 479 R Pos 479Z Political Theory R Pos 301 R Pos 302 R Pos 306 R Pos 307 R Pos 308 R Pos 310 R Pos 313 R Pos 314 R Pos 419Z Public Law R Pos 328 (R Pub 328) R Pos 330 R Pos 333 (A Wss 333) R Pos 335 R Pos 336 R Pos 346 R Pos 363 R Pos 410Z (R Pub 410Z) R Pos 426Z R Pos 427Z R Pos 428 R Pos 429Z R Pos 437Z R Pos 449 R Pos 449Z Internships cannot be used to satisfy the 400- level course requirement , but honors seminars or independent studies can be counted if they are appropriate and with permission. Independent study courses are used to deal with topics not covered by regular departmental offerings and after cla ssroom courses dealing with the same subject have been completed. Prior to registering for inde pendent study, students must have their proposed research project approved by a faculty member willing to direct the research. The student's prospectus must outline the topic of the proposed research, indicate its importance to political science, and describe the methodology to be employed and methodological problems that may be encountered. Students may not register for independent study unless a copy of the prospectus, properly signed, has been filed with the department; independe nt study courses may not be used in lieu of classroom courses. Public Administration c ourses other than R Pad 110, 111, 210 and 111, Public Policy courses and Criminal Justice 353 and 414 are acceptable as political science courses in meeting the 36-credit requirement in political science, but R Pad and R Crj 400- level courses cannot be used to satisfy the requirement of a 400-level course which requires a major research or writing project. The Political internship (R Pos 338) is open only to juniors and seniors with a minimum overall average of 2.5 or higher. A maximum of 3 credits from R Pos 338, the former R Pos 431; and U Uni 390, 391 and 392 will be applied toward a major in Political Science. Approval of the undergraduate coordinator is required prior to enrollment. The Department recommends that students take the 200-level survey and topical courses. The Department offers a two-course sequence (R Pos 416Z and 417Z) in empirical methodology for social scientists. R Pos 416Z and R Pos 417Z are both required for all Public Affairs majors. They will satisfy some of the requirements for a minor in computing in the social sciences. Honors Program This program is designed to provide serious students of politics with the opportunity for a special educational experience in small seminars where they can develop their writing, discussion and analytical skills. Majors may apply for admission to the Director of the Honors Program at the end of the sophomore year, or for junior transfers, upon admission to the University. The requirements for admission include: Overall cumulative grade point average of 3.5, and a 3.7 in political science courses.

In addition to attending classes and doing the same assignments as the other students in the course, they will earn the additional fourth credit through a tutorial with the faculty member teaching the course that will include extra reading and writing assignments. Students in the honors program will have the option of capping their studies with either a 4-credit honors thesis (R Pos 499Z) written under the supervision of a faculty member or a 4-credit version of an existing 400-level course in which the honors student will undertake a major writing project (R Pos 400-level + 1 credit R Pos 400) or R Pos 495Z. Honors students will need to have an upper-division area of concentration in American Politics, Global Politics, Public Law, or Political Theory. The two 300-level honors courses and the 400-level honors course or honors thesis can be us ed to fulfill this requirement. Maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 3.25 overall and 3.50 in political science to continue in the program in the senior year and to graduate with honors.

Nunez, Ph.D. Syracuse University Lewis Welch, Ph.D. Syracuse University Public administration and public policy are concerned with the formulation and implementation of governmental policies and programs. The approach of the department is interdisciplinary, drawing on various social and behavioral sciences. The courses focus on such topics as the role of bureaucracy in society, management of finances in the public sector, organizational theory and development, the political and legal environment of administration, and public policy research and analysis. The B.A. in Public Policy The B.A. in Public Policy is offered by the Department of Public Administration and Policy. The Public Policy program is a joint major/minor program designed to help intellectually mature and motivated students understand and respond to changes in government and society. The program helps students understand how public problems are defined, and how policies are made and implemented to address those problems. Public policy making affects everyone and involves questions of politics, economics, administration and mana gement. A B.A. in public policy will help the student develop a broad interdisciplinary understanding of the forces that affect what government does and why. Combining a student-designed concentration with field experience, the combined major and minor in Public Policy assists students through an interdisciplinary approach to develop analytic ability, research skills, and substantive competence in a specific public policy area. Student-selected technical and theoretical courses help develop skills and background desirable to future employers. Concentrations Typical policy concentrations include business-government relations, civil rights policy, criminal justice policy, environmental policy, foreign policy and international relations, health policy, labor relations and personnel policy, law and policy, policy and politics, public administration and management, social welfare policy, urban policy, and women and public policy. Students may work with their adviser to develop a concentration in other issue areas. Careers The Public Policy curriculum combines a strong academic program with opportunities to develop expertise in a particular policy area and hone communications and analytical skills. The program is excellent preparation for graduate study, law school, or employment in the public, private or nonprofit sectors. Graduates of the Public Policy program are employed in the state legislature, the executive branch, and have gone on to graduate study and careers in business, law, and management. Internships The internship is an integral part of the Public Policy degree. The University's location in the state capital affords students with unique opportunities for internships directly related to their fields of interest. These internships can be in the legislature, state agencies, private firms, and nonprofit organizations. The internship can give students practical experience, useful recommendations, and substantial advantages in graduate admissions and job placement.

The program serves the liberal education needs for students interested in the social sciences and human services professions. Part-time study is possible. The B.S. in social work qualifies graduates for advanced standing in so me M.S.W. programs. The Master in Social Welfare (M.S.W.) prepares students for advanced social work practice. These positions generally require advanced theoretical, practice, research, management and/or policy analysis skills. The School of Social Welfare offers programs leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in social welfare, a Master of Social Welfare (M.S.W.) degree, and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. The School of Social Welfare also sponsors the Institute of Gerontology, Social Work Education Consortium, The Center for Human Services Research, The Community and Public Service Program, and the Technology Education Consultation for Human Services (TECH Center). Both the B.S. and M.S.W. degree programs are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education, the national accrediting body for all schools of social work. Degree Requirements for the Major in Social Welfare General Program B.S.:A combined major and minor sequence consisting of a minimum of 62 credits as follows: Of the 62 credits: (a) 15-16 credits represent the elementary base; (b) 15 credits represent the advanced base; (c) the remaining 32 credits constitute the core requirements for a major in social welfare. In addition, it is recommended that prospective social welfare majors elect R Ssw 290 (Community Service) in their sophomore year.

Admission Requirements Students interested in the social welfare major must complete an application process. Admission to the program is competitive. Applications are accepted in the Spring semester of the student's sophomore year for entrance into the Fall semester of the junior year. Transfer students who will have completed 56 credits should apply during the Spring of the year for which they are seeking Fall admission. It is strongly recommended that those wishing to enter the major complete as much of the required elementary base as possible prior to entrance into the program in the junior year. Admissions decisions are based on the following criteria: Adequacy of the liberal arts base Application essay Progress toward completion of elementary base requirements or their equivalents Grade point average Personal/professional references Social welfare/human service experience The relative merit of any one criterion is considered in light of all others when admissions decisions are made. The overall quality of the application will provide the basis for admissions. Termination Policies Social welfare majors cannot repeat a core social welfare course more than once and cannot repeat more than a total of two courses within the major. The core courses are R Ssw 301, 305, 306, 322, 400, 405Z, 406, 408, 409 and 410. A student who receives a grade of C- or lower in a core course will be given a warning by the Dean of the School of Social Welfare that a second such grade in that course will result in termination from the program. If a student receives a grade of C- or lower in two different core courses, the student will receive a warning from the Dean of the School of Social Welfare that any additional grade lower than a C in a core course will result in termination from the major. The letter will specify the policy that is the reason for the termination from the program. It will also outline the student's option to use the School grievance process (spelled out in the Undergraduate Student Handbook ) to appeal their grade in a course. If they are successful in receiving a grade change to a C or better, they will be reinstated to the major. Students also may petition for reinstatement in the major after a period of one semester; their petition will go to a Committee on Readmissions which makes a recommendation to the Dean who makes the final decision whether to reinstate the student. Field Instruction This course is an integral part of the total educational process. It offers a student the opportunity to develop, apply and integrate the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes for work in social welfare settings. During the senior year each student is provided field instruction by a qualified instructor in an agency designated by the school. Placements are selected by the school for the students on the basis of their educational needs and, wherever possible, their area of interest. The field placements represent a variety of settings under public and private auspices and are located throughout the Capital District. Students are responsible for the expenses involved in placement.

May not be offered in 2005-2006. PROJECT RENAISSANCE Stephen E. DeLong, Director Professor of Geology and Information Science (Collins Fellow) Project Renaissance is a year-long living/learning program for first-year students at the University. Participating students live together in shared residence halls and take team-taught or linked, interdisciplinary courses that satisfy 12 credits of General Education requirements (6 credits per semester) and that also fulfill the following requirements: lower-level writing intensive, information literacy, and, in some cases, oral discourse. Students must register for 6 credits each semester, with the first semester prerequisite for the second; 6 credits may be awarded to students who complete the first semester but opt not to continue in the second semester. Each of the integrated, full-year programs examines, through an interdisciplinary approach, the relationship between human identity and technology as expressed in or resulting from fields such as literature, philosophy, history, sociology, political science, religion, art, and science. Students choosing the General Program study with a team of ProjRen faculty from several academic disciplines. This program is open to students interested in any major, as well as those who are undecided. Students choosing a Track take a Departmental \"linked\" course directly related to that track and a 3-credit ProjRen course complementary to the track (so that the two courses together offer an interdisciplinary experience similar to the General Program). The linked course is typically a larger class that ProjRen students attend with other students. Each track is appropriate for students considering a number of different majors. In 2005-2006, there are five tracks (linked Departments in parentheses): Arts & Humanities (Art History, History) Pre-Business (Economics) Pre-Health (Biology) Psychology/Sociology (Psychology, Sociology) Pre-Law (Philosophy, Business Law) Other features of both programs include the use of contemporary computer technology for communication and research and, in some cases, a community service experience. Course configuration and thematic focus may vary year by year. For example: how human identity or the \"self\" is understood in relation to groups, cultures, and institutions; human identity in relation to issues of racial and ethnic diversity and gender difference and also cultural definitions of the individual in relation to nature; the formation of traditional concepts and challenges to them from early history through the early modern period; and in the context of the last two centuries, the impact contemporary academic disciplines, especially the natural and social sciences, have had on the way we regard our humanity, our function in society, and our place in the world. Courses U Uni 151 Human Identity and Technology I (3) Brings writing, language, literature, and the arts to bear on issues of human identity as the \"self\" is understood in relation to groups, culture, and institutions. [HU] U Uni 152 Human Identity and Technology I (3) Explores the questions of how individual identity is understood in relation to groups, cultures, and institutions and how that understanding is produced through various technologies. [SS] U Uni 153 Human Identity and Technology II (3) Explores human identity as it relates to issues of racial and ethnic diversity and gender-related concerns in the United States; explores as well how human identity is related to sociopolitical concerns and their aesthetic representations. [DP OD] U Uni 154 Human Identity and Technology II (3) Examines cultural definitions of the individual in relation to nature; ques tions of the origin of life and the fate of Homo sapiens will be explored, along with study of the environment. [NS] University at Albany 252 U Uni 155 Human Identity and Technology I (3) Examines how writing, literature, the arts and religion have represented the changing manifestations of our understanding of human identity. U Uni 156 Human Identity and Technology I (3) Explores the historical development of the concept of human identity from prehistory through the eighteenth century. [HU] U Uni 157 Human Identity and Technology II (3) Examines contemporary approaches to issues of human identity, particul arly as it relates to society. [OD SS] U Uni 158 Human Identity and Technology II (3) Explores contemporary understandings of human identify from Darwinian evolution through contemporary genetics.

When founded in 1948, the University consolidated 29 state-operated, but unaffiliated institutions. In response to need, the University has grown to a point where its impact is felt educationally, culturally and economically the length and breadth of the state. More than 400,000 students are pursuing traditional study in classrooms or are working at home, at their own pace, through such innovative institutions as Empire State College, whose students follow individualized and often nontraditional paths to a degree. Of the total enrollment, more than 100,000 students are 24 years or older, reflecting State University's services to specific constituencies, such as refresher courses for the professional community, continuing educational opportunities for returning service personnel, and personal enrichment for more mature persons. State University's research contributions are helping to solve some of modern society's most urgent problems. It was a State University scientist who developed the MRI, and another who made the connection between automobile and industrial exhaust combining to cause changes in weather patterns. Other University researchers continue important studies in such wide-ranging areas as immunology, nanotechnology, bioinformatics, cyber security, and organ transplantation. More than 1,000 public service activities are currently being pursued on State University campuses. Examples of these efforts include special training courses for local government personnel, State civil service personnel, and the unemployed; participation by campus personnel in joint community planning or project work, and campus community arrangements for community use of campus facilities. A distinguished faculty includes nationally and internationally recognized figures in all major disciplines. Their efforts are recognized each year in the form of such prestigious awards as the Nobel Prize, Fulbright-Hayes, Guggenheim, and Danforth fellowships. The University offers a wide diversity of what are considered the more conventional career fields, such as business, engineering, medicine, teaching literature, dairy, farming, medical technology, accounting, social work, forestry and automotive technology. Additionally, its responsiveness to progress in all areas of learning and to tomorrow's developing societal needs has resulted in concentrations which include pollution, urban studies, computer science, immunology, preservation of national resources, and microbiology. SUNY programs for the educationally and economically disadvantaged have become models for delivering better learning opportunities to a once-forgotten segment of society. Educational opportunity centers offer high school equivalency and college preparatory courses to provide young people and adults with the opportunity to begin college or to learn marketable skills. In addition, campus-based educational opportunity programs provide counseling, developmental education, and financial aid to disadvantaged students in traditional degree programs. Overall, at its EOC's, two-year colleges, four-year campuses and university and medical centers, the University offers 3,600 academic programs. Degree opportunities range from two-year associate programs to doctoral studies offered at 12 senior campuses. The 30 two-year community colleges operating under the program of State University play a unique role in the expansion of educational opportunity. They provide local industry with trained technicians in a wide variety of occupational curriculums, and offer transfer options to students who wish to go on and earn advanced degrees. The University has graduated more than 2.5 million alumnae. The majority of SUNY graduates pursue careers in communities across the State. State University is governed by a Board of Trustees, appointed by the Governor, which directly determines the policies to be followed by the 34 state-supported campuses. Community colleges have their own local boards of trustees whose relationship to the SUNY board is defined by law. The state contributes one-third of their operating cost and one-half of their capital costs. The State University motto is: \"To Learn\u2014To Search\u2014To Serve.'' Chancellor Robert L.

Z = Writing Intensive Y = Oral Discourse X = Information Literacy W = Writing Intensive + Oral Discourse V = Writing Intensive + Information Literacy U = Information Literacy + Oral Discourse T = Writing Intensive + Information Literacy + Oral Discourse Whether a course also meets one of the other G eneral Education requirements can be determined from the updated online lists for each category available at \"General Education Lookup\" (http://www.albany.edu/gened/search/search.shtml ). On myualbany, the \"Search Class Schedules\" capability also allows students to search for courses in a term that fulfill one or more of the General Education categories. This same search capability exists from the University's homepage: http://www.albany.edu/schedule_of_classes/ to find courses that meet one or more General Education requirements.
