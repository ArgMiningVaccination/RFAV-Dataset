Background: In order to further improve the methodology and quality of data collection in homeopathic drug provings (HDP), there is a need for a minimum standardised HDP protocol. The objective of the present study was to test the feasibility of this type of protocol. Materials and Methods: The study protocol embraced a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 2 parallel groups. It was approved by an ethics review committee. During the pre-approval phase, discordances between the regulatory and homeopathic requirements for the protocol were checked and solutions found. The study medication was Potentilla anserina. 6 participants received verum and 4 placebo. The resulting symptom list will be published elsewhere. The procedure was accepted by all participants. Results: Three important issues were addressed: the requirement to keep all participants blinded; the adverse events reporting to regulatory authorities; and the necessity of a placebo control group. Other issues that need further investigations were identified, e.g. sample size, observation period and dosage regimen. Conclusions: A minimum protocol of a HDP is feasible. All important design elements of HDP could be solved in discussions with the respective regulatory authorities, and participating homeopaths accepted the procedure.", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2014-08-01", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Background: In order to further improve the methodology and quality of data collection in homeopathic drug provings (HDP), there is a need for a minimum standardised HDP protocol.
