Read the whole story", "sitename": "Ars OpenForum", "date": "2017-11-02", "cleaned_text": "Anti-cancer claims are unproven and stem from a few animal and cell experiments. Ars, You know what is actually \"deceptive marketing\": Writing \"that there is no or insufficient evidence linking cannabis use to cancer prevention\" BUT then only hyperlinking the last part of the sentence which states \"linking cannabis use to cancer prevention\" instead of the whole sentence. Whenever I hear someone claim Marijuana cures cancer I ask them why Tommy Chong was treated for colorectal and prostate cancer. Invariably they'll claim, like he did, he was \"99% cancer free\" because of cannabis oil and not the standard rounds of radiation and chemotherapy that he also got. Anecdotal, I know, but my best friend was diagnosed last March with stage 4 cancer in liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and was assumed to have 6 to 9 months to live. They offered some modified base version of chemo to take away the pain, and MAYBE extend his life a few more months. He lives in Florida and didn't have access to medicanl MJ. After research we found he could get CBD oil legally over the internet. He found a CBD oil that he decided to take, just experimenting with dosing until he felt comfortable with it, since he had no available medical advice where he lived. First, he went through chemo, never lost a pound of weight, and never got nauseous. His description of waiting in the chemo ward for his treatment, seeing all these other people that were doing horribly, while he looked and felt fine, was very interesting to say the least. He actually felt guilty about it, in a way. Second, he went in for a checkup 3 months later...COMPLETELY CLEAR of cancer in all the same locations. His doctor was dumbfounded, ordered repeat tests, and was found to still be clear. to this day his doctor I realize this is not a scientific blind study or anything, but it has at least convinced me there may be something to this claim. I find it absolutely insane that we are not allowed to do more research with medicinal MJ than is currently allowed. If CBD or hemp actually caused the terminal cancer to disappear instead of luck+constitution+chemo being the cause, why haven't cancer deaths plunged dramatically in states with medical marijuana? Oregon's had medical marijuana for nearly two decades (Ballot Measure 67 in 1998). <snip> Marijuana, on the other hand, has no big money backer and has been viewed with a stigma that can be traced back to a visceral early-20th century hysteria. In fact, the negative (modern) view of marijuana is heavily rooted in racism as it was closely associated with blacks during the Jazz Age </snip>So...doesn't that directly contradict the DEA's scheduling of marijuana? That directly defies one of the requirements (\"The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\") and FDA approval implies it defies a second (\"There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.\").There are two FDA-approved cannabinoid drugs to treat nausea from chemotherapies, though. Students of Propaganda will notice that the FDA has NOT forbidden people from taking Ms. Casida's products. It has forbidden HER from making fraudulent claims.All free people have a right to experience health and wellness from naturally derived cannabinoids. We should not have to only take FDA-approved synthesized drugs. In the USA, you have free speech rights but you are not allowed to commit fraud by telling people that if they give you money, you'll perform some urgent care, and then laugh all the way to the bank. We, the patients, who know unequivocally that cannabis does indeed cure cancer, appreciate that Big Pharma has everything to lose by allowing this natural herb to be accepted legally in America. I live in Virginia where the corporate base of the F.D.A. approved drug ring festers. Right now, I am receiving numerous daily mailings in the form of multi colored thick brochures that are paid outright by Big Pharma profits to make sure that their candidate gets into office on November 7th to protect their billions upon billions of dollars of drugststore pharmacy window dirty money. The reason that marijuana will not be legalized at the federal level is because of corruption. What you are witnessing at the local state level is telling America that patients do know the truth and we are very very angry at this deception. Big Pharma and government do not care about your health. They would have you run to your doctor and be sent off to an oncologist for radiation and chemotherapy, only to suffer and eventually die a painful and cruel death with your loved ones crying at the feet of these people who are in power who are capable of committing murder without penalty but much reward. It is time for us to stand up and we are here in Virginia and say that we are not going to take it anymore! There's a lot of research to be done on Marijuana. Few long term studies are available, and there are pros and cons to usage. I fully support medical uses that remove psychoactive components, but it's sad that it's been so heavily banned for so long. The only real study I've heard about it was one in Australia, and there were some definite negatives, such as when used young increases chances of split personality disorders and somewhat decreased long term IQ. Also constant use can make other pain drugs not work (Heavy MJ users may not get pain relief from opioids). It's just really sad because things like this only make it harder to discern the medical properties of the plant. Well, I suppose being so high that you don't care about having cancer anymore could be considered a sort of 'treatment'. \"We recognize that there's interest in developing therapies from marijuana and its components, but the safest way for this to occur is through the drug approval process\u2014not through unsubstantiated claims made on a website,\" Gottlieb said. \"We support sound, scientifically-based research using components derived from marijuana, and we'll continue to work with product developers who are interested in bringing safe, effective, and quality products to market.\" I do find this both amusing and extremely frustrating. There are some promising studies vis a vis cannabis and treating various cancers with it. No, it doesn't \"cure cancer\" as the claims go, but cannabinoid oils have shown promise in shrinking some melanomas and such, and certainly works wonders for treating and alleviating side-effects of more traditional treatments like chemo and interferon. But this kind of BS really doesn't help. Can someone explain to me the whole \"US laws make this hard to study this so we can't know\" thing? Have I stumbled into some alternate dimension where the US has a monopoly on science? America was not built on the freedom to scam people out of their money and their lives.\"There are a growing number of effective therapies for many cancers. When people are allowed to illegally market agents that deliver no established benefit they may steer patients away from products that have proven, anti-tumor effects that could extend lives.\" I understand the point the FDA is making but I do feel they are missing the big point and bigger problem. If the FDA asked themselves as to why people are seeking alternative treatment rather than using the \"growing number of effective therapies\", you start to realize that maybe the ill can't afford the treatment or maybe most insurances won't cover the effective therapies to cure someone. If we fix our health insurance industry first, maybe more people would seek other effective therapies to cure cancer, and then I would welcome the FDA's criticism. At this point the FDA is wasting their time and impeding the freedom America is built on. Whenever I hear someone claim Marijuana cures cancer I ask them why Tommy Chong was treated for colorectal and prostate cancer.

[http://www.doctoryourself.com/fda.html] This doesn't open any doors, and that doesn't make any sense. These products were explicitly stating that they cure cancer, and the FDA told them to stop. That's a pretty ordinary thing that the FDA regularly does, and the fact that the products happen to be marijuana-based is completely incidental.\"In the harshly worded announcement, the agency suggested that the \"deceptive marketing\" was tantamount to \"health fraud\" and that the agency was \"increasingly concerned at the proliferation of products claiming to treat or cure serious diseases like cancer.\" This is how they'll open the door up to cracking down on states that have legalized pot. They will come at it as an FDA issue (rather than a DEA issue) and items like CBD oil and CBD focused products (like 1.1 THC/CBD edibles, oils and tinctures) all of which do work amazingly wel;l for pain control (better than opiods because the 1.1 ratio helps control the pain without the high that THC normally provides. Don't get me wrong idiot claims like it cures cancer does no one any good and makes it harder to get a serious conversation going about pulling it off the Schedule 1 ranking so we can find out, empirically, what it is that THC and Cannibinoids can do medically. \".... Let's be clear: chemotherapy and radiation treatments are horrible. They have a horrible effect on the physical health of people who undergo them. Receiving these treatments decimates their immune systems, withers their bodies, and puts them through enormous suffering. I've had someone very close to me say that they'd rather die than keep going through with it. That someone was about ten years old at the time. Unless you've been through it yourself, you can't even imagine the kind of heartbreak it causes to have a child that young say that they want to die.

That's the problem with these products. It's not that your health insurance system is messed up or that your health care system is garbage - these kinds of alternative treatments do well enough even in places where that's not the case. They do well because people with cancer are desperate and chemotherapy and radiation are terrifying. These companies are promising them another way to health, and even with everything I know I'd still be tempted to take that offer. That promise is a lie, but good god is it tempting to believe it. And that right there? That's why it's so reprehensible for you to claim that the FDA is impeding on the freedom that America was built upon. These companies are lying to people, people who accept those lies will refuse effective treatments because of it, and those people will die. The freedom you're arguing for is the freedom to exploit the sick and desperate, to prey on peoples' fears of suffering, and to kill people for profit. If it's a waste of time for the FDA to even bother trying to stop that? If that's the freedom that America was founded on?

Why, ways to cure yourself using \"natural healing\", of course! Secrets that can be yours for the low, low price of $32! And it's written by a Ph.D, no less! Hm... I wonder what that Ph.D is in, though. Medicine? Oh, wait, nope, nutrition. Well, uh... nutrition is good, right? By the way, have you seen this other book he wrote? It's called \"Niacin: The Real Story: Learn about the Wonderful Healing Properties of Niacin\"! It teaches you how you can use vitamin B3 to treat everything from arthritis to mental illness, learning and behavioral disorders, cardiovascular disease and more! The Kindle version is a bargain at only $16.20. Actually, hold on. I've dug a bit further and it looks like the places listing his Ph.D as having to do with nutrition were wrong. He actually has a Ph.D in human ethology, a field that has no relation whatsoever to medicine and that isn't especially well-established or credible. Speaking of things that aren't well-established or credible, I found another great book of his! It's called \"Fire Your Doctor\", also available on Kindle at the low, low price of $16.20!

Then thank fucking god that I'm not an American, because I don't think I could live with the shame of being a part of that tradition. First off, my apologies for ruining your Friday, sounds like this hit close to home. Just so you are aware, I've watched friends, family, classmates, teachers all struggle and die from cancer too. I'm not the insensitive prick you paint me out to be. And I'm not going to over share my personal stories just to gain sympathy or persuasion. Let me clarify the meaning of my last post. As a Type I diabetic and part of the US insurance system (which seems you're not) I can confidently say the US health care industry is broken. When I can buy glucose testing strips on Amazon (out of pocket, no insurance coverage) for cheaper than what I can purchase at a pharmacy and covered by insurance, there is an issue. When diabetics are denied continuous glucose monitoring systems (which gives 24 hours of glucose level readings) because they are testing their glucose but not as many times as the insurance company deems, there is an issue. I can draw from my own experiences as well as others who have been denied coverage whether it's diabetes or cancer. So if people can''t get the proper treatment they need because of financial hurdles, they are going to be drawn to alternative methods whether it's cannabis, meditation, etc. Because of this result the effect in capitalist America (which I despise as well) is that you're going to have snake oil salesmen offering herbal cures, not just cannabis. If we address the cause, then the effect goes away on it's own without the government IMPEDING/REGULATING WHAT CHOICES WE MAKE (a.k.a. freedom, rights) with our health. If you so support the FDA's claims in this article, then why aren't they putting a fight against Big Soda too (there's obesity in America but the sugary soda conversation is often dodged). Oh wait, we have Soda lobbyists in DC., funny how that works. I'm a firm believer that cannabis can help certain types of cancer but determining the efficacy in which cannabis if effective has been delayed by scientists because of the prohibition for roughly the last century. So I also don't feel the FDA should be blanketing cannabis as completely ineffective this early in the research phase. Thus, whether or not the products have the proper elements to be effective is due to lack of research, because of government control. If a patient is aware of the risk and wants to take that risk, they should be allowed, just like any other exotic treatment or clinical trial. And thank fucking god you live in a different country and have the insurance you have where ever you're from. With the President we have, lately I'm completely embarrassed to be an American. I didn't misconstrue your point. Your point was that the FDA shouldn't be taking actions like this, and the specific action they took was to warn companies not to falsely claim that their products will literally cure cancer when there is absolutely no evidence that those claims are true. The only freedom being assaulted here is the freedom to make medical claims about life-threatening illnesses that are not true in order to sell a product.Edit: Also, your statement below \"The freedom you're arguing for is the freedom to exploit the sick and desperate, to prey on peoples' fears of suffering, and to kill people for profit. If it's a waste of time for the FDA to even bother trying to stop that? If that's the freedom that America was founded on?\" -Firstly, you totally misconstrued my point. Secondly, what the hell you think happened to our Native Americans when fucktard Colombus colonized the states. This is human nature and exploitation at it's finest across the entire world. There's nothing to fight for there, exploitation is rampant. So no, I would never fight/argue for this, it's just the reality. You're right, I didn't read it. The person who wrote it has no credentials and no credibility in this area, and he makes his living by selling books pushing the exact premises he's arguing on that website. \"They have a medical review board\" doesn't change that - I could establish a \"medical review board\" by finding five people who agree with me too, but that doesn't make that board credible. And as for the referenced articles? Maybe they're better. If so, link directly to them instead of linking to a source that's plainly not credible....because it is?It's about the money. It's always about the money. This comes from the FDA, who thinks that it's okay to irradiate food. Subtitle of the page: \"World's Largest HEALTH HOMESTEADING website\", written in comic sans.

Now if you'll excuse me, I've got over a hundred dollars worth of books to buy. You didn't read any of it did you? There are loads of references, and proven research dating back to 1930. The meat and potatoes of the information is all on the main page available for free. Lengthy articles, dosing information, etc. You don't have to pay a dime for any of that. This website, has helped me cure a lifetime of depression and anxiety, as well as massive physical pain. From what I understand any book you want to buy, simply goes further in depth. You also forget that for people to do this work, they have to pay the bills. It's not like he's accepting money from vitamin manfuacturers... not to mention the fact that every article has a medical review board, referenced articles, and links directly to those articles. The way that you immediately knee jerk dismiss this information is scary.
