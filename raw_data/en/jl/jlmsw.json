In an effort to help educate the public about autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the Daily News spoke with employees at Decatur County Memorial Hospital (DCMH) to learn more. DCMH Marketing Manager Lynzee McDowell, Director of Rehabilitation Services Lisa Oldham, and Staff Speech Pathologist Johanna Painter all weighed in with their expert opinions while speaking with the Daily News. According to Oldham and Painter, early detection and intervention are extremely important when dealing with ASD and autism. Painter added that parents should ask questions if they are concerned instead of waiting in fear of the diagnosis. Many may hear the word autism on a regular basis but still have little idea what it actually means. According to Autism Speaks, ASD and autism are general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are most often shown with difficulty communicating, socializing, interacting and engaging in their environment. Some people with ASD are nonverbal, meaning they can't speak at all. In addition, people with an ASD may show sensitivity to light and sound, problems developing relationships, trouble with abstract thought, behavioral issues similar to obsessive compulsive disorder and no middle ground when it comes to behavior because everything is at an extreme. While these are many of the common symptoms, each person with an ASD is different and may present with unique symptoms. Some of the biggest dangers to those with an ASD are often the lack of awareness of danger, the fight or flight response that sensory overloads can trigger, and the habit of wandering. Oldham suggested parents get a medical alert bracelet for their ASD child so emergency personnel and neighbors could be aware of the child's condition if they are separated from family. Painter recommended families speak to neighbors after receiving a diagnosis. \"People nearby need to know so they can help if there's an emergency or if the child gets out of the house,\" Painter said. Along with many of the symptoms of an ASD, there are usually sensory issues to deal with. Loud noises, bright lights, strangers, unfamiliar environments and changes to routines can all be triggers of sensory overload meltdowns. These meltdowns often look like tantrums, but the person with ASD is in genuine distress. In times like these, the person suffering the meltdown can experience a slight touch as if it was a cut or burn and all their senses are intensified because their brains are wired to experience the senses differently. It becomes very difficult for them to focus and usually triggers a fight or flight response, which is often seen as aggression, leading to problems when others are unaware of the cause. There are some things others can do when witnessing a parent attempting to cope with a sensory meltdown. Oldham suggested first asking if one can help the parent, possibly by holding items for them. Those approaching an autistic child in the grips of a meltdown should speak with calm, quiet voices, used relaxed body language and not draw attention to the bad behavior. \"Sometimes just the presence of someone not the parent, or an authority figure, can help them realize they are showing behavior,\" Oldham said. However, because strangers can trigger problems in ASD children, it may be a risk to approach the child. Speak to the parent and respect their wishes if they say there is no way to help. Many parents dealing with public meltdowns may feel embarrassed, so not staring and acting as if nothing is amiss is a simple way to help. Those wishing to spread awareness about autism and ASD can do so chiefly by talking to friends, family and neighbors. Getting the conversation started is one of the biggest hurdles, according to DCMH. One can also hold or attend local events benefitting autism, like 5K runs, bowling events and anything else to benefit ASD research. Local therapists are also available to speak for free through the DCMH Speaker's Bureau. One can reach a speaker for a multitude of subjects by contacting McDowell at 663-1228. The biggest thing one can do to spread ASD and autism awareness to others is to educate themselves and share those findings. Simply by taking the time to look up the answer to one autism-related question, one could find a wealth of information which could then be shared. There is, however, quite a bit of questionable research on the internet related to autism. Before sharing ASD facts, please take a moment to confirm the research. A widely shared study linking vaccines to autism led to widespread distrust of vaccines. That study has been soundly debunked, though many still share that information as fact. The Daily News will continue sharing autism and ASD awareness in an article for parents dealing with the disorder every day, including resources for families who have recently received a diagnosis. That article will appear in a future edition of the Daily News. "}
