In addition, various durations of detoxification can also be based on the toxin type. [How long it takes to detox from alcohol](https://nchc.org/nutrition/detox/how-long-does-it-take-to-detox-your-body-from-alcohol/) can be different from how long it takes to remove certain drugs from the body. All in all, there are ways [how to detox your body](https://nchc.org/health/how-to-detox-your-body/), and one method is by taking vitamins and supplements to help healthy liver function. Vitamins For Liver Detox There are a variety of vitamins that can assist with providing a healthy liver and detoxifying the body. Certain vitamins such as A, B, C, and D, and other supplements glutathione, milk thistle, selenium and NAC can help to further aid in liver detox and protection against toxins. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional regarding any new vitamins or supplements you want to consume. Best Vitamins For Liver Detox When it comes down to supporting liver health and aiding in the detoxification process, there are several best liver detox supplements and vitamins that stand out for this benefit. These help with detoxifying and getting rid of toxins found in liver cells and optimizing the function of liver enzymes as well. Vitamin A The provitamin A, [beta-carotene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924697/),[1] is known to possess potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the liver from damage, especially from alcoholic liver disease. However, these benefits are typically seen in low doses of Vitamin A as higher doses can have the opposite effect and cause liver damage. Vitamin B Vitamin B complex is actually a group of eight different vitamins that are needed for various metabolic processes. However, Vitamins B6, B9 (folic acid) and B12 work more on liver health. [Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8046002/)[2] is a cofactor in fat metabolism and has been linked to lowering liver fat accumulation. [Vitamin B9 (folic acid or folate)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736728/)[3] is primarily stored in the liver and helps with the detoxification process through a method called methylation. Lastly, [vitamin B12 (cobalamin)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736728/)[4] further aids in detoxification and has been found to help to lower liver fat accumulation. Vitamin C [Vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478121/)[5] is an essential antioxidant that can protect and improve liver cells and especially against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It supports the production of glutathione, a key antioxidant that aids further in liver detoxification and liver health.

It is well known for helping to keep the bones strong along with calcium. But its role in the liver is also just as important. In fact, low levels of Vitamin D can indicate liver disease since it is needed to turn the inactive form of the vitamin to its active form (25-OH vitamin D). Therefore the more damaged the organ the less Vitamin D is circulating in the body. Furthermore, this vitamin may be a potential treatment for overall liver disease. Glutathione [Glutathione](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5549431/)[7] is an antioxidant that plays a major role in detoxification of the cells. It helps the body to detoxify from chemicals, metals and toxins. Intravenous injections are currently used to help treat chronic liver diseases, however, there is evidence that oral administration may be able also to provide benefit as well. It is also important for immune health and helps to regulate body fat. Milk Thistle When it comes to liver health, [milk thistle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541075/)[8] is an important topic to mention as it displays strong liver-protectant properties by serving as an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and an antifibrotic (scarring). It can also give additional benefits to patients that currently suffer from NAFLD. Selenium [Selenium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020169300877579)[9] is an essential trace element since it reduces the toxicity of heavy metals, such as mercury. It also supports the production of glutathione in the liver. In addition, selenium supplementation has been shown to [improve liver function](https://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-annals-hepatology-16-articulo-increased-serum-selenium-levels-are-S166526812030079X)[10] by reducing AST and ALT lab values and may play a role in improving severe liver disease as well. N-acetyl-L cysteine (NAC) [NAC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270338/)[11] is another powerful antioxidant that supports liver detoxification, and aids in glutathione synthesis by replenishing the storage. There is also evidence that NAC may also be able to aid in the treatment of NAFLD as well.
