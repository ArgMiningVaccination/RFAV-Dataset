COVID-19 Vaccination Plan Template Overview The COVID-19 Vaccination Plan template was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist with the development of a jurisdiction's COVID -19 vaccination plan. The template is divided into 15 main planning sections, with brief instructions to assist with content development. While these instructions may help guide plan development, they are not comprehensive, and jurisdictions are reminded to carefully review the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations as well as other CDC guidance and resources when developing their plans. Jurisdictions are encouraged to routinely monitor local and federal COVID-19 vaccination updates for any changes in guidance, including any updates to the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations.
