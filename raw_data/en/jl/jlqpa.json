Through the Partnership, Milwaukee's five health systems and the Milwaukee Health Department, along with the other municipal health departments in Milwaukee County, aligned resources to complete a shared community health needs assessment (CHNA) in 2013. Supported by additional data collection and analysis from the Center for Urban Population Health, www.cuph.org , this robust community- wide CHNA includes findings from a community health survey of over 1,900 adults, key informant interviews and multiple secondary data sources. This shared CHNA serves as the foundation for Aurora Health Care and its five hospitals located in Milwaukee County to implement strategies to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities. The 2013 community health needs assessment is based on prior efforts undertaken by Aurora Health Care to assess community health needs. Since 2003, Aurora Health Care has underwritten a community health survey of Milwaukee County's cities and villages every three years, conducted in partnership with the ir respective munici pal health departments . Purpose and process of the shared Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) From 2012 - 2013 a shared community health needs assessment ( CHNA) was conducted to 1) determine current community health needs in the cities of Milwauke e, Franklin and Greenfield, and villages of Greendale and Hales Corners , 2) gather input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community and identify community assets, 3 ) identify and prioritize signi ficant health needs , and 4 ) develop impl ementation strategies to address the prioritized health needs within the context of the hospital's existing programs, resources, strategic goals and partnerships. The process of conducting the CHNA is illustrated below and is described in this report. Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center Page 11 of 76 Data c ollection and a nalysis Quantitative data was collected through primary (city -specific) and secondary (county- level) sources and was supplemented with qualitative data gathered through key informant interviews and focus groups. This community health needs assessment (CHNA) includes county- level data , since it provides pertinent information for assessing the community health needs for the other municipalities . Each data source were collected, analyzed and published at different intervals and therefore t he data year s (e.g., 2010, 2012) will vary in this report. The most current data available was used for the CHNA. The core data sources for the CHNA include: Quantitative data s ources Source #1 | Cities of Milwaukee, Franklin and Greenfield , and Village s of Greendale and Hales Corners Community Health Survey Reports The community health survey is a source of primary c ommunity health data . The latest telephone survey was completed in 2012, and analyzed and posted in 2013. This comprehensive phone -based survey gathers specific data on behavioral and lifestyle habits of the adult population and select information about child health . In addition, this report collects data on the prevalence of risk factors and disease conditions existing within the adult popul ation and compares, where appropriate and available, health data of residents to state and national measurements. Conducted every three years, the survey can be used to identify community trends and changes over time. New questions have been added at different points in time . JKV Research, LLC analyzed the data and prepared the final report. Additional information about the community health surveys is outlined in Appendix A. For the data summary , see Appendix D for Milwaukee, Appendix E for Franklin, Appe ndix F for Greenfield, Appendix G for Greendale and Appendix H for Hales Corners . Source #2 | Secondary Data Report The report summarizes the demographic and health- related information for Milwaukee County (Appendix B ). Data used in the report came from publicly available data sources. Data for each indicator is presented by race, ethnicity and gender when the data is available. When applicable, Healthy People 2020 objectives are presented for each indicator. The report was prepared by the Center for Urban Population Health. For further description see Appendix B . Qualitative data s ource Source #3 | Key Informant Interview Report Forty -one individual key informant interviews were conducted between August and December 2012. Each key informant was asked to rank order the top 3 to 5 major health -related issues for Milwaukee County, based on the focus areas presented in Wisconsin's State Health Plan, Healthiest Wisconsin 2020. For each top -ranked health topic the informant was asked to specify existing strate gies to address the issue, barriers or challenges to addressing the issue, additional strategies needed and key groups in the community that hospitals should partner with to improve community health. Among the key informants were the health officers for the twelve municipal health departments in Milwaukee County, as well as leaders of academic centers, health coalitions, foundations , health systems, social service agencies and community organizations . These key informants focus on a range of public health i ssues and represent the broad interest of the community served, including medically underserved, low income and minority populations. For fu rther description see Appendix C . The Key Informant Interview Report presents the results, including cross -cutting themes, summaries of the top five health issues, comparison of results across jurisdictions (city of Milwaukee versus other Milwaukee County municipalities), and summaries for additional identified health issues. Moreover , the Key Informant Interview Repo rt compiles an extensive listing of community assets and potential resources and partnerships identified to address com munity health issues (Appendix C).

From a local perspective, the significant health needs identified through the CHNA have an impact on community health, both for the community at -large and in particular specific areas within the community (such as specific neighborhoods or populations experiencing health disparities). To determine the significant health nee ds identified through the CHNA , the following criteria was considered: Burden of the health issue on individuals, families, hospitals and/or health care systems (e.g., illness, complications, cost , death); Scope of the health issue within the community and the health implications; Health disparities linked with the health issue; and/or Health priorities identified in the municipal health department Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIP s) The Healthy People 2020 definition of a health disparity: If a health outcome is seen in greater or lesser extent between populations, there is disparity. Race or ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, age, disability, socioecon omic status and geographic location all contribute to an individual's ability to achieve good health.

Access Questions about unmet medical care, dental care, prescription medication and mental health care were added to the community health survey (Source #1) in 2012. Unmet medical care | In 2012, adults reporting they did not get the medical care they needed in the last 12 months (Source #1) City or Village 2012 The Healthy People 2020 target is to reduce the proportion of persons who are unable to obtain or who encounter substantial delay in receiving necessary medical care to 4.2% . Why is this significant? Unmet medical care can lead to further health complications and increase future costs. Access to medica l care can detect and treat disease at an earlier stage, improve overall health, prevent disease and disability , and reduce preventable Corners 8% Unmet dental care | In 2012, adults reporting they did not get the dental care they needed in the last 12 months (Source #1) City or Village 2012 The Healthy People 2020 target is to reduce the proportion of persons who are unable to obtain or who encounter substantial delay in receiving necessary dental care to 5.0%. Why is this significant? Unmet dental care can increase the likelihood for oral disease, ranging from cavities to oral cancer, which can lead to pain and disability. Access to oral health services can prevent cavities, gum disease and tooth loss, improve the detection of oral cancer and reduce future dental care costs.10 Milwaukee 21% Franklin 7% Greenfield 15% Greendale 12% Hales Corners 12% Unmet prescription medication | In 2012, adults r eporting someone in their household had not taken their pres cribed medication due to cost in the past 12 months (Source #1) City or Village 2012 The Healthy People 2020 target is to reduce the proportion of persons who are unable to obtain or who encounter substantial delay in receiving necessary prescription medication to 2.8%.

In 2012, a dults reporting they personally were not currently covered (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 The Healthy People 2020 target f or health care coverage is 100%. Why is this significant? A dults without consistent health care coverage are more lik ely to skip medical care because of cost concerns, which can lead to poorer health, higher long -term health care costs and early death.13 Milwaukee In 2012, adults re porting not being covered at least part of time in the past 12 months (Source #1) City or Village 2009 2012 The Healthy People 2020 target f or health care coverage is 100%. Why is this significant? Lack of adequate coverage makes it difficult for people t o get the health care they need and, when they do get care, may lead to poor outcomes and burden individuals with large medical bills.14 Milwaukee adults rep orting that a household member was not covered at least part of the time in the past year (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 The Healthy People 2020 target f or health care coverage is 100%.

High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are key risks for heart disease.20 In 2010, heart disease was a leading cause of death in Milwaukee County.21 Milwaukee Behaviors: alcohol use, tobacco use, nutrition an d physical activity Four modifiable health risk behaviors are responsible for the main share of premature death and illnes s related to chronic diseases: excessive alcohol consumptio n, tobacco use, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity. 22 Based on the key informant interview findings, nutrition and physical activity emerged as one of the top five health issues for Milwaukee County (Source #3). Alcohol u se | In 2012, adults reporting binge drinking in the past month. Binge drinking is defined as five or more drinks on one occasion for males and four or more for f emales (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 The Healthy People 2020 goal for adult binge drinking is 24%. In 2010, 22% of Wisconsin respondents and 15% of U.S. respondents reported binge drinking in the past month (2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance). Note: Binge drinking is defined as five or more drinks on one occasion for males and four or more for females (Source #1). Alcohol and drug use was one of the top three community health issues reported by adults in all five municipalities (Source #1). Why is this significant? Binge drinking is associated w ith an array of health problems including, but not limited to , unintentional injuries (e.g. car crashes, falls, burns, drowning), inte ntional injuries (e.g., firearm injuries, sexual assault, domestic violence), alcohol poisoning, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, high blood pressure, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, and poor control of diabetes. Binge drink ing is extremely costly to society from losses in productivity, health care, crime and other expenses.23 Milwaukee 20 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Heart Disease.

Why is this significant? In 2010, cancer was a leading cause of death in Milwaukee County.24 Smoking increases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and several types of cancer (acute myeloid leukemia, bladder, cervix, esophagus, kidney, larynx, lung, mouth, pancreatic, throat and stomach). 90% of all deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease are caused by smoking.25 Milwaukee of Milwa ukee County mothers indicated smoking during pregnancy (Source #2). - The Healthy People 2020 target is no greater than 1.4%. What is this significant? Research has shown that smoking during pregnancy can cause health problems for both mother and baby, such as pregnancy complications, premature birth, low birth weight infants and stillbirth. 26 Physical a ctivity | In 2012, adults reporting engaging in recommended moderate or vigorous activity (Source #1) City or Village 2006 2012 Why is this significant?

A healthy and balanced diet, including eating fruits and vegetables, is associated with red uced risk for many diseases, including several of the leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. A poor diet can lead to energy imbalance (e.g., eating more calories than one expends through physical activity) and can increase one's risk for overweight and obesity. Healthy eating helps reduce one's risk for developing obesity, osteoporosis, iron deficiency and dental cavities.28 Milwaukee Department of Health Services.

Good nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining weight as well as decreases the risk for high blood pressure and chronic disea ses, such as diabetes and certain cancers.29 high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and overweight /obesity Based on the key informant findings, overweight/obesity emerged as one of the top five health issues for Milwaukee County (Source #3). High blood pressure | In 2012, adults reporting high blood pressure in the pa st three years (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 The Healthy People 2020 goal of adults with high blood pressure is 26.9% Why is this significant? High blood pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke. Fortunately, there are ways to pre vent high blood pressure or treat it if it is already high.30 In 2010, heart disease and stroke were leading cause s of death in Milwaukee County.31 Milwaukee High blood cholesterol | In 2012, adults reporting high blood cholesterol in the past three years (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 The Healthy People 2020 goal of adults with high total blood cholesterol is 13.5% Why is this significant? H igh cholester ol is a risk factor for heart disease. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent high cholesterol levels or treat it if it is already high.32 Milwaukee adults classif ied as being overweight (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 The Healthy People 2020 goal for health weight is 34%. As a result, the unhealthy weight goal is 66%. Why is this significant? Overweight and obesity can incr ease the risk for high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, some cancers, and other health conditions.33 Milwaukee includes overweight and obese respondents. One nationally used definition of overweight status developed by the CDC is when a person's body mass index (BMI) is greater or equal to 25.0. A BMI of 30.0 or more is consid ered obese. Body Mass Index is calculated by using kilograms/meter 2 (Source #1). 29 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity.

Mental health conditions | In 2012, adults reporting a mental condition (such as depression, anxiety disorder or post -traumatic stress disorder) in the past three years (Source #1) City or Village 2009 2012 Why is this significant? Mental health conditions are ex tremely costly to society, due to diminished personal, social and occupational functioning. Mental health conditions are associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes , and related to risk behaviors for chronic disease, such as physical inactivity, obesity, smoking and excessive drinking.34 Milwaukee 2012, adults reporting feeling so overwhelmed in the past year that the y considered suicide (Source #1) City or Village 2003 2012 Why is this significant? Suicide is a serious public health problem that can have lasting harmful effects on individuals, families and communities. While its causes are complex and determined by m ultiple factors, the goal of suicide prevention is to reduce factors that increase risk and increase factors that promote resilience.35 Milwaukee respondents were asked if they have felt so overwhelmed that they considered suicide in the past year. The survey did not ask how seriously, how often or how recent suicide was considered (Source #1). Additionally, in 2010, there were 116 suicides in Milwaukee County (12.2 per 100,000) (Source #2). - The Healthy People 2020 target is 10.2 per 100,000. 34 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Mental Health.

Infant Mortality, low birth weight and premature births| The death of a baby before his or her first birthday is called infant mortality. The infant mortality rate is an estimate of the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births. Based on key informant interviews, infant mortality emerged as one of the top five health issues for Milwaukee (Source #3). In 2010, infant mortality rate for Milwaukee County was 8.1 per 1,000 live births, whi le the state had a lower rate (5.7 per 1,000 births). In Milwaukee County, the percent of low birth weight births and infant mortality rate were over two times more frequent for births to African American/Black mothers (14.1%, 14.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively) than for White mothers (6.9%, 4.6 deaths per 1,000 live births) (Source #2) . - The Healthy People 2020 infant mortality rate target is 6.0 per 1,000 live births Why is this significant? Infant mortality rate is a widely used indicator of a population's health status because factors affecting the health of the entire population, such as economic development and availability of health services, also can impact the mortality rate of infants. 36 Sexual and reproductive health: teen pregnanc y and sexually transmitted infections Teen pregnancy | In Milwaukee County, from 2008 to 2010, the teen pregnancy rates fo r ages 15 -19 and ages 15 - 17 has decreased ; however, disparities still exist. Teen births have some of the highest risk ratios when co mparing the lowest socio -economic status (SES) zip codes to Milwaukee 's highest SES zip codes. Teens in the lower SES zip codes have 7.5 times greater risk for pregnancy than teens in the higher SES zip codes (Source #2) . Why is this significant? Teen pregnancy and childbearing can bring substantial social and economic costs through immediate and long -term impacts on the t een parents and their children.37 Sexually transmitted infections | The 2010 Milwaukee County sexually transmitted infections incidenc e rate was 1,469 per 100,000, considerably higher compared to the state (500 per 100,000). The 2011 HIV incidence rate was 15.7 per 100,000, three times higher than the sta te rate (and 4.6 per 100,000 ). Persons in the lower soci o- economic status zip codes h ad a 4.88 greater risk for Chlamydia and a 3.4 greater risk for HIV than persons in the higher SES zip codes (Source #2). Why is this significant? A n untreated sexually transmitted infection (also referred to as sexually transmitted disease) can lead to serious health problems . HIV affects specific cells of the immune system and over time can destroy so many of these cells that the body cannot fight off infection and disease. When this happens, HIV infection leads to AIDS. There are effec tive strategies for reducing STI risk and transmission.38 36 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Infant Mortality.

The ad hoc committee presented its final recommendation to the Social Responsibility Committee in October of 2012, and, for the purpose of developing community benefit implementation strategies, a \"signature co mmunity benefit focus\" for all Aurora Health Care hospital facilities was determined: A demonstrable increase in \"health home\" capacity and utilization by underserved populations across Aurora's footprint (Me dicaid -eligible and uninsured) During 2013, Au rora hospital facility leaders prioritized significant needs based on the following criteria: Meets a defined community need (i.e., access for underserved populations) Aligns community benefit to organizational purpose and clinical service commitment to co ordinate care across the continuum Aligns with hospital resources and expertise and the estimated feasibility for the hospital to effectively implement actions to address health issues and potential impact Reduces avoidable hospital costs by redirecting pe ople to less costly forms of care and expands the care continuum Has evidence -basis in cross -section of t he literature for management of chronic diseases in defined populations Leverages existing partnerships with free and community clinics and Federal ly Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) Resonates with key stakeholders as a meaningful priority for the Aurora hospital to address Potential exists to leverage additional resources to extend impact Increases collaborative partnerships with others in the community by expanding the care continuum Improves the health of people in the community by providing high- quality preventive and primary care Aligns hospital resources and expertise to support strategies identified in municipal health department Community Health Improv ement Plan (CHIP) Using t his criteria, Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center has prioritized the significan t health needs to address in its implementation s trategy: Access and coverage Chronic d isease (multiple) and specific focus on cancer and heart health Health risk f actors (blood pressure, cholesterol and overweight/obesity) Health risk b ehaviors (tobacco use, physical activity and nutrition) Mental h ealth Signific ant health needs n ot being addressed in the implementation strategy and the r eason: Dental health is being addressed on a system level, rather than specifically through ASLMC . Aurora Health Care is a founding and sustaining partner of the Mi lwaukee Health Care Partnership, which is working to improve access to dental care. Additionally, there is important work being done through organizations within the community. Sixteenth Street Community Health Cent er, Children's Health Alliance and Columbia St. Mary's are currently addressing dental care for children and adults . Our Aurora St. Luke' s Medical Center (ASLMC) implementation strategy does not include specific strategies for alcohol use since these are part of the standard co ntinuum of clinical care at ASLMC . Additionally, one of the aims of increasing access to health care, specifically primary care, is to addr ess the health risk behaviors that put individuals at greater risk for health complications and disease , including unhealthy alcohol consumption. Through its well -coordinated network of healthcare facilities, prov iders and service sites within Milwaukee County , Aurora Health Care has a system strategy for leveraging resources and expertis e to strengthen community capacity to address significant health needs. For example, t een pregnancy is being addressed on a system level . Aurora Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center Page 23 of 76 Health Care continues to be a community partner and works with other organizations to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in the city of Milwaukee, including a long -standing partnership with the United Way Teen Pregnancy Prevention Collaborative and the City of Milwaukee Health Department for this purpose. Infant mortality (low birth weight and premature births) also is being addressed at a system level. Aurora Sinai Medical Center and Aurora Family Services are committed to addressing infant mortal ity in the city of Milwaukee. The specific strategie s to address infant mortality are outlined in the Aurora Sinai Medical Center implementation strategy, which is posted at http://www.aurora.org/commbenefits . Although clinical practices and patient assessments are in place to address sexually transmitted infections, t his is not addressed in our ASLMC implementation strategy because considerable work is already being done through other organizations within the commu nity. The AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin (ARCW), Sixteenth Street Community Health Center, and Diverse and Resilient are organizations currently addressing HIV/AIDS in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Public Schools, the City of Milwaukee Health Department, and Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin are working to decrease the rate of sexua lly transmitted infections in the city of Milwaukee.

We recognize our role in addressing concerns about the accessibility and affordab ility of health care in Milwaukee County. Further, we recognize that we are accountable to our patients and communities, and that our initiatives to support our communities must fit our role as a not -for-profit community hospital. It is not surprising that we are asked to support a wide array of community activities and events in our community. However, today's community health needs require us to reserve limited charitable resources for programs and initiatives that improve access for underserved persons and specifically support community health improvement initiatives. The implementation strategies presented here are the result of our process for assessing community health needs, obtaining input from community members and public health representatives, prioritizing needs and consulting with our hospital staff and physician partners. Our strategies are organized into three main categories in alignment with three core principles of community benefit as shown below. Category Community Benefit Core Principle Priority #1: Access and Coverage Access for persons in our community with disproportionate unmet health needs Priority #2: Community Health Improvement Plan Build links between our clinical services and local health department community health impro vement plan (CHIP) Priority #3: Hospital focus Address the underlying causes of persistent health problems These implementation strategies do not constitute the entirety of the community benefits our hospital provides each year. A full accounting of o ur community benefits are reported each year and can be found by visiting: www.aurora.org/commbenefits . Principal community health improvement tool: Community Partnerships For any community health concern, it is widely recognized that a diverse team of engaged community partners is essential for implementing strategic community health improvement initiatives that make a difference. Therefore, we recognize the need to be a good community partner. Our im plementation strategies strongly reinforce our role as a partner for community capacity -building to address unmet community health needs. This Community Benefit Implementation Strategy was adopted by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Aurora Hea lth Care Board of Directors on December 19, 2013.

In addition, this report collects data on the prevalence o f risk factors and disease conditions existing within the adult population, and compares, where appropriate and available, health data of residents to state and national measurements. Conducted every three years, the survey can be used to identify community trends and changes over time. The health topics covered by the community health survey are provided in the Community Health S urvey Report Summary for the city of Milwaukee (Appendix D), city of Franklin (Appendix E ), city of Greenfield (Appendix F), village of Greendale (Appendix G) and village of Hales Corners (Appendix H) . Respondents were scientifically selected so that the survey would be representative of all adults 18 years old and older. The margin of error for smaller subgroups will be larger . For the landline sample, weighting was based on the number of adults in the household and the number of residential phone numbers, excluding fax and computer lines, to take into account the probability of selection. For the cell -phone only sample, it was assumed the respondent was the primary cell phone user. Combined, post -stratification was conducted by sex and age to reflect the 2010 census proportion of these characteristics in the area. Throughout the report, some totals may be more or less than 100% due to rounding and response category distribution. Percentages occasionally may differ by one or two percentage points from previous reports or the Appendix as a result of rounding, recoding variables or response category distribution. When applicable the data was compared with measures from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and indicators established by Healthy People 2020 . City of Milwaukee The sampling strategy was two -fold. 1) A random -digit -dial landline sample of telephone numbers which included listed and unlisted numbers.
