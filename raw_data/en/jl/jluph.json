It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2). The clinical spectrum of COVID -19 spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection t o severe disease. The majority of patients will present non- severe (flu- like syndrome) or mild symptoms (mild pneumonia). However, up to 20% of patients will present severe ( signific ant lung involvement leading to impairment of gas exchange function) or cr itical disease (including respiratory failure, thrombosis, multiorgan dysfunction) that might ultimately lead to death. Patients with risk factors (e.g. old age, obesity, chronic lung, kidney or heart disease, active cancer or immunosuppression, diabetes) are more prone to develop severe disease course and death. Vaccines have been developed for the prevention of COVID -19. For the treatment of COVID -19, apart from the usual standard- of-care techniques, several drugs have been tested for the management of hospitali sed patients throughout the course of the pandemic. Currently available therapeutics in Switzerland, depending on the stat us of the disease and patient characteristics , are essentially dexamethasone, remdesivir, baricitinib and various monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are in principle used in non -hospitali sed patients and the other drugs usually for treating hospitali sed patients. Since the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies depends on their ability to bind to the spike protein, it can be reduced against some SARS -CoV-2 variants. Therefore, small molecules with activity against other viral targets will be an important part of the therapeutic arsenal. There is currently no approved oral outpatient treatment in Switzerland to prevent severe COVID -19 outcomes. Paxlovid is an oral combination therapy consisting of two substances , nirmatrelvir and ritonavir . (3C-like protein) , is the main protease of the coronavirus. Nir matrelvir binds to the active site of th is protease and forms a covalent interaction (as determined by the co- crystal structure). 3CLpro digests the virus pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins at multiple junctions to generate a series of proteins critical for virus replication and transcription, including RdRp, the helicase and the 3CL pro itself. Notably , no close human analogues of the coronavirus 3CLpro are known. Ritonavir is also a protease inhibitor but is used here in combination as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance exposures of nirmatrelvir throughout the entire dosing interval. Notably, ritonavir is a well -known molecule that has long been used in combination as a protease inhibitor booster in HIV treatments.

No close human analogues of 3CLpro are known. The applicant investigated the effect of the combination of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (inhibitor of the major CYP enzymes responsible for inactivation of nirmatrelvir) only in a few proof -of-concept studies. Therefore, the safety margins given below are a comparison of a nirmatrelvir treatment in vitro or in vivo with the clinical exposure after treatment with the combination. Some final documents are still outstanding and will be submitted as post -approval commitments. 5.1 Pharmacology Nirmatrelvir and its major metabolite M4 inhibited SARS -CoV-2 3CLpro with IC 50 values of 19.2 nM and 17.5 nM (binding constant (K i) values 3.11 nM and 3.15 common variants ( i.e. USA-WA1, Alpha, Beta, Lambda, Gamma, Delta, Mu and Omicron) in several susceptible cell lines , with EC 50 values between 15.9 nM and 217 nM. As nirmatrelvir and M4 are P -glycoprotein (P -gp) substrates, their therapeutic index increased up to 58- fold in the absence of cellular P -gp. Combination of ritonavir with nirmatrelvir resulted in increased antiviral efficacy. In vitro replication efficacy of recombinant SARS -CoV-2 containing mutations in 3CLpro is currently being studied. Nirmatrelvir had no effect (IC 50 >10 \u00b5M) on the activity of several studied mammalian proteases. Oral administration of nirmatrelvir (up to 1000 mg/kg twice daily) in a mouse- adapted model of coronavirus infection reduced viral tit ers in the lungs up to 4.2 log 10 by Day 3 post -infection. The treatment also significantly improved infection- dependent body weight loss and lung histology. Secondary pharmacology investigations showed no off -target activities up to 100 M, i.e. 12-fold total human C max of nirmatrelvir at th erapeutic dose (39 -fold the predicted human unbound C max). The drug substance caused no adverse effects on respiratory or central nervous system function in rats at exposure levels corresponding to 17 -fold human C max at therapeutic dose. Treatments resulti ng in exposure levels up to approx. 3.6-fold the clinical exposure did not impact cardiovascular system function in monkeys . The outcome of the repeat -dose studies supports this conclusion. 5.2 Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of nirmatrelvir, T max was between 0.25 and 1.5 h in rats and approx. 0.25 h in monkeys. Plasma C max and AUC increased almost dose- dependently in rats. The terminal half -life of nirmatrelvir after oral dosing in rats was 2.8 -14 h, which is in a comparable range to that in hu mans administered nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir (6.8 to 8 h). Oral bioavailability in rats was dose- dependent, reaching 100% at 1000 mg/kg, whereas bioavailability in humans at therapeutic dosing was estimated to be 55%. The unbound fraction o f nirmatrelvir in plasma was approx. 30% in rat s, monkey s and human s, independently of the concentration. In rabbits and dogs, the unbound fraction in plasma increased with increasing dose , reaching up to 80%. Nirmatrelvir did not show preferential distribution into blood cells. The distribution of nirmatrelvir into tissues is currently being studied and the respective report will be submitted as a post-approval commitment. CYP3A4 was identified as the major metaboli sing Five metabolites were gener ated dehydrogenation vitro . The across was M4 (arising from hydroxylation). Metabolites M5 and M8 were generated vivo by the gut microflora. No human- unique metabolites were observed in vitro . In vivo , nirmatrelvir was the main circulating drug- related entity in plasma from rats, monkeys and humans following oral administration. SwissPAR 11 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 After administration of nirmatrelvir (up to 1000 mg/kg to rats and 10 mg/kg/day to monkeys), the percentage of dose excreted unchanged was low (rats: 17% in urine and 9- 22% in in urine and 4% M4 was the most abundant metabolite in excreta. In humans administer ed nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir, nirmatrelvir was the major drug- related material in excreta, with 55.0% in urine and 27.5% in faeces. 5.3 Toxicology The repeat -dose studies were conducted in rats (up to 1000 mg/kg/day ) and cynomolgus monkeys (600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/day twice daily)) using the oral route as intended in the clinical setting. Exposures achieved in animals were several fold higher than thos e in humans after treatment with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. The pivotal studies were conducted for up to 1 -month with a 2 -week recovery phase in both toxicological species. The duration of these studies is in line with the requirements outlined in ICH M3 to support short -term clinical use (not more than 10 days). Given that ritonavir is a mark eted product with a known safety profile, and that the achieved nirmatrelvir exposure in all tests was higher than human exposure levels, the lack of toxicological studies with a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir is acceptable, in line with ICH M3( R2). No adverse test item -related effects were observed in repeat -dose studies. Nirmatrelvir was not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo . Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted, which can be accepted as the treatment duration in humans is limited to 5 days. Oral nirmatrelvir administration did not affect fertility at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male and female rats, corresponding to an exposure of approximately 4.1 and 4.4 -fold the clinical exposure. In embryo -foetal development studies in rats, the NOAEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity was 1000 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 7.8- fold the human AUC 24 at therapeutic dose. In rabbits, lower mean foetal weight (0.91x control) was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 300 mg/kg/day, corresponding to approx. 2.8- fold human AUC 24 at therapeutic dose. In the pre- and postnatal devel opmental toxicity study, t he high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day was considered the NOAEL for parental F0 systemic toxicity and F1 developmental and syste mic toxicity, corresponding to approx. 8 -fold the human exposure at therapeutic dose. The Information for healthcare professionals adequately describes reproductive and developmental toxicity findings. The applicant did not perform juvenile animal studies . The PIP for nirmatrelvir does not require any nonclinical measures. The environmental risk assessment is in progress; the ERA will be submitted as a post-approval commitment. The Nonclinical Safety Specifications in the RMP adequately address the noncli nical findings and their relevance for clinical use. 5.4 Nonclinical Conclusions The submitted documentation is considered appropriate to conduct a risk assessment for nirmatrelvir. The submitted nonclinical data support the approval of Paxlovid in the propos ed indication. The relevant information has been included in the I nformation for healthcare professionals.

The impact of food on the absorption of the nirmatrelvir tablet in combination with RTV was not formally investigated, but nirmatrelvir /RTV was administered independently of food in the pivotal Phase 2/3 study. The median nirmatrelvir tmax after fasted administration of the tablet + RTV was about 3 hours. Dose proportionality Nirmatrelvir exposures increased less than dose proportional ly after single (150 mg to 1500 mg) and multiple (75 mg to 500 mg BID) dose administration, independently of the co- administration of RTV. Pharmacokinetics after multiple dosing Nirmatrelvir reached its steady state on Day 2 after RTV -boosted BID dosing. There was an approximately 2- fold accumulation after 5 or 10 days of RTV -boosted BID dosing. Distribution Nirmatrelvir in vitro plasma protein binding was about 70% and over the range of 0.3 to 10 \u00b5M independent of the Nirmatrelvir concentration. The in vitro blood- to-plasma ratio was 0.68, indicating limited penetration of Nirmatrelvir into red blood cells. After administration of Nirmatrelvir /RTV at 300 mg/100 mg, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of Nirmatrelvir in healthy subjects was 109.4 L. The Nirmatrelvir Vz/F in COVID -19 patients is unknown. Metabolism & e limination Nirmatrelvir was metaboli sed exclusively by CYP3A - mainly CYP3A4 - in vitro . In plasma, unchanged NIRMATRELVIR was the main compound after administration of a single 300 mg dose of Nirmatrelvir boosted with 100 mg RTV. Only traces of M4, M5 and M8 were detected. M4 was the major metabolite of Nirmatrelvir formed in vitro . Its absence in vivo is due to the co -administration of RTV, as the formation of M4 was almost completely inhibited by ketoconazole in vitro. The formation of M7 from M5 was mainly catalysed by UGT2B4 with a minor contribution of UGT2. Unchanged Nirmatrelvir was also the main compound excreted in urine (55% of the normali sed dose) and f aeces (27.5% of the normali sed dose). Additional metabolites detected in urine and/or f aeces were M5, M7 and M8. In urine, none of them accounted for more than 3% of the normali sed dose. In faeces, M5 was the most abundant metabolite accounting for 11.7% of the normali sed dose. The total recovery of drug- related material plus M8 was 84.9% of the administered Nirmatrelvir dose. After dose normali sation, 58.4% and 41.6% of drug- related material was in urine and faeces, respectively. After multiple RTV -boosted BID dosing, the Nirmatrelvir half-life was about 8 h. Renal clearance ranged from 2.93 to 3.78 L/h. Special Populations Renal function affected Nirmatrelvir PK after co -administration with RTV. The half -life increased from 7.7 h in subjects with normal renal function to 13.4 h in subjects with severe renal impairment (RI). There was a 1.3- fold, 1.4 -fold and 1.5 - fold increase of Nirmatrelvir Cmax in subjects w ith mild, moderate or severe RI, respectively. The corresponding increase in Nirmatrelvir AUCinf was 1.24-fold, 1.87- fold and 3.04- fold. There was a linear relationship between Nirmatrelvir CL/F or AUC and eGFR. Simulations of the Nirmatrelvir trough concentrations on Day 5 with a preliminary popPK model supported the proposed dosing recommendations for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. SwissPAR 13 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Preliminary data indicated comparable Nirmatrelvir exposures after administration of Nirmatrelvir plus RTV in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and controls with normal hepatic function. A final popPK analysis investigating the impact of age, weight and other covariates on Nirmatrelvir exposures is still missing. Interactions EFFECT OF OTHER DRUGS ON Nirmatrelvir /RTV In vitro d ata Nirmatrelvir is metaboli sed by CYP3A4 . NIRMATRELVIR is a multiple doses of Nirmatrelvir /RTV were administered, i.e. there was already close to maximum CYP3A4 inhibition due to RTV. Therefore, the further addition of itraconazole had no large effect on Nirmatrelvir exposures. The dose- normali sed Nirmatrelvir AUClast was about 6 to 15 -fold higher after boosting Nirmatrelvir with 100 mg RTV. EFFECT OF NIRMATRELVIR/RTV ON OTHER DRUGS RTV is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and P-gp and has also a strong affinity for CYP2C9 . The known interaction potential of RTV must be considered with regard to the overall interaction potential of the Nirmatrelvir /RTV combination (see Table 1 in the Information for healthcare p rofessionals, section \"Interactions \"). In vitro d ata - Static DDI risk assessment Direct or time -dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 cannot be excluded at therapeutic Nirmatrelvir exposures. No interaction potential due to inhibition was identified CYP1A2, at Nirmatrelvir exposures cannot be excluded. No induction of CYP2B6 or 2B15 at Nirmatrelvir exposures cannot be completely excluded. At therapeutic Nirmatrelvir exposures, the inhibition of P -gp and OATP1B1 cannot be excluded. No DDI risk OATP1B3 , OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K. Clinical data indicated no relevant additional effect of Nirmatrelvir /RTV on midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) exposures compared to Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 6.2 Dose Finding and Dose Recommendation There was no dose finding study performed. A popPK model was used to evaluate the dose and duration of treatment. The basis of the dosage rationale was as follows: (i) the 300 mg nirmatrelvir regimen was predicted to maintain concentrations above the EC 90 in most treated participants, (ii) the dose of 100 mg ritonavir was selected as it is already used as a PK enhancer in HIV drugs, (iii) the 5- day duration of the regimen was based on a viral dynamics model of SARS -CoV-2 infection in humans. 6.3 Efficacy The efficacy of Paxlovid in reduc ing hospitali sations and deaths due to COVID -19 was assessed in the single pivotal study C4671005 ( EPIC -HR). It was a P hase 2/3, sed, double- blind, placebo- controlled study in non- hospitali sed symptomatic adult participants with confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection, who were at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. The primary efficacy objective was to compare the efficacy of Paxlovid to placebo for the treatment of COVID -19 in non- hospitali sed symptom atic patients with COVID -19 at increased risk of progression to severe disease. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with COVID -19 related hospitali sation or death from any cause through to Day 28. Secondary endpoints included (i) clinical aspects such as time to sustained alleviation or resolution of targeted signs/symptoms, the proportion of participants with all -cause death through to W eek 24, the number of COVID -19 medically -related visits and (ii) virological parameters (viral l oad over time). The main inclusion criteria were an initial onset of signs/symptoms attributable to COVID -19 with a positive SARS -CoV-2 test (PCR or antigenic) within 5 days prior t o randomi sation, and at least one characteristic or underlying medical condition associated with an increased risk of developing severe illness. Risk criteria were generally in line with identified risk factors in the scientific literature and the criteria of the FOPH, except for the inclusion of cigarette smoking. A BMI threshold of 25 kg/m2 as well as an age 60 years were also considered to be risk factors, which are at the lower bound of the range but acceptable. The m ain exclusion criteria were prior SARS -CoV-2 infection or vaccination, an oxygen saturation of <92% on room air, moderate or several renal impairment, active liver disease or an anticipated need for hospitali sation within 48 hours after randomi sation. Participants were randomi sed (1:1) within 48 hours to receive Paxlovid or placebo orally q12h for 5 days. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and whether participants had received/were expected to receive treatment with COVID -19 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies . Patients were not stratified by time since COVID -19 symptom onset ( 3 vs >3 days) . This should probably have been performed as the study primary analysis in the mITT population relates to patients who were treated 3 days after COVID -19 symptom onset. Nevertheless, since time to symptom onset was balanced between treatment arms it likely did not affect the results. Participants were allowed to receive standard -of-care therapy that included corticoids (for any indication, used in 6.2% and 10.5% of the Paxlovid and The slight imbalance in frequency of treatment in the placebo arm is due to the increased number of patient s in this group who were hospitali sed. The total study duration was up to 24 weeks : study intervention through to Day 5/6, efficacy assessments through to Day 28, a safety follow -up period through to Day 34 and long- term follow- up at Weeks 12 and 24. An external data monitoring committee reviewed data from a pre -specified 45% interim analysis (Paxlovid n=678, p lacebo n=683) and confirmed that the criteria for stopping the trial due to efficacy had been achieved. Further enrolment in the study was therefore stopped. Overall, a total of 2396 participants were screened and 2246 participants w ere randomi sed, 1120 in the Paxlovid and 1126 in the placebo group. Demographic parameter s were we ll balanced between groups. In the final SwissPAR 15 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 analysis , 51% were male and the median age was 46 years. Only 13% of the study population was aged 65 years or older. 70% of subjects were enrolled in the USA and Europe, which is sufficient to extrapolate to the Swiss population. 62% of the subjects had at least 2 risk factors for severe disease. The most common risk factor at baseline was BMI 25 kg/m2 (80%), followed by hypertension (33%). The applicant considered smo king (39% of subjects) as a risk factor, but the association is controversial in the literature. Still, the proportion of smokers without any other risk factors was low (approx . 9%) and similar between the treatment groups. Risks factors related to immunodeficiency were almost non -existent, representing 0.6% of the study population. Two- thirds of patients had a duration of symptoms 3 days before treatment. Notably, even though patients with prior known SARS- CoV-2 infection or vaccination were excluded, 51% of the participants were seropositive at baseline. The proportion of participants who discontinued the treatment phase was low and slightly lower in the Paxlovid (6.0%) vs the placebo (7.7%) group. The primary reason for discontinuation was adverse event (2.1% Paxlovid vs 4.2% placebo). A total of 1053 Paxlovid subjects (94%) and 1039 placebo subjects (92.3%) completed the study. Of these, 78.5% of Paxlovid subjects and 76.8% of placebo arm subjects received 5 days of treatment. Clinical efficacy was shown to be significant in the final analysis: - In the mITT analysis set (subjects who received treatment within 3 days of symptom onset and who had not received and were not expected to receive monoclonal antibodies after diagnosis). The rate of COVID -19-related hospitali sation or death from any cause t hrough to Day 29 was of 0.7% (5/697) in the Paxlovid group and 6.5% (44/682) in the placebo group . Statistical significance was met with a p < 0.0001. This amounts to an absolute risk reduction of 5.8% and a relative risk reduction of 88.9% for Paxlovid in comparison to placebo. There were 0 deaths in the Paxlovid group and 9 deaths in the placebo group, all related to the disease under study . - In the mITT1 set (subjects who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset and who had not received and were not expected to receive monoclonal antibodies after diagnosis). The rate of COVID -19-related hospitali sation or death from any cause t hrough to Day 29 was of 0.8% (8/1039) in the Paxlovid group and 6.3% (66/1046) in the placebo group. Statistical significance was met with a p < 0.0001. This amounts to an absolute risk reduction of 5.5% and a relative risk reduction of 87%. There were 0 deaths in the Paxlovid group and 13 death s in the placebo group , all related to the disease under study . Clinical efficacy was shown among the majority of pre- specified subgroups and for all comorbidities, except where either few events occurred or a statistical test could not be performed because no participants had the event. As expected, the efficacy of Paxlovid was greater in participants either : aged 65 or older, with high viral load (which might be a predictor of more severe disease) , seronegative. On that last aspect, the results in th e mITT and mITT1 populations included both seropositive and seronegative patients, with a nearly 50/50 mix. In the mITT1 set, hospitali sation or death from any cause in patients with negative serology was 1.4% in the Paxlovid group (7/487) and 11.5% in the placebo group (58/505), that is an absolute difference of more than 10% (p < 0.0001). In patients with positive serology it was 0.19% (1/540) in the Paxlovid group and 1.5% (8/528) in the placebo group. The absolute risk reduction was therefore much lower , at 1.3%, but remained significant (p = 0.018). Since it is not reasonably possible to determine serostatus before drug prescription for an oral drug (and a positive serology might not be an absolute marker of protection against the disease, depending on the level of antibodies as well as the changing SARS -CoV-2 variant landscape) , this is not considered an issue. The applicant is currently conducting additional studies that should provide more data on treatment benefit in the seropositive population ( from vaccination or previous infection). SwissPAR 16 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Results from various sensitivity analys es were consistent with the primary analysis , including when participants who were lost to follow up before Day 21 were hypothetically assumed to have experienced both COVID -19-related hospitali sation and death. Other key secondary efficacy analyses indic ated that Paxlovid- treated patients stayed fewer days in hospital than thos e treated with placebo (0.09 vs 0.75 days) . In addition, no participants in the Paxlovid group were treated in the ICU. The number of medical visits through to D ay 28 was also significantly lower in the Paxlovid group, with a four -fold reduction in comparison to placebo (81 vs 22). In addition, the proportion of participants who achieved sustained alleviation or resolution of all targeted signs and symptoms through to Day 28 was higher in the Paxlovid group ( approx . 8%) with median time to resolution also significantly shorter ( approx . 2-3 days). Clinical efficacy correlated with a faster decline in viral load in Paxlovid- treated patients. The initial median baseline viral load was 6.3 log 10 cp/ml and 5.9 log 10 cp/ml in the mITT and mITT1 populations, respectively. At Day 5, in comparison to placebo, the viral load in the Paxlovid group was 0.90 log 10 and 0.74 log 10 lower in the mITT and mITT1 sets, respectively (p < 0.001). The evolution in viral load was similar between non -immunosuppressed and immunosuppressed patients, but this latter group included very few patients. The applicant mentioned that it is exploring conduct ing a Phase 2 trial to collect additional virological and efficacy data in immunocompromised patients. The main SARS- CoV-2 variant during the EPIC -HR study was Delta (>98%), which is congruent with the study period (July 2021- December 2021). Since the target of Paxlovid (3C rotease) is conserved across all SARS -CoV-2 variants known thus far, Paxlovid is expected to maintain efficacy against the current Omicron variant. This was confirmed by in vitro data, with cell -based assays (viability and RT -qPCR viral load measurement) i ndicating that the EC 50 values of nirmatrelvir against the original, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda, Mu and Omicron variant s were similar. Current work by the applicant is aimed at characteri sing the potential emergence of nirmatrelvir resistance mutat ions, typically in samples from patients who experienced treatment failure. I n vitro assays have indicated that some naturally occurring mutations in the protease (e.g. S144A, Q189K, E166A) are associated with significantly reduced nirmat relvir activity. Q 189K was found in 7 Paxlovid and 7 placebo patients ; S144A and E166A occurred once each in Paxlovid- treated patients. As of now, no significant associations were identified between viral baseline protease mutations or treatment -emergent mutations and treat ment failure. Overall, surveillance data is very preliminary and active monitoring of treatment -emerg ent mutations will be of paramount importance. 6.4 Safety The s afety assessment of Paxlovid is primarily based on the final analysis of the pivotal study EPIC - HR at the data cut -off date of 11 December 2021. 2224 participants who received at least one dose of either Paxlovid (n=1109) or placebo (n=1115) were included in the safety analysis set , and 2102 (93.6%) participants had completed the safety follow -up at Day 34. The overall demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients in the safety analysis set were similar in both arms. The proportion of participants who discontinued the treatment phase was similar between treatment groups (6.0% and 7.7% in the Paxlovid and p lacebo groups, respectively) , and a total of 1053 subjects in the Paxlovid group and 1039 subjects in the p lacebo group completed the study. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between groups: 22.6% in the Paxlovid arm and 23.9% in the placebo arm. Most all -cause TEAEs in both treatment groups were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity and essentially related to the COVID -19 disease itself. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were less reported in the Paxlovid group (4.1%) than in the placebo group (8.3%). In the Paxlovid group, a total of 34 (3.1%) subjects experienced a Grade 3 AE and 11 (1.0%) had Grade 4 events. The majority of the Grade 3- 4 events were reported in the SOCs i nvestigations (creatinine renal clearance decreased, D -dimer increased) Infect ions and infestations (COVID -19, Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 pneumonia, abscess, pyelonephritis, sepsis/viral sepsis). Fewer participants discontinued the treatment phase due to an AE in the Paxlovid group (2.1%) than in the placebo group (4.2%). Adverse events 1% (all grades regardless of causality) that occurred in the Paxlovid group at a greater frequency than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (5.6% vs <1%, and vomiting (1.1% vs <1%). These were mostly Grade 1 -2. There were 5 (0.4%) cases of Grade 3 TEAEs in the Paxlovid group: 1 case of palpitations, 2 cases of increase in transaminases, 1 case of dysgeusia and 1 case of maculo- papular rash. The AEs leading to drug treatment discontinuation were more frequently reported in the placebo arm than in the Paxlovid arm (4.2% and 2.1%, respectively). The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation with Paxlovid treatment were nausea (0.5%), vomiting (0.4%) and creatinine renal clearance decreased (0.3%). It is notable that hypertension occurred at a low frequency overall but was more frequent in the Paxlovid group (0.6% vs 0.2% in the placebo group ). Of the 7 cases, 6 were low grade and 6 had an event onset between Day 2 and Day 5. One patient had Grade 3 hypertension on Day 5 that did not resolve. The narratives have been reviewed and show that except for 1 SAE of Grade 4 hypertensive crisis (assessed as not related to study intervention by the Investigator in a patient known for chronic arterial hypertension), increases in blood pressure were small. No cases of hypertension w ere considered as related to Paxlovid by the Sponsor. Due to the limited number of cases, a causal relationship with Paxlovid cannot be concluded at this stage. The applicant has planned to conduct a global safety review of this aspect in its 3 sponsored clinical studies (EPIC -HR, EPIC- SR, EPIC -PEP). Serious adverse events were reported in a lower proportion of subjects in the Paxlovid group (1.6%) in comparison to the placebo group (6.6%). The SAEs were mostly related to COVID -19, and the most frequently reported were COVID -19 pneumonia, COVID -19 and creatinine renal clearance decreased. These occurred less frequently in the Paxlovid group in comparison to the placebo group (0.5% vs 3.3%, 0.2% vs 0.7% and 0.2% vs 0.3% , respectively). There were 13 deaths among participants in this study, all of which occurred in the placebo group. There were no specific laboratory test abnormalities during the first 34 d ays in the Paxlovid group. No in-depth QTc study was performed , but ECG s collected in the EPIC -HR study were similar between the Paxlovid and placebo groups. Overall, based on the safety data provided, no major safety concern was identified for Paxlovid. Dysgeusia and diarrho ea were significantly more elevated in the Paxlovid arm, but these were essentially low grade and self -limited. Hypertension events warrants surveillance. Since subjects with active liver disease or severely impaired kidney function were excluded from the study, no conclusions regarding safety in these groups can be drawn. In addition, the applicant does not recommend Paxlovid during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception. 6.5 Final Clinical and Clinical Pharmacology Benefit Risk Assessment The main option to prevent severe outcomes in COVID -19 is vaccination. Unvaccinated subjects or patients who did not respond adequately to vaccination are therefore inadequately protected. Currently, various monoclonal antibodies aimed at neutrali sing SARS -CoV-2 have been developed to prevent a severe course of disease in patients with risk factors. However, depending on the targeted epitope on the Spike protein, their efficacy can be impaired or nullified against some VOCs. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies are intravenous treatments that require complex logistics. There is a need for oral COVID- 19 drugs that are simpler to administer and have alternative mechanisms of action. Beneficial effects and respective uncertainties SwissPAR 18 / 21 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Paxlovid can be administered independently of food. The effect of food on Nirmatrelvir PK in combination with RTV was investigated for a suspension only. No respective PK data are available for the proposed commercial 150 mg tablet, but Paxlovid was administered independently of food in the pivotal efficacy study. The available data indicate that the addition of Nirmatrelvir does not appear to enhance the interaction potential of ritonavir, i.e. the combination is not worse in that respect than ritonavir alone. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, no dose adjustments are required for patient s with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The final report of the respective clinical pharmacology study is not yet available. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, no dose adjustments for patients with mild renal impairment are required. At least 81% of the patients had observed Nirmatrelvir C12h concentrations IC90 with the proposed dosing regimen. In a single pivotal P hase II/III study in non -hospitalised symptomatic adults with COVID -19 at increased risk of progressing to severe illness, Paxlovid significantly reduced the proportion of COVID -19-related hospitalisations or deaths from any cause at Day 28. In the final analysis, results of the primary endpoint (treatment with Paxlovid within 3 days of symptoms, mITT) show a 5.8% absolute reduction in comparison to placebo (6.5% vs 0.7%), that is a relative risk reduction of 88.9%. Results from a key secondary analysis (patients treated within 5 days of symptoms, mITT1) were supportive. Furthermore, no patients died in the Paxlovid treatment group wher eas 13 deaths occurred in the placebo group. Clinical efficacy was shown among all pre- specified subgroups, including (albeit at a reduced rate) in seropositive patients. Vaccinated patients were excluded from the study , and Paxlovid efficacy in this popul ation is as yet unknown. Since immunocompromised patients were essentially not represented in the study, no conclusion can also be drawn for this group. In its response to the preliminary decision, the applicant stated that it will conduct a Phase 2 study to investigate Paxlovid in non - hospitali sed immunocompromised symptomatic COVID -19 patients and estimates availability of the clinical study report at the end of 2023. The EPIC -HR study was performed during the SARS -CoV-2 Delta wave and nearly all patient s were infected with this VOC. The efficacy of Paxlovid against the VOC Omicron is not established, but genomic analyses do not indicate potential resistance mutations in its protease gene, and in vitro data are reassuring. Monitoring of potential treatment -emergent mutations and activity against potential new variants will be performed by the applicant. Unfavourable effects and respective uncertainties The co- administration of ritonavir is necessary to achieve therapeutic Nirmatrelvir exposures. The downside is the substantial but well -known interaction potential of ritonavir. This is appropriately addressed in the I nformation for healthcare professional s, but a clear layout (e.g. boxed warning) is required, in particular because Paxlovid will be prescribed by healthcare providers possibly not familiar with ritonavir's interactions. Furthermore, the low ritonavir dose and the short treatment duration of 5 days attenuate the DDI risk associated with Paxlovid treatment. No PK data in subjects with severe hepatic impairment are available. Dose adjustments for patients with moderate renal impairment are required. Currently, Paxlovid should not be used in pati ents with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease. As a full popPK analysis including the available patient data has not yet been completed, no quantitative information regarding the impact of demographic factors such as age, body weight, and race, etc. on Nirmatrelvir PK is available. SwissPAR 19 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 The effect of Nirmatrelvir on QTc is unknown. Safety data do not yield major concerns. Overall, adverse events were less frequently reported for Paxlovid than for placebo and the majority were low grade and self -limiting. The incidence of dysgeusia and diarrho ea were significantly increased in the Paxlovid group, but were also of low grade and therefore do not raise concerns regarding premature interruptio n of treatment by patients. There is a slight concern regarding increased hypertension events, even though most events were low grade. Non- clinical and clinical data do not suggest a risk of QTc prolongation with Paxlovid, but QTc prolongation has not been fully evaluated in humans. There are no data regarding the use of Paxlovid in pregnant women. Paxlovid is a cytochrome inhibitor, in particular of CYP3A. Therefore, the plasma levels of other drugs metaboli sed t hrough the cytochrome route can be altered when co -administered with Paxlovid. On the other hand, drugs taken by the patient that are inducers of CYP3A may cause large decreases in Paxlovid levels and alter its efficacy. Assessment of drug- drug interactions is therefore of paramount importance. Benefit -risk balance The main concerns from a clinical pharmacology point of view are the potential interactions of Paxlovid, which is addressed in the Information for healthcare professionals . The currently missing data (above all the popPK analysis, including patient data will be submitted as soon as available. The clinical efficacy in the study population and the low safety concern indicates a positive benefit -risk assessment for Paxlovid for t he proposed indication.

Indications/Uses Paxlovid is indicated for the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) in adult s who do not require oxygen therapy or hospitalisation due to COVID -19, and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID -19 (see \u00abClinical efficacy \u00bb). Paxlovid is not intended as a replacement for vaccination against COVID -19. Paxlovid should be used in accordance with official recommendations and in consideration of local epidemiological data about circulating SARS -CoV-2 variants. -07321332 tablets co -packaged with ritonavir tablets. The daily blister contains two separated parts each containing two tablets of PF- 07321332 and one tablet of ritonavir corresponding to the daily administration at the standard dose. Usual dosage The recommended dosage is 300 mg PF -07321332 (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) all taken together orally every 12 hours for 5 days. Paxlovid should be administered as soon as possible after a positive viral test for SARS- CoV-2 (see \u00abProperties/Effects \u00bb). A test using the nucleic acid amplification technique (NAAT) is preferred for confirmation of COVID -19. At the discretion of the treating physician completion of the full 5 -day treatment course is recommended even if the patient requires hospitali sation due to severe or critical COVID -19 after starting treatment with Paxlovid. Information for healthcare professionals 3 / 31 Missed doses If the patient misses a dose of Paxlovid within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose. Special dosage instructions Patients with hepatic disorders No dosage adjustment of Paxlovid is needed for patients with either mild (Child- Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child- Pugh Clas s B) hepatic impairment. Paxlovid should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \u00abWarnings and Precautions \u00bb and \u00abPharmacokinetics \u00bb). Patients with renal disorders No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60- <90 ml/min) . In patients with moderate renal (eGFR 30- <60 ml/min) , the dose of Paxlovid should be reduced to PF -07321332/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days to avoid over -exposure (this dose adjustment has not been clinically tested) . Special attention for patients with moderate renal impairment The daily blister contains two separated parts each containing two tablets of PF- 07321332 and one tablet of ritonavir corresponding to the daily administration at the standard dose. Therefore, patients with moderate renal impairment should be alerted on the fact that only one tablet of PF -07321332 with the tablet of ritonavir should be taken every 12 hours . Paxlovid should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment [ eGFR <30 ml/min, including patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis ] (see \u00abWarnings and Precautions \u00bb and \u00abPharmacokinetics \u00bb). Children and adolescents The safety and efficacy of Paxlovid in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available. Information for healthcare professionals 4 / 31 Patients with other underlying disorders Concomitant therapy with ritonavir - or cobicistat -containing regimen No dose adjustment of Paxlovid is needed. Patients receiving ritonavir - or cobicistat -containing therapy (e.g. for HIV treatment) should continue their treatment as indicated. Mode of administration For oral use. PF-07321332 must be co- administered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly co- administer PF -07321332 with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of this active substance that will be insufficient to achieve the desired therapeut ic effect. Paxlovid can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed, as no data is currently available. Contraindications Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life- threatening reactions . Medicinal products that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced PF- 07321332/ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. Paxlovid cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medicinal products due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer (see \u00abInteractions \u00bb). Medicinal products listed below are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible medicinal products that are contraindicated with Antibiotics: and triazolam * not approved in Switzerland Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in \u00ab Composition\u00bb . Warnings and precautions Risk of serious adverse reactions due to interactions with other medicinal products Initiation of Paxlovid , a CYP3A inhibitor, in pat ients receiving medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A or initiation of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A in patients already receiving Paxlovid , may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A. Initiation of medicinal products that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of Paxlovid , respectively. These interactions may lead to: - Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life- threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicinal products. - Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of Paxlovid . - Loss of therapeutic effect of Paxlovid and possible development of viral resistance. Table 1 lists drugs that are contraindicated or lead to significant interactions when used concomitantly with PF -07321332/ritonavir (see Interactions) . The duration of the period of risk of interaction is not exactly known. Potential for interactions should be considered with other me dicinal products prior to, during and after Paxlovid therapy; concomitant medicinal products should be Information for healthcare professionals 6 / 31 reviewed during Paxlovid therapy , and the patient should be monitor ed for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medicinal products. Severe renal impairment No clinical data are available in patients with severe renal impairment (including patients with ESRD ). Based on pharmacokinetic data (see \u00ab Pharmacokinetics \u00bb), the use of Paxlovid in patient s with severe renal impairment could lead to over -exposure with potential toxicity. No recommendation in terms of dose adjustment could be elaborated at this stage pending dedicated investigation. Therefore, Paxlovid should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min, inc luding patients with ESRD under haemodialysis ). Severe hepatic impairment No pharmacokinetic and clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, Paxlovid should not be used in patient s with severe hepatic impairment . Hepatotoxicity Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Paxlovid to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities or hepatitis. Risk of HIV -1 resistance development Because PF-07321332 is co-administered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV -1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV -1 infec tion. Excipients of tablets contain the excipient lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of total lactase defic iency or glucose- product . PF-07321332 and ritonavir film -coated tablets each contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. , they are almost \u00absodium -free\u00bb . Information for healthcare professionals 7 / 31 Interactions Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ritonavir) is a CYP3A inhibitor and may increase plasma concentration of drugs metabolized primarily via CYP3A . Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 as well as an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and the drug transporter p -glycoprotein (P -gp). Ritonavir also exhibits strong affinity for CYP2C9. Because of these properties, the drug has significant interaction potential and it is not possible to list all potential interaction partners by name here. In case of concomitant use of other medicinal products, therefore, it is always advisable to refer to their professional information in order to obtain information on their metabolization pathways and potential interactions as well as on the resulting possible risks and any dose adjust ments (or other measures) that may be required. Effects of Paxlovid on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ritonavir) is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that are extensively metabolised by CYP3A and have high first -pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when co- administered with PF -07321332/ritonavir. Thus, coadministration of PF -07321332/ritonavir with medicinal products highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life- threatening events is contraindicated (see Table 1). PF-07321332 reversibly inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, or CYP1A2 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro study results showed PF- 07321332 may be inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. The clinical relevance is unknown. Based on in -vitro data, PF-07321332 has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, MATE2K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B3 and OCT2. to inhibit MDR1, MATE1, OCT1 and OATP1B1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Ritonavir a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may ranked order: CYP3A4 >CYP2D6. Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P - glycoprotein (P-gp) and may inhibit this transporter. Ritonavir may induce and oxidation by C YP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could dec rease or shorten their therapeutic effect. Coadministration of other CYP3A4 substrates that may lead to potentially significant interaction (see Table 1) should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Information for healthcare professionals 8 / 31 As a conservative measure, the drug-drug interactions pertaining to ritonavir used in chronic HIV infection (600 mg BID when originally used as an antiretroviral agent and 100 mg BID as currently used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with antiretroviral agents), should apply for Paxlovid. Future investigations m ay enable to adjust the recommendations related to drug- drug interactions to the 5 days treatment duration of Paxlovid. Medicinal products listed in Table 1 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible medicinal products that are contraindicated or may interact with PF -07321332/ritonavir and should be used with caution. Table 1: Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Medicinal product class Medicinal product within class (AUC change, C max change) Clinical comments 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist Alfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of alfuzosin may lead to severe hypotension and is therefore contraindicated ( see \u00abContraindications\u00bb) . Amphetamine derivatives Amphetamine Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of amphetamine and its derivatives. Careful monitoring of adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are plasma levels of buprenorphine and its active metabolite did not lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic changes in a population of opioid tolerant patients.

Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggests a possi ble 3 -4-fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If Paxlovid is co- administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in c ase of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Ritonavir coadministration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of triazolam and is therefore contraindicated (see \u00abContraindications\u00bb) . The use of pethidine and ritonavir is contraindicated due to the increased concentrations of the metabolite, norpethidine, which has both analgesic and CNS stimulant activity. Elevated norpethidine concentrations may increase the risk of CNS effects (e.g., seizures) (see \u00abContraindications\u00bb).

These effects are thought to represent induction of bupropion metabolism. However, because ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro , the recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. In contrast to long- term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant interaction with bupropion after short -term administration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reductions i n bupropion concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of ritonavir coadministration. and adrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86%) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; similar effect s could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised by CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone. Consequently, concomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period. Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhib its CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of dexamethasone. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when dexamethasone is concomitantly administered with ritonavir.

Overdose Treatment of overdose with Paxlovid should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with Paxlovid . Properties/Ef fects ATC code J05 (not assigned) Mechanism of action PF-07321332 is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS- renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein precursors which leads to the prevention of viral replication. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A -mediated metabolism of PF -07321332, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of PF- 07321332. Antiviral activ ity PF-07321332 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS -CoV-2 infection of dNHBE cells, a primary human lung alveolar epithelial cell line ( EC 50 value of 61.8 nM and EC 90 value of 181 nM) after 3 days of drug exposure . PF-07321332 had cell culture antiviral activity ( with EC 50 values in the low nanomolar range 3 -fold relative to USA -WA1/2020) against SARS -CoV-2 isolates belonging to the Alpha (B.1.1.7), (P.1), The Beta (B.1.351) variant was the least susceptible tested variant with approximately 3.3-fold reduced susceptibility relative to the USA -WA1/2020 isolate. Resistance SARS- CoV-2 resistance assays are ongoing. Phenotypic assessments were conducted to characterize the impact of naturally occurring SARS- CoV-2 Mpro polymorphisms on the activity of PF-07321332 in a biochemical assay using recombinant Mpro enzyme. The clinical significance of these polymorphisms is unknown, and it is Information for healthcare professionals 24 / 31 also unknown if results from the biochemical assay are predictive of antiviral activity in cell culture. The following Mpro amino acid substitutions were associated with reduced PF-07321332 activity higher (3.7- fold). G15S is present in the Lambda variant, which did not have reduced suscepti bility to PF -07321332 (relative to USA -WA1/2020) in cell culture. In addition, three SARS -CoV-2 Mpro amino acid positions where polymorphisms have not been naturally observed were evaluated by substituting alanine at these positions and assessing their impact on activity in biochemical assays. These Mpro amino acid substitutions were associated with reduced PF-07321332 activity (i.e., higher K significance of substitutions at these Mpro positions is unknown. Cell culture resistance selection studies with PF -07321332 using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a betacoronavirus used as a surrogate) resulted in the emergence of Mpro amino acid substitutions: P15A, T50K, in Mpro was PF -07321332 susceptibility (~4 - to 5-fold higher EC 50 values). These positions correspond to E55 and S144 in SARS -CoV-2 Mpro, respectively. E55L alone not affect PF SARS activity by 91.9 -fold (based on K i value). The clinical relevance of these changes is not known. Among subjects in clinical trial EPIC -HR with sequence analysis data available at both baseline and post-dose sample (n=361 Mpro cleavage site amino acid changes were detected as treatment -emergent substitutions that were more common in PF -07321332/ritonavir -treated to placebo- treated gene or cleavage regions occurred in PAXLOVID -treated participants who also experienced hospitalization. Thus, the clinical significance of these substitutions is unknown. In a biochemical assay, the activity (K i fold-change 1, <1, and ~2, respectively). The potential phenotypic effect on PF- 07321332 susceptibility for the other substitutions is unknown. Information for healthcare professionals 25 / 31 Pharmacodynamics No informati on provided. Clinical efficacy The efficacy of Paxlovid is based on the interim analysis and the supporting final analysis of EPIC - HR, a Phase 2/3, randomised, double- blind, placebo- controlled study in non- hospitalised symptomatic adult participants with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 infection. Eligible participants were 18 years of age and older with at least one of the following risk factors for progression to severe disease: diabetes, ov erweight (BMI >25), chronic lung disease (including asthma), chronic kidney disease, current smoker, immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, active c ancer, medically -related technological dependence, or were 60 years of age and older regardless of comorbidities. Participants with COVID -19 symptom onset of 5 days were included in the study. The study excluded individuals with a history of prior COVID -19 infection or vaccination. Participants were randomi sed (1:1) to receive Paxlovid (PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with COVID -19 related hos pitalisation or death from any cause through Day 28.

A total of 2246 participants were randomised to receive either Paxlovid or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 46 years with 13% of participants 65 years of age and older (3% were 75 years of age and older) ; 51% were male; 72% were White, 5% were Black, and 14% were Asian ; 45% were Hispanic or Latino; 66% of participants had onset of symptoms 3 days from initiation of study treatment ; 81% had a BMI > 25 kg/m2 diabetes mel litus; less than 1% of the study population had immune deficiency, 47% of participants were serological negative at baseline and 51% were serological positive . The mean (SD) baseline viral load was 4.63 log 10 copies/ml (2.87); 26 % of participants had a bas eline viral load of >107 (copies/ml ); 6.2% of participants either received or were expected to receive COVID -19 therapeutic mAb treatment at the time of randomisation and were Information for healthcare professionals 26 / 31 excluded from the m ITT and mITT1 analyses. The primary SARS -CoV-2 variant across both treatment arms was Delta ( >98%), mostly clade 21J (based on interim analysis) . The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the Paxlovid and placebo groups. The determination of prim ary efficacy was based on a planned interim analysis of 774 subjects in mITT population. The estimated risk reduction was - 6.3% with unadjusted 95% CI of ( ( -10.61%, -2.02%) when adjusting for multiplicity. The 2- sided p- value was <0.0001 with 2 -sided significance level of 0.002. Table 4 provides results of the primary endpoint in the mITT1 analysis population for the full data set at final study completion.

The estimated cumulative proportion of participants hospitalised or death by Day 28 was calculated for each treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method, where subjects without hospitalisation and death status through Day 28 were censored at the time of study discontinuation. The estimated ri sk reduction was -5.8% with 95% CI of ( -7.8%, -3.8%) in participants dosed within 3 days of symptom onset, and - 5.2% with 95% CI of ( subset of participants dosed >3 days from symptom onset. Consistent results were observed in the final mITT and mITT2 analysis populations. A total of 1379 subjects were included in the mITT analysis population. The event rates were 5/697 (0.72%) in the Paxlovid group, and 44/682 (6.45 %) in the placebo group. Results from subgroup analyses were consistent with those in the overall population regardless of baseline serology status (Table 5).

Efficacy results for mITT1 were consistent across subgroups of participants including age (65 years) and BMI (BMI >25 and BMI >30) and diabetes. Temporary authorisation The medicinal product Paxlovid has been granted temporary authorisation as the clinical data was incomplete at the time the authorisation application was assessed (Art. 9a TPA). The temporar y authorisation is contingent on the timely fulfilment of conditions. After they have been met, the temporary authorisation can be transformed into an ordinary authorisation. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of PF- 07321332/ritonavir have been studi in healthy participants. Ritonavir is administered with PF -07321332 as a pharmacokinetic enhancer resulting in higher systemic of PF -07321332. Upon repeat -dose of PF- 07321332/ritonavir 75 mg/100 mg, and 500 mg/100 mg admi nistered twice daily, the increase in systemic exposure at steady -state is less than dose proportional. Multiple dosing over 10 days achieved steady -state on Day 2 with approximately 2- fold accumulation. Systemic exposures on Day 5 were similar to Day 10 across all doses. Absorption Following oral administration of PF -07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg after a single dose, the geometric mean PF -07321332 C max and AUC inf was 2.21 \u00b5g/ml and 23.01 \u00b5g*h/ml, respectively. The median time to C max (Tmax) was 3.00 h. Information for healthcare professionals 28 / 31 Following oral administration of PF- 07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg after a single dose, the geometric mean ritonavir C max and AUC inf was 0.36 \u00b5g/ml and 3.60 \u00b5g*h/ ml, respectively. The median time to C max (Tmax) was 3.98 h. Effect of food on o ral absorption Dosing with a high fat meal modestly increased the exposure of PF- 07321332 (approximately 15% increase in mean C max and 1.6% increase in mean AUC last) relative t o fasting conditions following administration of a suspension formulation of PF -07321332 c o-admin istered with ritonavir tablets. Distribution The protein binding of PF- 07321332 in human plasma is approximately 69%. The protein binding of ritonavir in hu man plasma is approximately 98- 99%. Metabolism In vitro studies assessing PF -07321332 without concomitant ritonavir suggest that PF- 07321332 sed by CYP3A4. Administration of 07321332 with ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of PF- 07321332. In plasma, the only medicinal product -related ent ity observed following concomitant administration with ritonavir was unchanged PF- 07321332. In vitro studies utilising microsomes have that cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is the major isoform involved in ritonavir metabolism, although CYP2D6 also contributes to the formation of oxidation metabolite M -2. Elimination The primary route of elimination of PF -07321332 when administered with ritonavir was renal excretion of intact medicinal product . Approximately 49.6% and 35.3% of the administered dose of PF- 07321332 300 mg was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. PF -07321332 was the predominant drug -related entity with small amounts of metabolites arising from hydrolysis reactions in excreta . Following oral administration of a single dose of PF -07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg the arithmetic mean terminal elimination half -life of PF -07321332 was 6.1 h. Human studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was primarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, part of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir. Following oral administration of a single dose of PF -07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg the arithmetic mean terminal elimination half -life of ritonavir was 6.1 h. Information for healthcare professionals 29 / 31 Kinetics in specific patient groups The pharmacokinetics of PF- 07321332/ritonavir based on age and gender have not been evaluated. Hepatic impairment Compared to healthy controls with no hepatic impairment, the PK of PF- 07321332 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was not significantly different. Adjusted geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC inf and Cmax of PF- 07321332 comparing moderate hepatic to 138.12%) and 101.96% (74.20%, 140.11%), respectively. PF-07321332/ritonavir has been studied in patients with severe hepatic im pairment. Renal impairment Compared to healthy controls with no renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir in participants with mildrenal impairment were not significantly different. However, in the moderately and severely impaired participant s the ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for (237.6%, 390.21%), respectively compared to the healthy control group Children and adolescents The pharmacokinetics of PF -07321332/rit onavir in paediatric patients have not been evaluated. Ethnical origin Systemic exposure in Japanese participants was numerically lower but not clinically meaningfully different than those in Western participants. Preclinical data No nonclinical safety studies have been conducted with PF- 07321332 in combination with ritonavir . Repeated dose toxicity Studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed no risk due to PF- 07321332. Repeat -dose toxicity studies of ritonavir in animals identified ma jor target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid gland , and kidney. Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were accompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes. Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir but have not been seen in dogs. Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary to phospholipidosis. However, clinical trials revealed no evidence o f medicinal product -induced ocular changes in humans. All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation Information for healthcare professionals 30 / 31 of ritonavir. Clinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function tests. Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted in rats and are considered to be attributable to species -specific spontaneous disease. Furthermore, no clinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials. Genot oxicity Studies of genotoxicity revealed no r isk due to PF -07321332. Genotoxicity studies revealed no risk due to ritonavir. Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with PF -07321332. Long- term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumor igenic potential specific for these species but are regarded as of no relevance for humans. Reproductive toxicity PF-07321332 No adverse effects were observed in fertility and embryo -foetal development studies in rats. A study in pregnant rabbits showed an adverse decrease in foetal body weight, in the absence of significant maternal toxicity. Systemic exposure (AUC 24) in rabbits at the maximum dose without adverse effect in foetal body weight was estimated to be app roximately 3 times higher than exposure in humans at recommended therapeutic dose of Paxlovid. Ritonavir Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats. Developmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and ossifi cation delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a maternally toxic dosage. Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and decreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dosage. Other information Incom patibilities Not applicable.
