[Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet). Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert, expressed enthusiasm at [Pfizer's announcement](https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-success-plans-for-emergency-approval-fda-2020-9?r=US&IR=T) that its coronavirus vaccine [was found to be more than 90% effective](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/four-reasons-for-encouragement-based-on-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-results/) in its final stage of clinical trials.
