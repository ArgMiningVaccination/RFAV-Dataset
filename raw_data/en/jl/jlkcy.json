[Transcript] To begin - Find a comfortable position either sitting or lying down. Make sure your spine is tall and straight. No twists or kinks. The more space you can create in your body the more easily the energy will be able to flow. Close your eyes. Soften your jaw. Relax your body. Start to focus on your breathing When you breath - feel the breath move through you - softening you - relaxing you. Become still. On your next inhale turn your hands over so that your palms are facing up. A symbol or a sign that you are ready to receive whatever is meant to come your way in todays practice. Tuck your chin slightly, relax your shoulders and allow yourself to relax a little deeper. Choose to open your mind and your heart. Begin to deepen your breath As you bring more loving awareness to the rhythm of your own breath. Allow yourself to become an observer in this moment. Become more present to this moment. Gently lift your heart - and together let's take a deep breath in. Together a long breath out. Inhale in. And in your own time exhale out. Observing your experience - in the here and now. Allow the outer layer of yourself. The busy outside layer - the chatter of the mind, the hold of the ego, the stress and worries of the day - the fear of not being good enough - allow it all to just soften and melt away. Get quiet. Feel the stillness arise within. Inhaling deeply. Exhaling completely I want you to visual your energy and your aura. Visualise it around your body - it is like a bubble of energy around you. It can be any colour. Allow the bubble of energy to expand. It is now filling the room. Allow it to expand even further. Filling your house. Filling your street, your city, your country. Expanding further and further around the globe, the moon, the stars, the planets, the sun and then continuing out into the universe. As it continues to expand and grow, it connects to everything. As your field of energy continues to expand and grow you are becoming one with all that is. You are plugged in and in sync with the universal energy. I will now call on the divine energy of source, the creator. You may have another name for it. What we call it is irrelevant - what matters is that we choose to tune in and connect with it. The energy of source, the creator is now streaming down. A beautiful golden light is streaming down on you. You are safe, protected and loved. On your next inhale visualise the crown of your head gently opening up . The golden light is now streaming into the top of your head and down through your body - Starting at the crown chakra, down to the throat, heart, belly, thighs, knees, feet and toes. Now down your arms, wrists, hands and fingers. The energy feels warm, nourishing and safe. You feel energised and light. The golden light now flows into all the cells of your body. Illuminating your entire body. As the beautiful golden light of source fills your body it also radiates down into the earth below you. It goes deeper and deeper into the earth below you, streaming down to the core of planet Earth. Gently streaming down layer by layer. This beautiful golden light then anchors itself to the core of the planet. Hugging the core of the planet. Anchoring itself in place by growing roots like a tree. Reconnecting with your breathe. You feel grounded, you feel safe and you feel anchored in this moment. I will now call on the beautiful healing energy of Mother Nature to rise up from the core of the earth. Layer by layer her silver light gently rises to the surface - towards you. She is the healer of all life; her essence can be felt through the plant and animal kingdom. On your next inhale she is going to gently flow into your body - from the ground up. Inhaling deeply - visualise Your body being flooded by her silver energy - from your head, chest, heart, and you're your arms. Her silver energy continues to flow down your belly, hips, thighs and feet. You are feeling more relaxed, grounded and at peace. In your own time take a big deep breath in. As you inhale your entire being is being hugged by both the golden energy of source the creator and the silver energy of Mother Nature. You are protected, safe and not alone. Whenever you need guidance or support call on these beautiful energies - they are available to you at all times. Now that you are grounded and supported - You are going to use your breathe to cleanse and purify your energy. You are going to cleanse the mind and body from negativity, toxicity and anything else that no longer serves you. Cleansing the link that connects you with the universal energy. As your energy gets cleansed your energetic vibration will raise - and as a result you will be able to communicate with the universe with more clarity and positivity. Begin by breathing into your heart. Allowing the breath to soften any armour you may have put up around your heart in order to protect it. Breathing deeply feel your heart soften and open. Inhaling - bringing in all that goodness, nourishment and light into the heart. Exhaling getting rid of anything that makes you feels heavy and worn down. Breathe in peace and love Exhale negativity and limiting beliefs Breathe in self-acceptance Let go all that no longer serves you. Now bring your awareness to your body. Allow your breathe to gently and slowly float down your body from your head to your toes. Allow the breath to soften any stiffness, pain or illness in the body. Breathing deeply feel your body soften and open. Inhaling - breathe in nourishment and light into the body. Imagine every cell of your body getting plumper as they are filled up with goodness. Oxygen and Nutrients are feeding every cell of your body. Your cells are healing and repairing. Exhaling getting rid of anything that is toxic in your cells and in your body. Breathe in wellness and vitality Exhale inflammation, illness and pain. Breathe in light. Let go of all toxicity in the body. Visualise your body renewing and healing with each breath you take. Inhale deeply Exhale completely. Tell yourself I am at peace I have nothing to fear I am well I am enough I am supported I believe in infinite possibilities I have the power to heal myself I am whole Breathing in. Allow these words to seep into every cell of your body. Accept these words as your truth. Take a few quiet moments here, to feel your own radiance. You feel lighter and more at ease. Return your awareness to your breath. Let each breathe wash away any negative energy you may have left in your mind or body. Each breath heals and renews you. Know that today's healing and cleansing has come from you. You hold this power within. And anytime you need to continue your work in healing or cleansing you can come back to this safe space at any time. Take 3 deep cleansing breaths. Breathing in thru the nose and sighing out through the mouth Begin to awaken your body and bring your awareness to the room around you. Notice how your body feels in all the points it meets the floor. The sounds that surround you. Begin to wiggle fingers and toes to slowly reawaken. Maybe take a gentle shoulder roll or slowly stretch your arms above your head. When you are ready open your eyes. Thank you so much for joining me. "}
