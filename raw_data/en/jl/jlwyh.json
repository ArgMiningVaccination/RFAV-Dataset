In addition, the Annual Performance Plan comprehensively responds to the priorities identified by Cabinet of 6th administration of democratic South Africa, which are embodied in the Medium- Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) for period 2019-2024. Over the next five years SAHPRA is structured to support delivery on the National Development Plan (NDP): Vision 2030; the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which builds on the work started under the Millennium Development Goals; the National Health Insurance which lays the foundation for moving South Africa towards universal access to quality health care services in accordance with section 27 of the Constitution. The Annual Performance Plan is also aligned to the Presidential Health Compact (2019), towards achieving social justice; through enabling access to affordable good quality, safe and efficacious medicines and medical devices. SAHPRA was recently established as a schedule 3A public entity, however the Board places high on its agenda SAHPRA's proper alignment to achieve the requisite social and economic impact, which is the primary reason for its existence. The Ministry of Health therefore commits itself to providing the necessary support to accelerate performance towards the achievement of the ultimate goals of MTSF, NDP, SDGs and the Presidential Health Compact; as SAHPRA claims its rightful place as one of the leading regulators in the continent and globally. I wish the Board and management well as they work shoulder to shoulder in pursuit of the fulfillment of these national aspirations. ____________________________ Dr Zwelini Mkhize. MP Executive Authority, Minister of Health ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 20216 7 PREFACE u BY THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD A compact and well-articulated legislative and policy environment is arguably a pivotal pillar and instrument for any regulator to give effect to the critical role that SAHPRA is mandated to fulfill. Nowhere was that more evident than during the first full financial year of operating as SAHPRA, emerging out of the erstwhile Medicines Control Council. SAHPRA operates in a complex legislative environment that straddles multiple areas and players. This amplifies a need for robust stakeholder engagement. Assuming an extended mandate that incorporates medical devices and radiation control in addition to an older mandate necessitated a close scrutiny of development in the policy environment. Some of these developments have significant socio-economic implications; most notably, being in the area of cannabis pursuant to its new dynamics following the Constitutional Court Judgement in September 2018. This has spurred enormous commercial debates and interests and has placed some urgent regulatory considerations on the doorstep of SAHPRA. The Board has encouraged SAHPRA's direct engagement in the public discourse on these matters at all possible levels of the organization so as to work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to shape policy. Another notable development is the advent of Presidential Health Summit Compact which also has policy implications for SAHPRA. Collectively, these developments require policies that are both industry-wide and those that are localised to SAHPRA's own internal operations; including a series of frameworks that require developments. The Compact recognises the need for capacitation of SAHPRA and other similar entities in the healthcare domain which includes a review of funding processes. Appreciating the massive capacity gaps SAHPRA currently has as it continues to evolve, I am pleased with, and have confidence, in the leadership and support the Board has afforded to SAHPRA management through its committees; ensuring that SAHPRA is able to assume leadership in its respective areas. It also gives the Board immense pleasure to confirm that SAHPRA has appointed a new Chief Executive Officer who has assumed duties in January; as one of the primary endeavours to stabilise the leadership of the organisation, starting at the top. This will be soon followed by the filling of other senior management vacancies in positions that have hitherto been occupied by acting incumbents. As we enter a new era of a new five- year planning cycle for SAHPRA and are nearing the end of term for the current Board, our focus is on shaping a bright future for SAHPRA and on handing over a solid organisation with a clear direction; supported by a conducive legislative framework, internal processes and systems and human capital to build sustainable organisational capacity. I also have pleasure to join our Honourable Minister and the CEO in presenting this Strategic Plan for the 2020 - 2024 period as well as the Annual Performance Plan for 2020 - 2021 medium-term period. ____________________________ Profess or Helen Rees Board Chairperson Professor Helen ReesSTATEMENT u BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Dr Boitumelo Semete -Makokotlela My journey with SAHPRA commenced in January 2020 and promises to be both challenging and exciting. I take the reins of an infant entity evolving through its developmental phases and emerging from a year that was without a doubt arduous but definitely very informative in helping determine the direction SAHPRA must take to grow. There is growing appreciation among management of the mammoth task to address the needs of stakeholders so as to cascade to meeting the needs of the people of South Africa. One of the exciting developments is being part of the era and generation that plays a crucial and direct role in effecting the existence and implementation of the NHI scheme and to enforce the ethos of accountability with the election of the 6th administration. Our enthusiasm for the beckoning future in the realm of healthcare service and our regulatory role therein is matched by our drive to improve our planning processes. Among other things, this means taking advantage of the infancy of SAHPRA to breed a professional organisational culture that will be beneficial to all our stakeholders. To this end, we believe we have formulated a fit-for-purpose Strategic Plan for the 2020 - 2024 five-year cycle; guided by the revised Framework for Strategic and Annual Performance Plan recently published by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME). We have endeavoured to align our planning process with the need to constantly keep our organisational effectiveness in check. In line with our extended mandate of ensuring that health products in our South African jurisdiction meet quality, safety and efficacy standards, we have re-formulated our core business outcomes as: These are the outcomes around which we will be rallying our current Team SAHPRA as well as the future recruits as we embark on a major drive to strengthen our organisational capacity to become a more proactive regulator. u Ensure effective financial management, governance and alignment of budget allocation with strategic priorities u Achieve and maintain financial sustainability through revenue generated and enhanced operational efficiencies u Consistently meet the needs and expectations of all SAHPRA's stakeholders u Achieve and maintain high levels of regulatory operational efficiency and effectiveness delivering to its stakeholders timeous and ensuring safe, efficacious and quality products u Strengthened ICT capacity to support digital transformation u Create a culture of excellence, while ensuring that SAHPRA's people are valued u Attract and retain superior talent u Promote the observance and upholding of organisational values and culture to advance business objectives and image/ reputation Some of the new indicators that underpin these outcomes are aligned to the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards which necessitates that we gear up our mechanisms to collect new healthcare data that pertains to our regulatory function. Therefore, this calls for our operations to be underpinned by sound internal controls and good governance as well as strong organisational capacity to advance efficient implementation of plans. This has a direct implication for our ability or otherwise to collect crucial data and serve as an aggregating repository for the sector; as we simultaneously seek to provide sector thought leadership. We have confidence in successfully attaining our recrafted vision: being an agile, conscientious and socio- economically transformative globally positioned African health products regulator with sustainable positive impact on long and healthy lives of South Africans. I am immensely proud and pleased to present both our aforesaid Strategic Plan and the Annual Performance Plan for the 2020 - 2021 Mid-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). ____________________________ Dr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela Chief Executive Officer ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 20218 9PART A: OUR MANDATEOFFICIAL SIGN OFF It is hereby certified that this Annual Performance Plan: u Was developed by the management under the guidance and support of the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) Board. u Takes into account all the relevant policies, legislation and other mandates for which SAHPRA is responsible. u Accurately reflects the outcomes and outputs which SAHPRA will endeavour to achieve over the period 2020/21. MANAGEMENT: SIGN OFF PROGRAMME 1 PROGRAMME 2 PROGRAMME 3 PROGRAMME 4 PROGRAMME 5 Adv Teboho 2020 - 202110 11 PART A: OUR MANDATE 1. UPDATES TO THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY MANDATES 1.1 RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE MANDATE The South African Health Products Authority (SAHPRA) is responsible for the: u Regulation of health products intended for human and animal use; u Licensing of manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of medicines, medical devices, radiation emitting devices and radioactive nuclides; and u Conduct of clinical trials. Since its establishment in February 2018, as a section 3A entity of the National Department of Health (NDOH), there has been no updates to its legislative and policy mandates. The cornerstone legislative mandates of SAHPRA are derived from the national Constitution, the National Health Act, 2003 (Act No. 61 of 2003) and the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No. 101 of 1965), as amended (herein after referred to as \"the Medicines Act\"). Pursuant to the expansion of the SAHPRA's mandate, to incorporate inter alia, the regulation and control of radiation- emitting devices and radioactive materials the following are various pieces of legislation that define the legislative framework within which SAHPRA executes its mandate: 1.1.1 The National Health Act, 2003 (Act No. 61 of 2003) It provides a framework for a structured uniform health system within the Republic, taking into account the obligations imposed by the Constitution and other laws on national, provincial and local government with regard to health services. The objectives of the National Health Act (NHA) are to: u Unite the various elements of the national health system in a common goal to actively promote and improve the national health system in South Africa; u Provide for a system of co-operative governance and management of health services, within national guidelines, norms and standards, in which each province, municipality and health district must address questions of health policy and delivery of quality health care services; u Establish a health system based on decentralized management, principles of equity, efficiency, sound governance, internationally recognized standards of research and a spirit of enquiry and advocacy which encourage participation; u Promote a spirit of co-operation and shared responsibility among public and private health professionals and providers and other relevant sectors within the context of national, provincial and district health plans; u Create the foundations of the health care system, and u Must be understood alongside other laws and policies that relate to health. 1.1.2 The Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No. 101 of 1965) as amended Amended by Amendment Act, 2008 (Act No. 72 of 2008) and Amendment Act, 2015 (Act No. 14 of 2015) and enacted in May 2017, enabled, among others, the establishment of SAHPRA, the licensing of manufacturers and importers of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and the regulation of medical devices. In terms of the Medicines Act, the objects of the Authority are to provide for the monitoring, evaluation, regulation, investigation, inspection, registration and control of medicines, scheduled substances, medical devices, radiation control, clinical trials and related matters in the public interest. It also provides for registration and control of veterinary medicines in such a way as to ensure that they are produced, distributed and used without compromising human and animal health. Antimicrobials intended for use in animals and registered under the Medicines Act can only be administered or prescribed by a veterinarian. As per section 2b (1) of the Medicines Act, the Authority must, in order to achieve its objects, ensure: u The efficient, effective and ethical evaluation or assessment and regulation of medicines, medical devices, radiation emitting devices and radioactive nuclides that meet the defined standards of quality, safety, efficacy and performance, where applicable; u That the process of evaluating or assessing and registering of medicines, medical devices, radiation emitting devices and radioactive nuclides is transparent, fair, objective and concluded timeously; u The periodic re-evaluation or re-assessment and ongoing monitoring of medicines, medical devices, radiation emitting devices and radioactive nuclides; u That evidence of existing and new adverse events and reactions, interactions, and signals emerging from post-marketing surveillance and vigilance activities are investigated, monitored, analysed and acted upon; u That compliance with existing legislation is promoted and achieved through a process of active inspection and investigation; and u That clinical trial or clinical performance study protocols are assessed according to prescribed scientific, ethical and professional criteria and defined standards.In executing its functions, the Authority may: u Liaise with any other regulatory authority or institution and may, without limiting the generality of this power, require the necessary information from, exchange information with and receive information from any such authority or institution in respect of:- matters of common interest; or a specific investigation; and u Enter into agreements to co-operate with any regulatory authority in order to achieve the objects of the Medicines Act. 1.1.3 Hazardous Substances Act (Act No. 15 of 1973) The Hazardous Substances Act provides for the efficient, effective and ethical evaluation and licensing of electronic generators of ionizing radiation and radionuclides. The Hazardous Substances Act classifies such substances and products in groups according to the risk associated with them. SAHPRA is only responsible for the regulation of Group III and Group IV hazardous substances. Section 3 of the Hazardous Substances Act refers to regulation of Group Ill hazardous substances which are electronic generators of ionizing radiation. Section 3A refers to regulation of Group IV hazardous substances, which are radionuclides. 1.1.4 Other related legislations Due to the complex environment that SAHPRA operates in, the following is a series of related legislation impacting on, and influencing the functioning of SAHPRA: u Fertilisers, Farm Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act, 1947 (Act No. 36 of 1947): Provides for the registration of fertilisers, farm feeds, agricultural remedies, stock remedies, sterilising plants and pest control operators. To regulate or prohibit the importation, sale, acquisition, disposal or use of fertilisers, farm feeds, agricultural remedies, stock remedies. Furthermore, it governs the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion and prophylaxis/ metaphylaxis, and the purchase of antimicrobials over-the-counter (OTC) by the lay public (chiefly farmers). u Animal Diseases Act, (Act No. 35 of 1984): Provides for the control of animal diseases and parasites, for measures to promote animal health and for matters connected therewith. u Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Act, 1982 (Act No. 19 of 1982): Provides for the establishment, powers and functions of the South African Veterinary Council; for the r egistration of persons practising veterinary professions and para-veterinary professions; for control over the practising of veterinary professions and para-veterinary professions; and for matters connected there with. It further makes provision for the compounding and or dispensing of any medicine which is prescribed by the veterinarian for use in the treatment of an animal which is under his or her professional care. u Drugs and Drugs Trafficking Act, 1992 (Act No. 140 of 1992): Provides for the prohibition of the use or possession of, or the dealing in drugs and of certain acts relating to the manufacture or supply of certain substance or the acquisition or conversion of the proceeds of certain crimes; for the obligation to report certain information to the police; for the exercise of the powers of entry, search, seizure and detention in specified circumstances; for the recovery of the proceeds of drug trafficking; and for matters connected therewith. u Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act, 1972 (Act No. 54 of 1972) (as amended): Provides for the regulation of foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfectants, in particular, quality standards that must be complied with by manufacturers, as well as the importation and exportation of these items. u Environmental Management Act: Waste Management Act, 1998 (Act No. 107 of 1998): Provide for co-operative, environmental governance by establishing principles for decision-making on matters affecting the environment, institutions that will promote co-operative governance and procedures for coordinating environmental functions exercised by organs of state; and to provide for matters connected therewith. u Health Professions Act, 1974 (Act No. 56 of 1974): Provides for the control over the education, training and registration for practising of health professions registered under the Act; and to provide for matters incidental thereto. u Nursing Act, 1978 (Act No. 50 of 1978): To consolidate and amend the laws relating to the professions of registered or enrolled nurses, nursing auxiliaries and midwives; and to provide for matters incidental thereto. u Pharmacy Act, 1974 (Act No. 53 of 1974: Provides for the regulation of the pharmacy profession, including community service by pharmacists.ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 202112 13 u Customs and Excise Act, 1964 (Act No. 91 of 1964): Provides for the prohibition and control of the importation, export or manufacture of certain goods, and for matters incidental thereto. A favourable legislative environment is fundamental to the operations of a regulator such as SAHPRA in supporting an effective execution of its mandate. There have been a few notable developments in SAHPRA's operating environment that have necessitated a review of its legislative and policy framework. In the first instance, SAHPRA's role exists amid an extremely complex legislative context where there is a series of other players involved where SAHPRA has only a limited but important regulatory role. A case in point is a role SAHPRA should be fulfilling through its representation at key ports of entry where there are goods that come into the country that fall within its legislative obligations; for their inspection, as per the Customs and Excise Act, cited above. Concerning one of the key new responsibilities emanating from SAHPRA's extended mandate are functions relating to radiation control, which have crucial elements falling within the jurisdiction of the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE). Another key collaborative partnerships needed to be nurtured is cannabis regulation which cross pollinates multiple ministries to effect the countries focus on enhancing access to this medicinal product. As SAHPRA continues to mature into role, it is becoming increasingly evident that there is a critical need to harmonise roles and responsibilities to avert the risk of an internal leadership vacuum or duplication of efforts and subsequent potential 'conflict'. 1.2 POLICY MANDATE The court ruling on the recreational use of cannabis has spurred a considerable public interest and debate in relation to implications for medicinal applications of cannabis. In addition, there is commercial interest that is tied to a significant potential economic gain from the legalisation and subsequent industrialisation of cannabis. This is evidenced by small-scale growers who seek to play in that space, a vast majority of whom have been growing the cannabis herb illegally for many years. It is imperative that as an agile regulator, SAHPRA takes proactive action in tackling regulatory framework relating to this area and strengthen collaborative partnerships with various government departments in bringing alignment to the various legislations supporting enhanced and broader access to cannabis based products. The entity therefore anticipates that it will be engaged with these matters that pertain to legislative and policy framework considerations, in tandem with other relevant industry bodies and government departments. 2. UPDATES TO INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AND STRATEGIES 2.1 INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES SAHPRA recognises the value of institutional policies for its effective and efficient operations in giving effect to its mandate. Given the infancy of the entity, despite having developed policies over the many months since its inception, the Regulator is still largely utilising the National Department of Health (NDoH) corporate services and policies to guide its compliance universe for both internal and external operations. Consequently, there will be a heightened focus on crafting a series of both policies and frameworks that are fundamental to SAHPRA's operations. There is equally a number of strategies that still need to be developed as the entity on-boards various specialists, particularly in the area of organisational development which is critical to building organisational capacity. Some of the noteworthy outstanding SAHPRA specific policies and strategies include performance management, change management, communications and so forth. However, in the interim, it will continue to rely on NDoH policies. Furthermore, there is currently a significant opportunity to boost earnings revenue from the provision of a range of services such as registering medical devices and licensing of radioactive nuclides. The frameworks to efficiently regulate these sectors has not come to full fruition due to a lack of internal processes, other internal constraints and competing business priorities such as eradicating the backlog and re-engineering of the business as usual operations. Thus, as the organisation reviews its fees, the services relating to medical devices, radiation control and complementary medicines, among others, will be developed. 2.2 INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGIES In compiling the Strategic Plan for the 2020-2024 Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) and the 2020-2020 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), SAHPRA took cognisance of, and factored the following key policy and strategic developments: u The National Development Plan (NDP): Vision 2030 and the National Drug Policy In terms of the overarching government socio- economic plans, SAHPRA has taken due cognisance of the National Development Plan's Outcome 2, \"A long and healthy life for all South Africans\" and its various outputs. However, this was essentially for purposes of ensuring alignment of this outcome plan to the National Drug Policy; which was adopted in 1995 with extensive support from the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Policy was adopted to serve the health care needs of South Africa in the following ways: 1. It offers a clear description of the approach by which pharmaceutical services in the country will be managed. 2. It offers guidance to stakeholders, including health care providers, suppliers of goods and services, and governmental and non- governmental agencies of ways in which they can contribute to achieving the policy's main aim. 3. It follows a clear and logical system for reducing inefficiency and waste and improving efficiency and effectiveness through the development of an adequate pharmaceutical infrastructure. 4. It facilitates the design, production and implementation of appropriate programmes for human resource development in health care. u The NDP Five-Year Implementation Plan In terms of the NDP Five-Year Plan emanating from the Seven National Priorities as announced in the State of the Nation Address (SONA) 2019, SAHPRA locates its contribution under Priority 2. In this regard, the target for health is outlined as, \"Implement the enabling legislative framework and create institutional capacity for NHI by 2024 to achieve universal health coverage for all South Africans by 2030,\" with its outcome being, \"Universal access to good quality health care for all South Africans achieved.\" In terms of impact, SAHPRA is aligned to, \"Enhanced access to good quality health services for all South Africans, based on need and not ability to pay.\" Similarly, the policy fundamentals of SAHPRA's link to these plans are predicated on the National Drug Policy as outlined above. u The Nine -Pillar Presidential Health Summit Compact, 2018 The Health Compact has aims at finding solutions to the crisis facing our health system. As such, the identified nine (9) pillars need to be strengthened to improve the health system in the country. They are as follows: 1. Augment human resources 2. Ensure improved access to essential medicines, vaccines and medical products through better management 3. Execute the infrastructure plan to ensure adequate, appropriately distributed and well maintained health facilities 4. Engaging the private sector in improving the access, coverage and quality of health services 5. Improve the quality, safety and quantity of health services provided with a focus on primary health care. 6. Improve the efficiency of public sector financial management systems and processes. 7. Strengthen governance and leadership to improve oversight, accountability and systems performance at all levels. 8. Engage and empower the community to ensure adequate and appropriate community based care 9. Develop an information system that will guide the health system policies, strategies and investment. The Health Compact contains numerous prominent references to SAHPRA, its roles and responsibilities and other interventions that require its direct involvement, as set out below. There is a need to address the current SAHPRA backlog of registration of medicines, which is a primary focal area for the Board and management. Regulation and registration interventions to address SAHPRA's backlog include: To prioritise medicine applications based on the public health need and expedite processes that take into account mutual recognition for medicines of public health benefit as a matter of critical concern; To re-engineer regulatory processes to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and delays by re-engineering the operational models and revising business processed; To create collaborative structures to introduce new medicines into pilot programmes so as to address high burden diseases, particularly HIV, TB, cancer and other diseases of priority; and To adopt the novel regulatory mechanism of reliance and molecule-based registration. It would be remiss not to note that, while innovative, the rigour of the reliance mechanisms remains to be established within the global regulatory environment, and as such the full effectiveness of this strategy may not be realised in the initial implementation. Therefore, the December 2019 deadline articulated in the Health Compact, determined by independent stakeholders and without input from the SAHPRA Board and managers, will not be feasible without compromising SAHPRA's core mandate of quality, safety and efficacy. Operationally, it is imperative to note that operational and policy frameworks will also require concurrent alignment to the business-as-usual environment, as well as the use of automation and leveraging collaborative PART A: OUR MANDATE CONTINUED ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 202114 15 structures to achieve the timeous introduction of new medicines so as to address high-burden diseases. The process towards reducing the turnaround times will therefore need to be measured and deliberate to be effective. Further considerations towards supporting the presidential Health Compact include the need to review the level of funding of crucial health sector entities such as SAHPRA, the Office of Health Standards Compliance (OHSC), the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS) and the Compensation Commission for Occupational Diseases (CCOD) institutions, together with the review of the budget allocations to the public health sector and the provincial and municipal health services. An objective system of determining the allocation of resources to these entities needs to be established. There is a need for an improved Communication Strategy and approach as SAHPRA currently does not timeously communicate decisions that affect the availability of medicines. Further considerations towards supporting the presidential compact include, include; the level of funding of crucial health sector entities such as SAHPRA, OHSC, CMS, and the CCOD institutions needs to be reviewed; together with the review of the budget allocations to the public health sector and the provincial and municipal health services. An objective system of determining the allocation of resources to these entities needs to be established. A need for an improved Communication Strategy and approach as SAHPRA currently does not timeously communicate decisions that affect medicines availabilityu The Minister of Health's Budget Vote and Policy Statement The policy statement reiterates and reemphasises that SAHPRA will be strengthened to ensure that the registration of medicines and capacity for local production of active ingredients as well as removal of application backlogs are accelerated. In terms of stakeholder management there is a strong need for cooperation between the public and private sector, civil society, patients' associations, academics, researchers including labour in transforming the health system. The Ministry will have a dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders to aid the flow of information amongst parties within the next six months. u The Revised Framework for Strategic and Annual Performance Plans (FSAPPs) Key issues to note and respond to with regards to the Framework are: The application of diagnostic tools such as PESTEL and SWOT analyses, scenario planning, problem tree analysis among others, as well as adopting a balanced scorecard approach to strategic planning. It provides guidelines for the development of Operational Plans which must be approved by March annually. These Operational Plans are particularly enormously important in the context of SAHPRA in institutionalising the performance culture at programme and individual levels.

RELEVANT COURT RULINGS On the 18th of September 2018, The Constitutional Court found sections of the Medicines Act which restrict cannabis use to be unconstitutional in certain limited circumstances. It is therefore not a criminal offence for an adult person to u Use or be in possession of cannabis for his or her personal consumption in private; and u To cultivate cannabis in a private place for his or her personal consumption in private u The Court did not make a distinction between using, possessing or cultivating cannabis for recreational or medicinal use u SAHPRA will therefore be required, within 24 months from 18th September 2018, to amend the Medicines Act to comply with this judgement.PART A: OUR MANDATE CONTINUED Figure 2: Strategic Objectives for 2020-2024Ensure effective financial management, governance and alignment of budget allocation with strategic priorities Achieve and maintain high levels of regulatory operational efficiency and effectiveness delivering to its stakeholders timeous and ensuring safe, efficacious and quality productsCreate a culture of excellence, while ensuring that SAHPRA's people are valuedStrengthened ICT capacity to support digital transformation Attract and retain superior talent Promote the observance and upholding of organisational values and culture to advance business objectives and image/reputationAchieve and maintain financial sustainability through revenue generated and enhanced operational efficienciesConsistently meet the needs and expectations of all SAHPRA's stakeholders Valuing our peopleKey SAHPRA Strategic objectivesANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 202118 19 PART B: OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS 4. UPDATED SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS 4.1 OVERVIEW: The environment in which SAHPRA performs its regulatory role is largely shaped by the developments that emanate from its immediate internal and external milieu. These developments include significant internal structural, cultural, governance and organisational changes that are a natural consequence of the journey to transition into a Schedule 3 A Public Entity. The changing political landscape, as well as and socio-economic factors have placed a greater emphasis on health systems reform. The way that these developments will influence the organisation's overall regulatory performance in the short to medium term is of great significance to SAHPRA. It is also important to reflect on public health, government policy and industry trends that may have a considerable influence on our current and future regulatory role. 4.1.1 External environment analysis SAHPRA has not been sheltered from the key social, economic and political developments in the environment in which it executes its regulatory mandate. The economic forecasts on GDP growth from 2018/19 have been downgraded several times by different agencies. The annual GDP growth rate found itself in negative territory in the last 2 quarters of 2019. The GDP growth rate for 2020 is most likely to hover around 1% One particular focus area for SA in reaching the 1.4% to 1.6% range forecasted by the SA Reserve Bank is improved utilisation of state finances and reducing cost drivers. These factors are crucial in addressing the challenges of unemployment and poverty. It has been reported that up to a third of the South African population is living below the poverty line. The increase in poverty, which is accompanied by joblessness, has a negative impact on the ability of individuals to privately access quality safe and effective health services and products. Public health commodity security therefore becomes increasingly vital and is thus an influencing factor focusing SAHPRA's public health priority policy. These external influencers have ushered in a change in the balance of power across the healthcare value chain as governments; advocacy agencies and medical aid providers start to exert more pressure on pharmaceutical companies to drop their prices. There is a move from reactive healthcare to prevention, which is bound to attract new entrants and unsettle the status quo. The trend to register generic medicines in SA as more doctors and consumers opt for affordable, yet effective alternatives to expensive brand name medication will support greater affordable access Several key developments in this environment have had a direct impact on SAHPRA and its regulatory role. The major recent development in the policy sphere is the promulgation of the National Health Insurance Implementation Policy and its gazetted implementation advisory committees. The broader health sector has enjoyed a period of relative stability from a political perspective. This has ensured that the policy developments in the sector have progressed without major, unexpected obstacles; however; access to quality health services is still a gap in the country. Despite life expectancy showing an increasing trend in the past few years, the average life expectancy is still low at 63.1 years for females and 59.1 years for males. The average life expectancy is expected to rise to 70 if the health sector reform is successful. SAHPRA's public health priority focus will therefore need to align to the current and emerging health needs. The country is currently facing an increasing burden of diseases that negatively affects the health of the population and results in poor health outcomes. Epidemiologically, South Africa is confronted with a quadruple burden of disease resulting from communicable diseases such as HIV/ AIDS and TB; maternal and child mortality; NCDs such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, mental, behavioural and neurological illnesses and chronic lung diseases like asthma; as well as injury and trauma., The alarming rise of abuse and misuse of licensed medicines, particularly the opiates and the resultant implications on public health has direct consequences on the work of SAHPRA There is also the invisible burden of adverse drug reactions towards medicines used to treat these conditions. Studies in South Africa estimate that 6-8% of medical ward admissions are caused by adverse drug reactions, a significant proportion of which are deemed to be preventable; but nevertheless continue to add to the disease burden experienced by the public. In addressing the health care burden, the health sector faces increasing costs of medical products and technologies. The main cost drivers in the public sector (other than human resources) are pharmaceuticals; laboratory services; blood and blood products; equipment; and surgical consumables.. To address some of the gaps in offering quality health services to the people of South Africa, the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill has been promulgated and will be implemented in the coming years. The NHI is a health financing system that is designed to pool funds to provide access to quality affordable personal health services (including health products) for all South Africans based on their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status. It naturally follows that in executing its mandate effectively and efficiently, SAHPRA has a fundamental role to play as a regulator in assuring medicine commodity security, product safety and quality monitoring within this system of universal health coverage (UHC). Whilst the mandate of SAHPRA is focused on regulating quality, safety and efficacy of health products; the indirect impact on access and cost is inevitable. More efficient health product registration, post- market surveillance and execution of other health product regulatory roles; enhances investment in the pharmaceutical market, improve access and diminish the threat of unsafe, substandard and/or counterfeit health products. At greatest risk from these health product threats is the growing numbers of vulnerable individuals arising from the widening socio-economic gap in the population The local pharmaceutical market is growing at just over 9% in value and this growth is ascribed to the increased demand for generics. Nearly every therapeutic class currently has at least one generic equivalent available and sales of over- the-counter (OTC) generics now also outstrip brand name products by almost R1 billion in value and more than 53 million units. In SA, generics are fast becoming the pillar of healthcare because of the affordability to public health and accessibility by the most vulnerable in society. It is therefore imperative that the existing medicine registration backlog inherited by SAHPRA, which primarily comprises generics, be eradicated. It is prudent to consider the challenges experienced by the industry for whom the efficiency and effectiveness of SAHPRA will have consequences. These challenges include: u Currency weakness increases the cost of imported active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are key ingredients in the manufacturing process, as well as the cost of finished pharmaceutical products (FPPs) or health products not manufactured in this country. u The level of single exit pricing (SEP) increases does not adequately cover the cost base of pharmaceutical companies, of which currency is a substantial driver. u Another challenge is the increasingly competitive government tenders, with punitive conditions attached for non-compliance. Weak economic growth means that SAHPRAs improved business format could stimulate the health sector and encourage submission of applications in this country. Eradication of the backlog and efficiency in turnaround times at SAHPRA is a key under-pinners to how the regulator opts to respond to industry related difficulties. This response to industry challenges will seek to ensure diverse access of health products to meet the diverse public health needs More efficient licensing of health product manufacturing facilities secures the quality of health products SAHPRA wishes to assure. further, Efficiency in the registration process will help to negate the threat related to our other competing regulatory mandates in this period that SAHPRA seeks to build its full capacity as a Schedule 3A entity. The same arguments hold true for the medical technology industry, commonly referred to as medical devices, consisting of instruments, devices, apparatuses, or machines that are used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or disease, or for detecting, measuring, restoring, correcting, or modifying the structure or function of the body for some health purpose. Efficiency of licensing and effective post-marketing surveillance are key a considerable determinant of ensuring the positive impact of the medical technology industry on public health in South Africa The South African medical device market was estimated at R30 billion in 2019 and ranks among the top 30 largest in the world. Compared with the pharmaceutical market, where domestic manufacturers are now able to meet 50% of demand in volume terms, South Africa's domestic medical device industry remains underdeveloped, with imports catering for 90% of the market by value. This has direct bearing on SAHPRA's regulatory strategy. South Africa's medical device production firms tend to be small or medium- sized businesses and often combine their distribution activity with manufacturing. Multinational companies present in South Africa often operate in a joint venture capacity with local firms. Most South African manufacturers focus on producing basic medical equipment and supplies, with production focused mainly on bandages and dressings, medical furniture and low technology items. The global medical device market is expected to reach an estimated $409.5 billion by 2023, and it is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% from 2018 to 2023.1 Major factors for the growth in the industry are healthcare expenditure, technological development, an aging population and chronic diseases. Clinical trials for devices in Europe are controlled by member states under a competent authority. Another role of a competent authority is compliance and enabling enforcement, ensuring that the Medical Devices Act is being complied with and working with collaborative partners such as the Hawks and South African Police to potentially prosecute anyone who places a device on the market without authorisation or a device that is inappropriately labelled. Recent research suggests that up to 30% of pharmaceutical research and development is now directed toward combination products. There are three basic groups of these products, namely: u Drug-device combinations, which fall under pharmaceutical law; u Device-drug combinations, where the lead is device law; and u Diagnostic-drug combinations or \"companion diagnostics\", which may require new legislation to be appropriately handled. SAHPRA's strategic focus will seek to influence this sector to ensure global regulatory alignment and to support innovative product development where relevant while safeguarding against the registration of irrational or potentially unsafe combinations while supporting the licensing innovative products that meet the regulatory standards of safety, efficacy and quality and have public health value. Another key emerging sector that SAHPRA needs to strategically respond to must align with strategically is the global trend of regulation of cannabis and cannabis-ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 202120 21 PART B: OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS CONTINUED containing products. In November 2017, SAHPRA implemented a licensing framework to regulate proposed growers of cannabis for medicinal use. This would in effect enable cultivation, manufacture and supply of standardised high-quality cannabis for medicinal use and cannabis- containing medicines. Licensed domestic cultivation of cannabis for medicinal use is aimed at ensuring sufficient local supply for medical, scientific and clinical research purposes. This will require the implementation of control measures and vigilance approaches necessary to prevent diversion and misuse as well as ensuring patient safety. South Africa's current regulatory requirements for registration of medicines would also apply to cannabis- containing products intended for sale in South Africa. The way forward for SAHPRA will be to build capacity to both register products and license manufactures in line with its quality, safety and efficacy mandate for legitimate operation, as well as monitor the performance of these licensed products, regulate; in collaboration with key law enforcement partners and other government agencies; illegitimate operations that transact in substandard or falsified products. Similarly, SAHPRA needs to take a lead in addressing the scourge of codeine misuse and abuse that has reportedly reached alarming rates in South Africa as well as in neighboring countries. This problem requires a coordinated multi-sectoral approach that will explore regulatory solutions while building on our collaborative relationships with health professionals, law enforcement, the media and the pharmaceutical industry On the 15th November 2013, the Minister of Health published amendments to the General Regulations made in terms of the Medicines and Related Substance Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965), which established a category of medicines, complementary medicines (Category D), and effectively established a regulatory framework for this category. The medicines which fall under this definition originate from the six (6) major disciplines recognised by SAHPRA, namely Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Unani Tibb and Western Herbal Medicine 1, as well as combination products identified in the accompanying Guideline for Complementary Medicines (Quality, Safety and Efficacy) published in the same year. Following further interaction with various stakeholders, the category of complementary medicines was broadened to establish two sub-categories of Category D (complementary medicines), reflected in the General Regulations published and implemented as per Government Notice 859 in Government Gazette 41064 on 25 August 2017. This resulted in the inclusion of new sub-categories of Category D, including those traditional disciplines that are not indigenous to South Africa (discipline-specific medicines) but also the more modern supplement-type of medicines (health supplements).The original deadlines for submission of applications for registration prescribed by Regulation 48C of the General Regulations in 2013 were deleted by the General Regulations in 2017. A new timeline will be established by way of the publication of declarations that categories, sub-categories or classes of Category D medicines (complementary medicines) shall be subject to registration (\"call-up notices\") in terms of section 14 of the Medicines and Related Substance Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965). In the next five years, resources will be dedicated to reviving this process and giving it a stronger momentum to ensure the public accesses to these products with greater assurance of safety and fortification against false claims as well as substandard- and falsified CMs. A significant strategy enabling SAHPRA to attain these mandates is alignment and collaboration with other regulatory authorities; especially in the continent. Of special note is SAHPRA's affiliation to the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonisation initiative (AMRH ) and Zazibona, The AMRH seeks to address the availability of safe, good quality and affordable medicines; which is a challenge for many African countries due to non-existent, weak or outdated legal frameworks and limited capacity. AMRH works to improve access to quality, safe and efficacious medicines by providing an enabling regulatory environment for pharmaceutical sector development in Africa. SAHPRA seeks to support; learn from; work with and provide thought leadership to this endeavour. Zazibona promotes a collaborative model to facilitate access to good-quality medicines through work-sharing in assessment of medicines and inspection of medicine manufacturing and testing facilities. Products that meet assessment criteria are then granted registration in the participating countries, in which CTD-format applications for registration would have been submitted. Where countries agree that is necessary, variations to the products which have been registered under this collaboration may be handled through the same process. SAHPRA's footprint in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the continent of Africa is fundamental to establishing the entity as one of the leaders in Africa's health product regulatory environment. This outcome will help to fortify the legitimacy of Africa, not just South Africa, in the global responses to issues and challenges in the health product access and safety arena. 4.1.2 Internal environment analyses SAHPRA was established in February 2018 on the platform set up by the South African Medicines Control Council. The shift to a Schedule 3A Public Entity was to enable the Regulator to achieve autonomy, alignment with global trends and hence increased agility, effectiveness and efficiency in executing its mandate. The entity has made positive strides since its inception, but the birth of this new entity was not without challenges. At the outset, SAHPRA should have been regarded as a \"start-up\" organisation and should have been provided with adequate corporate service support and sufficient technical staff to deliver on its expanded mandate and inherited challenges. Limited capacity of these essential underpinners was provided to SAHPRA, resulting in significant gaps in the operationalisation of the entity. This transitional period coincided with industrial action in the NDoH's Civitas building where SAHPRA was still housed, and this limited the support that these NDoH departments could offer SAHPRA. The SAHPRA staff themselves were affected by the industrial action. At the beginning of 2019, the Regulator had to precipitously move out of Civitas and into new premises on the campus of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to enable work to resume. Lack of secure IT and communication infrastructure further hampered the Regulator's work. The spread of its activities across five remotely situated buildings within the CSIR campus continues to make SAHPRA's work challenging. This entire context puts enormous strain on the existing and newly appointed staff at a time when they have been asked to undertake many turnaround processes. Despite these challenges, a team of committed and resilient staff and Board members rolled up their sleeves and led SAHPRA through this difficult period, enabling it to emerge as a growing organisation into a good and positive space. Despite the troubleshooting that had to take place in the past year, the catchwords for the Regulator during this period have been re-envisioning and re-engineering. SAHPRA will soon have more fit-for-purpose premises, supported by new IT systems designed for the complex needs of a regulatory authority that aims to become fully digitalised within the next year. The Authority is in the process of employing over 100 new and much needed staff at all levels and in all departments of the organisation over the next three years. The crucial leadership roles of the CEO, CFO, CRO and Company Secretary were filled in the 2019 financial year. Efforts have been intensified to secure other key critical senior positions in both the corporate services and core programmes to keep up the momentum of establishing the entity's leadership. Filling these critical leadership roles will enable a phased approach of recruitment at the technical and administration levels without impacting outputs. While the operational aspects are being tackled as indicated above, the core business of SAHPRA will equally receive the required attention. Established SAHPRA mandates, such as pharmacovigilance, are receiving renewed attention, while new portfolios, including radiation control and medical devices, are receiving priority attention so as to address identified shortcomings. Radiation control, a service that is essential both for public health and for heath security, will see major changes and improvements in the coming year aimed at streamlining its mandate and addressing backlogs. Registration of medical devices will continue to be aligned with global best practices and its staff contingent will be bolstered to implement new strategies. The new vision for pharmacovigilance, which is key to ensuring the safety of all health products, includes electronic reporting, facilitating good vigilance practice within the industry and proactive multi-stakeholder communication, prioritizing public engagement and reporter feedback. The complementary medicines registration and regulation unit will be bolstered with capacity and resources to implement the framework established and approved. The critical priority for SAHPRA since its launch in February 2018 has been the clearance of the medical products backlog. SAHPRA inherited the backlog from the Medicines Control Council, but at the outset the backlog size and scope were unclear. Using the current strategies, it would take eight years to clear the backlog even if no new applications were received. It is impossible to achieve SAHPRA's vision of establishing a state-of-the-art, world- class regulatory authority while this burden of the backlog continues to weigh the entity down. To address this immense challenge, SAHPRA required and received the buy-in of the pharmaceutical industry who have agreed to adopt fundamentally different ways of doing business. The SAHPRA team have put an ambitious roadmap in place to clear the backlog within a period of two years, using totally re-engineered approaches for medicines registration. This includes digitisation, reliance procedures that allow SAHPRA to exchange information with recognised regional and international regulatory authorities, and standardisation of evaluation processes that will enable applicants and regulators alike to know what is excepted of them and how long it should take. The same processes are now being introduced for \"business as usual\" applications. These radically different strategies will reduce the timelines for the registration of both cutting- edge, innovative medicines and of generic medicines.. In summary, over the next five years SAHPRA needs to focus on achieving stabilisation and momentum out of this transitional phase towards greater autonomy, effective governance and operational efficiency. As the entity looks to strengthen its stakeholder engagement, a new communication strategy will be introduced, which places at its core the wellbeing of all who live in South Africa. A comprehensive communication strategy has been developed which supports SAHPRA's business strategy.. It is envisaged that in 2020 SAHPRA will redesign its website and implement the use of all forms of media to proactively and interactively communicate with the public, professionals and industry. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 202122 23 PART B: OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS CONTINUED 4.1.3 PESTE l analysis A PESTLE analysis is a framework to analyse the key factors (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal and Environmental) influencing an organisation from the outside TABLE 1: SAHPRA'S PESTEL ANALYSIS POLITICAL 1 The introduction of the 6th Administration following the recent elections has ushered in a renewed focus on reform and shift in policy. Public health reform is exemplified in the area prioritisation of Universal health coverage and the promulgation of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill. 2 There is a plethora of legislations that affect the areas of SAHPRA's operations which straddle various departments that need to be co-ordinated through intergovernmental relations processes. This would include regulation of radiation emitting devices, management of opiod abuse as well as deregulation of cannabis. 3 Increasingly competitive government tenders, with punitive conditions attached for non-compliance, have been introduced. 4 The industry is still to transform and there is currently no sector chapter to promote self-regulation for sector transformation in line with government policies, mainly the BBBEE Act. ECONOMIC (FINANCIAL) 1. There has been a change in the balance of power across the healthcare value chain as governments and medical aid providers start to exert more pressure on pharmaceutical companies to drop their prices. 2. The SA medical device market is estimated at R30 billion in 2019 and presents an opportunity to garner greater revenue and stimulate the local manufacturing industry. Compared with the pharmaceutical market, where domestic manufacturers are now able to meet 50% of demand in volume terms, South Africa's domestic medical device industry is small, with imports catering for 90% of the market by value. 3. The local pharmaceutical market is growing at just over 9% in value and this growth is ascribed to the increased demand for generics. 4. Nearly every therapeutic class currently has at least one generic equivalent available and sales of over-the-counter (OTC) generics now also outstrip brand name products by almost R1 billion in value and more than 53 million units. 5. Global shortages of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are key ingredients in the manufacturing process impact licensing and access within SA market 6. 7. Weak economic growth means that the public health sector will be required to do more with fewer resources than initially planned. In essence, a weaker fiscus translates into South Africa needing to drive the transition to a greater fees contribution to its revenue as opposed to the fiscal contribution to its revenue 8. There is a need for generic medicines in South Africa as more doctors and consumers opt for affordable, yet effective alternatives to expensive brand name medication. SOCIAL/SOCIO-ECONOMIC 1 The increasing rates of inequity and poverty amongst the different population groups in South African society is a clear indication of an increase in the number of vulnerable individuals that need a social safety network against sub- optimal and falsified health products that flood across porous borders into vulnerable third world markets. 2 In South Africa, generics are fast becoming the pillar of healthcare because of their affordability to public health and the fact that they make medicine accessible to the most vulnerable in society. 3 There seems to be social scepticism surrounding the success prospects of the NHI Scheme due to challenges that have been witnessed in state-owned enterprises. 4 There is a danger of misinterpretation of the Constitutional Judgement on the recreational use of cannabis. This could affect the medicinal use aspects that SAHPRA is responsible for which may necessitate urgent public education interventions and collaboration with other government departments such as Social Development, Trade and Industry, and Finance.TECHNOLOGICAL 1. Digitisation of SAHPRA operations is imperative to optimize SAHPRA into a globally c recognised space. 2. Technical advances and increasing trends in cyber-crimes create risks to unauthorized access to sensitive information. Data security is a growing business consideration that must prioritized 3. On line purchasing sites are not adequately regulated and have a negative impact in that they enable ease of access to illegal importation of drugs that could make it hard for SAHPRA to detect. ENVIRONMENTAL 1. An increase in reported cases of abandoned or recklessly handled radiation-emitting materials that are causing illnesses for neighboring communities requires the urgent attention of SAHPRA 's radiation control division. 2. SAHPRA must align to the global trends of greener industrial systems and should seek to align legislation and practice of licencing and inspections with stimulating industrial compliance. LEGAL 1. There is a plethora of legislation that requires harmonisation in order to provide clarity for SAHPRA to discharge its role with greater efficiency and confidence, given the critical importance of legislation for SAHPRA 's regulatory function. 2. The Constitutional Court judgment on cannabis requires urgent interventions in terms of proper policy frameworks. 3. The evolving universe of health product regulation necessitates focused efforts from SAHPRA to review the legal framework so as to ensure the regulatory compliance unit is properly aligned to enforce regulation at a global level. 4 A key area of law enforcement is that of false and misleading advertising that adversely impacts public safety 4.1.4 Internal environment analysis The Board which was appointed in October 2017, has one year left in their term. It has established the following committees which are fully operational and functional: 1. Finance 2. Risk, Audit and Governance 3. Technical Oversight and Strategy 4. Information Technology 5. Stakeholder Communications 6. Human Resources and Remuneration The Board and senior management are acutely aware of the importance of good corporate governance and of the medium and long term sustainability of SAHPRA. Having been established in February 2018, SAHPRA's operations are predicated on the operational framework as set out in Figure 3 below, and structured into five programme areas, as follows: u Programme 1: Administration Responsible for leadership and administrative support to enable SAHPRA to deliver on its mandate and comply with all relevant legislative requirements. This function is represented by the Office of the CEO, CFO, and Chief Support Officer. u Programme 2: Authorisation Management Serves as a project office responsible for providing specialised administration support necessary for SAHPRA's core functional programmes to enable the entity to deliver on its roles in specific reference to processing licences and permits. u Programme 3: Inspectorate and Regulatory Compliance Responsible for ensuring public access to safe and quality health products through conducting inspections and regulatory compliance facilitating GMP, GWP, GDP, GCP and GLP compliance. u Programme 4: Medicines Evaluation and Registration Conducts evaluation of safety, quality and therapeutic efficacy of medicines and register them for use as per delegated authority in terms of relevant legislation. u Programme 5: Medical Devices, Diagnostics and Radiation Control Develops and maintains regulations and guidelines pertaining to the regulatory oversight of medical devices, ionising and non-ionising radiation- emitting devices and radioactive nuclides. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR 2020 - 202124 25 PART B: OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS CONTINUED Whilst programmes 1 and 2 both provide administration- related support, there are fundamental differences in that the latter operates as a project management office (PMO) supporting specifically programmes 3, 4 and 5 which carry a registration responsibility. Building internal capacity has been singled out as the most critical area where accelerated performance needs to happen. The processes are underway to recruit the necessary talent. In addition to internal organisational capacity, there are critical issues pertaining to business processes which incorporate important matters of various frameworks including a framework for services for which SAHPRA can charge fees The entity is still grappling with internal issues which have caused it not to be able to fully leverage on its institutional status as a Schedule 3A entity. Overcoming these issues should allow for greater efficiencies in its operations. u At the core of the challenges are severe deficiencies in organisational capacity with the most acute shortages in SAHPRA's institutional capacity being in the current programmes 1 and 5. Building necessary internal capacity is paramount to the entity's ability to be fully functional against the backdrop of additional responsibilities that form part of its extended mandate since transitioning from its forerunner, the Medicines Control Council (MCC). while ensuring the quality review of applications. u Notwithstanding capacity challenges, core functional programmes are fully functional, in spite of their chronic inefficiency challenges such as heavy reliance on external evaluators. Even as the organisation seeks to develop technical capacity in these programmes through focused and earnest recruitment, the lag period between recruitment and full competency for a senior evaluator is significant and hence a diminished reliance on external evaluators will need to be phased in. External evaluators will never be completely eliminated as the depth and breadth of technical competency in the clinical space needed is too diverse to be able to house all experts as full time staff. u SAHPRA is still reeling from the aftermath of industrial action that has hampered its ability to clear the applications backlog, further complicated by the aforementioned capacity challenges. In developing this Strategic Plan, there is clear acknowledgement that building internal capacity that is supported by necessary human resource change management processes may take no less than another two years at best. u The current reality is that SAHPRA's inherited institutional inefficiencies may compromise timely access to essential and innovative medicines. . Linked to this are issues relating to business systems, particularly for core business processes that need to be automated to achieve necessary levels of efficiencies. The entity is still in the process of migrating out of the technology platforms of the NDoH towards establishing its own platforms that will allow for necessary customisation considerations. u As a regulator, SAHPRA is gearing itself to assert its authority in the sector through among other ways, investing in sector thought-leadership predicated on servicing as an authoritative repository of strategic sector information u There are other issues that require urgent attention, including inter alia, work in Programme 5 which falls in the domain of radiation control falls outside the mandate of SAHPRA. As much as 90% of the radionuclides of radioactive source materials that are regulated under Programme 5 is for industrial application. Engagement with the Minister of Energy to work out a solution to reframe this space is underway and will be a significant focus in the short to medium term strategies.

The South African Auditing Standard (SAAS 320.03) defines materiality as follows: \"Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality depends on the size of the item or error judged in the particular circumstances of its omission or misstatement. Thus, materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point, rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic, which information must have if it is to be useful.\" Accordingly, we will be dealing with this framework under two main categories, being quantitative and qualitative aspects. Materiality can be based on a number of financial indicators. Detailed below is an indicative table of financial indicators as documented in the Treasury Practice note on applications under S.54 of the PFMA. BASIS ACCEPTABLE PERCENTAGE RANGE Total assets 1 % - 2 % Total Revenue 0,5 % - 1 % Profit after tax 2 % - 5 % SAHPRA will use 1 % of total revenue to determine materiality. SAHPRA operations are driven mainly by applications received and are therefore essentially revenue-driven. In determining the materiality value as 1 % we have considered the following factors: a) Nature of the SAHPRA's business In terms of the Medicines Act, the objects of the Authority are to provide for the monitoring, evaluation, regulation, investigation, inspection, registration and control of medicines, scheduled substances, clinical trials and medical devices, radiation control and related matters in the public interest. b) The control and inherent risks associated with the SAHPRA. In assessing the control risk of the SAHPRA, and concluding that a materiality level higher than 0,25 % can be used due to a reasonable control environment being present cognizance was given to amongst others:u Proper and appropriate governance structures have been established; u An audit and risk committee that closely monitors the control environment of the SAHPRA was established; u The function of internal audit was partly outsourced to a firm with SAHPRA specific experience; and u An internal audit plan, based on annual risk assessments being performed, is annually reviewed and agreed by the audit committee. c) Quantitative Aspects Materiality Level The level of materiality for 2020/21 has been set as follows: Total 2018/19 audited revenue: R 231 280 133 x 1 %= R2 312 013 d) Qualitative Aspects Materiality is not merely related to the size of the entity and the elements of its financial statements. Obviously, misstatements that are large either individually or in the aggregate may affect a \"reasonable\" user's judgement. However, misstatements may also be material on qualitative grounds. These qualitative grounds include amongst others: i) New ventures that the SAHPRA has entered into. ii) Unusual transactions entered into that are not of a repetitive nature and are disclosable purely due to the nature thereof due to knowledge thereof affecting the decision making of the user of the financial statements. iii) Transactions entered into that could result in reputational risk to SAHPRA. iv) Any fraudulent or dishonest behaviour of an officer or staff of SAHPRA. v) Procedures/processes required by legislation or regulation (e.g. PFMA and the Treasury Regulations)Registered Office Address CSIR Campus Reception Building 38a Meiring Naud\u00e9 Road, Brummeria Pretoria 0002 Postal Address Private X828 Pretoria 0001 Contact Telephone Numbers +2712 842 "}
