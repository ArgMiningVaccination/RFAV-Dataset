Star batter Ricardo Elliot helped his team rally back in a competitive seventh-inning, smashing a clutch home run off Tiburones ace, Kyle Murano.

I'm writing it all down so I don't doubt my memories later. <br><br>Day before the workers' rally, I was on night watch, Umberto was there late to prep. Suddenly some of Ben\u00edtez's soldados show up. Our new supervisor, a McKay man, let them into the plant. When they beelined for Umberto, I hid. They talked a little while. Suddenly Umberto started waving his arms and calling them liars. Then, they just dragged him to one of the vats. I bet they wanted to make it look like an accident. I heard them shouting, struggling, then Umberto screaming. I didn't hear any gunshots. <br><br>The soldados and the supervisor didn't come back. Still, I waited until the next shift was about to clock in to come out. I found skin and clumps of hair at the vat. His face must be gone. At the morning meeting, the supervisor told us Umberto was gone to Esperanza to look after a sick relative and that we wouldn't see him any more. <br><br>I don't know what to do. 0x6B4F23EE 1131121 Dear Ensigns of La Joya, <br><br>It has come to our attention that contradictory rumors are circulating in La Joya. We have come to understand that a masked individual has been sighted trespassing on McKay properties after dark. We are also aware that some soldiers believe this individual is connected with accidents and malfunctions in McKay properties. Furthermore, we learn certain soldiers believe that this individual is one Umberto Salazar, an Outcast who was executed in January of 2019, according to a report signed by some of your rank. <br><br>Admiral Ben\u00edtez desires to know whether her ensigns are liars who falsified a death report to cover an error or merely superstitious idiots who prefer a ghost story to the practical explanation of masked guerrillas targeting industrial locations. A complete report is expected by the end of the week. Remind yourselves that McKay will seize any opportunity to put Admiral Ben\u00edtez's leadership in doubt.<br><br>The Staff Secretary of Admiral Ben\u00edtez 0x6C22E7F7 1131125 F.

I find out we had somebody tampering with our shit. Phantasma, for sure. (Recommendation: Outcast) <br><br>P. Suarez: My cousin saw what they did to Umberto. Pushed him right into a vat. He ran off, shedding skin like a lizard. I think he's out there, looking like raw sausage but still fighting. <br><br>R. Mesa: I just feel like a rich company from Canada wouldn't have this many problems for no reason. And Umberto knew everything inside and out...<br><br>U. Zayas: Phantasma's bullshit, La Moral probably invented him to make lazy people think they deserve more. I'm sick of it. If the military wants someone dead, they die. (Recommendation: Recruit)<br><br>G. Silva: My dad knew Umberto. Said he was the best organizer La Joya ever had. Just wanted a fair shake for workers. And the military executed him for that. I think people just wish he was alive. 0x854142C2 1131123 Reminder: Call military office and report following: <br><br>As per our meeting last week, an undercover survey has been conducted of local McKay employees. Troublingly, we found that many workers believe that Umberto Salazar was disfigured or killed by the military. Additionally, 32% believed there is a masked man (\"Phantasma\") who has been responsible for various issues at McKay facilities; 27% believed \"strongly\" that this man is Umberto Salazar (context: Umberto Salazar was responsible for worker unrest during the McKay takeover in 2019. After his terms of employment were rejected, he abandoned his work and disappeared). As per your request, we will note the names of anyone spreading these anti-military rumors and enforce a three-strikes-to-Outcast policy. Increased guerrilla activity is the likely cause of any sightings of masked figures. <br><br>McKay Global appreciates the continued support of Yara's navy and will do everything to support it in return. 0xA901D518 1131117 Team, <br><br>Spread the news to all shifts: If this Yanqui McKay is going to use our labor it'll be on our terms.

This meant working with the country's sole import/exporting company - McKay Global. <br><br>Given Ana's hatred for foreigners, she often clashed with the company's Canadian CEO (This seems to be a common sentiment with this Yanqui). President Castillo had to step in several times to settle several arguments between the two of them. He always assured Admiral Ben\u00edtez that there was a plan with Se\u00f1or McKay and that Yara will get more out of him, than he will get out of Yara. <br><br>President Castillo ordered Admiral Ben\u00edtez to take orders from McKay for the time being. It is part of a plan to take advantage of the Yanqui. 0x3D09B423 1132000 Notes for Untitled Admiral Ben\u00edtez Biography #2<br><br>Everyone in Yara knows about the pivotal moment when Admiral Ben\u00edtez became a household name all across Yara. I had planned to build a rapport with her before asking about that event. Admiral Ben\u00edtez made it the first subject we spoke about. <br><br>Her parents served under the corrupt Espinosa government. They were loyalists who stole money from Yara. <br><br>They asked their daughter to help them flee to the U.S. She arrested her parents and they faced a speedy trial for treason. <br><br>Admiral Ben\u00edtez, then just a lieutenant, oversaw her parent's execution. She says she did not weep for them. I believe her. 0x4A0E84B5 1132001 Soaked Notebook Page 0x4D6340AC 1132005 Soaked Notebook Page 0x6FCB0EA8 1131997 Soaked Notebook Page 0x887323AF 1131999 Soaked Notebook Page 0xA400E599 1132003 Soaked Notebook Page 0xD307D50F 1132002 Notes for Untitled Admiral Ben\u00edtez Biography #3<br><br>Ana was a quiet middle child who spent most of her youth with the crew of her parent's yacht. The rugged seafarers taught her everything about the ocean. Ana recognized the difference between the wealthy who aspired to be Western and the poor who had no other option than to be Yaran. <br><br>As a teenager, she cut ties with her family. Joining the navy was an obvious choice. She became the youngest Lieutenant and, while stationed in the capital, met her future husband. Leon worked in the Administration Office of the Navy. They have two daughters: Ana \"Gorda\" Ben\u00edtez II (9), Ana \"Lita\" Ben\u00edtez III (3).<br><br>Castillo promoted Ana from Lieutenant to Minister of the Navy. With the travel demands of the position, Ana decided that the children needed a stable upbringing. Leon would raise the children and their family's home base would continue to be in the capital. Over the course of my visit, she spoke to her children over a dozen times. 0xD46A1116 1132006 Notes for Untitled Admiral Ben\u00edtez Biography #5<br><br>The second mandate for Admiral Ben\u00edtez? Protect Yara's most important resource - its people. President Castillo feared an exodus by sea. Ben\u00edtez attacked the issue brutally: a zero-tolerance policy leaving the island. She instructed her fleet to execute all defectors, and all dead bodies to be brought ashore and strung up as a stark warning to all Yarans. It didn't take long for the number of escape attempts to drop dramatically. The exact number of deaths is unknown, but the estimate is over 5,000. <br><br>I will need to paint this differently since many Yarans are split on this tactic. <br><br>Ben\u00edtez took me to her favorite place on the island: a cargo crane used for her gruesome \"catch of the day.\" Every morning the body of a recently executed traitor is strung up. The sight was horrific. Bodies are left to rot. Ben\u00edtez asked if I wanted to bet whether or not the body of this Outcast would fall into the ocean by sunset. 0xE6566174 1128646 UNMASKING THE SEA MONSTER 0xFF741339 1131998 Notes for Untitled Admiral Ben\u00edtez Biography #1<br><br>The highest ranking woman in Yara's military means business. <br><br>Before I stepped into her office, she made it clear that she had done her research. She showed me the surveillance file the government has on me. <br><br>She did not let me look inside the thick file, but she called out a dozen facts about me. Past relationships. Friends. Enemies. Even the names of people I had forgotten. <br><br>Who remembers every classmate of every class they've taken? <br><br>I'll tell you who - Yara's section section=0x149D8B80 0x0D456682 1179545 Search TAKING PHOTOS 0x944C3738 1179546 Use [ACTION_CAMERA_TOGGLE] to take out your phone. 0xE34B07AE 1179547 Aim at the target and use [ACTION_TAKEPHOTO] to take a photo. section section=PC 0x1D2B7FD5 1168017 Ubisoft Connect is temporary unavailable.

That's all Santos ever fucking does is read. Meanwhile me and El Tigre are up to our elbows in blood. Revolutions aren't won with books, they're won with bullets. Santos would have died on that beach if it wasn't for me. Since then I've won battle after battle for him. Taught Lucky and Lorenzo everything they know about guerrilla warfare.

No one has my spirit or attitude, he says. I take my new assignment with pride. I'm finally doing something meaningful for Yara. <br><br>I take all my meals and sleep with the people I am meant to teach. I must remain on their level, even if the soldiers give me special privileges like more rations or a blanket. We all wear the same uniform: the Outcast seeking redemption. We should receive our assignments soon - I hope to be sent to El Este so that I can spread Castillo's message further. <br><br>One of the soldiers, my colleague at this point, tells me he will get this letter to you. Please keep my horses a little longer. My only regret in serving Yara this way is that I can't see my animals anymore. <br><br>Omar 0x5A338853 1124350 Summary: Perfectly obedient prisoner, possible delusions<br><br>Description: This report is filed mainly for posterity, and to add to the official record a curious case of an Outcast who believes himself to be part of the project to 'rebuild para\u00edso' through excessive and complete submission. The Outcast in question, 9023, is perfect - no demands or outbursts, follows instructions, and actively aids guards in finding dissidents and potential rebellious inmates. Outcast 9023 actually believes he is working for the military, showing other prisoners how to become True Yarans. <br><br>Again, the commanding officers of our installation wanted to note this Outcast into record as a true oddity. He has not (and likely will never) create any difficulties for the regime. <br><br>Lt. Marcos 0xAA4B1C27 1124346 The local detachment came for my farmland, for the glory of Yara. They didn't have to ask twice. I voted for Castillo, I still believe in his project. <br><br>They need more patriotas like me in the fields, so the sergeant suggested I volunteer. I hear what those terroristas from Libertad say about the Viviro, but I believe nothing. I'm a True Yaran and I will see para\u00edso. <br><br>I should only be gone a few weeks. Feed my horses while I'm away.<br><br>Omar 0xB43DE97F 1124352 i have passed every test. served my country with dignity. bore every burden with a smile. i dream in red and taste viviro when i wake up. this is my privilege. no - my honor.<br><br>i deserve para\u00edso and Ant\u00f3n will give it to me. i, omar pasqual, am the last True Yaran. i miss my horses. 0xD97D033C 1128633 THE LAST PATRIOTA 0xDD4C2CB1 1124347 Dirty Sheet of section section=0x3FCD7CE1 0xB07B28CC 1183278 You're approaching the [DLC_HIGHLIGHT]final challenge[DLC_HIGHLIGHT_END]!

The Minister of Culture, Mar\u00eda Marquessa, is calling the event a violent attack on Yara and claims the group responsible, M\u00e1ximas Matanzas, is a terrorist cell aligned with Libertad. The Minister claims the rap group promotes toxic, violent behavior through their lyrics. <br><br>However, anonymous attendees have come forward to give an account of what happened that day. While the lyrics, written by rapper Talia Benevidez, are often politically charged, the show began peacefully. That changed when the military arrived to break up the crowd. <br><br>Soldiers forcibly removed peaceful citizens, and beat one man who refused to leave. Attempting to stop the attack, a crowd member threw a beer bottle which hit a soldier. In reaction, the military opened fire and threw innocent civilians into trucks slated for Outcast camps.

When he was drunk, he said he'd stolen a bunch of money from the Ministry of Culture - he was the one in charge of this park right? He helped build this place?<br><br>Well, I found some weird chest outside that Tramposa Caf\u00e9. I dug it out, but it's too heavy for me to carry. Maybe he wasn't lying. <br><br>It must be a ton of money - even by Yara's standards, these contractors cut corners here. Built five years ago and looks like they followed a Soviet style guide. If you have the keys you found stashed at the visitors center, let's try our luck to get rich! 0x691FBF1C 1128500 Santino, <br><br>That meddling Dr. Schanz discovered our little slush fund. He's been blabbing to anyone with two ears and a government ID - the Ministry of Culture is quite probably going to have us executed. Schanz has disappeared too, and I'm sure he'll conveniently end his life soon (at least that's what the papers will say). <br><br>Those dinos might not be real, but lets not see what horrific 'accident' will befall us once a government accountant checks the books. Time to collect that emergency fund I stashed near the Tramposa Cafe. Just look for the pterodactyl. <br><br>See you soon, <br><br>Torres 0x7A744A8E 1128541 I was interrogating this guerrilla earlier, and he kept trying to make a deal with me. In between the crying bouts, he would babble about money stashed someplace in the park. It got me thinking, and you know how dangerous that is. <br><br>Remember the park contractor who had the refrigeration unit from the caf\u00e9 'fall' on him, in a horrible twist of fate? I know back then we didn't ask why bad things happened to unlucky people, but cash - or missing cash - tends to motivate extra-judicial killings. <br><br>Look at me, thinking again... Those keys you found and stashed in one of the exhibits at the visitor center might have a use after all.

They definitely knew we could hear them too... 0x334693F4 1154376 Jungles are great for complete cover. The poisonous snakes, less so. A couple guerrillas were bitten. 0x3415899C 1127459 Independent research on the dark web: what could go wrong? 0x342B57ED 1154372 We need better path maintenance - a few guerrillas walked into some semi-poisonous shrubs and headed back to camp for treatment. 0x34783860 1133881 How can teenagers be that cutting?

This should be helpful. 0x362E5C01 1116647 Our homegrown superspy secured the layout and guard shifts. We're ready for the next step. 0x36C0B5D8 1116816 These are former FND - they found our tracker immediately. 0x36FAAB1C 1037416 We had troops set off some flares. The guards were actually dumb enough to leave their posts to investigate. Time to head in. 0x37E4F4DD 1134069 A few overzealous guerrillas say they'll quit Libertad to act full-time now! 0x3840EAB0 1133933 We RIP Pauletta. 0x3844A6C8 1075472 CREATE A DIVERSION 0x38D53E67 1021357 Contact operations pretending to be interested in striking a deal. 0x38DCFD82 1117093 A more suspicious guard radioed ahead that \"some new people\" were coming up.

A couple guerrillas paid the price by stepping on landmines. 0x3F2962D1 1075476 INTERROGATE 0x3FB1399B 1117097 It can't be that hard to pretend to be a rich person, right? 0x3FB8FA7E 1021353 They're just hired thugs, too separated from operations to know anything. We'll have to do some digging elsewhere. 0x3FECB80B 1011491 The locals don't trust us and wouldn't let us stay in the village. Sleeping in the muddy jungle made us even more exhausted than before. 0x404721FE 1020638 We've been tracking a naval convoy that we suspect is headed to the C4 plant in Florida. Time to move. 0x40E3C44B 1134068 We weren't the most convincing FND soldiers. A brutal fire-fight ensued with the stationed military, but we eventually got to the set doors. 0x4120AF72 1020582 Catch some enemy soldiers and interrogate them. 0x41296C97 1116646 Get a Libertad agent on the inside to scope out the facility. 0x41C7854E 1116817 Activate the Libertad social media whisper network and rely on tips to track the anti-aircraft site. 0x41FD9B8A 1037417 We had troops set off some flares to draw away the guards, but they're disciplined. They refused to leave their posts. We might be able to get in from another point. 0x425ADAEC 1133967 The FND is getting the message - the fishers all reported getting FND questions about El Tibur\u00f3n Fantasma once they reached shore. 0x425E9694 1075426 GATHER INTEL 0x4312B90A 1127458 First thing: do some on the ground activism. Figure out where this politician is getting her Yaran support, and how she's getting the message out. 0x432C677B 1154373 FULL CAMO 0x437F08F6 1133880 Somehow, the kids didn't laugh us into submission. They still want more proof we're \"chill\" though... 0x4412CCEF 1133884 We got a couple tacit head nods from some of the ringleader teens. We've got an in, but we'll have to do something cool now. 0x4644A88E 1116642 The commander is an old man and former Russian spy. He has a reputation for being incredibly unstable so we need to be ready for anything. 0x464D6B6B 1020586 We deployed scouts to various high-traffic areas in Kyrat, and were able to track a vehicle bearing Yaran markings back to its base. 0x46905F93 1037413 We managed to slip under a gap in the fence, and narrowly avoided the spotlights. Guards remain at their posts. So far, so good. 0x46AA4157 1116813 Yara is too big... Our scout reports are only offering sporadic movement. 0x47B2485C 1136947 SOW SOME SEEDS 0x482E5247 1075477 COLLECT INTEL 0x48B6090D 1117096 We had to knock out and disable two curious guards. We need to be more careful moving forward. 0x48BFCAE8 1021352 They broke more easily than we thought. They've directed us to three distributors' locations. 0x48EB889D 1011490 The locals invited us to share their shelter and food. Everyone is bright-eyed and ready for a fight. 0x49558860 1134064 Tonight's guests were some Special Forces soldiers who saw our entrance. We had to fight some elite units, but we're at the set doors. 0x4DA480C4 1133888 Our Libertad confidence guise worked. The kids recognized us, but now we need to do something to convince them to skip FND enrolment. 0x4DF6066A 1116713 INFILTRATE 0x4E384C79 1134060 We blew a hole right into the FND security room. A totally unnecessary fight ensued. If only we knew the studio layout. 0x4EB0CD0B 1073947 The convoy's defenses were formidable and we lost some recruits in the attack. 0x4F47DA26 1133932 Parrots don't exactly work like this... Pauletta returned, but if he saw anything he isn't talking. 0x4FD20EF1 1021356 We've snuck around the facility, but all notes and docs have been locked up tight. Nothing lying around here. 0x4FDBCD14 1117092 Easy! The guards barely looked at us as we drove our van through the service entrance. 0x51312F7E 1133926 Shoot anything grey that flies! These birds must have some kind of marker or indicator. 0x5380F332 1116707 Turns out money can't buy everything. The FND take our funds and turn away our guerrillas. 0x54ED372B 1116703 All our hand-to-hand fighters landed safely, and are ready to brawl their way around the ship. 0x55E1CC80 1117038 An elite strike force full of lethal fighters... we win this battle being nimble! 0x565CEB67 1133922 Plant some false stories and see if the FND rolls up on the locations we reveal. 0x569D7DC5 1011484 The locals were so impressed with our organization we even convinced a few of them to join us. Let's hope they can shoot straight. 0x57ABFC4A 1073957 What was supposed to be a simple strike turned into a prolonged firefight with numerous casualties on our side. 0x58325DD6 1116656 SPY ON SPY 0x59F037E1 1116756 The warning is slowly spreading amongst Libertad patrols. So far, so good. 0x5A37563A 1154363 RETRACING STEPS 0x5A83819A 1133877 HELLO FELLOW KIDS 0x5B41EBAD Creative differences on the origins of El Tibur\u00f3n's primeval anger caused a few guerrillas to quit Libertad. 0x5B45A7D5 1075436 CHASE 0x5C2C2FB4 1133973 A few guerrillas were arrested for filing false reports. We haven't heard from them since... 0x5C5780AB 1117034 We've got the supply ship's route - now we just need to decide what kind of task force to assemble for the raid. 0x5D53B9EB 1134021 Security at the server hub is incredibly tight - we couldn't get into any offices to even start a fun surveillance program. 0x5D5A9223 1154367 Those soldiers never stood a chance - they were surprised by our bold choice to take the obvious path. 0x5F2B31EE 1011488 The detonators we brought along turned out to be duds. That's Yaran engineering for you. 0x5F5F99CF 1116652 A guard-shark? You can't plan for that... We lost a few guerrillas. 0x5F8B6ED2 1037403 GAIN ACCESS 0x60099043 1127739 GO UNDERCOVER 0x609A125E 1116876 Sharks, why are there always sharks - some guerrillas didn't make it back to the boat. 0x6189A6E2 1127464 Most Yarans looked at us dumbfounded. They've never heard of this politican, so we're back to where we started. 0x61BFC044 1116991 ENTRAP 0x631E5421 1020704 We surprised the convoy and took out several ships. The remaining crew escaped on a dinghy and led us straight to the base. 0x637CE2E3 1117041 Snipers and paratroopers - it just sounds cool! 0x63CF18BB 1127764 We tailed him and got useful intel on his travel plans. Our scouts were never detected. 0x641126FA 1117045 A few of our finest fighters were taken down by FND bullets. 0x64380F4B 1116699 Use the cover of darkness to board the ship with a crack team of jujitsu experts. 0x659D9EC8 1073977 We got too hasty and the guards spotted us, sniping a couple of our troops. 0x65DA8F28 1021281 Our \"barista\" makes some damn good \"coffee.\" Our troops are pumped up and ready for action. 0x667EB112 1116599 COMPETE 0x66E462FB 1127460 We hit pay dirt! Yaran Pesos are flowing into the foreign politician's coffers. We know our next move. 0x67F7D647 1116872 No boats and no survivors. We've gained no new intel about the attack. 0x683FEAC9 1127468 A few of our guerrilla researchers got into too many forum arguments. They need some time off. 0x68A53920 1116591 Her follower count took a hit - the bots are paying off! 0x69BFDC68 1127735 Unsurprisingly, the villa has intense security and a few of our troops were spotted and shot. Getting close is too risky. 0x69E25DF8 1021333 We missed one guard and he managed to pull an alarm which called for backup. We're in, but we'll be busy. 0x6A795490 1127768 We arrived too late to catch the general as he got in early and slipped away. He could be anywhere now. 0x6AA8180A 1020708 The convoy was prepared for attacks and put up a damn good fight. We had to cut off the pursuit. 0x6B28BCBA 1116927 Those angry former soldiers sure can talk! We've got all the intel we need about the island lab. 0x6BCE9788 1134058 Blow a hole through the exterior wall. Quick and easy, but does announce that we're here to save guerrillas. 0x6C4578A3 1116923 We've got spies deep in the FND - time to call in some favors. 0x6D871294 1116823 SCOUT 0x6DA76AD1 1117049 JUST RIGHT 0x6E2F302C 1073826 Some of our troops went into the jungle for wood and never came back. We suspect jaguars. 0x6ED21871 1127731 Pose as civilian workers scattered around the island. 0x6FC8FD39 1116595 Nobody cared - even our stories in newspapers failed to get any attention. 0x7037FD25 1020518 Canvass the locals for information. 0x7068F416 1075406 Several scouts haven't reported back. They must have gotten lost. 0x70A4ED29 1127725 Scope out the villa and its surroundings. 0x71132E31 1134015 The genius bar wants us near the FND server building to see if we can get some \"free\" wifi to give the nerds a shot at the network. 0x71D57D46 1117100 Who can imagine that such a simple task can be dangerous? 0x72338DFB 1116937 RUMORS 0x72DD6422 1116766 FND snipers shot a few guerrillas trying to boost our signal. 0x755E49E2 1116933 One of the more hostile ex-FND paratroopers opened fire and killed a few guerrillas. 0x75B0A03B 1116762 All the boats are returning to shore - there's some time to plan a next step. 0x767EEA28 1134011 Our IT spies need a \"backdoor\" into the FND system. We don't know what that means, but hopefully they'll have some instructions. 0x767F7937 1116989 Our guerrilla ransom negotiators quit the cause due to the high-stress environment. 0x76B8B95F 1117104 WAITSTAFF 0x76D3CC78 1116585 SOCIAL STRATEGY 0x7794A8A0 1021327 Our team has arrived at the facility. A strategic plan to get in would be great. 0x78A4F105 1116981 The FND negotiator is too cagey to give up the location. We now don't have enough time to plan a proper surprise attack. 0x78A5621A 1134019 Time to do spy things! Sneak in and bug the place to get some passwords. 0x7912A102 1127729 Observing the enemy gave us some good info on which areas are more concentrated. This will serve us well when rescuing civilians. 0x79669B32 1116881 RADIO 0x7981231F 1116866 The mayday location is strewn with wreckage. We need to find any survivors. 0x7AD429FA 1127774 While trying to attach the device in the plane's undercarriage, several of our troops cut the wrong wire and electrocuted themselves. 0x7B0CD3BD 1073984 A few of our fighters saw an opportunity for a more lucrative life and left Libertad to join the arms dealers. Greed is a powerful thing. 0x7B4BC25D 1021272 MISSION PREP 0x7C260644 1021276 We couldn't find any vehicles to shoot. Today must be an off-day for convoys. 0x7D68A179 1020710 We spent more time discussing our strategy and improved our plan of action. 0x7DB9EDE3 1127770 We successfully bugged his plane and he is none the wiser. We even stole some gasolina from the hangar. 0x7F658053 1116589 None of our posts took off. Clout can be bought overnight, but we don't have those kinds of resources right now. 0x7FC9351C 1116985 Agree to the FND terms. She's too valuable and popular an organizer to mess around. 0x7FF4EE0D 1136936 ALOOF RECON 0x7FFF53BA 1127470 Looks like the FND monitors the line - they deduced we were Libertad and sent a raid to our location where a few guerrillas fell in the firefight. 0x80106062 1075410 SCOUT AND SALVAGE 0x8081F8CD 1021335 We had a little fireworks party on a boat. While the guards were busy figuring out what the fuck was going on, we snuck through the entrance. 0x80DC795D 1127733 The soldiers noticed right away. They keep track of their civilian workers closely and came after us. We'll have to retreat. 0x81C69C15 1116597 A few guerrillas with alts got geotagged and captured! 0x824B198F 1116921 FIND THE STRONGHOLD 0x8380224C 1116697 GETTING TO THE RING 0x838973B8 1116821 A few guerrillas were caught trying to plant the device and paid with their lives. 0x84E4B7A1 1116825 CROWDSOURCE 0x8526DD96 1116925 Even our spies don't know anything, aside from the facility being on a remote island off the coast. 0x85FCBEAA 1136971 THE OLD FASHIONED WAY 0x86AB580C 1116593 Post on all platforms and through traditional media about her lies. 0x86E0556E 1116978 The FND open hostage negotiations by demanding a ridiculous amount of money and weapons. We need a response. 0x87223F59 1116878 The radio short-circuited and exploded, claiming a few guerrilla lives. 0x87B1BD44 1127737 SURVEILLANCE 0x87EC3CD4 1021331 Quickly and quietly take out the guards. 0x88EA03D7 1127462 Get out to the people, and get as much info from average Yarans. 0x89971D2B 1073828 The flies here must be carrying some sort of disease. A few of our recruits got some nasty bites and are too sick to fight. 0x89F9B76B 1116870 This kind of wreckage only comes from military attacks. Be on alert. 0x8A1F47D6 1117047 BIG 0x8AACBD8E 1127762 We need to verify the target's movements and plan our attack - our next move has to be perfect. 0x8B7447C9 1073992 We tried sneaking under the fence, but we found out the hard way that it was electric. Some of our troops were electrocuted badly. 0x8C76BA8F 1134056 ENTER STAGE LEFT 0x8C9091BD 1116929 Work the community! Someone on the coast must have seen something... 0x8D0D60A8 1075445 AMBUSH PRACTICE 0x8D10350D 1020706 Chase the convoy out on the open water. 0x8D7283CF 1117043 The enemy just retreated below deck once the first shots were fired. Not an ideal outcome. 0x8DC17997 1127766 We can head to his destination ahead of time in disguise as tourists and intercept him on arrival. 0x8E947372 1116874 We managed to pick up a few more survivors who've explained what happened. 0x8F87C7CE 1127466 Cash is an international language. We scored an invite to the next big fundraiser! 0x8FB1A168 1116993 AGREE 0x902C85A7 1021329 We're in. The guards were new and forgot to verify our paperwork and credentials. Complete idiots. 0x91C75430 1116987 The FND negotiator senses weakness. They ask for more weapons and a timeline too rapid to plan a proper response. 0x91F13296 1127472 CANVASS! 0x92286768 1021274 Use some enemy shooting skills. 0x923C07D9 1136969 LOW-TECH 0x926F7688 1073982 We got hasty and took some hits before subduing the soldiers. A few troops are out of commission. 0x93B78CCF 1127772 Several scouts were killed en route to the target by a passing military convoy. They will be remembered. 0x94DA48D6 1127776 POSE AS CIVILIANS 0x95654925 1116768 PROTECT 0x96AA9029 1116983 We've got a lock on her location. We'll have the upper hand freeing the labor organizer now. 0x978FD022 1020516 GATHERING INFO 0x97D0D911 1075408 SET TRAPS 0x984CC30A 1136938 The teens just asked how we could be so disloyal to the True Yaran government. It doesn't look like they took us seriously. 0x98708B04 1134013 We didn't get caught, and the dongle didn't explode. We'd call that a success, for now. 0x98DDAD54 1116587 Start a social media campaign to challenge her propaganda. 0x99C7481C 1127723 ISLAND VILLA 0x9B5028CE 1116931 The fishers are too scared to rat on the FND - this facility must be the real deal... 0x9B6DF3DF 1136982 NIGHT RAID 0x9B9E2B43 1021278 We ambushed an enemy convoy and ended up killing a high-ranking officer. The more of those we take out, the better. 0x9BBEC117 1116760 The water is too rough, and multiple patrols have radioed in requesting to break the standstill. The death squad can move freely again. 0x9C3DECD7 1116935 MOLES 0x9CD3050E 1116764 A couple guerrillas climbing our cell towers to boost the signal fell to their deaths. 0x9E390E18 1116868 We pulled several Outcasts from the ocean who helped explain what happened. 0x9E66953A 1075404 We managed to scrounge up some much-needed supplies. We're well equipped for the fight ahead. 0x9EAA8C05 1127727 The layout of the villa is confusing and took a lot of time to map out. If we spend too much time doing this, we're more likely to be spotted. 0x9F1D4F1D 1134017 Turns out wandering around a highly secured server facility with your phone out is a really easy way to get caught by FND patrols... 0x9FDB1C6A 1117102 Some of our billionaire guerrilla's entourage were arrested for being too rowdy. 0xA00A655B 1136949 FEATHERED FRIENDS 0xA0362D55 1134062 Use the cover of darkness to surprise the hostage takers. 0xA149BB0A 1133930 Free a loyal Yaran parrot to track the grey-winged menace and report back. 0xA14DF772 1075471 QUICK ATTACK 0xA1D5AC38 1117090 First we need to sneak onto La Coleccionista's estate the night of the big soiree. 0xA1DC6FDD 1021354 Sneak into the warehouse and look for any transaction records. 0xA3F86746 1116711 STEALTH 0xA5E2F7EB 1133969 A guerrilla who tagged along with the fishers got lost at sea. 0xA5E6BB93 1075428 SCOUT 0xA6110209 1073841 Our recruits are not well-equipped for mountaineering and there were a few fatal falls while trying to get into position. 0xA67FA849 1116819 Too many trolls de mierda sending in fake data. Our crowdsourcing has given us bad intel. 0xA6914190 1116648 Radio silence from our spy - that can't be good, and we've got no info. 0xA6B1ABC4 1021350 We need to track down the arms distributors - time to do some investigating. 0xA6B86821 1117094 Rich people need waiters - Libertad is here to (briefly) serve. 0xA75BE94C 1134066 Pose as FND reinforcements to better fortify the studio against Libertad attacks. 0xA8430A47 1020584 The scouts we caught were tough nuts to crack. We only got sketchy info from them before they took their own lives. 0xA86A23F6 1021358 The assistant on the phone bought our ruse and arranged for meetings with three different distributors. We're in business. 0xA89E3EBF 1037411 Our snipers took out several guards, but one survived and called for backup. The jail is surrounded and guards are on high alert. 0xA8A4207B 1116811 Get as many Libertad eyes on the road as possible. All scouts, scouting all the time. 0xA908E00C 1073949 Several guerrillas complained loudly about missing a golden opportunity, making the whole group nervous and annoyed. A few went AWOL. 0xAA1CADC3 1133886 Words hurt! A few guerrillas couldn't stand the name-calling and left. 0xAA4FC24E 1154375 Slow and steady finds the cave. We reached our destination and not a single FND soldier spotted us. 0xAC54BBC0 1133965 If we're going to use an ancient legend to scare off the FND, we need to make sure people actually know about the legend of El Tibur\u00f3n Fantasma. 0xAD220657 1154371 We snuck past the FND with ease - we could see them, but they had no idea we were so close. 0xAD7169DA 1133882 A couple kids bullied some guerrillas so badly they left the skatepark. 0xAF0E240A 1117098 Our fake guerrilla billionaire named dropped Chirico, and the entire Libertad entourage got in easy! 0xAF270DBB 1116644 Our scouts got the layout AND stole supplies... completely unseen. Excellent work. 0xAF2ECE5E 1020580 The locals provided some general information, pointing us to a village. Some even agreed to join our cause. 0xAFC9E462 1116815 The mobile site has been bugged! Now we can reallocate our guerrillas and beat these deserters. 0xAFF3FAA6 1037415 Distract the guards, then sneak past their posts. 0xB151F8E3 1116650 Our guerrillas broke the code in a day! We've bugged their entire comms. 0xB2224E98 1133971 The sheer volume of reports has tweaked some FND commanders. A lot of our fake reports are getting follow-up requests. 0xB259E187 1117036 The bold strategy was wise - we easily handled the FND forces on board. Now to find the weapons. 0xB354F30F 1154365 DIRECT ROUTE 0xB438DE35 1116709 A couple guerrillas' parachutes didn't open. At least they dented the ship when they landed. 0xB54F8A81 1133975 The legend is forcing itself into reality. We've seen several FND patrol people talking or reading our little scary story. 0xB63C3CFA 1116654 A radio array short-circuited and electrocuted our guerrillas. Talk about bad luck... 0xB6890279 1133928 We only discovered that all our guerrillas are awful shots. We didn't hit a single bird. 0xB7FE56CD 1116754 We need to protect our guerrillas without giving away our knowledge of the hit squad. 0xB8528A4B 1133920 TO CATCH A (WINGED) THIEF 0xB8931CE9 1011486 Lay explosive traps along the 0xBAE35607 1116701 Our approach boat was spotted and blown to pieces. We probably should have given our guerrillas guns... 0xBB213C30 1116601 COUNTER-MESSAGE 0xBD3BAC9D 1133879 Is \"fly\" still cool? teens, try not to embarrass Libertad. 0xBD8E921E 1116705 Access the ship as a wealthy Yaran gambling contingent who want to bet on the fights. 0xBE481AE6 1116758 Command all current patrols to hold their position through emergency protocols. 0xBF3F4E52 1133924 No luck - the FND either didn't get our false info, or the pigeon master is smarter than we thought at parsing intel. 0xBF5E87CC 1037409 Snipe the perimeter guards, steal their uniforms, and enter the jail. 0xBF649908 1116809 LOCK-ON BLUES 0xBFFED8F0 1011482 Our troops arrived with some time to prepare before the enemy shows up. A little extra work could guarantee our victory. 0xC0F9665B 1116755 Pass the message to reliable guerrilla commanders currently on patrol. 0xC11225DD 1117089 GETTING IN THE DOOR 0xC13B0C6C 1116655 RECON 0xC18E32EF 1133929 Friendly fire is always bad, and somehow worse when we're shooting at pigeons. These guerrillas will be avenged. 0xC2331508 1117033 HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH? 0xC248BA17 1133974 Write the full Legend of El Tibur\u00f3n Fantasma and plaster the nearby FND installations with printed versions of the story. 0xC24CF66F 1075435 AMBUSH 0xC33FEEA3 1116708 A couple guerrillas got excited and tried to punch away bullets. They didn't make it. 0xC453C399 1154364 Benito's sure he dropped the weapon in a cave deep in FND territory. Time to get spelunking. 0xC45AE851 1134022 Some intrepid security guards gunned down our spies as they planted the bugs. 0xC5257E0E 1133970 Send in false reports to the FND about soldiers and civilians lost at sea in the bay near the fort. 0xC55ED111 1117037 Not a lot of \"surprise\" in our plan. The enemy has refortified their defenses below deck... with the weapons. 0xC656C875 1116651 They keep swapping the code, and we're running out of time. Better just move ahead without info. 0xC6762221 1021349 FIND THE DEALERS 0xC714E1DB 1073958 Unfortunately this \"coffee\" was pretty strong and few of our recruits OD'd. The rest of us will stick to tobacco for now. 0xC8387EC4 1133925 Our fake intel still got a careless guerrilla killed when they wandered into the ambush. 0xC859B75A 1037408 We've arrived at the black site and are waiting outside under cover of night. We need to get access. 0xC8F9E866 1011483 Build defensive fortifications. 0xC94F2A70 1116759 We've bought our guerrillas some time - at least any mobile patrol boats will be considered hostile. 0xCA3C9C0B 1133878 The FND program targets kids at a local skatepark. How can we do some clandestine research? 0xCA89A288 1116704 Do you know about wind? Our guerrillas didn't, overshot the tanker, and are now target practice for 0xCC260CA6 1116600 TROLL deck! Now to stop the competition... 0xCDE58FB2 1154368 A few stray bullets injured some guerrillas. They've returned to base camp. 0xCE16648C 1136958 SCARE THE FISHERFOLK 0xCF55BADD 1133921 First, we need to verify this winged enemy really exists. Trapping an airborne mole might be hard... 0xCF942C7F 1011487 A nasty surprise is waiting for anyone who tries to enter the village. This will give us a major leg up in the fight. 0xCFB64E88 1075487 DISTRACT GUARDS 0xD05CD9DA 1134067 We should have all been cast in daytime soaps. These were the roles we were destined to play, and now we're outside the set doors. 0xD0F83C6F 1020637 CLOCKING THE CONVOY 0xD116329F 1073840 We lost a few recruits during our efforts to snag some soldier prisoners. 0xD17898DF 1116818 Using a heat map, we can map the anti-aircraft site's movement. We're ready to move on it now. 0xD1967106 1116649 Try to break the facility's radio code to get valuable intel. 0xD1B69B52 1021351 Capture some soldiers protecting the warehouse and see if they know something. 0xD1BF58B7 1117095 These FND guards are too lazy - they didn't even bother to check our IDs. 0xD2E5C77D 1133968 The FND didn't bite. The fishers even heard snickering on the other side of the radio. 0xD3ADA49B 1127457 GET A GRIP 0xD4FF57D0 1116710 A few guerrillas fall overboard boarding the tanker. Bad luck and fewer fighters moving foward. 0xD64AC7E4 1075470 GO UNDERCOVER 0xD64E8B9C 1133931 Pauletta the parrot is a real Libertad hero. He divulged the location of a weird farm in the hills that smelled of pigeon. 0xD6D29CAE 1117091 Can't be too hard to sneak past the guards as a generic delivery person, right? 0xD6DB5F4B 1021355 We found one of the manager's transaction notes left in a receiving area. This could be our golden ticket. 0xD70D55CD 1136948 TARGET PRACTICE 0xD7311DC3 1134063 Guerrilla ops always go better at night. We took out a couple guards and reached the set doors with ease. 0xD809149C 1117099 Our guerrilla billionaire's accent wasn't fancy enough - the guards weren't paying attention, so we snuck in the back. 0xD8203D2D 1116645 Our scouts have gone silent - looks like we're going in blind. 0xD829FEC8 1020581 The locals were all too eager to take the money we offered them, but the quality of information they provided left much to be desired. 0xD8914FD6 1075478 POSE AS BUYERS 0xD8CED4F4 1116814 We need to get a tracking device on the anti-aircraft site to make our lives easier. 0xD8F4CA30 1037414 We tried sneaking under the fence, but the spot lights going over the tarmac caught us. We weren't quick enough. We had to scatter and meet at a rendezvous point. 0xDA2536C1 1154370 Use Libertad's best friend: the guerrilla paths marked by our blue and white sigils. 0xDA76594C 1133883 Just watch, but in a cool way. We can't be weird or needy. 0xDB538B56 1133964 SPREAD THE LEGEND 0xDD1B9D55 1133887 We're guerrillas dammit! We don't need to pretend to be cool, we ARE cool. 0xDD48F2D8 1154374 A guerrilla has to know the jungle to survive - why not start now, and take to the trees to reach the cave. 0xDE0FD09A 1073948 We lost several boats to enemy fire and treacherous water. 0xDF443AD1 1020585 Send out troops to observe the roads and villages. 0xDF4DF934 1116641 FORMER KGB? 0xDF6D1360 1021359 The assistant on the other end saw right through us and threatened to track our number. They're not as stupid as we thought. 0xDF990E29 1037410 Our snipers shot a few guards down, and our troops quickly went in, traded uniforms, and headed in. Let's see how long we can maintain cover for. 0xDFA310ED 1116810 We need to devise a way to track the anti-aircraft site while it moves, or more Yarans will suffer. 0xE08872A5 1116865 SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS? 0xE088E0B4 1020517 We've arrived in Kyrat but have minimal info on where the officer is. 0xE0D7E987 1075409 REST 0xE1ADA0BF 1116982 Time for some Libertad spy craft! Trace the call to the FND holding facility. 0xE26279B3 1116769 RETREAT 0xE3DD7840 1127777 PLANT A BUG 0xE4B0BC59 1127773 A few of our guerrillas got nabbed by customs on arrival and missed their chance to tail the general. We'll get them out later. 0xE52F57FE 1021275 We not only took out a solid chunk of FND reinforcements during our practice, but we scored some of the gasolina they were hauling as well. 0xE568461E 1073983 Security guards spotted us lurking around the facility and started shooting. We retreated, but there were some casualties. 0xE6C064A6 1116986 The FND agree to the swap and give us enough time to prepare a counterattack. 0xE6F60200 1127473 FAUX DONATION 0xE6FDBFB7 1136935 SPEAK THE LINGO 0xE72BB531 1021328 Go undercover as regime officers to gain entry. 0xE78B1CFC 1073839 Many of our recruits aren't used to the freezing weather conditions here, and several have fallen ill with hypothermia. 0xE81A7F8B 1134016 Nobody password protects their printer wifi, apparently. The techies are happy, and we can move forward with the operation. 0xE8DC2CFC 1117103 DELIVERY PERSON 0xE93E3E8E 1116869 We only found bodies - we're too late. 0xE961A5AC 1075405 There's not much here but mud and insects. We'll have to make do with whatever we have. 0xE9ADBC93 1127726 The island isn't as populated as we thought and we were able to map the layout of the villa and any escape routes, supplies, and houses the soldados stay in. 0xEB3ADC41 1116934 A couple guerrillas quit Libertad to become true salty dogs (fishing can't be easier than fighting). 0xEBD43598 1116765 The hold order worked, but an FND patrol captured one of our stationary guerrilla boats. 0xEBE0BF7D 1136960 THE LEGEND IN PRINT 0xEC571858 1116930 A few fishers report constant traffic in and out of a remote cay. Looks like we've found the spot. 0xEC6AC349 1136983 FALSE REINFORCEMENTS 0xEC991BD5 1021279 One of our recruits revealed our position to the enemy too early. They managed to escape and we achieved nothing. 0xECB9F181 1116761 Order a full retreat due to a false report of an FND attack on shore. 0xEF4BF39C 1136939 A couple guerrillas had high school flashbacks and left the skatepark out of sheer embarrassment. 0xEF77BB92 1134012 We love the simple explanations. The IT techs gave us a thumb drive to plug into a switchbox up a phone pole near an FND server hub. 0xEFDA9DC2 1116586 We've creeped her socials and gathered info on her contract with the regime. Time to make our first online move. 0xF0250FCF 1116879 DIVE 0xF0B68DD2 1127736 The civilians trust us, but some soldados suspected something was up. They've killed a few of our disguised recruits. 0xF0EB0C42 1021330 Our unshaven guerrillas were immediately sniffed out and had to kill their way in.

There's got to be a financial connection... section section=PlayGo 0x014D9AE2 1149731 Are you feeling lucky? You've stumbled onto a rare find here - the secrets of la revoluci\u00f3n, if we're being honest. We guerrillas have a code, passed down from the heroes of the first revolution in '67 to all of us just trying to survive today. Use your intuition, your dreams, anything really - the numbers all mean something and should be recognizable to any guerrilla fighting for Yara's freedom. <br><br>We hide our Criptogramas out of the way, on guerrilla paths, and even in plain sight - the FND doesn't speak our language or know our symbols, so they're safe. Happy hunting, and we hope these chests offer something of value for the revolution! 0x0191F7BC 1121618 Supremo: Part One<br><br>It came to me in a fever dream.

Her name is Clara Garc\u00eda.<br><br>Desertion is a dangerous game to play. The first step is not to leave the military. Contact Libertad first. It isn't difficult if you know where to look.

There is hope. 0x22C12566 1155208 Those fishermen are generous with the catch, but we need more boats. We keep shuttling guerrillas to where they're needed most, but there's no guarantee their skiffs and RHIBs ever make it back. <br><br>I get that guerrillas can't exactly be picky with the help we get, but maybe ask if they're willing to do a few more smuggling runs a week. I know they're running passes to the coast of El Este and sometimes up to Siniestra - even moving a few extra bodies would be a huge help. 0x24672C4D 1121620 He Apparently such a thing as too much depleted uranium <br>- Freeze Ray: test it out on my drink<br>- Exploding shit: Yanquis used it North Africa, why not us?<br>- One in four guerrillas who go out with the Supremos don't come back.

Get out there and execute! 0x35019C15 1155210 Little brother! I'm glad you've finally seen the light and given up on that FND dream. Fighting against Castillo isn't glamorous (you've seen the camp, it isn't exactly the Hotel Para\u00edso) but we're just trying to survive. <br><br>Just stop fucking around on patrol - I don't want to see you high with a gun in your hands. Save that shit for after the war. <br><br>And if you ask \"did we pick blue for Libertad because of the flowers\" in front of a crowd of guerrillas ever again, I'll disown you. 0x37893F1D 1140141 Remember Guerrillas, a chainsaw engine in hand is worth two dead soldados in the bush. What Juan is saying is SCAVENGE with a fucking purpose. <br><br>Find scraps? Good. Tape them together at a workbench. Everything you find has a purpose in our fight. We got guerrillas all over Yara brewing homegrown nitroglycerine and fashioning plastic bottles into silencers. <br><br>The world is our Libertad oyster, so get your fucking hands dirty and dig around in the garbage! <br><br>-Juan We found love in a truly hopeless place Dominic - at first I just thought you were another rude boy who joined the military, but I soon realized you were a diamond. Take a bow because you completely changed my mind; I've got love on the brain.

You won't find it growing anywhere else in the world. The blue on the true Yaran flag comes from this flower, as the dye used on the first flags was made by grinding up its petals. <br><br>The story goes that when a guerrilla falls fighting for Yara's freedom, a Mariposa flower grows by the body. They are the 'Tears of Yara'. This is obviously just a folk story, and has more to do with a famous poem by Lorenzo Canseco than any truth. <br><br>The reality is the flower prefers dry, remote, shaded locations - exactly the kind of ground guerrillas also thrive in, and the Legends of '67 used these plants to mark safe routes away from government patrols. Searching for guerrillas, the soldiers never thought to look for flowers first. 0xD6590660 1121536 The residents of this home offered shelter to known Libertad terrorists. As such their property and domicile have been seized as FND contraband; aiding and abetting guerrilla activities in the region will result in the strictest punishment allowed by Yaran law. 0xD9875E31 1140143 These FND comemierdas aren't civil at the best of times, but if you so much as step foot into any of their Restricted Areas, you will be fucking shot on sight.<br><br>Use your eyes and ears to assess the situation.

Isla Santuario recently received a new military installation near Vencejo Channel that guarantees air superiority. <br><br>The Anti-Aircraft Site will be administered and maintained by some of the FND's most eager officers.

John, our champion voice, was defeated by false idols. Jacob had the wolves come his door - he fought bravely and will be remembered. Glorious Faith, sister to us all, could not convince our pursuers to see the light. <br><br>Despite the work of interlopers who did not understand God's plan, the Seed Family's sacrifices were not in vain. The Collapse did come, and the Father survived. In prayer and meditation, he bides his time in a bunker with the Deputy - the one who brought hell to our doorstep.<br><br>Yes, the world has ended... but we survived.

With extreme prejudice. <br><br>Cornered, will Kyrat's most underhanded General face Pagan in noble and glorious combat? Or will her deceitful ways continue? Will Yuma's poisoned bullet (that is also, inexplicably, radioactive) finally defeat our noble King-turned-spymaster, or will the fatal shot simply cure Pagan's latent and undiagnosed leukemia? <br><br>Tune in this Sunday at 8PM Kyrati Central Time for a taste of the King's majesty, and his underlings deviousness! 0x1D9A13F2 1129932 So, I was doing some amateur architectural daydreaming - thinking about ways to torture the next Jason that walks into my life and BOOM. This fucking idea hits me. And I don't want to fuckin' forget so: <br><br>Vaas' PRISON OF ONE: <br><br>- a big fucking pillar with little slots, windows, blinds, contrivances, whatever the fuck, to watch inmates<br><br>- cells all the way around the circular structure with the doors facing the pillar<br><br>- one single guard (Lil' Montenegro Jr.) <br><br>The beauty of my ORIGINAL IDEA is that you only need one person in the guard pillar thingy. The prisoners just THINK there's always someone watching them, so they fucking... they act accordingly. They're too stupid or scared to pull anything, and the one guard just gets to chill and eat mangos, watch porn, whatever. It's perfect. <br><br>Jason would hate it, which means I fucking love it. Now I just need to actually take some prisoners instead of, you know, killing them on sight. 0x1EBA7A81 1156934 Pagan Min has it all - money, fame, a whole nation under his thumb... but who did he leave behind? Who did he step on, to reach his golden Kyrati throne? <br><br>Let's start from the beginning. MOHAN GHALE, Golden Path rebel leader, hated the King with every fiber of his being. So much so that he sent his wife ISHWARI GHALE to spy on Pagan. Instead of ending his rule, Pagan and Ishwari fell in love and even had a child: LAKSHMANA MIN. The happy family was clearly built to fail. <br><br>Infanticide, murder, and an escape to America followed. Before Ishwari died, she told her son AJAY GHALE to return to Kyrat - a cryptic wish for the reunion of mother and daughter. But when Ajay returned, it wasn't the happy reunion Pagan had hoped it would be. The flames of old wounds and family drama were stoked by Pagan's top general and childhood friend, YUMA LAU. Her waning faith in the King's ruthlessness only deepened the violent rift between Pagan and his pseudo-stepson.<br><br>But now? Our great King Pagan has the opportunity to make it all right. Will he defeat the external threats and reunite his family? Can Lakshmana be saved, and Ishwari redeemed? Will Pagan finally ascend, becoming the perfect man we all know he can be?<br><br>Of course he will. He's Pagan fucking Min. 0x22B171BA 1129947 Saint Faith 0x25DCB5A3 1129943 Saint Jacob 0x28072CA7 1157127 \"Proof of purchase that, under the guidance of the Voice, any wretched soul can be redeemed.\" 0x28EE7F9C 1180067 Proverbs 22:16 Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty. <br><br>Find the idols made in your name, and take from those who have too much. <br><br>1 - The jail holds more than just prisoners. <br>2 - A boat, in the shadow of your monument. <br>3 - Your salvation on the hill hides a secret. <br>4 - The crossroads marked by a tower and the wind. <br>5 - With the flayed sinner of the hillside. <br>6 - Perched on your banner, overlooking Eden. <br>7 - Shadowed, guarding the dock of Fall's End. <br>8 - Watching over those who ruin the natural world. <br>9 - Tucked away, in the barren shell of the land's bounty. <br>10 - Alongside the mighty buck of the valley.<br><br>Eden's Gospel 23:19 Those who covet, or those who imagine without doing, betray themselves.
