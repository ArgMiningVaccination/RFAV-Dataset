My first position in the oral health field was as a Practice Administrator for a General Dentist. I will always be thankful for this opportunity to work one on one with patients to help them get the dental care they needed. I learned about the financial barriers that some patients experienced as well as the emotional impact the fear of dental care can create. This experience has helped me continue to relate to the hundreds of thousands of Nevadans I have serviced in my career. I have a good understanding of the delivery of care. My perspective is not only from a dental practice stand point, but from t he insurance payer position and the thousands of routine experiences from the education and triage of care that impacts the patient so broadly; socially, self -confidence, and overall health. I have pioneered dental care management and care coordination programs that have increased awareness of the importance of oral health. My day -to-day, relevant experience and access to resources have allowed me to witness the need for greater oral health awareness in our community and act upon it. With informational rack cards and outreach, including deployment of a proprietary mobile dental unit, I have experienced firsthand the results of being pro -active in connecting patients to care providers. It has also been a goal to help educate others about the importance of oral health and the relationship to overall health. My position over the years has given me to meet and work with our members and local business and union leaders. I have seen the difference this education can make in the lives of children, parents and seniors. I have served on the Community Coalition for Oral Health since 2014 . In 2015 I was elected to chair and I currently remain in the chair position. The goal is to keep the coalitions in Nevada working to bring the dental community together to suppo rt one another . I also service on the board of Oral Health Nevada. I have served on the United Labor Agency of Nevada trustee for approximately 18 years. I was elected as Secretary and remain on the Executive Board. ULAN is a 501 C3 and assists individuals and families who are experiencing the hardship of a n unexpected crisis . The goal is to improve the quality of life for workers and their families and the community at large. I also work on three charity golf tournaments in the community that help suppor t community charities.
