Financial Statements and notes 55 3 Chairman's report Welcome to the Annual Report and Annual Accounts for 2018/2019 for East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EMAS). For EMAS, t his has been a n exciting year of great significance , and I am pleased to update you on our work to make the very best use of our resources to achieve quality care for our patients. As medicine advances, health needs change and society develops , so the NHS has to continually move forward so that in 10 years' time we have a service fit for the future. In January 2019, NHS England published the NHS Long Term Plan - designed to give everyone the best start in life; deliver world -class care for majo r health problems, and help people age well. NHS organisations, including EMAS, are coming together to think about how the plan can help local people, and setting up ways for NHS organisations and local councils to work closer together to make health and care better for everyone. To ensure we continue to play our part in the wider development of the NHS, d uring the year we engaged with staff, and organisations and individual s, to create 'The Big 3: Respond | Develop | Collaborate' - a summary of EMAS' r efreshed vision, strategic priorities and organis ational value s. Overall, people supported the direction set out and the wording used to describe our journey (as featured on pages 11 and 12 of this report) . The Big 3 strategic aims are popular, with many r espondents saying they are concise, easy to understand and achievable . In May 2018, we were delighted to announce that we and NHS Hardwick Clinical Commissi oning Group (CCG) had agreed new contract terms to see an extra \u00a39 million invested by the CCGs in our area to give us extra funding for clinical staff, ambulances and other resources. Since then, life at EMAS has been as busy as it has ever been, and work has progressed at pace . We had to be ambitious in our plans to ensure we use d the funding wisely , and I recognise that this has created additional pressure for many working at EMAS. I wish to pay tribute to everyone at the service for the professional ism, contribution , commitment and tenacity shown throughout the year - we have much to be proud of. Using the additional funding we have recruited and trained over 230 new, additional frontline clinicians, purchased 47 new urgent care ambulances, and following the introduction of 68 new accident and emerency ambulances, a further 67 have come into servic e (40 are replacements and 27 are additional vehicles). Additionally, in February 2019, we were delighted to announce that the EMAS ambulance van conversion had been judged as the best in the UK by NHS Improvement, with the EMAS Fiat Ducato conversion emer ging as the clear winner. Alongside the biggest recruitment programme ever undertaken at EMAS, it was also necessary to develop our education programme, building new facilities and renovat ing existing estate to provide the additional classroom space need ed to accommodate our new employees and to further enhance learning and education for our existing staff. Our Leicestershire Rosings building has been renovated and in Northamptonshire we installed 4 a new modular building for education purposes, meaning colleagues no longer need to travel further afield to receive their training. Nationally there are not enoug h qualified paramedics to allow us to recruit people 'straight off the shelf', therefore our education and operational teams, supported by others at EMAS, have been working incredibly hard to develop our own education programme s. This approach will allow existing colleagues to progress to paramedic and creates more opportunities for people to join EMAS and progress through the clinical ranks. In August 2018, we launched a new training centre with Nottingham Trent University (NTU). This exciting partn ership provides us with facilities at Clifton Campus, accommodating initially over 160 recruits who started training in September 2018 , and after qualifying joined our frontline staff as Ambulance Technicians from January 2019. This new partnership, along side work with our regional higher education institute partners, is a positive step forward to provide more development opportunities for our staff and stren gthen and improve patient care. In March 2019, we announced the appointment of EMAS' new medical director, Dr Leon Roberts MBE, an ex-Army doctor who for the past seven years has flown regularly with one of the region's 999 emergency helicopters. In addit ion, Dr Roberts has worked as a GP in the Emergency Department at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and as an urgent care doctor in Corby, Northamptonshire. He will continue to work as a general practitioner associate at Oakham Medical Practice in Rutland. Dr Roberts previously worked with EMAS as an assistant medical director and strategic medical adviser and has supported our Clinical Assessment team to prioritise and offer the best and most appropriate care to patients dialling 999. Adding Dr Roberts experie nce of the local NHS from different perspectives, to the skill and knowledge within our executive and senior management leadership teams, will help as the NHS and EMAS move towards more effective and collaborative working to find solutions to patient needs , using skills and expertise from across health and social care sectors. At the time of writing, a Care Quality Commission (CQC) unannounced inspection was conducted in April 2019 , and a Well-Led CQC inspection at Horizon Place was scheduled to take place during May 2019. Both inspections give us the opportunity to evidence how much progress has been made since the last inspection in 2017 when we were rated as 'requires improvement'. We have achieved a great deal since then and have a lot to be proud of at EMAS . When the CQC publish their report and rating following both investigations we will respond and make the information available on our website. This report is complemented by our Quality Account (to be published in June 2019), which gives a review of how we did against our quality and safety targets and includes updates on innovation, researc h and development work at EMAS. Pauline Tagg MBE Chairman 5 1. Performance Report The purpose of this report is to help readers assess how the organisa tion has performed. It is intended to provide a balanced review of our business and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties EMAS faces. 1.1 Overview Chief Executive's Statement We constantly seek better ways of working to deliver the best possi ble care to our patients and I am proud to share with you the improvements that we have made together with colleagues, and individuals , and organisations working to support delivery of our quality improvement plans. Using feedback shared during our Big 3 engagement (see details in the Chairman's report and elsewhere in this publication) we determined the service and business development areas we want to be leaders of. In response to national, regional and local changes to health and social care systems (for example, in some areas integrated care systems have been set up; a new type of collaboration between NHS organisations, working with local councils and others to take collective responsibility for managing resources, delivering NHS standards and improvin g the health of the population they serve), we are adapting our Clinical Operating Model. This will support patients through new advanced roles with new skills and new ways of working, all of which will be underpinned by career development and education for staff. We have agreed to focus on three key priority areas: advanced practice; clinical leadership and supervision; and clinical hub development, and next steps include to produce a full business case to support each area. At our August 2018 Trust Board meeting we discussed an exciting new service being developed to improve the amount of time our vehicles and crews are available to respond to urgent and emergency calls. Make Ready is a systematic preparation service - from refueling through to cleaning, checking and restocking medicine supplies - designed to have every ambulance prepare d and equipped right from the start of every 999 crew's shift, rather than the crew spending time preparing the vehicle. This will initially happen at two early adopter sites (Gorse Hill and Kingsmill Ambulance Stations in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshir e) to allow us to test our approach through the Plan, Do, Study, Act methodology. Modifications, layout changes and refurbishment work at both sites will allow dedicated vehicle preparation operatives to work alongside Fleet mechanics and key enabling staff to ensure vehicles are ready to go as soon as crews arrive for their shifts. In addition to the Big 3 engagement feedback helping to shape services, I was delighted by the response we received from two important surveys held during the year. The NHS Staff Opinion survey resulted in a 56% response rate (1,823 colleagues) - the highest response rate to date, and an independent Health, Wellbeing and Culture Audit resulted in a 48% response rate (1,431 colleagues). Both surveys are far from a tick box exercise; the experiences and views shared by colleagues have helped to give an accurate picture of life at EMAS, telling us where we have good practice so that we can protect it, and where we have opportunities to make things better. 6 Our evaluatio n of the results has identified clear links with themes that have arisen between the two surveys, and plans have been developed to address the strongest themes: Continued development and investment to ensure leadership capacity and a supportive leadership style. This is the key driver for continued improvement, evidenced through the audit that shows that leadership behavior is a key determinant of positive staff experience, staff wellbein g/health outcomes, and creating a positive culture. Development of qua lity improvement knowledge, skills and application throughout the organisation to ensure learning from errors, learning from good practice, and increased reporting. Alongside this we wil l review the Serious Incident approach and evaluate and learn from goo d practice already seen to improve staff experience in an area of EMAS, with a view to roll out across the service. Further development of initiatives supporting improving support for st aff suffering mental ill health and developing resilience. Implementa tion of the clinical model, specifically development in career progression opportunities into advanced practice roles, supporting engagement, motivation and retention, appraisal, and cli nical supervision. Following the announcement of additional funding for EMAS in May 2018, we initiated our biggest recruitment programme in the history of our service, and we are working hard to improve our retention rate. To keep progressing, it's vital that we act on the feedback received from our staff, and that we continue to provide and develop the support networks and services available to them. Other steps taken during the year are having a positive impact on both patient and staff wellbeing. The introduction of a new Urgent Care Transport Service in April 2018 has helped to reduce some of the pressure faced by our Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) staff and ambulance crews, in addition to reducing delays experienced by patients. Through a programm e called 'releasing time to care', we have taken steps to reduce the number of regular late shift finishes because they impact negatively on wellbeing and morale. The impact on patients too is measurable; higher staff sickness levels often mean less resour ces on the road, affecting us getting a timely response to the patients who need us most. In addition, the operational inefficiency created increases costs, which is money that could be spent on developing frontline services. That's why our Director of Operations led the introduction of the new 'releasing time to care' concept in February 2019. There were two objectives: 1) to release more time to care for the patients we have a duty to serve, and 2) to better support staff welfare by allowing more crews to finish on time. We revised the end of shift process and finessed the mandatory fields that require completion on our electronic patient report form system. In line with Plan, Do, Study, Act methodology, we have closely monitored the impact and the initial results are very positive. We are getting to patients more quickly and duplicate 999 calls, eg asking 'where's the ambulance?', have reduced. Late end of shift for ambulance crews has reduced significantly across the region, and pressure on our Emergency Operations Centre dispatchers has reduced because they have fewer patients waiting for 7 a response, and our Clinical Assessment team are not having to make as many calls back to patients apologising for the delay. Releasing time to care has helped us to put more time into the system to care for our staff and patients. As more of our new, additional frontline colleagues leave the training centres to join the frontline and as we improve our retention rate, we expect further improvements to be experienced and evidenced. The 2018 /2019 performance year has seen significant developments and progression at EMAS, and this report gives a good flavour for some of the work delivered. More examples can be found on the EMAS website news pages including patient stories, our zero- tolerance approach to verbal and physical abuse against our staff/vehicles/equipment, awards won, recognition of long service, graduating paramedics, new and pilot services, and much more. Our colleagues have worked tirelessly with people in othe r organisations to p rovide the best possible care and treatment to our patients, and I thank them all, together with our volunteers, for their continued dedication and professionalism. To the best of my knowledge the information contained in this Annual R eport is accurate and reflects a balanced view of EMAS' future ambitions. Richard Henderson Chief Executive 8 EMAS' purpose and activities EMAS is a statutory body which came into existence on 1 July 2006 under the East Midlands Ambulance Service Natio nal Health Service Trust (Establishment) Order 2006 No 1620 (the Establishment Order). We provide emergency and urgent services for 4.8 million people , covering approximately 6,452 square miles across six counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshi re, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland. Patient transport is provided for Derbyshire patients with routine hospital or clinic al appointmen ts (clinical commissioning groups have contracted private organisations to deliver patient transport in the other counties) . More than 3,700 people are employe d, at 70 facilities used including ambulance stations, community ambulance stations (smaller facilities, often shared buildings with other organisations allowing our crews to 'stand -by' in strategic locations in-between responses to 999 calls), two Emergency Operations Centres (Nottingham and Lincoln ), training and support team offices and fleet workshops. Our frontline accident and emergency ambulance crews represent the largest staff group at EMAS , and we operate a fleet of over 660 vehicles, including emergency ambulances, fast response cars, specialised and driver training vehicles, and urgent care and patient transport vehicles. Every day EMAS receive s aroun d 2,147 calls from members of the public who have rang 999. On average this equates to a new emergency call every 40 seconds and is in addition to the calls received from healthcare professionals booking transport to support patient transfers from one healthcare facility to another. Acciden t and Emergency Service With four large cities, major arterial roads, an international airport, a lengthy coastline and several country parks, demand on EMAS' can increase particularly during the summer months when visitor numbers to the region increase . Aside from the challenges posed by our geographical boundaries and the road networks across the region, EMAS must respond to the rising number of 999 calls made by the public. We receive valuable assistance from many Community First Responder (CFR) sche mes providing emergency cover mainly in the more rural areas we se rve; circ a 1600 individual community first responders. Our Emergency First Responder schemes are operated with fire services who respond in a l ife threatening emergency in a similar way to a CFR. Over 50 EMAS colleagues operate as Medical First Responders providing support when they can attend emergency incidents in their local area and in their own time. Our Community Response Team has worked closely with individuals and groups in our commu nities to place community public access defibrillators (CPAD) in strategic locations, thereby sup porting the chain of survival for patients having a cardiac arrest. There are currently over 2600 CPADs available across the East Midlands. 9 In October 2018, in support of Restart a Heart Day, EMAS colleagues and volunteers across the East Midlands helped t each over 1 6,000 young people how to save a life using cardio -pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We also benefit from the invaluable presence of four sepa rate air ambulances which respond across the region and are operated by registered charities (Derbyshire Leicestershire and Rutland Air Ambulance, Lincs and Notts Air Ambulance; Magpas Air Ambulance and Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance). In additio n, we have a team of over 26 doctors - the East Midlands Immediate Care Scheme - who volunteer their time, working over and above their normal general practice or hospital work, to provide both a primary response role to life -threatening calls and clinical support for crews at serious clinical incidents such as road traffic collisions. We continually strive to further improve patient care by ensuring that patients consistently receive the right response first time. Our approach also means that more patients will be treated in the community, and fewer people will go to a busy hospital Emerge ncy Department unnecessarily. Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response Together with other NHS organisations, we are required to have appropriate and effective contingency arrangements in place to ensure the maintenance of core functions even when responding to a range of incidents which impact on patient care or public health. As a designated Category 1 Responder under the Civil Contingencies Act, we must comply fu lly with a range of statutory duties. In addition, specific NHS objectives are set by NHS England in the form of the Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Framework. This lists a number of highly spec ific factors that underpin EMAS' Contingency Planning activities, as well as testing business continuity and special operations arrangements. We regularly meet with county based Local Resilience Forums - a group of multi -agency representatives - to develo p and strengthen resilience measures, test plan s and develop working relationships through major incident exercises. In addition, we engage and work with Local Health Resilience Partnerships (strategic level health organisations). In line with the National Ambulance Resilience Unit's Command Service Sp ecification, many EMAS commanders have been renewing their training and certification requirements by attending a variety of operational, tactical and strategic command courses. The annual Emergency Preparedne ss, Resilience and Response Assurance Framework is approved by our Trust Board , and we continue to work to our contractual standards in this respect. We operate a Hazardous Area Response team (HART) which is made up of personnel specially trained in dealing with Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and N uclear incidents, Hazmat incidents, swift water rescue and Urban Search and Rescue techniques. They also support EMAS operations during protracted incidents or periods of increased call demand. We comply with our contractual obligations in terms of deliver ing HART and Special Operations provision, and these are closely monitored to ensure that the services w e deliver are of a high standard. 10 Urgent Care Transport Service On 3 April 2018, we launched a new dedicated tier to our emergency frontline. The Urgen t Care Transport Service (UCTS) operates across all areas of the East Midlands and is designed to reduce delays for patients, and reduce the pressure faced by our Emerge ncy Operations Centre (EOC) staff and ambulance crews. Over 100 urgent care assistant s (UCAs) have been employed and trained to work on our frontline, with two urgent care dispatchers and one urgent care clinical advisor in our Nottingham EOC. The new service provide s transport to: patients requiring urgent admissions to hospital, as det ermined by their general practitioner or healthcare professional (HCP) patients requiring transport without the need for on -going ambulance treatment (eg emergency treatment), as identified by our Clinical Assessment Team or frontline A&E crews after asses sment at the scene. UCAs have not been trained to drive on blue-lights, their focus is on lower priority and non - life-threatening calls, this means emerg ency ambulance crews can focus on 999 calls, reaching the most poorly patients quicker. Data and impr ovements in patient safety and experience shows that the new service is making a difference. The UCTS team have transported 23,173 patients to hospital du ring the first year. In March 2018, the average time for a four -hour urgent transfer to hospital was t hree hours, 36 minutes. This has reduced significantly to two hours and nine minutes by March 2019. The 95th percentile in March 2018 was ten hours 43 min utes for a four - hour urgent transfer and in March 2019 this was five hours 11 minute s. Patient Transp ort Service EMAS provides non-emergency Patient Transport Service (PTS) in Derbyshire for patients who are registered with a general practitioner. This service launched on 1 August 2016 with the contract lifetime running to 31 July 2019, however in Februa ry 2019, commissioners extended the three -year contract to a four-year contract, so EMAS will continue to provide PTS in Derbyshire until at least July 2020. PTS is for patients who need medical or clinical support to get to and from their healthcare appo intment. Entitlement to transport depends on whether the patient meets the eligibility criteria set out by the local clinical commissi oning group. On an average day, the Derbyshire service provides care and support during 630 journeys and receives over 350 phone calls from NHS colleagues and patients to make or amend a journey booking. 11 On Thursday, 2 August 2018 PTS call handler Sally Lancashire took our 500,000th Derbyshire patient transport booking. Coincidentally, this landmark call was taken on the second birthday of Derbyshire PTS. Sally, who has worked in the NHS for 23 years, was presented with a certificate by PTS Performance Delivery Manager James Oldham to recognise the landmark call. Call handling and clinical assessment Our Clinical Assessme nt Team (CAT) consists of paramedics, nurses, midwives, and a mental health practitioner. They dealt with 175,449 calls during the year compared to 211,343 in 2017/2018. Team members provide clinical advice to patients and signpost them to services and pla ces where alternative, more appropriate care can be provided. This results in fewer admissions to hospita l emergency departments. The team also offers clinical advice to ambulance crews and Emergency Operations Centre colleagues and provide a telephone tri age service to various clinical hubs across the East Midlands . EMAS' values During 2018, we engaged with our staff and stakeholders to seek their views on a draft refresh of our EMAS vision, strategic priorities and values. The values, originally designe d by staff at EMAS in 2009, have been updated to reflect our commitment to encourage innovati on, team and partnership working, and to look outwards as well as inwards. EMAS has five values which underpin everything we do, including the way we deliver our services and how we all work with others. By living these values and supporting others to do the same, we will help to make sure that EMAS is an organisation we can all be proud of. Respect: Respect for our patients and each other. Integrity: Acting with integrity by doing the right thing for the right reasons. Contribution: Respecting and v aluing everyone's contribution, and encouraging innovation. Teamwork: Working together, supporting each other, and collaborating with other organisations. Competen ce: Continually developing and improving our competence. Our v alues help us provide our p atients with access to high quality clinical care and services to ensure the best experience and clinical outcom e. 12 EMAS' vision As with our values, during 2018 we engaged with colleagues and stakeholders to seek their views on the refresh of our vision and strategic priorities. The final version was approved by our Trust Board in October 2018 , with the detail included in the 'Our Future Vision and Strategy' presentat ion available on our websit e: https://www.emas.nhs.uk/about -us/our -values/ Our vision is to be 'Responding to patient needs in the right way, developing our organisation to become outstanding for patients and staff, and collaborating to improve wider healthcare.' From this we created : 1) Respond - we will respond to patient needs in the right way. We will know we have achieved this when: We are making full use of the care pathways available, safe ly treating patients at home. We have the right number of staff in post with the right mix of skills, knowledge and training to respond flexibly to all patient needs based on our workforce plan. We have the right number, type and age of vehicles on the roa d to meet th e requirements of our workforce plan. We have access to the right equipment, ambulances and staff to meet patient demand and need. 2) Develop - we will develop our organisation to become outstanding for patients and staff. We will know we have achieved this when: Our patients report consistently high levels of satisfaction. Our staff and volunteers report that they are proud to work for EMAS. Our workforce is healthy, engaged, supported and satisfied, and everyone exemplifies the EMAS values in all that we do. Our staff and volunteers can access opportunities, education and training to support their career development. 13 We have realised benefits through ensuring we operate a modern and sustainable estate. We are consistently delivering the Ambulance System Indicators (including patient quality measures). We have achieved a Care Quality Commission rating of 'outstanding' and are consistently meeting our financial targets. 3) Collaborate - we will collaborate with partners and other organisations to redu ce healthcare demand and improve wider healthcare. We will know we have achieved this when: We have led and contributed to improvements in key areas of healthcare that matter most to EMAS , our patients and our partners across the area we serve. Areas will be determined during engagement with system partners, and may include: - More patients appropriately treated at home where safe or close to home (non - conveyance) - Closer collaboration betwee n the two regional clinical hubs (999 and NHS111) - Mental health (pre vention and demand management) - Public education (management and prevention) - Access to improved pathways - Further develop our relationship with 111 to ensure patients access to most appropri ate care Our local communities are accessing emergency and urgent ca re services in the most appropriate way, based on their clinical needs. In February 2019, we launched our communications and engagement programme with new animations featuring real EMAS people, and the use of augmented reality technology to literally bring our Big 3 posters to life. Colleagues were encouraged to apply to become an avatar in a future anima tion explaining in their application how they could support The Big 3 strategy and campaign. The short animations are targeted primarily at colleagues to encourage their involvement and will be used at staff engagement events including our Conversation Caf\u00e9 tours during 2019 . They are also appropriate for wider consumption and in addition to being published via our s ocial media networks and on our website , they will be used at events in the community where the topic will be of interest or use to people in attendance. 14 EMAS' strategic o bjectives and associated strategies Directed by our refres hed vision and values, we are working to become leaders in: our use of innovative technological solutions our proactive work on mental health work on patient safety ensuring equality and diversity within our workforce demonstrating international best pract ice for our clinical outcomes for patients with cardiac arrest developing and embedding the paramedic skillset in multi -disciplinary team approaches across wider healthcare (led by EMAS) our proactive work with partners on public education (management and prevention) within our local communities developing a positive organisational culture that means staff want to work here and have high levels of satisfaction identifying and managing sepsis (across all geographies), building on the success of our pilot wit hin Lincolnshire The refreshed vision and strategic approach are being incorporated into the EMAS Integrated Business Plan (presented to the Trust Board in April 2019) and Annual Plan and continue to inform our service transformation and development progr amme , with progress and milestones monitored regularly through a variety of delivery groups and committees . We continue to be involved in county -based Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships and Integrated Care Systems to devise and deliver new mod els of care that support the needs of patients and wider health and emergency response systems. Key risks Our Trust Board ensures sound risk management arrangements and internal control principles are in place. We monitor performance on an ongoing basis through reports submitted to the Trust Board and committees during the year. The key risks identified are included in the Governance Statement section of this document. 15 1.2 Performance Analysis Accident and Emergency performa nce standards National perfo rmance standards The NHS England's Ambulance Response Programme (ARP) is not about the fastest response, but the most appropriate clinical response. Category 1 - Life-threatening This is defined as a time critical life -threatening event requiring immedia te intervention or resuscitation. These calls should be responded to in a mean average time of seven minutes and at least 9 out of 10 times before 15 minutes. Category 2 - Emergen cy This is defined as potentially serious conditions that may require rapid assessment and intervention. These calls should be responded to in a mean average time of 18 minutes , and at least 9 out of 10 times before 40 minutes. Category 3 - Urgent This i s defined as urgent problems that needs treatment to relieve suffering but are not immediately life threatening. These calls should be responded to at least 9 out of 10 times before 120 minutes. Category 4 - Non-Urgent This is defined as problems that are not urgent but require assessment. These less urgent calls should be resp onded to at least 9 out of 10 times before 180 minutes. In line with clinical guidance, each category has set criteria to establish the required resource, transport and re sponse times to ensure that the right response gets to the patient, first time, ev ery time and within time. Nationally, a revised set of Clinical Ambulance Quality Indicators (measur es, indicators and standards) have been developed and are widely supported by commissioners, ambulance providers, paramedics, unions and patient and publi c representatives. There are also four categories for call s received from health care professionals (HCP) including general practitioners, requesting a response within an agreed time scale (one, two, three to four hours) for a patient to be conveyed to a hospital or other place of care. More detail about ARP can be found on the NHS England website at https://www.england.nhs.uk/urgent -emerge ncy-care/arp/, including short animations and an easy read guide to ARP. 16 East Midlands Ambulance Service accident a nd emergency performance During 201 8/2019, we receive d 1,026,249 e mergency and urgent calls. Our accident and emergency crews responded t o 674,036 of these calls, which equates t o 1,847 face to face responses every day . During the same period, EMAS lost 64 ,007 hours to pre -hospital handover delays (compared to 74,030 hours lost during 2017/2018), equating to the l oss of 5,334 twelve -hour vehicle shifts - an average of 15 shifts a day. Ambulance Response Programme Standards, 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 Category Average response time 50th percentile 75th percentile Additional performance monitoring measures Key Performance Indicators (KPI) In addition to the Ambulance Response Programme performance standards referred to above, EMAS also monitors performance on a daily, weekly and monthly basis against a series of measures which have a direct or indirect impact on overall frontline performance. Our Trust Board receives an update on all rele vant measures via an Integrated Board Report (published on our public website) , including: Activity Ambulance Clinical Quality Indicators Derbyshire Patient Transport Service Duty of Candour High level financial position Hospital handover and turnaround Patient Advice Liaiso n Service (PALS) - eg queries, compliments and complaints Quality Everyday Resourcing Safeguarding Serious incidents Workforce eg recruitment and workforce plan, statutory and mandatory education, flu vaccination rates, and sickness abs ence. Monitoring our key performance indicators and reviewing the detail with identified risks and learning ensures our Trust Board and management teams remain aware of the actual or potential challenges ahead, the likely impact, and actions needed to mit igate a ny risk or potential disruption to the trust . This approach, which is aligned to the NHS Change Cycle methodology (Plan, Do, Study, Act) also allows the trust to protect and learn from areas of best practice . Hospital handover times During 201 8/2019 the health and social care system continued to face huge pressure and significant challenges which impacted on our ability to respond to emergency calls and meet the government standards. Nationally, emergency department colleagues are required to acc ept a clinical handover from our ambulance crews when they arrive at hospital with a patient within 15 minutes. At times, h andover delays continued to place EMAS under extreme pressure and remained t he focus of much attention. During 2018/2019, EMAS lost 64,007 hours to pre -hospital handover delays (compared to 74,030 hours lost during 2017/2018), equating to the loss of 5,334 twelve -hour vehicle shifts - an average of 15 shifts a day. Fundamentally the risk associated with handover delays is to patients waiting in the community , often without a medical professional present, for a 999 ambulance response. The situation also has an impact on staff wellbeing, morale and sickness levels. 18 Our Executive team and local senior management teams continue to act to manage and mitigate the risk that the hospital handover delays create. Reports providing updates and detailing action taken have been submitted during the year to the Trust Board meetings held in public, and concerns , particularly relating to issues out o f our direct control or influence, continue to be escalated to organisations that regulate, commission and monitor EMAS services. Clinical care Whilst the speed of response to ambulance calls is important, equally as important is the clinical care provi ded on scene, and in our emergency vehicles as the patient is assessed and if needed, taken to hospital for further assessment and treatment. Throughout the year we continued to progress against four quality improvement priorities originally set in 2017/2 018, against these three domains of quality: Clinical effectiveness Patient safety Patient experience The quality priorities are: Clinical effectiveness: Priority 1: Staff health and wellbeing EMAS has been recognised nationally as 'leading the way' in supporting staff mental wellbeing. Our support schemes are founded upon the principle that colleagues are best placed to provide support to each other through having a shared experience of the job. To keep improving health and wellbeing at work we will continue to develop, and review staff support mechanisms. Lead: Director of Quality and Nursing Prior ity 2: Improving Sepsis care Sepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection. Without quick treatment it can lead to multiple organ failure a nd death. Red Flag Sepsis means a patient is presenting with clinical signs that suggest they are either suffering or approaching septic shock. Last year we successfully piloted the delivery of antibiotics to Red Flag Sepsis patients. We are committed to keep developing our work and treatment of Sepsis patients. Lead : Medical Director.19 Patient Experience: Priority 3: Cardiac arrest - return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival outcomes. Following the introduction of our Cardiac Arrest Strateg y ROSC rates increased at EMAS by around 4.5%, with a 0.6% increase in survival to discharge from hospital. In terms of performance against other ambulance services we are average. We are committed to continue to : develop and improve our cardiac arrest ou tcomes. increase the presence of frontline clinical supervi sion to all active resuscitation attempts. improve our Ambulance Quality Indicators and outcomes around stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma improve. Lead: Medical Dire ctor Priority 4: Continue to reduce conveyance by the uti lisation of alternative care facilities. Nationally it is recognised that providing care closer to home and reducing unnecessary hospital attendances and admissions improves patient care and outcomes. To ensure we play our part, we are committed to: Maintain and improve 'hear and treat' (over the phone advice) Maintain and improve 'see and treat' (face to face response) Reduce conveyance to hospital by accessing alternative pathways that are available Have robust patient safety plans in place that sup port non -conveyance Lead: Medical Director Priority 5 : To reduce prolonged waits across all call categories by delivering the national Ambulance Response Standards During 2018/2019 we will: Deliver agreed workforce plan. Deliver the agreed performance improvement trajectories. Improve efficiency and productivity through better utilisation of our resources. Improve fleet availability through the delivery of the new vehicles. Lead: Director of Operations 20 Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) As part of the NHS Standard Contract 2017 -2019 , 2.5% of EMAS' income in 2018/2019 was dependent upon the organisation achieving quality improvement goals through innovation. CQUIN schemes are an opportunity for EMAS to provide a key focus on quality improvement. The outcomes from these schemes can be significant and impact directly on patient care. The CQUINs were agreed between EMAS and the 22 Clinical Commissioning Groups who commission the service. We foc us on delivering schemes that make significant changes to the lives of patients and their outcomes. National Health and Wellbeing CQUIN This is year two of this two -year CQUIN which is nationally mandated by NHS England and is applied to all NHS contrac ts (where appropriate). The CQUIN is aimed at encouraging providers to improve their role as an employer by looking after the health and wellbeing of employees. It covers three areas: Indicator 1a: Staff survey: Achieving a five-percentage point improvemen t in two of the three NHS annual staff survey questions on health and wellbeing, musculoskeletal and stress. The improvement should be achieved over a two -year period with the baseline survey being the 2016 survey. - Question 9a: Does your o rganisation take positive action on health and well - being? Providers are expected to achieve an improvement of five-percentage points in the answer 'yes, definitely', compared to the baseline staff survey results, or achieve 45% of staff surveyed answering 'yes, definitel y'. - Question 9b: In the last 12 months have you experienced musculoskeletal problems as a result of work activities? Providers are expected to achieve an improvement of five-percentage points in the answer 'no' compared to the baseline sta ff survey result s, or achieve 85% of staff surveyed answering 'no'. - Question 9c: During the last 12 months have you felt unwell as a result of wor k related stress? Providers are expected to achieve an improvement of five percentage points in the answer 'no ' compared to baseline staff survey results or achieve 75% of staff surveyed answering 'no'. Indicator 1b: Healthy eating for staff and visitors: Maintaining improvements made under the 2016/17 CQUIN which are: - The banning of price promotions on sugary drinks and foods high in fat, sugar or salt. - The banning of advertisements on NHS premises of s ugary drinks and foods high in fat, sugar or salt. - The banning of sugary drinks and foods high in fat, sugar or salt from checkouts. - Ensuring that healthy option s are available at any point including for those staff working night shifts. 80% of drinks lin es stocked must be sugar free. 80% of confectionery and sweets do not exceed 250 kcal. At least 75% of pre -packed sandwiches and other savoury pre -packed meal s (wraps, salads, pasta salads) available contain 400kcal (1680 kJ) or less per serving and do not exceed 5.0g saturated fat per 100g. 21 Indicator 1c: Flu vaccination: Year 2 - achieving an uptake of flu vaccinations by frontline clinical staff of 75%. In ad dition to the Health and Wellbeing CQUIN NHS England mandated a two-year nation Conveyance CQUI N for all NHS Ambulance Trusts focused on reducing conveyance to hospital emergency departments and a two-year Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) CQUIN aimed at encouraging engagement with and contribution to the STPs transformation initiatives: National Conveyance CQUIN This indicator incentivises managing care closer to home and a reduction in the rate of ambulance 999 calls that result in conveyance to a hospital emergency department. The introduction of enhanced training and protocols for amb ulance clinicians, better system - wide data sharing, improved clinical support and advice to the ambulance service from a range of healthcare professionals in cli nical hubs, and/or the provision of alternative care pathways are all be expected to have a pos itive impact on this indicator. Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) CQUIN It is anticipated that this CQUIN supports delivery of the STP ambitions in re lation to urgent care by reducing inappropriate conveyances, handover delays, utilisation of lo cal community health services and supporting the full integration of services. For year two of this two -year CQUIN EMAS worked with commissioners to develop milestones aligned to the STP ambitions at a local level, individual CQUINs were agreed for the sev en STP footprints which EMAS falls under, these are: Derbyshire STP - reduction in attendances and conveyances to type 1 and type 2 emergency departments focusin g on high volume attendance cohorts . Greater Lincolnshire and Humber, Coast and Vale STPs - reduction in conveyance to type 1 and 2 emergency departments targeting the top 10 presenting complaints resulting in conveyance to a type 1 and 2 emergency departm ents. Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland STP - reduction in conveyance to type 1 and 2 emergency departments with a focus on frailty . Northamptonshire - provision of a GP home visiting service to improve admission avoidance to secondary care through the provision of pre -hospital care . Nottinghamshire - reducing conveyances to type 1 and 2 emergency departments by 1.5% in contribution to the STPs overall ambition to reduce conveyance by 3%. An additional two -year CQUIN was agreed with the 22 CCGs which f ocused on improving the use of el ectronic patient report forms in support of the ambition of a paper free NHS. Electronic Patient Report Form (ePRF) implementation CQUIN This CQUIN indicator is designed to provide a technical solution capable of: - recording ambulance patient records in an electronic format , - supporting emergency care provision through process and technical enablement, - integrating the technical solution with existing medical devices as well as achieving greater integration with the wider healt h care system, and - enhancing pati ent care and experience. 22 Over the two years of this CQUIN it is expected that EMAS will implement the technical solution and ensure 90% compliance for completing ePRF across the region by the end of the second year (2018/19 contract year). The CQUIN also requires several technical capabilities to be in place to enhance the provision of the ePRF system. This includes emails to general practitioners to let them know when one of their patients have been seen by an EMAS clinici an and define future developments to provide information which can help identify gaps in provision for use of alternative pathways. Funding A full set of accounts is provided from page 55 onwards. Financial targets We finished the year with a financial deficit of \u00a3 2.8 million (\u00a3 3.1 million after adjustments for impairments and donated asset donation and depreciation). We did not generate sufficient income to cover our costs. This represented an improvement on the trust control target agreed with NHS Imp rovement. We ha ve delivered \u00a3 5.6 million savings, which was slightly above our target. During the year to March 2019, we achieved the following performance against our financial duties: Description of Target Trust Target Actual Result Adjusted (Deficit ) \u00a3(1,538) k* \u00a3(1,509)k * 3.5% return on capital with Capital resource Limit \u00a312,638 k \u00a312,448 k *excluding the effects of impairments and donated assets EMAS' deficit for the year includes the following which did not form part of our recurrent revenue for the year: \u00a3'000 Reversal of impairments charged as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in previous years 225 Provider Sustainability Fund Incentive - Finance 29 Incent ive - Bonus 531 Incentive - General Distribution 949 Contribution to Trust Results 1,734 23 It is our responsibility to achieve a cumulative break -even over a three -year period position and should we fail to do so, or are forecast to do so, it is the External Auditor's responsibility to formally report this to the Secretary of State. The Trust's longer -term plans thus include the need to receive significant investment from its commissioners to address both the operational and financial concerns. Expenditure EMAS incurs costs that are predominantly associated with the provision of clinical activity. The largest expenditure area is pay which accounts for 70.5% of the total expenditure. The Trust Accounts for 2018/2019 are set out in full following the main body of this report. These have been prepared on a 'Going Concern' basis and in accordance with guidance issued by the Department of Health, and in line with International Financial Accounting Standards (IFRS). So far as the directors are aware, t here is no re levant information of which the auditors are unaware. During 2018/2019, EMAS spent most of available capital. The majority of this was allocated to Transport . This expenditure was funded partly through internally generated capital funds and additional Pu blic Divided Capital allocated to the Trust in the year . EMAS operates income generation activities covering operational cover for public events, such as football matches and race meetings, it also provides training covering vehicle maintenan ce. These are not significant areas of income ( 2.2%) and are priced to cover the cost of providing the service plus a contribution to the fixed costs of the organisation. Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation t hat the NHS Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. Recruitmen t Significant progress was made through the delivery of our People Strategy in strengthening workforce planning arrangements and triangulating activity, operational, finance and workforce information to ensure a comprehensive, collaborative and integrated approach to workforce planning. This was suppor ted by independent Demand and Capability modelling that provided clarity on the workforce capacity required to deliver against national performance standards, and formed the basis of our workforce plans, subsequ ent increased financial investment to increas e the workforce capacity, and delivery of the plan in 2018/2019. Thanks to the additional \u00a39million investment in EMAS announced in May 2018, we have been able to recruit new, additional colleagues to our frontline - we have increased our frontline team by over 230 colleagues over the year. 24 EMAS continues to deliver a challenging workforce plan as part of a two-year investment programme that will see our frontline establishment increase by circa 500 whole time equivalents by 31 March 2020. Subsequent years will then continue to focus on maintaining funded workforce establishment, deliver the aspirations of the Clinical Model and increase the registered skill mix to 55% by 2025. This is against a backdrop of a national shortage of qualified paramedics . To address this, our Human Resources, Recruitment, Education and Operational teams, supported by others at EMAS, have been working incredibly hard to develop our own recruitment and education programmes. This approa ch will allow existing colleagues to progress to paramedic and creates more opportunities for people to join EMAS and progress through the clinical ranks. Alongside the biggest recruitment programme ever undertaken at EMAS, it was necessary to devel op our education programme, building new facilities and renovating existing estate to provide the additional classroom space needed to accommodate our new employees and to further enhance learning and education for our existing staff. Our Leicestershire Rosings building has been renovated and in Northamptonshire we installed a new modular building for education purposes, meaning colleagues no longer need to travel further afield to receive their training. As stated previously, nationally there are not enough qualified paramedics to allow us to recru it people 'straight off the shelf', therefore our education and operational teams, supported by others at EMAS, have been working incredibly hard to develop our own education programmes. This approach will allow existing colleagues to progress to paramedic and creates more opportunities for people to join EMAS and progress through the clinical ranks. In August 2018, we launched a new training centre with Nottingham Trent University (NTU). This exciting partnershi p provides us with facilities at Clifton Camp us. This new partnership, alongside work with our regional higher education institute partners, is a positive step forward to provide more development opportunities for our staff and to strengthen and improve patient care. In addition, we are developing a university award with NTU to give us more control over the content and assessments our staff will undertake, moving to practical based assessments and away from portfolios. Successful technicians will be eligib le to graduate from the university and attend an award ceremony to receive their certificates. We are developing a BSc Paramedic Science programme for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire that will enable us to recruit more graduate paramedics and offer develop ment opportunities for existing staff, and we are exploring opportunities for staff to undertake research through studentships, supported by research bursaries as well as Continuous Professional Development opportunities in trauma, paramedic prescribing and urgent care. 25 This additional partnership, alongside our regional higher education institute partners, allows us to give development opportunities for our staff and, strengthen and improve the services we provide to patients. Modern Slavery Statement In 2017 EMAS published a statement made pursuan t to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act (2015), setting out the steps that EMAS have taken, and will continue to take, to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our organisation and commissioned services . The statement was refreshed and approved by the Trust Board i n March 2019 . Visit https://www.emas.nhs.uk/join -the-team/working -for-emas/ for details. Patient experience Under the 'develop' heading of our Big 3 vision and strategic priorities, we say we will have achieved our aim when 'our patients report consistently high levels of satisfaction'. Feedback from patients, carers, and members of the public is therefore important to us, whether it is to say 'thank you' for a positive experience, or if there's something that we need to get better at. We continually seek to improve quality for our pati ents, delivering sustained improvement in the patient experience and clinical outcomes. Our EMAS Pati ent Voice group, made up of public volunteers, is chaired by our Director of Quality, and is supported by two sub -groups based in Nottinghamshire and Derb yshire. They meet regularly to discuss and add strength to our services; they review our complaints, c ompliments PALS procedures, media messages and a selection of responses to help identify areas for improvement. The group is actively involved in quality visits to a variety of our facilities across the East Midlands. During the year the groups visite d our Emergency Operations Centre in Nottingham and Hazardous Area Response team in Mansfield to gain a better understanding of the service provided. Membe rs of the group took part in cardio -pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and supported our Restart a Heart campaign, teaching school pupils and the public how to do hands -only CPR. The group also attended the EMAS Community First Responder's Conference in October, allowing members to gain knowledge about the work our volunteers do, and benefit from the time networking with them. EMAS Patient Voice have been active in the community delivering an EMAS Ambassador presentation to various groups to explain EMAS procedures, sign post the public to use other non -emergency healthcare providers when appropriate , and to encourage people to join our volunteer services. More detailed information on our achievements is provided in our Quality Account 2018/2019, pub lished on the EMAS and NHS Choices websites. 26 Freedom to Speak Up Listening to and acting on staff feed back helps us improve our services for all patients. The EMAS Head of Mental Health is the Freedom to Speak Up (FTSU) Guardian - a confidential point of contact about incidents of malpractice, professional misconduct or financial malpractice. Together with colleagues across the service, our FTSU lead promotes the importance of speaking up and listening to colleagues talk about challen ges and opportunities to improve our culture and services. The EMAS Workforce Committee receives FTSU reports to ensure feedb ack and concerns are being dealt with and responded to. We will continue to improve our processes based on feedback received nation ally, from regulators and from our own staff. General Data Protection Regulation Based upon the Information Commissioners '1 2 steps' guide, we developed and delivered an action plan to ensure EMAS is complaint in respect of the new data protection legisla tion published in 2018, in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), supported in the UK by the Data Protect ion Act 2018. EMAS' compliance is monitored by both the Information Governance Group and the Finance and Performance Committee. The EMAS Head of Information Governance also acts as the EMAS Data Protection Officer, managing virtual work -streams including c ommunications, to support the fair processing notices and procurement, to support the contract reviews. Information r elating to GDPR is communicated to all EMAS colleagues through the staff digital magazine Enews, and through statutory and mandatory educat ion. Environmental Sustainability Our Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP) and Environmental Policy Statement have continued to be the frameworks on which we are currently delivering our five-year 30% carbon reduction target as well as our commi tment to continue to comply with all relevant environmental regulation. We have continued to embed the principle s of good environmental management practices into all relevant aspects our operation. The carbon associated with the energy we use across our es tates, our travel and transportation and our procurement and commissioning have continued to be monitored, manag ed and reported against our 2014/15 baseline. 27 We are proud to report that our carbon footprint reduced by 4% from 26,839 tCO 2e in 2014/15 to 25,861 tCO 2e at the end of the 2018/19 financial year. We achieved this improvement in our performance, even though the number of 999 calls we received increased by 22% over the last four years. The figure below show that we effectively achieved a 21% reduction in the carbon we emit for every 999 call we received during the 2018/19 financial year compared to our 2014/15 baseline . We have continued to implement initiatives that support the delivery of our commitment to improve our environmental perform ance and enhance our resilience to the challenges associated with climate change. Below are some of the highlig hts of our environmental sustainability performance during the financial year under review: We are actively reducing emissions from our fleet as well as the public health impacts of our operation. The newer, more efficient and less polluting healthcare a nd support vehicles that we have bought over the last four years have reduced the average carbon our vehicles emit per distance travelled by 11. 4% from 200.4 g/km to 177.5 g/km. In conjunction with the above, the fuel we use per every 999 call we receive reduced by 14% against our 2014/15 baseline. This efficiency is attributed to our newer vehicles, reduction of the number of times our emergency vehicles were left idling and our current operational model. Our current operational model is underpinned by ou r commitment of optimising every opportunity to deliver sustainable emergency healthcare services within the communities we serve. We are acti vely collaborating with other local partners and stakeholders. One of the benefits of this collaboration is that we recently received a sustainable travel grant from the Nottingham City Council (NCC). The grant from NCC has been used to install eight dual 7 kW electric vehicle charging units. These units were commissioned in December 2018 and have collectively contr ibuted to avoiding the emission of 744 kgCO 2 and 93 kgN 2O. We have continued to monitor our fleet against the current London ultra -low air zone (ULEZ) standard. As at March 2019, 61% of our fleet are compliant with the current ULEZ standard. We will conti nue to explore opportunities to reduce the public health and environmental impacts of our fleet. 31.6 29.529.9 26.0 25.1 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19KgCO2e / 999 Calls Received28 We have continued to promote the benefits of su stainable travel across our Trust. During the 2018/19 financial year, car sharing contributed to avoiding over 4 0,000 miles, while cycling accounted for 274 miles of our business travel. The number of premises from which our staff use electric and hybrid e lectric vehicles for business travel increased from zero during the 2014/15 financial year to nine during 2017/1 8 and ten at the end of the year under review. An in -depth analysis of our current business travel shows that pure electric and hybrid electric vehicles were used to travel up to 1.5% of our 2018/19 business miles. These low and ultra -low emission vehicles contributed to reducing the public health and environmental impact of business travel. Over the last four years, we have continued to invest i n upgrading the heating system and lighting stock across our premises. These investments have contributed to reducing the electricity and gas used across our premises by 10% and 23% respectively. These achievements have enhanced our financial resilience to rising energy prices and reduced this aspect of our carbon footprint. The water efficiency measures that we have installed across our premises have contributed to reducing our water use by 27% during the 2018/19 financial year compared to our 2014/15 bas eline. This implies that we are actively playing our part in reducing the pressure on water resources across o ur operational area. The 2% reduction in the procurement and commissioning aspect of our carbon footprint over the last five years is attributed t o our cost improvement programme (CIP). We will continue to promote of the benefits of embedding good environm ental practices and efficiency into all aspects of our operation. Over the last four years we have consistently diverted 98% of all non -healthcar e wastes generated from our premises from landfill. The environmental and financial benefits of recycling will continue to be promoted across all areas of our operations. Over the last five years, the proportion of soft clinical wastes generated from our operations that were disposed via high temperature incineration route reduced from 27% to 0.5%. We will continu e to promote the public health and environmental benefits of safe handling, segregation and storage of all healthcare wastes generated from our operation. Environmental sustainability requirements have continued to be included into relevant aspects of our procurement and commissioning processes. During the year under review, we carried out environmental assurance visits to the premises of some our contractors. These visits were conducted to gain assurance that these contractors are embedding the principles of sustainable development into the way they deliver services on behalf of EMAS. Chief Executive 22 May 2019 29 2.

The relevant responsibilities of Accountable Officers are set out in the NHS Trus t Accountable Officer Memorandum. These include ensuring that: there are effective management systems in place to safeguard public funds and assets and assist in the implementation of corporate governance; value for money is achieved from the resources a vailable to the trust; the expenditure and income of the trust has been applied to the purposes intended by Parliament and conform to the authorities which govern them; effective and sound financial management systems are in place; and annual statutory a ccounts are prepared in a format directed by the Secretary of State to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs as at the end of the financial year and the income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the year. To the bes t of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the res ponsibilities set out in my letter of appointment as an Accountable Officer. 32 2.4 Governance statement Scope of responsibility As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for maintaini ng a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public fu nds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilitie s assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied effic iently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Trust Accountable Of ficer Memorandum . The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of the East Midlands Ambulanc e Service NHS Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficient ly, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in the East Midlands Ambula nce Service NHS Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. The governance framework of the organisation Description of the governance framework The Board has established the following committ ees to support it in its role: an Audit Committee which is responsible for reviewing the Trust's governance, risk management and internal control systems and also monitors the integrity of the Trust's financial statements and financial reporting mechanisms a Quality and Governance Committee which monitors the effectiveness of the Trust's assurance framework, oversees compliance with legislative requ irements, best practice in governance and regulatory standards and ensures that a greater awareness of clinica l quality is fostered throughout the Trust; a Workforce Committee which agrees and monitors the implementation of strategies relating to workforce issues and monitors performance against key workforce metrics; a Finance and Performance Committee which considers performance against the Trust's objectives as set out in the Integrated Business Plan and the Annual Plan, monitors operational and financial performance, oversees the capital programme and monitors arrangements for cash forecasting, investing and b anking; a Remuneration and Nominations Committee which has responsibility for setting the remuneration of the Chief Executive and Executiv e Directors and any groups not included within the Agenda for Change Pay Framework. 33 A Transformation and Improvemen t Programme Board was also in existence for most of 2018/19 to monitor the actions arising from the last Care Quality Commission inspectio n and implementation of the Transformation Programme. The Executive Team took on the role of monitoring the Transform ation Programme in February 2019 and a Care Quality Commission Preparedness Group was established. At this point the Transformation Progr amme Board ceased to exist. There are also a number of sub groups reporting to the committees which undertake specifi c roles and support the committees in their assurance role. Minimum requirements are set for attendance at meetings against which performance is monitored. Ensuring quality governance The Trust has arrangements in place for ensuring quality governance which include: the Quality and Governance Committee; an annual Quality Account; an annual Clinical Audit programme which is overseen by the Clinical Governance Group; identification, investigation and learning from Never Events and Serious Incidents the Qu ality Everyday programme which ensures that the standard and quality of care is maintained and the Care Quality Commission's require ments for ambulance trusts followed. Ensuring corporate governance The Trust Board has confirmed compliance with the NHS provider licence condition 4 and has not identified any significant risks to non -compliance. Details to support this are set out be low. Leadership - The Trust is headed by a Board with collective responsibility for the long - term success of the organisa tion. The division of responsibilities between executive functions and the running of the Board are set out in the Trust's Standing Orders and Scheme of Delegation. There have been changes to the Board membership during 2018/19. Interim management arran gements were in place within both the Medical Directorate and the Quality Directorate from 1 October 2018. The Medical Director ret ired from the Trust at the end of September 2018. A new Medical Director has been appointed and took up post on 1 April 201 9. The Trust is currently recruiting to the role of Director of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety. The Interim Finance Direct or was appointed substantively to the role during the year. One of the Non-Executive Directors completed their term of offi ce during 2018/19 and a new Non-Executive Director joined the Trust Board. A new Director of Operations joined the Board at the beg inning of 2018/19. Effectiveness - Directors received an induction on joining the Board. This is supplemented with Boar d Update and Discussion Sessions to enable Board members to work effectively together and to set aside time to discuss and agree the Trust's vision, provide input to the development of key strategies and also to receive information about the Trust's functi ons. Individual directors, the Chief Executive and the Chairman undertake annual performance appraisals. The Board undertook an a ssessment of its role and performance in April 2018. Areas of improvement were identified as part of the self - assessment an d have informed the Update and Discussion Session work programme. 34 Accountability - The Board recognises its responsibility for d etermining the nature and extent of the significant risks involved in achieving the Trust's strategic objectives. The Board ensures the Trust has sound risk management arrangements and internal control principles and has sought assurance that these arrang ements were operating effectively through its committees and the reports it receives during the year. Sustainability - The Trust has a five -year Integrated Business Plan which takes a long - term view of the vision of the Trust. Board members were involved in the development of the plan and the document was approved by the Trust Board. The Board receives regular reports from t he Chief Executiv e which include information on national initiatives and general horizon scanning. These reports inform the work of the Board in developing its long-term plans. The Trust has arrangements in place to ensure the discharge of statutory fun ctions. Responsi bility for functions is clearly allocated to individual Executive Directors. Regular reports are presented to the Board and appropriate committees to provide assurance that statutory requirements are met and compliance ensured for individ ual functions. T he Scheme of Delegation identifies responsibility for specific statutory roles and details delegated authority to undertake the functions. Capacity to handle risk As Accountable Officer I have responsibility for the overall direction o f the risk manage ment systems and processes within the Trust. The Associate Director of Corporate Services was the identified lead for risk during 2018/19. The Trust provides training and guidance to ensure that risk management is integrated into all policies and proc edures which: raises awareness of incident reporting and near misses; ensures compliance with professional registration requirements; provides a consistent approach to the management of risk; and ensures systems and processes which hav e the capacity to manage and mitigate risk are developed and maintained. Good practice and lessons learnt were widely shared during the year through mechanisms such as the Lessons Learnt Group, the Risk, Safety and Governance Group and the Clinical Gover nance Group. The risk and control framework Risk management arrangements The Trust has a Risk Management Policy which was revised and approved by the Board in November 2017. There is a systematic process for the identification of risk throughout the organisation throu gh local or divisional risk registers and a Board Assurance Framework. The risk registers and Board Assurance Framework are reviewed regularly to ensure risks are managed effectively in accordance with the Risk Management Policy. 35 Risks are scored for impact and likelihood using a risk evaluation model. The significance of a risk to the achievement of the Trust's strategic objectives determines whether a risk is managed locally or escalated for inclusion in the Board Assurance Framew ork. The Trust's strategic -level risks are contained in the Board Assurance Framework which details the risk and any mitigation through the application of controls, together with evidence that demonstrates the application of those controls. In identifying current and expected risk scores the Trust Board considers its risk appetite, determining the level of risk it is willing to accept and the mitigating actions required to achieve that. The Board Assurance Framework is the key tool used by the Trust to pr ovide as surance that risk and control mechanisms are in place and operating effectively. Through regular monitoring of the Board Assurance Framework and the operational risk registers, which underpin the risk management process, the Executive Team and the Trust B oard ensure that current risks are managed appropriately and there are suitable arrangements for preventing and deterring risk. The Board Assurance Framework was subject to a thorough review during 2018/19. Responsibility for the detailed examina tion of specific risks on a regular basis is delegated to the respective committees. The Trust's Internal Auditors undertook a survey of Board members views of the Board Assurance Framework during 2018/19. This demonstrated a good level of understanding of risk management at Board level. Work continues to further embed risk management across the Trust. The main risks identified during 2018/19 were: resourcing levels required to meet demand and provide a quality service; the impact of high demand incl uding ca lls from 111 services; compliance with long -term financial targets the impact of not meeting contractual targets achievement of Care Quality Commission standards; ability to demonstrate compliance with equalities requirements; effective recruitm ent and retention of sufficient staff to meet the demand for services and ensuring workforce diversity; developing an appropriate skill mix and opportunities for staff with advanced practice skills; the risk of rising staff costs from national pay awards; effect ive clinical leadership; the impact of sickness absence on resourcing the risk of industrial action resulting from changes to policy and terms and conditions; failure of the information and communications technology infrastructure and risk of data loss thr ough cyber -attacks ; the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations; non-delivery of the Patient Transport Service by other partners; responding to demand during Winter; the cost of modernising the estate; rising costs from the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union; and the impact of hospital handover delays on resourcing. 36 A number of these challenges are likely to continue into 2019/20. Risk management is further embedded within the Trust through the system of servi ce management responsibilities. Equality impact assessments are carried out against core business policies, and risk assessments and quality impact assessments are completed on proposed business activities and changes. The risk management arrangeme nts are supported by a system of management control throughout the organisation which governs how the organisation operates. This includes the existence of clear policies and procedures to guide staff in their everyday work, a scheme of delegation which e xplains which groups and individuals have specific decision - making and financial authority, arrangements for the supervision and appraisal of staff and a system of audits and reviews of the Trust's processes to ensure compliance with legislation and intern al requirements, particularly in relation to patient safety and effectiveness. These measures ensure that the organisation's statutory obligations and requirements from external regulators including the Care Quality Commission are complied with and risks are effectively managed including the prevention and deterrence of those risks. The Trust's quality impact assessment and equality impact assessment processes ensure that risks which could arise from changes to services, new initiatives or proposals for efficiency savings are identified early, prevented and deterred as appropriate and managed effectively. The Trust has an annual Counter Fraud work programme in place and the result of the reviews undertaken are monitored by the Trust's Audit Committee. The Trust has completed self -assessments against NHS Improvement's Well Led Framework and has identified actions where improvement can be made. This is overseen by the Trust Board. The Trust also asked NHS Improvement to undertake an independent review of the Trust against the Well Led framework during 2018/19. Findings from this review will inform the Trust's Well Led self -assessment and will be used to revise the action plan. The Board receives the Board Assurance Framework regular ly and discusses t he principle risks and the controls in place. The Board also receives integrated performance reports which provide data in respect of financial, clinical and national targets and objectives. Any areas of risk are highlighted. Information included in the i ntegrated performance reports is overseen by the Performance Management and Information Team to ensure the quality of the data. The Trust also has a Data Quality and Compliance Group responsible for providing assurance that the data used by the Trust is f it for purpose. Workforce Strategies and Staffing Systems The Trust takes an evidence -based approach, utilising independent external reviews and historic activity trends, to determine the required number of suitably qualified, competent and skilled staff to deliver services in each locality. The 2018/19 Workforce Plan was underpinned by an independent review (Demand and Capacity Review) and supporting service commissioning arrangements. This plan recognised that delivery of the required frontline workfo rce to meet that set out in the Demand and Capacity Review, would be achieved over a two-year period ending 31 March 2020. Delivery of the workforce plan is 37 supported by a recruitment and education plan taking account of factors such as the required incre ased capacity; turnover information; abstraction data; length of education programmes; a nd available workforce supply to deliver the required funded workforce. The plan includes utilisation of third -party resources to maintain the required staffing levels whilst new employees are recruited and undertake training. All frontline staff members a re qualified in their respective role. To support newly qualified staff and those in training, experienced frontline staff members provide mentorship and guidance in p ractice. The Trust continues to support development of mentor capacity and capability th rough its practice education programme. Development of the five -year Workforce Plan is overseen by the Workforce Planning Group, a subgroup of the Workforce Committe e of the Trust Board. The Workforce Plan is updated on an annual basis using future work force modelling determined by strategic priorities, workforce supply, education availability and financial considerations. The plan is presented to the Trust Board for approval. The plan is monitored on a monthly basis in relation to staffing numbers, cost and delivery of nationally set performance standards. The Trust reports and monitors quality metrics monthly through the Quality and Governance Committee, which inc ludes patient experience and patient safety and would identify workforce issues impactin g on patients. In addition, the Integrated Board Report incorporates performance, workforce, finance, clinical and quality metrics and is reviewed and discussed by the Trust Board at each meeting. It is acknowledged that there is a shortage of paramedi cs nationally to meet the needs of the Ambulance Sector. The Trust's main workforce risk identified in 2018/19 relates to developing its workforce to have a greater pr oportion of registered paramedic staff and to provide opportunities for advanced practic e skills. During 2018/19, the Trust has progressed development of its long -term Clinical Model, informing future workforce skill mix requirements. In addition, the Tr ust has increased its paramedic education provision through development of new Higher Ed ucation partnerships to increase the number of paramedics available and to provide opportunities for Advanced Practice Education. Data security risks The Trust Board approved the Information Security Strategy 2017/21 in November 2017. The Trust has an Information Security Management System including appropriate governance arrangements, providing assurance to the Trust Board through the Information Gove rnance Group and the Finance and Performance Committee. This allows for the identification and management of data security risks. The Information Security Manager has day to day responsibility for managing these risks. Arrangements to identify and mana ge the risks inc lude regular testing of all systems, firewalls, antivirus updates and arrangements for backup and restore testing. Employer obligations As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. 38 The Trust has published an up -to-date register of interests for decision -making staff within the past twelve months, as required by the ' Managing Conflic ts of Interest in the NHS' guidance. Statutory requirements Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Trust has undertake n risk assessmen ts and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are com plied with. The Trust has a sustainable development management plan based on a comprehensive assessment of all areas in which the Trust significantly interacts with the environment. The plan is the framework against which the Trust delivers its responsibilities under t he Climate Change Act and complies with all relevant environmental regulations. The Trust has continued to develop and implement initiatives that support its commitment to continue to comply with all environmental regulations, impro ve environmental perform ance and enhance resilience to the challenges associated with climate change. Public and patient involvement in the work of the Trust The public and patients are involved in identifying risk and for bringing this to the attention of the Trust in a varie ty of ways including patient satisfaction surveys, complaints, litigation claims, Patient Advice and Liaison concerns and the Patient Voi ce Forum. A representative of the Patient Voice Forum is a member of the Quality and Governance Committee. Regulatio n and inspection The Care Quality Commission is currently carrying out a planned inspection of the Trust which started in April 2019 and will be completed mid May 2019. The previous inspection was undertaken in February and March 2017. The overall ratin g for the Trust following that inspection was Requires Improvement. The Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. The Trust has arrangements in place for ongoing monitoring of its compliance with these r equirements and ensuring that actions required by the Care Quality Commission are implemented. This was overseen by the Transformation a nd Improvement Board and the Quality and Governance Committee during 2018/19. The Care Quality Commission Preparedness Group was established in February 2019 to ensure the Trust was prepared for the forthcoming inspection and to ensure completion of any a ctions arising from inspections. Internal audit programme and assurance The Trust's internal auditors have provided a significant assurance opinion for 2018/19. The significant assurance opinion means that there is a generally sound framework of governance, risk management and control designed to meet the organisation's objectives, and that controls are generally bein g applied consistently. 39 One high risk issue was identified by the internal auditors during 2018/19. This relates to the arrangements for monitoring compliance with Duty of Candour requirements. There were two limited assurance opinions provided on re views in 2018/19. These were: Duty of Candour Data Security and Protection Toolkit. The internal auditors provided significant assurance opinions on seven audits in 2018/19. Prevention of Future Deaths Reports The Trust received two Prevention of Futur e Deaths reports from the Coroner in 2018/19. The issues highlighted were: triaging of calls, including in relation to sepsis; shortage of ambulance service resources; response times; capacity management ation arrangements; use of first responder s; and re-categorisation of calls. The Trust has arrangements in place to ensure a response is sent to the Coroner within the required deadline and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to address the concer ns. Review of economy, efficiency and eff ectiveness of the use of resources The Trust Board has a strong commitment to ensuring value for money is achieved, this is reflected in the business and service delivery plans, with monitoring predominantly carried out through the Board sub committees. The Audit Committee in particular ad vises the Trust Board on performance against its value for money objectives. The Finance and Performance Committee has used the recent Carter Report on ambulance efficiency to assist in the process of establishing econo my, efficiency and effectiveness in t he use of resources. The committee receives monthly updates on performance against standards identified in the report. The Trust has benchmarked well on all aspects of economy and efficiency however elements of effecti veness were affected by funding limit ations. To ensure economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources was achieved during 2018/19 the Trust has: partially implemented the review undertaken in 2017/18 of pricing and costs needed to implement the Ambulance Review Programme stand ards and which examined EMAS efficiency against industry standards; the full year effect will be seen in 2019/20; participated in and led elements of the Carter review into Ambulance Service use of resources; the EMAS A mbulance vehicle specification was de termined as the benchmark; participated in a jointly commissioned review with commissioners to establish the cost of a safe and effective ambulance service for the East Midlands; and participated in further benchmarkin g of back office functions with NHS Improvement. 40 Information governance During 2018/19 there were no reportable incidents relating to information governance. The Trust has information governance policies and procedures in place to prevent security and information breaches and to address any issues that may arise or any areas of concern. These were reviewed in 2018/19 in line with the new Data Security and Protection Toolkit. The Trust was assessed as \"standards not met\" for 2018/19 as there are some standards for which it is unable to provide all of the evidence. The Trust has submitted an improvement plan to NHS Digital to demonstrate how it will address thi s. Internal Audit conducted their audit of the toolkit and provided a limited assurance opi nion. The Trust has a Non -Executive Director lead for the requirements arising from the General Data Protection Regulation. Annual Quality Account The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amende d) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. The priorities identified for 2019/20 were consulted on with stakeholders to ensure that the Trust prioritised those areas of interest to the public. The Trust Board revie ws and approves the Quality Account prior to publication and seeks assurance from the Executive Directors regarding the accuracy of the document. The Clinical and Quality Strategy sets out how the Trust will improve the quality of its services for patie nts and monitor compliance with quality standards. An update on the Quality Account Priorities is presented at regular intervals to the Quality and Governance Committee. The Trust Board receives an Integrated Board Report at each meeting which includes t he key quality performance indicators. Review of effectiveness As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the information provided in this annual report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Trust Board and the Audit Committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. Processes have been in place through out 2018/19 to main tain and review the effectiveness of the system of internal control. This includes oversight of the Trust's corporate risks by the Trust Board in regularly reviewing the Board Assurance Framework; consideration by the Audit Committee of assurance reports from Internal Audit, External Audit, the Local Counter Fraud Service and EMAS managers; the Trust's risk management arrangements; and arrangements for clinical audit and clinical governance as overseen by the Quality and Governance Commi ttee. 41 Conclus ion No significant internal control issues have been identified during the year. 2.5 Remuneration Report 2.6 Remuneration Policy Senior managers' remuneration This remuneration report is for the year ending 31 March 201 9.

The banded remuneration of the highest paid director in the financial year 2018/2019 was \u00a3143,500 (2017/2018 \u00a3132,500) This was 4.86 times (2017/2018 4.56 times) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a329,533 (2017/2018 \u00a329,027). In 2018/2019 and 2017/2018 no employees received remuneration in excess of the highest paid director. Remuneration ranged from \u00a315,404 to \u00a3143,500 (2017/2018 \u00a315,404 to \u00a3132,414). Total remuneration includes salary, non-consolidated performance-related pay, benefits in kind as well as severance payments. It does not include employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions.The table above shows the salary and pension entitlements of senior managers. It should be noted that the total for the year includes Salary, Expense payments, Performance related pay and derived increase in capital value of pension benefits at pension age, calculated using legislated relevant factor of 20 on annual pension at pension age, plus lump sum at pension age. This does not reflect an increase in remuneration during 2018/2019 but an annual pension value multiplied by a notional value of 20 which may be realised following retirement. The pension benefit table below sets out cash equivalent transfer values.44 As Non -Executive members do not receive pensionable remuneration, there will be no entries in respect of pensions for Non - Executive members Chief Executive 22 May 2019 Pension BenefitsReal Increase at Pension AgeReal Increase in Pension Lump Sum at Pension AgeTotal Accrued Pension at Pension Age at 31 March 2019Lump Sum at Pension Age Related to Accrued Pension at 31 March 2019Cash Equivalent Transfer Value at 1 April 2018Real Increase in Cash Equivalent Transfer ValueCash Equivalent Transfer Value at 31 March 2019Employer's Contribution to Stakeholder Pension Bands of \u00a32,500 Bands of Executive Director 5.0 - 7.5 10.0 - 12.5 40 - 45 95 - 100 454 139 627 Kerry Gulliver Director of Human Resources and Organisational Development 2.5 - 5.0 2.5 - 5.0 25 - 30 60 - 65 418 92 537 0 Mike Naylor Director of Finance 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Judith Douglas Ceased Trust Board Membership 31 March 2019Director of Quality and Nursing5.0 - 7.5 5.0 - 7.5 35 - 40 85 - 90 543 144 718 0 Paul Benton Commenced 1 October 2018 Acting Director of Quality and Nursing 0.0 - 2.5 2.5 - 5.0 25 - 30 60 - 65 333 50 450 0 David Whiting Interim Chief Operating Officer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ben Holdaway Commenced 5 February 2018 Director of Operations 2.5 - 5.0 0 30 - 35 0 253 70 344 0 Robert Winter Ceased 30 September 2018 Medical Director 0 0 55 - 60 0 1,341 0 1,341 0 John Stephenson Commenced 1 October 2018 Interim Medical Director 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Will Legge Director of Strategy and Transformation 0.0 - 2.5 0 20 - 25 45 - 50 261 50 333 0 45 Exit Packages Agreed in 201 8-2019 Redundancy and other departure costs have been paid in accordance with the provisions of the NHS Scheme.

We have an Improving Wellbeing and Reducing Sickness Absence Plan which is monitored through our internal governance structure as well as through our Divisional Performance Re view meetings. There are many initiatives to improve health and wellbeing that link in to our work to improve engagement and culture. During the year we also worked with NHS Improvement to review sickness absence management and receive any feedback that the y had. This work has provided assurance on our absence management processes, along wit h recommendations that support improving wellbeing and reducing sickness to support us to continue to improve in this area. We have also been actively involved nationally in the Ambulance Wellbeing and culture work which is now published on the NHS Employe rs website. Staffing Policies EMAS has a structured system in place for the development of new staffing polices and the review of existing policies. This allows the organisation to learn from previous experiences and ensure that fair and equitable processes are in place for all staff. The consistent approach we take in developing staffing policies includes working in partnership with our trade unions . We have polici es in place to en sure full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled persons, having regard for their particular aptitudes and abilities. Policies include arranging appropriate training for employees who have become disabled pe rsons whilst empl oyed at EMAS, or for training, career development and promotion of disabled persons employed by EMAS.

EMAS has evaluated its status and has decided it does not meet the definition of a 'commercial organisation'. Therefore, the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act do not apply to the organisation. During 20 18/2019, EMAS' expenditure on consultancy fees was \u00a3195 k (201 7/2018: \u00a3172k). Details relating to off payroll arrangements are declared in the Remuneration Report.

Financial Statements and notes East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust Annual Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 201956 Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the accounts The directors are required under the National Health Service Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each fin ancial year. The Secretary of State, with the approval of HM Treasury, directs that these accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the trust and of the income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the year. In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to: apply on a consistent basis accounting policies laid down by the Secretary of State with the a pproval of the Treasury; make judgements and estimates which are reasonable and prudent; state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts. assess the Trust's abilit y to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and use the going concern basis of accounting unless they have been informed by the relevant national body of the intention to dissolve the Trust without the tra nsfer of its services to another public sector entity. The directors are responsible for keeping prope r accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the trust and to enable them to ensure that the account s comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned direction of the Secretary of State. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other ir regularities. The directors confirm to the best of their knowledge and belief they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the accounts. The directors confirm that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and under standable and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess t he NHS trust's performance, business model and strategy .

Additional PDC may also be issued to trusts by the Department of Health and Social Care. A charge, reflecting the cos t of capital utilised by the trust, is payable to the Department of Health as the public dividend capital div idend. Revaluation reserve Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are re cognised in operating income. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previou s gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential. Financial assets reserve / Available -for-sale investment reserve This reserve comprises changes in the fair value of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. When these instruments are derecognised, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised as other comprehensive income or expenditure are recycled to income or expenditure, unle ss the assets are equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income as a result of irrevocable election at recognition. Merger reserve This reserve reflects balances formed on merger of NHS bodies. Income and expenditure reserv e The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the trust. 65 Statement of Cash Flows 2018/19 2017/18 Note \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Cash flows from operating activities Operating (deficit) / surplus (1,922) 10,774 Non-cash income and expense: Depreciation and amortisation 8,097 Net impairments 8 (225) (875) Income recognised in respect of capital donations 4 (141) - Amortisation of PFI deferred credit - - Non-cash movements in on-SoFP pension liability - - Decrease / (increase) in receivables and other assets 1,023 (1,933) (Increase) / decrease in inventories (481) 103 Increase / (decrease) in payables and other liabilties 986 (2,774) (Decrease) in provisions 2,051 (2) Tax (paid) / received - - Operating cash flows from discontinued operations - - Other movements in operating cash flows - - Net cash generated from operating activities 10,511 13,390 Cash flows from investing activities Interest received 91 27 Purchase and sale of financial assets / investments - - Purchase of intangible assets - (22) Sales of intangible assets - - Purchase of property, plant, equipment and investment property (9,405) (12,129) Sales of property, plant, equipment and investment property 723 473 Receipt of cash donations to purchase capital assets - - Prepayment of PFI capital contributions - - Investing cash flows of discontinued operations - - Cash movement from acquisitions / disposals of subsidiaries - - Net cash generated (used in) investing activities (8,591) (11,651) Cash flows from financing activities Public dividend capital received 5,032 257 Public dividend capital repaid - - Movement on loans from the Department of Health and Social Care (1,800) 1,700 Movement on other loans - - Other capital receipts - - Capital element of finance lease rental payments - - Capital element of PFI, LIFT and other service concession payments - - Interest on loans (234) (234) Other interest - - Interest paid on finance lease liabilities - - Interest paid on PFI, LIFT and other service concession obligations - - PDC dividend (paid) (1,332) (1,464) Financing cash flows of discontinued operations - - Cash flows (used in) other financing activities (3) - Net cash generated from financing activities 1,663 259 Increase in cash and cash equivalents 3,583 1,998 Cash and cash equivalents at 1 April - brought forward 5,959 3,961 Prior period adjustments - Cash and cash equivalents at 1 April - restated 5,959 3,961 Cash and cash equivalents transferred under absorption accounting 46 - - Unrealised gains / (losses) on foreign exchange - - Cash and cash equivalents at 31 March 28.1 9,542 5,959 66 Notes to the Accounts Note 1 Accounting policies and other information Note 1.1 Basis of preparation The Department of Health and Social Care has directed that the financial statements of the Trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2018/19 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. Note 1.1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. Note 1.2 Going concern These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as Department of Health group bodies should prepare their accounts on a going concern basis unless informed Department of Health Group Accounting Manual 2018/19 by the relevant national body or DH sponsor of the intention for dissolution without transfer of services or function to another entity. The Trust has not received any such notification. Note 1.3 Interests in other entities The Trust does not hold any interests in any other entities.67 Note 1.4.1 Revenue from contracts with customers Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for under IFRS 15. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). As directed by the GAM, the transition to IFRS 15 in 2018/19 has been completed in accordance with paragraph C3 (b) of the Standard: applying the Standard retrospectively but recognising the cumulative effects at the date of initial application (1 April 2018). Revenue in respect of goods/services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allocated to those performance obligations. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where the Trust's entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional a contract receivable will be recognised. Where entitlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset will be recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be satisfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. Revenue from NHS contracts The main source of income for the Trust is contracts with commissioners for health care services. A performance obligation relating to delivery of a spell of health care is generally satisfied over time as healthcare is received and consumed simultaneously by the customer as the Trust performs it. The customer in such a contract is the commissioner, but the customer benefits as services are provided to their patient. Even where a contract could be broken down into separate performance obligations, healthcare generally aligns with paragraph 22(b) of the Standard entailing a delivery of a series of goods or services that are substantially the same and have a similar pattern of transfer. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year, where a patient care spell is incomplete. Revenue is recognised to the extent that collection of consideration is probable. Where contract challenges from commissioners are expected to be upheld, the Trust reflects this in the transaction price and derecognises the relevant portion of income. Where the Trust is aware of a penalty based on contractual performance, the Trust reflects this in the transaction price for its recognition of revenue. Revenue is reduced by the value of the penalty. Revenue from research contracts Where research contracts fall under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised as and when performance obligations are satisfied. At contract inception, the Trust assesses the outputs promised in the research contract to identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer either a good or service that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer. The Trust recognises revenue as these performance obligations are met, which may be at a point in time or over time depending upon the terms of the contract. NHS injury cost recovery scheme The Trust receives income under the NHS injury cost recovery scheme, designed to reclaim the cost of treating injured individuals to whom personal injury compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises the income when it receives notification from the Department of Work and Pension's Compensation Recovery Unit, has completed the NHS2 form and confirmed there are no discrepancies with the treatment. The income is measured at the agreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less an allowance for unsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts in line with IFRS 9 requirements of measuring expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Note 1.4.2 Revenue grants and other contributions to expenditure Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. The value of the benefit received when accessing funds from the the Government's apprenticeship service is recognised as income at the point of receipt of the training service. Where these funds are paid directly to an accredited training provider, the corresponding notional expense is also recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit.68 Note 1.4.3 Other income Income from the sale of non-current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. Note 1.5 Expenditure on employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment-related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry-forward leave into the following period. Pension costs NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme. The scheme is an unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, general practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of Secretary of State, in England and Wales. The scheme is not designed in a way that would enable employers to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as though it is a defined contribution scheme. Employer's pension cost contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the scheme except where the retirement is due to ill-health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. Note 1.6 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 69 7Note 1.7 Property, plant and equipment 7Note 1.7.1 Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust it is expected to be used for more than one financial year the cost of the item can be measured reliably the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000, or collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have similar disposal dates and are under single managerial control. Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly different asset lives, eg, plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful lives. 7Note 1.7.2 Measurement Valuation All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All assets are measured subsequently at valuation. Assets which are held for their service potential and are in use (ie operational assets used to deliver either front line services or back office functions) are measured at their current value in existing use. Assets that were most recently held for their service potential but are surplus with no plan to bring them back into use are measured at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. Revaluations of property, plant and equipment are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying values are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Current values in existing use are determined as follows: Land and non-specialised buildings - market value for existing use Specialised buildings - depreciated replacement cost on a modern equivalent asset basis. Assets held at depreciated replacement cost have been valued on an alternative site basis where this would meet the location requirements of the services being provided. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, where capitalised in accordance with IAS 23, borrowings costs. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when the assets are brought into use. IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of an assumption or another source of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period. On the basis of existing knowledge, outcomes within the next financial year that are different from the assumption around the valuation of our land, property, plant and equipment could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability recorded in note 17.1. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred.70 Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'held for sale' cease to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction and residual interests in off-Statement of Financial Position PFI contract assets are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the trust, respectively. Revaluation gains and losses Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income'. Impairments In accordance with the GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. 7Note 1.7.3 De-recognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'held for sale' once all of the following criteria are met: the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales; the sale must be highly probable ie: - management are committed to a plan to sell the asset - an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale - the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price - the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'held for sale' and - the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will be abandoned or significant changes made to it.71 Following reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Depreciation ceases to be charged. Assets are de-recognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recognition as 'held for sale' and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset's useful life is adjusted. The asset is de-recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. 7Note 1.7.4 Donated and grant funded assets Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met. The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 72 8Note 1.7.5 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) transactions 8Note 1.7.6 Useful lives of property , plant and equipment Min life Max life Years Years Land - - Buildings, excluding dwellings - 50 Dwellings - - Plant & machinery - 15 Transport equipment - 7 Information technology - 5 Furniture & fittings - 7 8Note 1.8 Intangible assets 8Note 1.8.1 Recognition 8Note 1.8.2 Measurement Software Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, eg an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, eg application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 of IFRS 5. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or \"fair value less costs to sell\".PFI and LIFT transactions which meet the IFRIC 12 definition of a service concession, as interpreted in HM Treasury's FReM , are accounted for as 'on-Statement of Financial Position' by the trust. In accordance with IAS 17, the underlying assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment, together with an equivalent finance lease liability. Subsequently, the assets are accounted for as property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets as appropriate. The annual contract payments are apportioned between the repayment of the liability, a finance cost, the charges for services and lifecycle replacement of components of the asset. The element of the annual unitary payment increase due to cumulative indexation is treated as contingent rent and is expensed as incurred. The service charge is recognised in operating expenses and the finance cost is charged to finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Trust has no PFI or LIFT assets. Useful lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. The range of useful lives are shown in the table below: Finance-leased assets (including land) are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or the lease term, unless the trust expects to acquire the asset at the end of the lease term in which case the assets are depreciated in the same manner as owned assets above. Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Useful lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. The range of useful lives are shown in the table below:74 9Note 1.9 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is measured using the first in, first out (FIFO)formula. This is considered to be a reasonable approximation to fair value due to the high turnover of stocks. #Note 1.10 Investment properties The trust has no investment properties. #Note 1.11 Cash and cash equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Trust's cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. #Note 1.12 Carbon Reduction Commitment scheme (CRC) The CRC scheme is a mandatory cap and trade scheme for non-transport CO2 emissions. The trust is registered with the CRC scheme, and is therefore required to surrender to the Government an allowance for every tonne of CO2 it emits during the financial year. A liability and related expense is recognised in respect of this obligation as CO2 emissions are made. The carrying amount of the liability at the financial year end will therefore reflect the CO2 emissions that have been made during that financial year, less the allowances (if any) surrendered voluntarily during the financial year in respect of that financial year. The liability will be measured at the amount expected to be incurred in settling the obligation. This will be the cost of the number of allowances required to settle the obligation. Allowances acquired under the scheme are recognised as intangible assets. #Note 1.13 Financial assets and financial liabilities #Note 1.13.1 Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument, and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by ONS. This includes the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements and are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, ie, when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. #Note 1.13.2 Classification and measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through income and expenditure. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices or valuation techniques. Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through income and expenditure or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial liabilities classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through income and expenditure.75 Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations under lease arrangements and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment (for financial assets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and a financing income or expense. In the case of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income where business model objectives are met by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and where the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Movements in the fair value of financial assets in this category are recognised as gains or losses in other comprehensive income except for impairment losses. On derecognition, cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to income and expenditure, except where the Trust elected to measure an equity instrument in this category on initial recognition. The Trust has irrevocably elected to measure the following equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value trough income and expenditure Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are those that are not otherwise measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. This category also includes financial assets and liabilities acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term (held for trading) and derivatives. Derivatives which are embedded in other contracts, but which are separable from the host contract are measured within this category. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities in this category are recognised as gains or losses in the Statement of Comprehensive income. The Trust has irrevocably elected to measure the following financial assets / financial liabilities at fair value through income and expenditure. Impairment of financial assets For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets or assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Trust recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is initially measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1) and subsequently at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk assessed for the financial asset significantly increases (stage 2). For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged to operating expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position. #Note 1.13.3 Derecognition Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.76 Note 1.14 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Note 1.14.1 The trust as lessee Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for an item of property plant and equipment. The annual rental charge is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to Finance Costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The lease liability, is de-recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Operating leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Leases of land and buildings Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. Note 1.14.2 The trust as lessor Finance leases Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Trust's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the trust's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. Operating leases Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Note 1.15 Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the trust is disclosed at note 34.2 but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts. Non-clinical risk pooling The trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and in return receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any \"excesses\" payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. 77 Note 1.16 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed in note 35 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in note 35, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Note 1.17 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets), (ii) average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short-term working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the \"pre- audit\" version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. Note 1.18 Value added tax Most of the activities of the trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. Note 1.19 Corporation tax The Trust has no corporation tax liability. Health service bodies are generally exempt from corporation tax, as they are either part of the Department of Health or have specific exemption provided by sections 985 and 986 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010).78 Note 1.20 Foreign exchange The functional and presentational currency of the trust is sterling. A transaction which is denominated in a foreign currency is translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Where the trust has assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at the Statement of Financial Position date: monetary items are translated at the spot exchange rate on 31 March non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains or losses on monetary items (arising on settlement of the transaction or on re-translation at the Statement of Financial Position date) are recognised in income or expense in the period in which they arise. Exchange gains or losses on non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the same manner as other gains and losses on these items. Note 1.21 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in a separate note to the accounts in accordance with the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM. Note 1.22 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the trust not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). However the losses and special payments note is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. Note 1.23 Gifts Gifts are items that are voluntarily donated, with no preconditions and without the expectation of any return. Gifts include all transactions economically equivalent to free and unremunerated transfers, such as the loan of an asset for its expected useful life, and the sale or lease of assets at below market value.79 Note 1.24 Transfers of functions to / from other NHS bodies / local government bodies For functions that have been transferred to the trust from another NHS / local government body, the assets and liabilities transferred are recognised in the accounts as at the date of transfer. The assets and liabilities are not adjusted to fair value prior to recognition. The net gain / loss corresponding to the net assets/ liabilities transferred is recognised within income / expenses, but not within operating activities. For property, plant and equipment assets and intangible assets, the cost and accumulated depreciation / amortisation balances from the transferring entity's accounts are preserved on recognition in the trust's accounts. Where the transferring body recognised revaluation reserve balances attributable to the assets, the trust makes a transfer from its income and expenditure reserve to its revaluation reserve to maintain transparency within public sector accounts. For functions that the trust has transferred to another NHS / local government body, the assets and liabilities transferred are de-recognised from the accounts as at the date of transfer. The net loss / gain corresponding to the net assets/ liabilities transferred is recognised within expenses / income, but not within operating activities. Any revaluation reserve balances attributable to assets de-recognised are transferred to the income and expenditure reserve. Adjustments to align the acquired function to the trust's accounting policies are applied after initial recognition and are adjusted directly in taxpayers' equity. No such transactions took place during 2018/19. Note 1.2 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies The following are the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below) that management has made in the process of applying the trust accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: No such judgements have been made. Note 1.2.1 Sources of estimation uncertainty The following are assumptions about the future and other major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Non-Current Assets. Values as disclosed in notes 16, tangible assets, and 15 intangible assets. Asset lives are set out in notes 1.7.6 and 1.8.3 with maximum lives being set by reference to the type of asset and it's expected useful life in normal use. Building lives are based on the recommendations received from the District Valuer. Land and buildings have been re-valued as at 31 March 2019 and have not been subject to indexation in the year. The results of this are disclosed in note 18. Provisions. Values as disclosed in note 34. These have been estimated based on the best information available at the time of the compilation of the accounts. Estimates of employee's legal claims are made including the advice received from the NHS Resolution to the size and likely outcome of each individual claim. The Trust's maximum liability regarding each claim is limited to \u00a310k. The employee frozen leave provision is computed with reference to each individual employee entitled to these payments and computed at their latest pay scales. No further employees will become eligible for these payments. Note 1.25 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2018/19. Note 1.26 Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or adopted As required by IAS 8, trusts should disclose any standards, amendments and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective or adopted for the public sector and an assessment subsequent application will have on the financial statements.80 Note 2 Operating Segments The Trust operated as one segment to provide an emergency healthcare service to the East Midlands area. The Trust considers that disclosure of separate segments should occur where that segment accounts for more than 10% of total operating revenue. The chief operating decision maker for the Trust is the Trust Board which receives a financial report containing summarised financial results at each Trust Board meeting.81 Note 3 Operating income from patient care activities All income from patient care activities relates to contract income recognised in line with accounting policy 1.4.1 Note 3.1 Income from patient care activities (by nature) 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Ambulance services A & E income 166,434 161,607 Patient transport services income 9,072 9,758 Other income 452 487 All services Private patient income - - Agenda for Change pay award central funding 2,099 - Other clinical income - - Total income from activities 178,057 171,852 Note 3.2 Income from patient care activities (by source) Income from patient care activities received from: 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 NHS England - 685 Clinical commissioning groups 175,506 170,376 Department of Health and Social Care 2,099 - Other NHS providers - 154 NHS other - 150 Local authorities - - Non-NHS: private patients - - Non-NHS: overseas patients (chargeable to patient) - - Injury cost recovery scheme 452 487 Non NHS: other - - Total income from activities 178,057 171,852 Of which: Related to continuing operations 178,057 171,852 Related to discontinued operations - - 82 3Note 3.3 Overseas visitors (relating to patients charged directly by the provider) 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Income recognised this year - - Cash payments received in-year - - Amounts added to provision for impairment of receivables - - Amounts written off in-year - - 4Note 4 Other operating income 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Other operating income from contracts with customers: Research and development (contract) 200 328 Education and training (excluding notional apprenticeship levy income) 3,431 4,055 Non-patient care services to other bodies - - Provider sustainability / sustainability and transformation fund income (PSF / STF) 2,822 8,844 Income in respect of employee benefits accounted on a gross basis 249 327 Other contract income 2,222 2,439 Other non-contract operating income Research and development (non-contract) - - Education and training - notional income from apprenticeship fund 22 8 Receipt of capital grants and donations 141 - Charitable and other contributions to expenditure - - Support from the Department of Health and Social Care for mergers - - Rental revenue from finance leases - - Rental revenue from operating leases - - Amortisation of PFI deferred income / credits - - Other non-contract income - - Total other operating income 9,087 16,001 Of which: Related to continuing operations 9,087 16,001 Related to discontinued operations - - 83 5Note 5.1 Additional information on revenue from contracts with customers recognised in the period 2018/19 \u00a3000 77 Revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods - 5Note 5.2 Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations 31 March 2019 \u00a3000 within one year - after one year, not later than five years - after five years - Total revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations - 6Note 6 Fees and charges 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Income - - Full cost - - Surplus / (deficit) - - Revenue recognised in the reporting period that was included in within contract liabilities at the previous period end HM Treasury requires disclosure of fees and charges income.

The estimated additional pension liabilities of these ill-health retirements is \u00a3247k (\u00a3155k in 2017/18). The cost of these ill-health retirements will be borne by the NHS Business Services Authority - Pensions Division.87 Note 10 Pension costs The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019. The Department of Health and Social Care have recently laid Scheme Regulations confirming that the employer contribution rate will increase to 20.6% of pensionable pay from this date. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuationPast and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to test the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the 2012 valuation. Following a judgment from the Court of Appeal in December 2018 Government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process pending conclusion of the continuing legal process. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2019, is based on valuation data as at 31 March 2018, updated to 31 March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. 88 #Note 11 Operating leases #Note 11.1 East Midlands Ambulance Trust as a lessor 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Operating lease revenue Minimum lease receipts - - Contingent rent - - Other - - Total - - 31 March 201931 March 2018 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Future minimum lease receipts due: - not later than one year; - - - later than one year and not later than five years; - - - later than five years. - - Total - - #Note 11.2 East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust as a lessee 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Operating lease expense Minimum lease payments 3,090 3,046 Contingent rents - - Less sublease payments received - - Total 3,090 3,046 31 March 201931 March 2018 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Future minimum lease payments due: - not later than one year; 2,926 2,449 - later than one year and not later than five years; 8,457 4,782 - later than five years. 702 805 Total 12,085 8,036 Future minimum sublease payments to be received - - At the natural termination of the lease agreements the Trust is required to return the vehicles in a similar condition to that supplied.

This note discloses costs and commitments incurred in operating lease arrangements where East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust is the lessee. The Trust's significant leases are in respect of vehicles for the provision of Accident and Emergency and Non-Urgent Patient Transport Services. The Trust is required at all times to keep the vehicles insured, taxed and with valid MOT certificates where necessary and fully maintained to ensure a fully roadworthy condition.There are no provisions for the charging of contingency rentals or escalation costs. Should the lease agreements be subject to an early termination by the Trust, penalty clauses in the lease agreements would result in the outstanding balance of the lease payments to become immediately due.89 Note 12 Finance income Finance income represents interest received on assets and investments in the period. 2018/19 2017/18 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Interest on bank accounts 91 27 Interest income on finance leases -

Because of the continuing service provider relationship that the NHS Trust has with Clinical Commissioning Groups and the way those Clinical Commissioning Groups are financed, the NHS Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by business entities. Also financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of listed companies, to which the financial reporting standards mainly apply. The NHS Trust has limited powers to borrow or invest surplus funds and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day-to-day operational activities rather than being held to change the risks facing the NHS Trust in undertaking its activities. The Trust's treasury management operations are carried out by the finance department, within parameters defined formally within the Trust's standing financial instructions and policies agreed by the board of directors. Trust treasury activity is subject to review by the Trust's internal auditors. The Trust is principally a domestic organisation with the great majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the UK and sterling based. The Trust has no overseas operations. The Trust therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations. The Trust borrows from government for capital expenditure, subject to affordability as confirmed by NHS Improvement. The borrowings are for 1 - 25 years, in line with the life of the associated assets, and interest is charged at the National Loans Fund rate, fixed for the life of the loan. The Trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Trust may also borrow from government for revenue financing subject to approval by NHS Improvement. Interest rates are confirmed by the Department of Health (the lender) at the point borrowing is undertaken. The Trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Trust's operating costs are incurred under contracts with Clinical Commissioning Groups, which are financed from resources voted annually by Parliament . The Trust funds its capital expenditure from funds obtained within its prudential borrowing limit. The Trust is not, therefore, exposed to significant liquidity risks.113 Note 41.2 Carrying values of financial assets \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Trade and other receivables excluding non financial assets 5,315 - - 5,315 Other investments / financial assets - - - - Cash and cash equivalents at bank and in hand 9,542 - - 9,542 Total at 31 March 2019 14,857 - - 14,857 Loans and receivables \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Trade and other receivables excluding non financial assets 9,026 - - - 9,026 Other investments / financial assets - - - - - Cash and cash equivalents at bank and in hand 5,959 - - - 5,959 Total at 31 March 2018 14,985 - - - 14,985 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is applied restrospectively from 1 April 2018 without restatement of comparatives.

The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to reserves on 1 April 2018. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and introduces a revised approach to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, a new forward-looking 'expected loss' impairment model and a revised approach to hedge accounting. Under IFRS 9, borrowings from the Department of Health and Social Care, which were previously held at historic cost, are measured on an amortised cost basis. Consequently, on 1 April 2018 borrowings increased by \u00a335k, and trade payables correspondingly reduced. Reassessment of allowances for credit losses under the expected loss model resulted in a \u00a30k decrease in the carrying value of receivables. The GAM expands the definition of a contract in the context of financial instruments to include legislation and regulations, except where this gives rise to a tax. Implementation of this adaptation on 1 April 2018 has led to the classifiction of receivables relating to Injury Cost Recovery as a financial asset measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these receivables at 1 April 2018 was \u00a3443k. Note 44.2 Initial application of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers as interpreted and adapted by the GAM has been applied by the Trust from 1 April 2018. The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to the income and expenditure reserve on 1 April 2018. IFRS 15 introduces a new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers replacing the previous standards IAS 11, IAS 18 and related Interpretations. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue when it satisfies performance obligations through the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As directed by the GAM, the Trust has applied the practical expedient offered in C7A of the standard removing the need to retrospectively restate any contract modifications that occurred before the date of implementation (1 April 2018).117 Note 45 Related parties Income Expenditure Receivables Payables \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 Department of Health and Social Care 2,165 0 0 0 Health Education England 1,991 10 0 28 NHS 165 0 NHS Lincolnshire 9,864 8 62 0 NHS Lincolnshire West CCG 7,543 0 45 0 NHS Mansfield 0 39 0 NHS 0 23 0 NHS North Derbyshire CCG 0 29 0 NHS North East Lincolnshire CCG 5,702 0 27 0 NHS North Lincolnshire CCG 6,083 35 0 NHS Nottingham City CCG 12,831 297 0 NHS Nottingham North and East 4,453 0 96 0 NHS Nottingham West CCG 3,196 0 69 0 NHS Resolution (formerly NHS Litigation Authority) 0 791 0 2 NHS Rushcliffe CCG 2,903 0 63 0 NHS South Lincolnshire 0 27 0 NHS South West Lincolnshire CCG 3,974 0 24 0 NHS Southern Derbyshire 327 0 NHS West Leicestershire CCG 10,652 0 162 0 HM Revenue & Customs - VAT 0 0 479 0 HM Revenue & Customs - Other taxes and duties and NI contributions 0 10,887 0 2,869 NHS Pension Scheme 0 13,134 0 1,815 During the year, none of the Department of Health Ministers, Trust board members or members of the key management staff, or parties related to any of them, has undertaken any material transactions with East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust.

Due to the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting in 2009-10, NHS Trust's financial performance measurement needs to be aligned with the guidance issued by HM Treasury measuring Departmental expenditure. Therefore, the incremental revenue expenditure resulting from the application of IFRS to IFRIC 12 schemes (which would include PFI schemes), which has no cash impact and is not chargeable for overall budgeting purposes, is excluded when measuring Breakeven performance. Other adjustments are made in respect of accounting policy changes (impairments and the removal of the donated asset and government grant reserves) to maintain comparability year to year.121 Annual Report 2018/2019 Produced by: East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust Trust Headquarters 1 Horizon Place Mellors Way Nottingham Business Park Nottingham NG8 6PY Call: 0115 884 5000 Email: communications@emas.nhs.uk To receive this report in other formats, such as large print, audio or another language, please call our Communications team via 0115 884 5000 "}
