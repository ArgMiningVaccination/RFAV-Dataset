The father of medicine, [Hippocrates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4263393/), put great focus on treating illnesses and diseases through natural medicine. He strongly believed in the self-healing power that our bodies possess. He would encourage nutrition, exercise, massage, and hydrotherapy to his patients which would encourage the natural resistance of organisms to get stronger and overcome diseases. How is holistic medicine different than conventional ways of treating illness or disease? Having a holistic approach doesn't emphasize the absence of illness or disease. Emphasis is placed on overall wellness \u2014 being in good physical and mental health. Is holistic the same as self-care? [Self-care,](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-do-we-mean-by-self-care) a term that's become increasingly popular among millennials, is by definition \"the ability of individuals, families, and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider.\" One common misconception is that self-care refers to activities that are self-indulgent.

Three studies in the 1960s-1970s by psychiatrist George Solomon, physician Herbert Benson, and psychologist Robert Ader showed direct connections between the mind and the body. From studying the effects that emotion had on inflammation to how mental and emotional cues affected the immune system, these studies have led to an increase in mind-body practitioners that specialize directly in mind-body programs. Having a holistic approach to wellness doesn't require an expert. For example, using aromatherapy and a warm bath to relieve stress might be a common part of your self-care routine. While conventional medicine addresses illness or ailments using pharmaceutical drugs, surgery, or medical treatments, professionals who practice mind-body medicine and [holistic wellness](https://splendorofyouth.com/) focus on creating a state of internal balance \u2014 not just the absence of illness. The Rise of Mind-body Medicine Mind-body medicine uses the power of thoughts and emotions to influence physical health by focusing on the relationship between the brain, mind, body, and behavior \u2014 and the powerful ways in which [emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and behavioral factors](https://www.mentalhelp.net/alternative-medicine/mind-body-medicine-an-overview/) can directly affect health.
