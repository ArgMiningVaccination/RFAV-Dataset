Vaccine administration to the public expands through the phases as vaccine becomes more available. Overarching Goal : To vaccinate as many people who choose to be vaccinated as possible in a time -sensitive manner as a critical mitigation strategy in the COVID -19 pandemic response. Advisory Communities on Immunization Practices (AC IP) Allocation Framework of COVID -19 Vaccine1 Balancing Goals: Prevention of Morbidity & Mortality and Preservation of Societal Functioning Phase 1 Operational Goals2 Decrease death and serious disease as much as possible Preserve functioning of society Reduce the extra burden the disease is having on people already facing disparities Increase the chance for everyone to enjoy health and well -being 1 Chamberland, M.E.

Mitigate health inequities \u2014 Reduce health disparities in the burden of COVID- 19 disease and death, and make sure everyone has the opportunity to be as healthy as possible. Promote justice \u2014 Treat affected groups, populations, and communities fairly. Remove unfair, unjust, and avoidable barriers to COVID -19 vaccination. Promote transparency \u2014 Make a decision that is clear, understanda ble, and open for review. Allow and seek public participation in the creation and review of the decision processes. Other Considerations National/statewide trends and data (at- risk groups) Operational considerations (staff levels, critical services/infrast ructure, available supply, etc.) Logistics (vaccination staff/resources, storage, venue support requirements) Time sensitivity (ability to vaccinate large groups within the timeframe) Situations and Assumptions The COVID -19 vaccine allocation phased groups for Delaware were developed based on ethical decision -making only; logistics were not a consideration. The initial allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine to the State of Delaware will not be adequate to protect all the Phase 1 groups 4. The initial allocation of vaccine must be distributed and administered in a very short period due to storage and utilization requirements and urgency to reduce transmission during the pandemic. Operational decision -making is used to consider the physical ability to vaccinate within the Phase 1 sub -groups in order to efficiently utilize the anticipated vaccine supply with the resources available and within the limited timeframe. The vaccine delivery timeline will drive the allocation of resources among the phases; over lap of phased groups is likely (see Figure 2). Flexibility is permitted to adjust phased groups based on current trends and public health needs. 3 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Center for Health Security (2020).

Positive test within 90 days - The best characterized cases of re -infections to date have occurred at least 90 days after the first illness episode's onset. An increasing number of published studies suggest that >90% of recovered COVID- 19 patients develop anti -SARS- CoV-2 antibodies15. Additional studies also demonstrate antibody response, including after mild or asymptomatic infection, can be durable for 3 months or more. This evidence must be interpreted cautiously as anti -SARS- CoV-2 antibodies have not been definitively correlated with protection of humans from infection. 2. Sole Source or Critically Limited Service - If limited staff are available to provide a particular critical service, consider more timely vaccination for these staff to maintain services. 3. Vaccine Side Effects - Although most si de effects after vaccination are mild, side effects may lead to absenteeism from work. Planning for work absenteeism should be considered in the vaccination of staff at a workplace. 4. Multiple Phase Criteria - Individuals that meet multiple phase criteria may be determined to be of higher risk than any one phased group and should be considered for more timely vaccination. 15 Ibarrondo , J.F., et al.
