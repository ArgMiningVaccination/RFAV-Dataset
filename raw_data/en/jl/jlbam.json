What might we be able to improve upon in order to be strong and well prepared to take on what the new year has to bring? \\nSome of us take this time to support the body's cleansing actions as well as to eliminate any extra weight the holidays may have gifted us.\\nI suggest considering three of Cheryl's Herbs' combination teas: TEA\\nThe aim of Burdock Purifying Tea is to assist the body in reducing toxicosis. Insufficient urinary function, deposits such as stones, issues of arthritis, stagnant lymph, congested liver, and skin conditions all stand to receive benefit from this pleasant-tasting combination of purifying herbs. \\nBURDOCK ROOT - Specifically, Burdock is indicated bladder irritation, urinary incontinence, and deposits. By resonating with such urinary issues, Burdock Root also helps resolve arthritis, gout, and rheumatism along with lymphatic stagnation, liver congestion, and a variety of skin conditions including eczema, psoriasis, hives, and weeping eruptions. The more toxic boil or abscess may also be resolved by this herb. Burdock Root is known to assist in the removal of toxins in the gut, thereby supporting the gut's beneficial flora. It may be used for Candida and Colitis, as well.\\nVIOLET LEAF - is useful for urinary tract infections, stagnant lymph, and enlargement of the spleen.\\nSometimes, CLEAVERS HERB is substituted for Violet Leaf. Cleavers Herb is also beneficial for urinary tract infections and stagnant lymph.\\nNETTLE LEAF - helps reduce edema and swelling of the kidneys.\\nRED CLOVER BLOSSOM - helpful when lymph is congested and glands are swollen.\\nLAPACHO BARK (PAU D'ARCO) - is useful for lymphatic congestion and fungal infections.\\nSOURCES: Peter Holmes' The Energetics of Western Herbs, Dr. Sharol Marie Tilgner's Herbal Medicine from the Heart of the Earth, Matthew Wood's The Earthwise Herbal, A Complete Guide to Old World Medicinal Plants\\nBOTANICAL SAFETY INFORMATION\\nBurdock Root, Arctium contains isoflavones, compounds that are structurally similar to the human hormone estradiol and capable of binding to estrogen receptors. Some studies have indicated that Red Clover Blossom isoflavones have a greater affinity for the estrogen receptor Beta (found primarily in bone, brain, heart, and the vascular system) than estrogen receptor Alpha (found primarily in uterus, breast, ovaries, and adrenal glands).\\nLapacho Bark (Pau D'Arco), Tabebuia avellanedae, wild crafted\\nAvoid during pregnancy or lactation. Avoid with blood thinning medication. Large single doses of Lapacho bark decoctions may cause gastrointestinal upset and\\/or nausea.\\n DIGESTIVE TEA\\nDigestive Tea helps to soothe, support, and maintain a healthy digestive system. Drink before, after, or in between meals as needed.\\nDILL SEED - helps break up gas.\\nFENNEL SEED - stimulates the appetite and digestion, settles the stomach reducing the likelihood of nausea, vomiting, and indigestion, and relieves hiccups, gas, and bloating.\\nGINGER ROOT - sluggish liver, appetite loss, difficult, uncomfortable digestion, accumulation of undigested food, nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, and indigestion are addressed by Ginger root.\\nCLOVE FLOWER BUD - stimulates the liver and digestion and helps with gas, hiccups, and indigestion.\\nSOURCES: Matthew Woods' The Earthwise Herbal, A Complete Guide to Old World Medicinal Plants, Peter Holmes' The Energetics of Western Herbs\\nBOTANICAL SAFETY INFORMATION\\nDill Seed, Anethum graveolens, organic\\nAvoid during pregnancy.

Possible interaction with lithium.\\nFennel Seed, Foeniculum vulgare, organic\\nAvoid use of Fennel seed alcohol liquid extracts and Fennel seed essential oil during pregnancy or lactation.

Not for long-term use; do not exceed recommended dose. Standard Dose: 1.0 - 3.0 grams of Clove bud as tea.\\nThis product is certified organic.\\n WEIGHT LOSS TEA\\nNo doubt there are many reasons for unhealthy weight gain. Apart from genetic, medical, or pharmaceutical reasons for the gain, taking on the responsibility of moderating our weight surely implies at the very least an appropriate intake of nutrients from food. Cheryl's Herbs' WEIGHT LOSS TEA has been built upon the knowledge that certain herbs have an affinity for the digestive system and support it by enhancing digestion and absorption of nutrients, which in turn promote metabolism and elimination.\\nCHICKWEED HERB - is a type of demulcent herb indicated for the digestive tract. By moistening, soothing, cooling, and reducing inflammation, it increases the function of the mucosal lining of the tract. Optimal performance of the mucosal lining improves absorption of nutrients into the body, which then increases the efficiency of our metabolism. Efficient metabolism means more energy to use and more calories burned. Improved absorption and metabolism facilitate elimination, as well. Additionally, and what makes this herb the star of this weight loss combination, is Chickweed Herb's ability to reduce fat cells.\\nFENUGREEK SEED - appears to have some success in helping to normalize blood sugar levels. When those levels are within proper range, hunger is better controlled.\\nFENNEL SEED - settles the stomach and stimulates digestion.\\nDANDELION ROOT - is a bitter herb which classifies it as a digestive stimulant. It helps promote the flow of bile which means it assists in the digestion of fat. Fat appears to be a major fuel for our metabolism.\\nGOTU KOLA HERB - helps relieve sluggish digestion.\\nLAPACHO BARK - It may be Lapacho Bark's laxative effect that aids in some degree of weight loss.\\nMILK THISTLE SEED - offers significant support to the health of the liver. Because one of the liver's jobs is to produce bile, Milk Thistle Seed contributes to the proper digestion of fat.\\nSOURCES: Peter Holmes' The Energetics of Western Herbs, Dr. Sharol Marie Tilgner's Herbal Medicine from the Heart of the Earth, Leslie Taylor's The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs\\nBOTANICAL SAFETY INFORMATION\\nChickweed Herb, Stellaria media, used appropriately.\\nFenugreek Seed, Trigonella foenum-graecum, organic\\nAvoid during pregnancy.
