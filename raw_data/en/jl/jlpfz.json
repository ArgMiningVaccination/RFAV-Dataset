COVID-19 treatments work best when you receive them as soon as possible after becoming sick, so it's important to get tested and talk to your doctor right away to find the treatment that is best for you. Each of these treatments have proven to be effective against COVID-19 and are available throughout New York State. There are currently two types of treatment options available: [Monoclonal Antibody Treatment](/monoclonal-antibody-therapeutics) - Given as a preventative to be given to those who are not COVID-19 positive but who have immune system issues or who are unable to get the COVID-19 vaccine. - Administration: Via intravenous (IV) drip or via injection (preventative). [Antivirals](/oral-antivirals) - Given soon after positive COVID-19 diagnosis to help fight infection and shorten recovery time. - Administration: Either via intravenous (IV) drip or as a tablet or capsule. All treatments require a prescription. You should talk to your provider to see what is right for you. If you test positive for COVID-19 and do not have a regular health care provider, you can find a treatment provider at [COVID-19 therapeutics locator](https://covid-19-therapeutics-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/). Eligibility New Yorkers 12 years or older who test positive for COVID-19 and are experiencing symptoms may be eligible for treatment. The FDA also recently approved the antiviral Veklury (remdesivir) for pediatric patients 28 days or older weighing at least 3 kilograms. Oral antivirals can be given within 5 days of having symptoms. Each treatment option has its own eligibility criteria and suggested use. That's why we urge all New Yorkers to get tested as soon as symptoms come on and to reach out to their healthcare provider to seek treatment if they are positive. Your healthcare provider can determine whether you are eligible and what treatment would be best for you. Frequently Asked Questions How do I know if I have COVID-19?
