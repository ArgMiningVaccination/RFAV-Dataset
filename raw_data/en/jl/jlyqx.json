This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AT of hip pain. We searched eight databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of AT on hip pain until August 2022. Twelve RCTs (806 patients) were included: two reported a significant effect of AT compared with that of conventional medicine (CM) alone for hip pain; two reported significant effects of AT + CM compared with that of CM alone in terms of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); two reported a significant effect of AT + CM compared with that of Sham AT + CM in terms of anaesthetic dosage; two reported a significant effect of AT + CM compared with that of Sham AT + CM in terms of the side effects associated with analgesic use; one study reported a significant effect of AT compared to that of no-treatment. No serious adverse events were reported. Our findings demonstrate the potential of AT in managing hip pain. Given the low quality and small sample sizes of the studies, the evidence supporting AT for hip pain management was weak. Further clinical trials and systematic reviews are required. The protocol of the current study was registered in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42017079586).", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-01", "cleaned_text": "Acupuncture Treatment for Hip Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11111624](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11111624) [Integrative, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in Healthcare]( /journal/healthcare/topical_collections/CAM_Health )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-11-01624)]. Despite its inherent stability, the hip joint provides the necessary high-degree mobility for performing daily activities such as standing and walking. The area surrounding the hip joint is supported by strong joint ligaments and a thick, strong muscle layer, which plays a vital role in stabilising the joint and providing mobility [ [2](#B2-healthcare-11-01624)]. [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01624)]. [4](#B4-healthcare-11-01624)]. [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01624)]. Kim et al. reported that TCM treatment methods for hip pain include acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, herbal medicine, cupping, moxibustion, and Chuna (Korean-style manual and ST31 [ [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01624)]. [7](#B7-healthcare-11-01624), [8](#B8-healthcare-11-01624)]. In addition, there are various types of acupuncture, including auricular acupuncture, electroacupuncture, pharmacopuncture, and acutomy. Among them, auricular acupuncture is known to relieve pain by stimulating the nerves of the auricle and correcting imbalances in the body in both directions [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-01624), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01624)]. [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01624)]. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review of previous RCTs that used acupuncture in all diseases that cause hip pain including hip OA to explore and present evidence of its effects. 2.

[Table 1](#healthcare-11-01624-t001)summarises the details of the included studies. Participants 3.3. Intervention [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624), [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01624), [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624)] [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)]. The [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), were used in each of two different studies. Ashi points were also used in four studies [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624)]. MA-AH4 (hip joint) and MA-TF1 (shenmen) were used in all four studies using auricular acupuncture, [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] and MA-AH4 (hip joint) and in three [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)]. IC1 (lungs) and MA-AT1 cun anterior to the mandibular angle (hip joint) were each used in one study. 3.3.2. Needle Type (Diameter, Length) [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01624), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)]. Needles with a diameter of 0.30 mm were used in three studies [ [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01624), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624)], and needles with diameter of 0.18 mm [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)], 0.25 mm [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624)], and 0.40 mm [ [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624)] were used in each study. The needle length varied from 25 mm to 75 mm. All the studies that used auricular acupuncture used needles with a diameter of 0.22 mm. Three studies [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] used a needle with a length of 1.5 mm, and one study [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624)] used a needle with a length of 1.3 mm. One study [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624)] did not report the needle type, and another study [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624)] did not clearly indicate needle size. 3.3.3. Depth of Insertion 3.3.4. Angle of Insertion 3.3.5. Needle Retention Time 3.3.6. CM [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)], Sham AT [ [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624)], and + CM combined treatment [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)]. In detail, AT was compared with no-treatment, and CM, Sham AT, and AT + CM combined treatment was compared with CM and Sham AT + CM combined treatment. 3.5. Intervention Effects 3.5.1. Outcome Measures [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624)], and the used in three studies [ [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624)]. In addition, VAS Scores [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), requirement [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)], [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)], and fentanyl dose [ [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] were used as evaluation tools in two studies. All other evaluation tools were used in this study. 3.5.2. Types [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)], avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip in one case [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624)], and bursitis around the hip in one case [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624)]. In addition, six studies [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] performed total hip arthroplasty (THA), and THA was performed for hip OA in four [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] of the six studies. 3.5.3. AT versus CM (Conventional Medicine) [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624), [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624)] compared AT and CM treatments in patients who did not undergo THA, and two studies [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624)] showed that AT had a significant effect compared to CM treatment in patients with hip joint pain. In one study [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624)], AT showed a significant effect compared to CM treatment in relation to the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score (p < 0.05), and in another study [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624)], in relation to the VAS and Harris score (Pain, Function, ROM, Total), AT showed a significant effect on CM treatment and were considered significant (p < 0.05). 3.5.4. AT + CM versus CM [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)], the combination of AT and CM treatment was compared with CM treatment alone. One study [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624)] compared the combination of AT and CM treatment with CM treatment alone after PRFA surgery and one study [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)] before THA. A meta-analysis was conducted on the VAS score. As a result of the meta-analysis, combined AT and CM treatment showed a statistically significant reduction in the VAS score compared to CM treatment (p < 0.05) ( [Figure 2](#healthcare-11-01624-f002)). In addition, in one study [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)], AT and CM combined treatment showed a significant effect compared to CM treatment in relation to Anaesthesia positioning time and Anaesthesia completion time (p < 0.05), and in another study [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624)], in terms of Harris score (Pain, Function) and Inflammatory factors (CRP, TNF-), AT and CM combined treatment showed a significant effect compared to CM treatment (p < 0.05). 3.5.5. AT + CM versus Sham AT + CM [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)], the combined treatment of AT and CM was compared with the combined treatment of Sham AT and CM, and a meta-analysis was conducted on the anaesthetic dose and incidence of analgesic side effects (nausea and vomiting). As a result of the meta-analysis, in two studies [ [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)], combined treatment of AT and CM showed statistically significant results in terms of fentanyl dosage compared with combined treatment of Sham AT and CM (p < 0.01) ( [Figure 3](#healthcare-11-01624-f003)). In addition, two other studies [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] showed that AT and CM combined treatment had a statistically significant effect compared to Sham AT and CM combined treatment on the incidence of nausea and vomiting (OR 0.24; 95% CI and no-treatment groups were compared and evaluated. In one study [ [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01624)], statistically significant results were obtained for the VAS, T lymphocytes, and serological tests (p < 0.05). In the other study [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624)], WOMAC and SF-36 were used as evaluation indicators, but neither showed significant results. 3.5.7. AT versus Sham AT [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624)], the AT and Sham AT groups were compared and evaluated, but no statistically significant effect was observed. 3.6. Adverse Events [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624)]. No AEs were reported in four studies [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)], and AEs were not [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624), [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01624), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01624), [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624)]. In one study [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624)], minor local bleeding or hematoma, pain at the site of needle insertion, and vegetative symptoms were reported in the AT group and no AEs were reported in the no-treatment group. In another study [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624)], auricular haemorrhage, local pain, headache, and hip pain after needle placement were reported in the AT + CM group, and auricular haemorrhage and local pain were reported in the Sham AT + CM group. 3.7. Assessment for ROB [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624), [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01624)], there was no mention of the random assignment order method; therefore, they were evaluated as having an unclear risk. [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)], the group was assigned by an independent third party to conceal the assignment order; therefore, it was evaluated as low risk. In the remaining 11 studies, there was no mention of concealment of the assignment order; therefore, they were evaluated as having an as high risk in terms of the blinding of subjects and researchers. Owing to the nature of RCTs on acupuncture, the risk of bias for subject and researcher blinding may be high. [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624)], the item on blinding of the outcome assessor was evaluated as high risk. Nine papers were evaluated as having unclear risk because they were not mentioned, and two papers [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624)] were evaluated as having low risk. [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624)], and they were evaluated as high risk due to a lack of relevant comments. In one study [ [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01624)], there were significant missing values in the patient group, which could have affected the results; therefore, this study was evaluated as high risk. Two studies [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01624), [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624)] that did not address the exclusion/dropout outcomes were assessed as having unclear risks. The remaining seven papers were evaluated as low risk. 4. Discussion [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01624)]. [23](#B23-healthcare-11-01624)], acupuncture treatment among TCM treatments can be an alternative to conventional treatment, because it has few side effects and is effective in reducing pain [ [24](#B24-healthcare-11-01624), [25](#B25-healthcare-11-01624)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01624)]. [7](#B7-healthcare-11-01624), [8](#B8-healthcare-11-01624)]. However, no systematic literature review has examined the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of hip pain. Therefore, in this study, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 12 RCT that studied the effect of acupuncture on hip pain were conducted to determine the effect of acupuncture on hip pain and to prepare the basis for prognostic judgment. [26](#B26-healthcare-11-01624), [27](#B27-healthcare-11-01624)]. The most frequently used acupoints in studies using ear acupuncture are MA-AH4 and MA-TF1; it is thought that these two acupoints were also selected considering the effect of the acupuncture point and the location of pain. [2](#B2-healthcare-11-01624)]. Four of the studies used auricular acupuncture. The auricular acupuncture needle has a smaller diameter or length than general acupuncture needles but has a longer retention time. Auricular acupuncture is known to enhance the analgesic effect through continuous stimulation and is used for various types of pain treatment in clinical practice [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-01624), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01624)]. [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01624)]. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in all diseases that cause hip pain, including hip OA. Additionally, studies on pain occurring before and after total hip arthroplasty (THA) were also included, similar to previous studies conducted by Li [ [28](#B28-healthcare-11-01624)] and Shin [ [29](#B29-healthcare-11-01624)]. Nevertheless, this study is significant because only two studies [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)] overlapped with Li's study, and Shin's study has not yet been conducted as a protocol. [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01624), [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01624), [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01624), [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01624)]. The meta-analysis compared the CM and sham acupuncture plus CM groups to the acupuncture plus CM group and showed statistically significant results in VAS reduction in the former and fentanyl dose in the latter. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624), [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624)]. In one study of acupuncture [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01624)], side effects such as minor local bleeding or hematoma, pain at the site of needle insertion, and vegetative symptoms were reported in the experimental acupuncture group. In one study of auricular acupuncture [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01624)], side effects such as auricular haemorrhage, local pain, headache, and hip pain after needle placement were reported in both the experimental acupuncture group and the control sham acupuncture group. These side effects were treated appropriately without further complications. Similar side effects have been reported in other studies related to acupuncture [ [30](#B30-healthcare-11-01624), [31](#B31-healthcare-11-01624)] and auricular acupuncture [ [32](#B32-healthcare-11-01624)]; therefore, they can be considered common side effects of auricular acupuncture. One of the greatest advantages of acupuncture is its low incidence of side effects [ [33](#B33-healthcare-11-01624)]; no fatal side effects were reported in the 12 RCTs included in this study. 5.
