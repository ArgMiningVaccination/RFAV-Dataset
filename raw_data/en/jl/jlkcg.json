And this had countless benefits that Western science is now starting to document. For example, research has shown that soil microbes change from one season to the next, attaching to the roots of seasonal foods and herbs. Those microbes not only inoculate your gut with the appropriate seasonal bacteria, they also support the effectiveness and potency of the herb itself. According to Ayurveda, seasonal soil microbes, when consumed with food or herbs, also act as circadian (seasonal) probiotics and bio-enhancers, supporting gut health and your immune system. Getting the right microbes from your organic foods each season allows you to boost immunity in the winter, decongest in the spring, and dissipate heat in the summer.

The heat of summer is the perfect antidote to help dry up excess moisture, mucus, or congestion that spring leaves behind.

I grow it every year in my garden. It enhances a salad, makes a great green smoothie, and can be brewed into a tasty tea. Ayurvedically its tastes are bitter, astringent, and sweet, which are the three tastes that most effectively balance pitta. Even though brahmi is mostly a cooling herb and a great to antidote the summer's heat, it can be used by all body types in all seasons. Brahmi, aka gota kola, has numerous other health promoting properties. It's known to support cognitive function by supporting better brain lymphatic drainage. It's also one of the best herbs for maintaining a radiant complexion and supporting a healthy intestinal lining. Brahmi is also an adaptogen, helping the body cope with stress and emotional ups and downs.

[Neem](https://store.lifespa.com/product/neem-plus-capsules/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=lifespa.com&utm_campaign=Neem) (Azadirachta indica) is perhaps the most famous pitta-pacifying herb. It has so many properties it is commonly called the village pharmacy. The traditional Ayurvedic doctor could give neem for almost any condition because of its broad spectrum effectiveness. Neem has a bitter taste and is a refrigerant, which means it acts as the perfect antidote for summers heat. Also called the Queen of the Skin, it, like Brahmi, supports the healthy function of both the inner and outer skin. Studies have also found that neem supports the healthy breakup of undesirable bio-film that allows bacteria to uncontrollably proliferate and disturb the delicate balance of the gut microbiome. By addressing the environment of the intestines and the proliferation of a healthy microbiome, neem has access to every organ and organ system in the body.

[Shatavari](https://store.lifespa.com/product/shatavari-capsules/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=lifespa.com&utm_campaign=Shatavari) (Asparagus racemosus) is one of the most rejuvenating herb for both men and women. It has been wrongly pigeonholed as estrogenic and only for women, but studies show that it boost libido more in men than it does in women. From the Ayurvedic perspective, shatavari is an [ojas](https://lifespa.com/ayurvedic-supplement-facts/ojas/) builder, which suggests that it supports immunity, a radiant complexion, energy, and vitality, as well as virility. It has a sweet and bitter taste and is therefore a very cooling herb. Shatavari is also an unctuous herb that effectively resolves the dryness that comes with excess heat. Shatavari will not let the body or skin dry out each summer\u2014a dryness that sets the stage for vata aggravation with the incoming cold and dry winter. Because of its natural coolingproperties, shatavari supports a healthy epithelial and healthy inner skin, including the lining of the intestines, stomach, lungs, and kidneys, making it one of the revered herbs of Ayurveda.
