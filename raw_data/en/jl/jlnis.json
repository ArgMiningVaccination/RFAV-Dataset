Usage data(Countries) Format A data frame with 258 observations on the following variables. worldmap region name http://mappinghacks.com/ data sets gapminder country name in Gapminder data sets maps region name in maps data sets Details The \"countries\" in the maps data include several other geographic regions (bodies of water, islands belonging to other countries, Hawaii, etc.) that are not countries. Furthermore, the maps countries do not include many of the countries that have been created since ca. 2000. The mapping is therefore many-to-many, and also includes some NAs when there is no appropriate mapping. Bodies of water in the maps data, for example, are not assigned a country in the Gapminder.

Usage data(Dimes) Format A data frame with 30 observations on the following 2 variables. mass mass of dime in grams year year the dime was minted Details These data were collected on a sample taken from a large sack of dimes for the purpose of estimating the total number of dimes in the sack based on the weights of the individual dimes. Source Data were collected by Michael Stob. Galton Galton's dataset of parent and child heights Description In the 1880's, Francis Galton was developing ways to quantify the heritability of traits.

Patients with established primary care relationships they planned to continue, signicant dementia, specic plans to leave the Boston area that would prevent research participation, failure to provide contact information for tracking purposes, or pregnancy were excluded. Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxication stay and follow-up interviews were undertaken every 6 months for 2 years. A variety of continuous, count, discrete, and survival time predictors and outcomes were collected at each of these ve occasions. This data set is a subset of the HELPmiss data set restricted to the 453 subjects who were fully observed on the age,cesd (There is some missingness in the other variables.) HELPmiss contains 17 additional subjects with partially observed data on some of these baseline variables. This is also a subset of the HELPfull data which includes 5 timepoints and many additional variables. Note The \\code{HELPrct} data set was originally named \\code{HELP} but has been renamed to avoid confusion with the \\code{help} function.

Is this because boys have wider feet, or because it is assumed that girls, even in elementary school, are willing to sacrice comfort for fashion? To assess the former, a statistician measures kids' feet.\" References Mary C.

Usage data(Mites) Format A data frame with 47 observations on the following variables. treatment a factor with levels mites andno mites outcome a factor with levels wilt andno wilt Details Researchers suspected that attack of a plant by one organism induced resistance to subsequent attack by a different organism. Individually potted cotton plants were randomly allocated to two groups: infestation by spider mites or no infestation. After two weeks the mites were dutifully removed by a conscientious research assistant, and both groups were inoculated with Verticillium, a fungus that causes Wilt disease.
