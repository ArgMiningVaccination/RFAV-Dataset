Avena Commitment to Quality. | | | || | WEBINAR (25min) Discussing why it is the #1 selling product for more than 25 years. Q. How long should I use this for? A. We would recommend you continue to use Herb Cocktail until you can support healthy bowel eliminations on just good diet alone. Having one for each meal you ingest, or minimum of 3 per day. Q. How does this work? A. Avena's Herb Cocktail works inside the bowel to promote complete evacuation. Forming into a gel, it absorbs undigested foods and effectively breaks down impacted stools on intestinal walls. More than a cleanser, it helps improve bowel function by encouraging and exercising proper peristalsis. Our most dynamic formulation, Herb Cocktail cleans deep without harsh stimulation for a safe and gentle cleanse. It improves bowel function to support healthy elimination. Q. Is this safe of pregnant Woman? A. We do NOT recommend pregnant woman or nursing mothers partake of any form of detoxification unless absolutely nessecary, The child will act like a filter and absorb the increased toxicity while detoxing. It is best detox before your pregnant or after your done nursing. Q. I heard Cascara Sagarda is addictive? A. 1. Herb Cocktail is Electrically formulated, without getting overly technical this means that the individual characteristics of the Cascara Sagrada are combined with the other ingredients to create a new ingredient, each contributing to the overall experience. The Herb Cocktail does not act or behave like Cascara Sagrada in any way, shape, or form. I do not recommend people use Cascara Sagrada with IBS, but I do highly recommend people use the Herb Cocktail while experiencing IBS. It is safe, gentle, and very effective not only with cleaning but also healing. 2. The Herb Cocktail forms into a unique gel that draws and pulls toxins from all aspects of the body, because of this behavior everything is drawn into the Gel, and nothing is pulled out of the gel. So people do not absorb any of the Cascara Sagrada, or other ingredients. Giving it a very gentle, and safe use for all sorts of intestinal dysfunctions. Also keep in mind the level of Cascara Sagrada is very small and would not be enough to cause any discomfort for majority of people. Q. Can Children use this? A. Children facing constipation or diahrea can consider use of the Herb Cocktail, Use a body mass equivalent, If the child weighs half of a adult man, use half the suggested dosage. Use short term and increase raw vegetables and natural whole food fibres. Q. What diet changes should I make while using the Herb Cocktail A. We would advise to remove gluten and flour from your diet during a cleanse, especially with the Herb Cocktail, A Gel mixed with flour is not good news for your bowel. If you do have to consume gluten and Flour products, try to separate your Herb Cocktail as far apart as possible. Q. Will I Experience excess bowel movements? A. It is very unlikely that you will experience diarrhea, as the product turns into a gel. You may find that it even rectifies diarrhea. Q.What should I expect? A. While taking the Herb Cocktail, you can expect an increase in bowel movements, and possible detox symptoms. Q.What are some detox symptoms I may experience while taking this product? A. Some possible detox symptoms are headaches, fatigue, gas, bloating, dehydration, and Abdominal discomfort. Q.How long does it take to cleanse? A.This will vary greatly due to diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. A person should aim to cleanse for at least 90 days and reassess their body at that time. A standard recommendation is to cleanse a full month for every year you have consumed a Standard American Diet(SAD). Q. Why does the Herb Cocktail have a different colour than the last bottle I had? A. Color variances are very common with 100% whole foods, but that it doesn't effect the product quality. The Herb Cocktail contains a flower called hibiscus, which changes color in every season and region. Q. Is there a difference between the capsule and powder form? A. There is a difference in the cost, as you are getting twice as much in the powder form, than you are in the capsules. The rate of effectiveness is also greater in the powder, due to the formation of the gel beginning through the process of combining the powder and the liquid content together. Where as taking the capsules, the production of the gel does not start until the capsules reach the digestive tract.This is why the powder may seem more effective. Q.Can it be taken with food or supplements? A. This product is not suggested to be taking with food or any other supplements, as the gel will absorb everything that is present in the intestinal tract, which may decrease the effectiveness of the supplements. We recommend taking the Herb Cocktail either one hour before consuming foods, or two hours after. Q. What is a healthy bowel movement? A. The answer to this could change with everyone advice, But consider the following as an logical idea. You should have 3 or more movements per day, they should be 2/3rds the size of your wrist, they should be 1' long or the distance between your wrist and elbow, they should be solid consistency, light brown colour, they should float or slowly sink, they should not smell very bad or leave much on the tissue. HOW MANY BOWEL MOVEMENTS SHOULD YOU HAVE EACH DAY? After each meal, your body should have an elimination. So if you eat three meals a day, you should have three bowel movements a day. If you eat three meals each day, but only have one or two bowel movements, your second and third meals are backing up in your colon, causing auto-intoxication or self-poisoning.
