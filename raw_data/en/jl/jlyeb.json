The goal is to engage primary and subspecialty health care providers (HCPs) in integrating local and tertiary center survivorship care. Faculty : Alexander Role: Title: Improving Dexterity in Children with Cerebral Palsy by Training Finger Individualization Goal : The goal of this project is to examine the efficacy of a novel training paradigm to improve fine control of the impaired hand in children and young adul ts with cerebral palsy. To accomplish this we propose two specific aims: 1) Explore the neural correlates of diminished finger individuation and its rehabilitation; 2) Use intensive training of finger individuation to improve manual dexterity Faculty : Alexander Role: Co -I (6% Title: Neural Mechanisms of Impaired Finger Independence in Stroke Survivors Goal: Spatial muscle activation patterns in the upper limb (intrinsic and ext rinsic finger muscles) will be evaluated using high -density surface EMG recordings in stroke survivors and age -matched controls. Then, using a new technique called event -timing coherence analysis, these activation patterns will be mapped to spinal, subcort ical and cortical levels of control in order to better understand normal and maladaptive UNC PM&R 2018-2019 Page 8 of 23 activation patterns in the patient with stroke -related hemiparesis. We will also analyze individual motor units to determine if there is evidence of axonal reinnervation following stroke. Through these findings, we hope to establish a theoretical foundation that can provide guidance for the development of centrally or peripherally targeted rehabilitation strategies to maximize hand functional recovery of stroke survivors. Faculty : Filer Role: Co Title: Real -time direct control of a powered prosthetic ankle using surface electromyography. Goal: Commercially available powered prostheses for the lower limb utilize pre -programmed pattern generators based on common movement patterns such as walking or stair -climbing. Unfortunately, this control strategy struggles to adapt to less-common or multidirectional tasks often encountered by lower limb amputees. This study will test a direct myoelectric control strategy of a powered ankle prosthesis and measure the cognitive load of such a control strategy. We will also test this control strategy for both cyclical and non - cyclical tasks in comparison to existi ng methods of motor control. Faculty : Filer of a Powered Knee Prosthesis using a novel Reinforcement Learning -based tuning system and Visual Biofeedback Goal: The objective of this study is to implement a novel machine learning strategy (Reinforcement Learning) to tune a powered-knee prosthesis for subjects with a unilateral above knee amputation. Effects on gait metrics (biomechanics, symmetry , perceived effort) will be measured for prosthetic and intact limbs. Subsequently, a visual biofeedback system will be employed to train subjects in the use of the device, with the goal of additional improvement in gait biomechanics. Faculty : Filer Role: 03/31/2025 BME/NCSU Title: Adaptive Coordination of Functional Electrical Stimulation with a Powered Exoskeleton to Improve Sitting -to-Standing in People with Paraplegia Goal: The lon g-term goal of the research program is to enable people with spinal cord injury (SCI) to stand and walk by using a hybrid exoskeleton technology that combines functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a lower -limb powered exoskeleton. The central object ive in this application is to validate new controllers that adapt to day -to-day and inter -person variabilities in muscle responses, optimize coordination between FES - assist and the exoskeleton based on a user specific muscle fatigue and recovery model, and assess the ability of the controllers to reduce FES-induced muscle fatigue by using ultrasound imaging as a sensing modality.
