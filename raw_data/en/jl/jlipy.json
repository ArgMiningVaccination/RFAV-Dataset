This is a topic I get asked about all the time and wanted to put together a post that would answer all of your questions. In doing so, I have learned SO much about the candle industry in general and I have found the best nontoxic candle brands that use natural ingredients, so you can feel good about burning them. I mean, who doesn't love the coziness that a candle can bring to your home...but the harmful chemicals found in conventional candles aren't worth it. Thankfully there are better choices out there. I am sharing all the information, along with what I think are the best nontoxic candles, including my honorable mentions too. Let's dive in! *Affiliate Disclosure: I do have affiliate links in this blog post. If you purchase something from my link, I will receive a small commission from the sale.

We are extremely grateful for the willingness to let us test out their candles. Many candles were tested and not all were included in our guide. We only wanted to include the best! We will periodically update this list as we are waiting to hear back from a few brands as they confirm the ingredients in their candles** Are candles actually toxic? Unfortunately, there are candles on the market that are toxic and release toxic chemicals into the air when they are burned, which ultimately contributes to indoor air pollution. I would even venture to say most candles contain toxic ingredients. I do think it's important to realize that if you choose to burn anything in your home, there is the potential for toxins to be released into the air even with the safest, most nontoxic choices. However, the good news is that I am going to give you all the information you need to make a better choice for you and your home and help you find the best natural candles! What to consider when looking for a safe, nontoxic candle? When looking for truly clean candles you need to consider the wax, the wick, and the fragrance that is used. And, as I researched the candle industry, I will admit there was more to know than I realized. While I was known to burn a vanilla candle throughout most of college, I haven't always been one to burn candles after switching over to a greener lifestyle. It honestly just seemed like an extra thing and I didn't want to have to worry about any harmful ingredients. Now that I have done the research and found companies I can stand behind, that is definitely changing for me! I love the ambiance of a candle. And, with the right scent, it can be the best addition to a home, especially in the cooler months. When you are looking into a candle company, you will want to consider the following to ensure the candle has all clean ingredients: 1. Wax First thing, you want to consider the type of wax that a brand uses for their candles because most conventional candles are made from paraffin wax, which is a derivative of petroleum. The concern with this, and really most petroleum products, is that it isn't clean burning. We are all familiar with the idea that when a petroleum product like gasoline is burned it releases toxic substances and high amounts of carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. ( [1](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/petroleum/)) When paraffin candles are burned they can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air. ( [2](https://www.iqair.com/us/blog/health-wellness/hidden-dangers-scented-candles)) This includes benzene, a known carcinogen ( [3](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/benzene.html)), and toluene, which can affect the nervous system ( [4](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts56.pdf)). Just like any other toxins, a one-time exposure is so different than if you light a candle daily and are frequently exposed. Safer, Non Toxic Wax Choices: 100% soy (non-GMO would be ideal but those companies working with American-grown soy wax will struggle to have this as a choice), coconut oil, vegetable oil or beeswax. You may have to inquire with a company to make sure that the candle wax contains ONLY these ingredients. 2. Wick Candle wicks used to be a much bigger deal than they are currently when it came to finding a non toxic candle. However, in 2003 the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned the manufacture and sale of lead-cored wicks and candles with lead-cored wicks. ( [5]) Despite this, you still want to look into what exactly the wick from your favorite candle brand is made from. Wicks are typically made from cotton, wood or even hemp. You can take it a step further and inquire with the candle company if their cotton wick is bleached or unbleached. You will also want to inquire if it is a wood wick, if it has been soaked in any type of oils and what kind. Safer, Non Toxic Wick Choices: You will want to look for 100% cotton or hemp that is unbleached or wood that is untreated or soaked in a natural substance. 3. Fragrance If you are familiar at all with 'fragrance,' you know that if you see it listed on a label or a brand says they use 'fragrance,' it is important to dig in and find out exactly what makes up that fragrance. If you want all the details, you can read my blog post [Natural Perfume and Fragrance](https://gurlgonegreen.com/2021/02/23/natural-perfume-and-fragrance/). But, in a nutshell, when you see the word \"fragrance\" on a label of a product there could be dozens of other ingredients in it as well- and more like hundreds to be exact. A company does not have to disclose the exact ingredients in their artificial fragrances since it is looked at as trade secrets by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the National Academy of Sciences, at one point approximately 95% of the chemicals used in synthetic fragrance oils were derived from petroleum! ( [6]) So even if you manage to avoid petroleum in the wax of the candle, if you don't check out the fragrance, you may still be exposed! My biggest take away when looking for non toxic candles is that it is easiest to choose a candle that is scented with '100% essential oils' or 'essential oils only.' If you like a stronger scent, the synthetic candles we tested tended to be stronger, so it may be worth your time to investigate candle brands that use safe synthetics. Safer, Non Toxic Fragrance Choices: Candles scented with pure essential oils, 100% essential oil blends, fragrance oils derived from natural essential oils, or safe synthetic fragrances. If it says fragrance anywhere as an ingredient, this is something that you MUST inquire of the company and get more information on. Being made with phthalate-free fragrance oils isn't enough!

They audit them every year, so consumers can be assured that their candles are as clean as they claim. GGG Team's Review: These are really one of the best scented candles out there. The ingredients used in their candles are top notch. For someone who doesn't love heavily scented products, I thought the scent intensity was just perfect!

GGG Team's Review: I love these 100% beeswax candles! It's so nice being able to have a candle that you can buy in a variety of sizes and add to whatever candle holder you have. I love the simplicity of the Bluecorn Beeswax candles- they really go well with anything! They give off a subtle honey scent from the beeswax but that's it. I love how there isn't a strong scent. Such a great gift idea too! [Check Unbleached Cotton Wick Coated in Beeswax Fragrance: No additional fragrance added What makes Welch Candle Co.
