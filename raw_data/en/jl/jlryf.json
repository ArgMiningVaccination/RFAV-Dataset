The AERLP was established by the 57th Montana Legislature in 2001 and is managed by the Montana Energy Office, a bureau of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Since its inception, the program has provided financing for more than $17 million in alternative energy systems and energy saving measures installed in Montana homes and businesses. The revolving loan program is principally funded by air quality penalties collected by DEQ. The interest rate for 2023 is fixed at 3.5 percent, 4.023% APR*. *APR based on a $25,000 loan, 3.5% interest rate, 10 year term, and $625 in closing costs. Ranking Procedure in Effect for New Applications Demand for AERLP loans is expected to exceed available funds this quarter. Pursuant to the administrative rules guiding the program (Administrative Rules of Montana, Title 17, Chapter 85), DEQ has established ranking criteria to prioritize new, eligible applications for funding. Please see the Ranking Criteria & Procedures for more details. DEQ staff will continue to accept and review loan applications on a rolling basis. New applications received on or after March 25, 2023 that clear both technical and financial review will be included in the next scoring, ranking, and funding round. The next round is tentatively scheduled for September 4, 2023. Please contact AERLP staff with questions. Updated August 22, 2023.

Alternative Energy Systems \"Alternative energy systems\" are defined in Montana law as \"the generation system or equipment used to convert energy sources into usable sources using fuel cells that do not require hydrocarbon fuel, geothermal systems, low-emission wood or biomass, wind, photovoltaics, geothermal, small hydropower plants under 1 megawatt, and other recognized non-fossil forms of energy generation.\" (15-32-102, Montana Code Annotated) Alternative energy systems commonly financed by the AERLP include: - Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems - Solar thermal systems for water or space heating - Geothermal systems, including ground source heat pumps - Wind generators - EPA-certified low-emission pellet stoves or wood stoves Energy Conservation Measures \"Capital investments for energy conservation purposes when done in conjunction with an alternative energy system\" are defined in Montana law as \"a capital investment that is used for an energy conservation purpose that is in the same structure as, and is constructed, installed, or otherwise put in service as part of, or at about the same time as, an alternative energy system to reduce the size of energy system needed.\" (17.85.103, Administrative Rules of Montana) Energy conservation measures commonly financed by the AERLP include: - Insulation - High-efficiency windows - Energy-efficient appliances Additional requirements The proposed project, activity, or equipment must: - Be located in Montana - Be technically appropriate for Montana's climate - Be proven reliable and be commercially available - Generate energy for the sole use of the owner, however, net metering systems are eligible for funding - Meet all applicable certifications and standards, such as local building codes and utility interconnection requirements - Comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements protecting the quality of resources such as air, water, land, fish, wildlife, and recreational opportunities DEQ will conduct a technical, environmental and financial review of all applications to determine program eligibility. Feel free to contact program staff with questions. Application Review and Funding Steps DEQ generally accepts and processes loan applications throughout the year. It usually takes two to four weeks for the approval process, and up to two additional weeks for loan funds to be deposited in the borrower's bank account. - Upon receipt of an application DEQ assesses the application for completeness, and begins technical and environmental reviews. Program staff will contact the applicant if the application materials are incomplete or if additional information is required to determine eligibility. When technical and environmental reviews are complete, DEQ transfers the application to the AERLP financial services contractor, Montana Business Assistance Connection (MBAC) for financial review. - MBAC analyzes the applicant's credit and loan repayment history, debt-to-income ratio, and loan security. MBAC may request additional information as necessary to process the loan application. Upon completing its financial review, MBAC will make a recommendation to DEQ to either fund or not fund the loan application. - DEQ reviews the recommendation and findings of MBAC's financial review and either approves or denies the issuance of a loan commitment statement to the applicant. MBAC will mail the approved loan commitment to the applicant, including a list of items required for loan closing. - Applicant must sign and return the loan commitment statement to MBAC. Upon receipt of a signed loan commitment statement, MBAC will mail final loan documents to the applicant. - Applicant must sign and return the loan documents to MBAC. Upon receipt of signed loan documents, MBAC will deposit loan proceeds in the borrower's bank account. - Borrowers are required to provide DEQ with photographs of all major components of the project no more than 30 days after installation. Borrowers are also required to obtain and submit copies of all applicable permits, the approved inspection record for all applicable permits and a copy of the fully executed utility interconnection agreements (if required) no more than 30 days after installation. Project verification requirements are a condition of the loan and are the responsibility of the borrower. - AERLP may conduct site visits to verify the project installation. - Borrower makes loan payments to MBAC. MBAC will remit those payments to DEQ in order to fund new loans. How long does it take to receive funds? Timeline can vary based on a number of factors, but usually it takes two to four weeks for the application review and approval process, and up to two additional weeks for loan funds to be deposited in the borrower's bank account. How is the money received and used? Loan funds are deposited into the borrower's bank account shortly after the final loan documents are signed and submitted to DEQ's financial services contractor, the Montana Business Assistance Connection (MBAC). Loan funds are restricted to qualified expenditures. DEQ site visits may be required to assure the loan funds are used as proposed. What can loan funds be used for? Loan funds are restricted to qualified purchases and services including but not limited to: - Engineering and consulting services - Financial services associated with the project - Normal loan fees and closing costs - Equipment and components - Installation costs and associated services - Energy conservation products (when installed in conjunction with an alternative energy system) and associated installation costs and services - Other qualifying items as approved by the program manager What can loan funds not be used for? Loan funds may not be used for a number of expenditures including but not limited to: - Purchasing land, buildings, or vehicles - Paying the applicant for in-kind labor or services - Purchasing fossil fuel-powered generators or heating systems - Repairing or replacing roofs What technical information is required? The required supporting documents can be found in the application checklist ( [individual](https://deq.mt.gov/files/Energy/Documents/AERLP/AERLP_Individual_Checklist.pdf), [business](https://deq.mt.gov/files/Energy/Documents/AERLP/AERLP_Business_Checklist.pdf)). A site assessment of the project is required, including a map delineating the planned locations for the equipment to be installed. Other information includes: - Energy production estimates as appropriate - Energy saving calculations with assumptions - Product information, specifications, manufacturing data, brochures, etc. for appliances and/or equipment to be installed - Information on dealers as needed - Contractor bids Why do I need an asbestos inspection on a commercial facility? The Asbestos Control Act requires an asbestos inspection be completed by a department-accredited asbestos inspector prior to any demolition or renovation of a commercial facility regardless of the facility's age (ref: [ARM 17.74.354](https://rules.mt.gov/gateway/RuleNo.asp?RN=17%2E74%2E354)). A building previously used as a commercial or public facility, or a structure or installation with more than four dwelling units, are also subject to asbestos regulations. To determine if the Residential Exemption applies to your property, please see the Asbestos Control Program's [Residential Exemption Guide](https://deq.mt.gov/files/Public/Asbestos/Documents/docs/Residential%20Exemption%204-29-2021.pdf?ver=2021-05-07-092649-293\u00d7tamp=1620401305886).

For other questions regarding the Asbestos Control Program please visit their [program page](https://deq.mt.gov/cleanupandrec/Programs/asbestos) or call 406-444-5300. What loan security is required? All loans financed through the AERLP are secured, and applicants must provide some form of loan security. Generally, this is a junior lien position on the real property where the project is located. In addition to the property lien, the installed alternative energy system components purchased through the program are listed as loan security. The program strives to use real estate to secure loans wherever possible. In situations where this is not possible, the financial contractor will work with borrower to agree on a security arrangement. What documentation is required for project verification? To verify eligible use of loan funds, borrowers are required to provide DEQ with photographs of all major components of the project no more than 30 days after installation. Borrowers are also required to obtain and submit copies of all applicable permits, the approved inspection record for all applicable permits and a copy of the fully executed utility interconnection agreements (if required) no more than 30 days after installation. Project verification requirements are a condition of the loan and are the responsibility of the borrower. What happens to applications when the loan fund is depleted? When the program receives more applications than funds are available, DEQ will implement a ranking process that prioritizes applications based on criteria published in the Administrative Rules of Montana ( [ARM 17.85.111 (5)](https://rules.mt.gov/gateway/RuleNo.asp?RN=17%2E85%2E111)). Ranking criteria includes: the amount of energy produced, the diversity of technology in the portfolio, the return on investment, the use of a process as a system or equipment generally available in Montana, the geographical diversity of the project portfolio, and the diversity of borrowers in the project portfolio. Will AERLP ensure the project is a good one? No, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality may not: - Act as an attorney, engineer, financial, or tax consultant. The applicant should hire any professionals or professional services needed. - Guarantee the project is a good investment. - Endorse any product, manufacturer, contractor, or component. All evaluations are made only for loan purposes. The applicant should shop for competitive bids and use professional help if necessary. - Compel a contractor or engineer to remedy defects in construction or to live up to any contracts they make with you. - Ensure that any project is safe. Can AERLP recommend installers? No; however, various organizations maintain lists of recommended or qualified installers that operate in Montana. The Montana Renewable Energy Association (MREA) maintains a list of its member installers on its [website](https://montanarenewables.org/directory/). Applicants in NorthWestern Energy's service area may wish to consult the utility's listing of approved installers through its [Renewable Energy Program](https://www.northwesternenergy.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/clean-energy/how-you-can-help/renewable-energy-qualified-installer-20211027.pdf?sfvrsn=1877d02b_18). Are AERLP projects eligible for tax credits or utility incentives? Many projects funded by AERLP are eligible for federal tax credits. For more information on these tax credits please visit: - The Energy Tax Credits & Financing Tab on the [Energy Resources Page](https://deq.mt.gov/energy/resources) - The [Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE)](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program?fromSir=0&state=MT) Please consult with a tax professional to determine your eligibility for available tax credits.
