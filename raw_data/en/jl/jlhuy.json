The report was prepared for section 46 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, in accordance with the requirements of that Act and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. It was approved by the Board on 7 September 2022 and provides a comprehensive overview of the ABC's performance and delivery in line with its Charter remit. This annual report reflects a key milestone in the ABC's history, our celebration of 90 years of serving the nation as Australia's public broadcaster. Over the course of the last year the ABC has met many significant challenges together with the communities we live and work in, not least emergency weather events and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The ABC's achievements this year reflect the commitment and professionalism of the people who work here. The ABC continues to maintain its position as the leading news provider, while programming across radio, television and digital platforms has kept all Australians informed and entertained. Our 90th year is a chance to not only celebrate but also to reaffirm our relationship with the Australian people as a trusted and cherished national institution, deserving of the investment placed in us. That investment and the returns on that investment, are comprehensively detailed in this annual report.

In celebrating the ABC's 90th anniversary we have taken pride in our achievements since our first broadcast in 1932. Australia has grown over the years and so has the ABC, shaped by our listeners and viewers. From a single radio service, the ABC has developed into a multi-platform media operation and a public broadcaster of international renown, delivering Australian stories and conversations across the nation. We have enjoyed a long and stable relationship with our audience. When the ABC was created there was a need to address a national deficit of news and current affairs. Many Australians, widely dispersed around our continent, were also starved of timely information and entertainment. Consequently, the ABC has offered concerts and educational programs from its very beginning. In fact, our first live orchestral concert by the National Broadcasting Orchestra went to air the day we were launched as part of the opening celebrations. Since those exciting early days, the ABC has become Australia's most important cultural institution. The arts of Australia, and the best from around the world, are a rich part of the ABC's offerings. Even when COVID affected live performances and recordings, the ABC connected and delighted audiences around Australia, particularly with extra Arts content on ABC iview. This year, we experienced the biggest ever turnout for the ABC Classic 100 countdown, with more than 200,000 music lovers voting for their favourite. The ABC has music for everyone - ABC Classic, ABC Country, Double J, triple j and ABC Jazz. It's always midnight somewhere on this planet, and there always will be an Australian at home or on the road listening to Australian sounds on the ABC. Research from the Australia Institute, the independent public policy think tank, consistently shows that the ABC is the most trusted source of news in the country. On the 2022 Federal election night, the ABC was the outstanding trusted choice for Australian TV viewers, attracting a 44.3% national audience share. Australians expect our news and current affairs teams to deliver quality public interest journalism and they strive to do this. Revelations by ABC reporters in the past 12 months about the cosmetic surgery industry, sexual abuse in sport, and failings in child protection and the guardianship system, resulted in widespread consternation and pressure for change. In an age of news deserts, natural disasters, misinformation and disinformation, it is critical that the ABC is always close to the action to report the facts and truth for our listeners and viewers. In the past year we have increased our representation in country areas with the appointment of 60 extra journalists, boosting the number of employees working outside our capital cities to more than 600. Local teams across Queensland and New South Wales, with our Emergency Broadcasting teams, covered devastating floods tirelessly and over an extended period in the face of massive logistical challenges. Their bravery and resilience are impressive, and I thank them for it. The ABC reflects and celebrates our diversity as a nation. Programs like Back Roads and Movin' to the Country tell stories of inspiring Australians, and not surprisingly viewers fell in love with a bunch of kelpies and their farmers on Muster Dogs . Our top dog, Bluey is not only a world-wide hit, but a celebration of Queensland houses, humour and heart. The ABC commissioned Here Out West , a feature film exploring the lives of people living in Sydney's culturally diverse Western suburbs. It opened the Sydney Film Festival in 2021 and has been critically acclaimed. Earlier this year, It has been a year of reflection and celebration, and of looking forward.

Earlier this year, Foreword from the Chair 2 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022we were pleased to bring the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras broadcast home to ABC TV and Radio, achieving #1 in its timeslot for city viewers aged under 55. We look forward to being host broadcaster of World Pride which will be held in Sydney in February next year, running concurrently with the 2023 Mardi Gras celebrations. In October 2021, the Board commissioned an Independent Review of ABC Complaints Handling Procedures, conducted by former Commonwealth and NSW Ombudsman Professor John McMillan and former SBS Director of News and Current Affairs Jim Carroll. They recommended the appointment of an Ombudsman. This role is an important one for both the ABC and its audiences. We already have the highest standards of complaints handling in place of any Australian media organisation and appointing an Ombudsman will assist us in strengthening the existing complaints handling processes that reflect the trust placed in the ABC by our audiences.Experienced media executive Fiona Cameron will become our inaugural ABC Ombudsman in September 2022. Previously a full-time Authority Member at the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), Fiona will head an expanded Editorial Complaints Unit, currently known as Audience and Consumer Affairs, and will have the power to review a complaint finding. Of course, the ABC has changed over 90 years and we will continue to reinvent ourselves and adapt to change, with technology pushing us along, as we head to our 100th anniversary. One thing will never change however and that is our purpose. We will continue to bring people together and to give our nation's many voices a platform, as we inform, educate and entertain Australians, whoever they are and wherever they live.

Capital City Radio reached an estimated 2.5 million people each week, while weekly live streams of Capital City Radio on the ABC listen app increased by 21% year-on-year to 881,000. 50% of the Australian population aged 16+ engaged with the 2022 triple j Hottest 100 . Bluey is the highest rated program in the history of ABC Kids and is the No 1 program ever on ABC iview. ABC iview was Australia's No 1 broadcaster streaming service in 2021, with a 25% share of minutes viewed across the year. 1.9 million people watched Muster Dogs on ABC TV and ABC iview. Live streaming of The Ashes on the ABC listen app saw record weekly audiences of 500,000 users in the weeks beginning 5 December and 2 January. The ABC was the No 1 broadcast TV network on 2022 Federal Election night , with a prime-time metro share of 36.4%. ABC YouTube channels averaged 10.3 million weekly views . The ABC Everyday website had 2.2 million monthly users . The ABC's 2021 New Year's Eve coverage reached 3.6 million Australians on broadcast TV. Social posts relating to the ABC's 90th birthday published up to 30 June 2022 generated 6.9 million video views and 1.5 million engagements . Q+A host Stan Grant. 13The year ahead The ABC begins a new funding period well positioned to continue to be the nation's most trusted and valued digital content provider, as we are with our broadcast services. Funding for the 2023-25 triennium, announced in February 2022 by the previous government, included the resumption of indexation and continued support for the ABC's Enhanced Newsgathering (ENG) program and audio description services. The Albanese Government, elected in May 2022, has committed to providing the Corporation with additional funding for its operational base and pledged to increase the ABC's funding period from three to five years. The Corporation welcomes this funding boost and its enhanced financial certainty. The ABC will engage with the Government in the second half of 2022 in relation to these changes and will invest additional funding in line with its strategic priorities. The Government has also committed to increased funding for the ABC's international services. The Corporation will apply the additional funding to increase the number of ABC Radio Australia transmission sites in strategically important locations across the Pacific, increase the volume of bespoke programming in priority content areas and build media capacity with partners across the Pacific. The ABC's activities in the coming year will continue to be guided by the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-25. As a \"living document\", the Five-Year Plan is updated to respond to the evolving media environment and the Corporation anticipates adding further priorities and initiatives to that Plan during the year. The ABC will continue to prioritise the delivery of personalised digital media experiences that meet the needs and expectations of contemporary audiences. The introduction of ABC iview login and unified user accounts in 2021-22 created a foundation for a seamless viewing experience and allows audiences to easily discover relevant content. In 2022-23, the Corporation will build on these foundations and core capabilities. It will embark on data-driven initiatives to encourage audiences to try new ABC products and use a wider variety of the content that the ABC offers on its digital platforms, including content relevant to their local area. It will also continue to develop the software platform and APIs that enable audiences to discover ABC content and continue to enhance privacy protections. The Corporation is strongly committed to ensuring access to public interest journalism across Australia. Throughout 2022-23, it will continue its commitment to regional, rural and remote Australians, including the additional services in regional Australia that it established as a result of commercial deals struck with Google and Facebook in 2021. The ABC will consider evidence-based adjustments to these services in 2023 in light of data collected over the first 12 months of activity. In addition, the Corporation will explore models for partnerships and collaboration with small independent outlets to support media diversity and invest in research that will assess local news needs and propose potential solutions. Consistent with the decentralisation objective of ensuring that at least 75% of content-makers work outside of its Ultimo headquarters, the Corporation announced the location of a new Parramatta office in Sydney's west in July 2022 and began planning the relocation of up to 300 employees to new site. The move is expected to be completed by 2024. In parallel, the ABC will reduce its footprint within the Ultimo building, creating a rental income opportunity to offset the operating costs of the new Parramatta facility. 14 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022To achieve its ambition of looking and sounding like contemporary Australia, the Corporation emphasises diversity and inclusion across the stories that it tells and in the composition of its workforce. During the year, it will update key plans that focus its commitments in this area, introducing a new Diversity & Inclusion Plan and refreshing the Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-22, which has been extended for one year. A review of commissioning, begun in the first half of 2022, will identify opportunities to promote quality over quantity and maximise the efficiency of the Corporation's investment in original Australian content. The review will consider the content strategies and commissioning models of leading international public service media organisations. About 3,000 of our staff completed the 2022 Employee Engagement Survey and I was very pleased with the overall engagement score of 73%. That's an increase from 71% in 2020 and it exceeds the Australian benchmark of 72%. An overwhelming 92% of respondents said they are proud to work at the ABC. The score is ten points above the external benchmark, setting the ABC ahead of many other Australian organisations. This is an excellent result.To strengthen the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the Corporation has appointed a Chief Transformation Officer to enhance implementation of the ABC's strategic priorities and continue to find efficiencies across the organisation to support investment in content. In line with its commitment to make financially and environmentally sustainable choices, the Corporation will develop a plan to significantly reduce its environmental impact by the end of the decade. Throughout the year, the Corporation will continue to work with government on future directions for broadcast services, particularly the important issue of prominence. It will likewise continue to work with other media organisations to make the case for media freedom in Australia.

With rising geo-political tensions, a climate emergency and economic uncertainty, the ABC's outstanding journalism, including domestic and international newsgathering, analysis and investigations, remains as necessary to Australia as at any time in its history. News that matters The ABC's news audience is bigger, broader and more diverse than it has ever been. Over 2021-22, the ABC remained Australia's leading source of news and public interest journalism. Audiences turned to its broadcast and digital coverage in huge numbers during major events at home and abroad, including the visa saga surrounding tennis star Novak Djokovic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the floods and extreme weather events that devastated parts of Queensland and NSW. Across the weekend of the federal election, the ABC was Australia's top news provider on both broadcast and digital platforms, while programs such as Insiders and News Breakfast achieved new milestones. Throughout 2021, COVID lockdowns and restrictions drove record levels of digital users across all ABC services, thanks to audiences having more time to spend on media and an increased appetite for news. In the first half of 2022, audiences began returning to pre-pandemic media habits. Despite this, the pandemic remained the nation's top story, and digital services retained considerable audience volumes. Online, ABC News Digital remains consistently one of the top two local news brands, after being No 1 throughout 2020 and 2021. ABC investigative journalism had significant impact and led to real-world changes benefitting all Australians. These included a review of regulations to address unsafe practices in the multi-billion-dollar cosmetic surgery industry, help for vulnerable people trapped in the guardianship system and actions within sporting bodies to prevent the sexual abuse of young people. RN provided agenda-setting daily news and current affairs through RN Breakfast and RN Drive . Host Fran Kelly announced her retirement from RN Breakfast at the end of 2021 following 17 years with the program. She was replaced by journalist Patricia Karvelas, formerly the presenter of RN Drive , which is now hosted by former 7.30 reporter Andy Park. Highlights of RN's Background Briefing investigations included a three-part audio series by Mario Christodoulou and Ben Sveen on one of the world's biggest ever data leaks. This global collaboration with the International Consortium for International Journalists and the ABC's Four Corners exposed how an Australian accountant made a fortune by keeping the secrets of the rich, powerful and criminal. ABC Factual documentaries ensured the ABC remains a trusted source for the stories behind the daily news. Big Deal explored Australia's billion-dollar political lobbying industry and investigated how the nation can safeguard its democracy from being sold to the highest bidder. With unprecedented access to the work of Nobel Prize winner Professor Peter Doherty, Cracking Covid captured the real time story of Australia's race against the pandemic. 18 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Emergency Broadcasting Local teams across Queensland and New South Wales along with the Emergency Broadcasting team worked tirelessly over an extended period to provide local coverage and national reporting on the storms and flooding in Queensland and New South Wales that began in January. Teams undertook rolling coverage to provide up-to-date information about the significant unfolding weather events for local communities, and also reported for state and national programs to keep audiences across unfolding events. Coverage was maintained over an extended period despite the logistical challenges such as major road closures and communications disruptions experienced in Lismore and the evacuation of the ABC's Brisbane office due to flooding. ABC Radio Brisbane pulled out all stops to stay on-air as torrential rain and floodwater lashed the city late in February. A weekend of emergency broadcasting came to an abrupt halt on the evening of Sunday, 27 February when the small crew of radio staff had to evacuate the ABC building in South Bank as floodwaters surrounded the area. ABC Tropical North stepped in to broadcast with rolling emergency broadcasting continuing from Mackay. Monday's Breakfast and Mornings shows came from the Sunshine and Gold Coasts as the whole of south-east Queensland grappled with the weather. With much wrangling by management, staff and the ABC's Operations and Technical team, ABC Radio Brisbane was back on air from the Gold Coast in time for Kat Feeney's Afternoons program. ABC Radio Brisbane and ABC Gold Coast crammed into the snug Mermaid Beach studio for three days, brilliantly collaborating to bring rolling coverage to all of south-east Queensland. As the floodwaters receded, ABC Property worked incredibly hard to get ABC South Bank back online as ABC Radio Brisbane staff took to the field to cover the clean up. By Thursday morning, the team was back in South Bank, keeping the city and state informed as the Mud Army 2.0 rolled out into the suburbs to get Brisbane back on its feet. Stay Connected, the ABC's emergency broadcasting awareness campaign, ran over summer, with content featured on ABC and third-party platforms, as well as billboards. The campaign raised awareness of how to tune into local ABC Emergency information on AM and FM frequencies. In September, the ABC released After the Disaster , a podcast aimed at helping audiences cope with life after an emergency. A partnership with the Red Cross and the University of Melbourne, the podcast was hosted by Kate Brady, the National Recovery Adviser for the Australian Red Cross. It adds to the suite of resources available on the ABC Emergency website that help Australians prepare for and recover from emergencies.Nick Parmeter reports on the floods from NSW's Mid North Coast. 19Regional Public Interest Journalism Investment In March 2021, the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code became law, opening the way for the ABC to enter commercial agreements with Google and Facebook. From the outset, the ABC committed to investing any net revenues raised through the agreements with the digital platforms in regional and rural public interest journalism. Recruitment for new journalist roles began shortly after the agreements were signed in late 2021. The new reporter roles were put into areas that were known to be underserved by the media or in news deserts - where the ABC believed they were most needed and would have the most impact. By March 2022, the ABC had placed 60 additional journalists into regional locations. This boosted the number of ABC employees working outside capital cities to more than 600. The ABC increased the number of journalists working out of its major bureaux and Toowoomba, facilitating greater coverage of the issues facing smaller and remote communities in these regions. Five mini-bureaux, supporting two journalists each, were opened in new locations at Batemans Bay, Carnarvon, Hervey Bay, Charleville and Warragul. An additional five new locations were chosen for individual reporter placements in Gladstone, Whyalla, Northam, Swan Hill and Victor Harbor. Following the roll-out of the investment in Regional Public Interest Journalism, the ABC now has journalists working in 58 regional locations across Australia. The world at home The ABC has continued to tell compelling stories about people and events overseas that are relevant to Australians and enhance our understanding of the world. Since January 2022, reporters and camera operators from the London bureau have been on the ground in Ukraine covering the Russian invasion, with additional teams flying in from Australia, the US and the Middle East. The ABC's coverage of the conflict has been world-class and ground-breaking, keeping the audience engaged and informed over the months with innovative angles and approaches, but always telling stories with humanity at their heart. The Pacific has also been an important focus, with major stories including the impact of COVID and border closures in countries reliant on tourism, demands for more action on climate change, rioting in the Solomon Islands and China's growing influence. The ABC has worked with local journalists in Pacific countries to amplify the stories of the region for audiences at home and abroad. Given the Chinese government has not so far granted visas to return ABC reporters to Beijing, a newly established bureau in Taiwan will ensure the continuation of comprehensive news and analysis of China and the region. 20 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022A commitment to local communities and the stories that matter most to them is a central part of the ABC's 90-year relationship with Australian audiences across the continent. Local communities, local friendships As Australia opened up from pandemic restrictions in 2022, local teams were able to reconnect directly with communities through outside broadcasts and local events. Teams celebrated festivals and events around Australia, from the Birdsville races to the Mundi Mundi Bash music festival. The 'Your Stories' series of outside broadcasts connected teams with their local suburbs. ABC Melbourne Mornings broadcast in Kalorama to support the Dandenong Ranges community recovering from a devastating storm which destroyed 76 homes in the area. Strong audience figures for Local Radio in 2021 reflected the important role played by the local network during the pandemic, providing timely local news and information for audiences and a space for listeners to share their experiences and connect with others during a time of stress. Commitment to local and regional Australia ABC Sydney Afternoons host Josh Szeps. 21Capital City Radio reached an estimated 2.5 million people each week and weekly live streams of Capital City Radio on the ABC listen app increased by 21% year-on-year to 881,000. ABC Capital City Facebook followers also grew by 147% to four million. The ABC set up a newsroom in Hobart's Moonah Arts Centre in September, creating a shared space for ABC News and Local Radio to tell more stories from the city's northern suburbs. Teams reported from the Glenorchy council area over a four-week period, including a pop-up radio station from the main street in Moonah. In March, ABC Radio Melbourne launched a Radio-in-Residency at a pop-up studio at Deakin University's Waterfront Gallery in Geelong. The collaboration with the City of Greater Geelong and Deakin University saw ABC Melbourne presenters broadcast from the studio residency throughout the month, covering local stories and issues. The Remote Communities project enables content makers to spend time in communities building more meaningful relationships, helping them to draw out stories and share perspectives that might not otherwise be told. While COVID restrictions affected travel in 2021, 19 trips were commissioned in 2022, the first to Heron Island in Queensland. The initiative was renamed The Embedded Reporting Project in 2022 and broadened to provide more opportunities for journalists to spend time with communities across more locations. On October 26, Perth woke to the sad news that the ABC's popular Breakfast host, Russell Woolf, aged 56, had died in his sleep. The announcement was followed by an outpouring of support from listeners and the wider Perth community for Russell's family, friends and ABC colleagues. Russell's former Breakfast co-host Nadia Mitsopoulos presented a tribute show the following day with messages coming from a wide range of community leaders, including the WA Premier Mark McGowan and WA Governor Kim Beazley. In 2021, the ABC brought all its charity and fundraising events together under one name - ABC Gives. For the first time, its end-of-year charity fundraisers ran under the ABC Gives banner in all states and territories. The ABC partnered with trusted local and national charities, raising $1.7 million to support Australians in need. The end-of-year fundraising is part of many activities that local teams undertake throughout the year to help their communities, such as ABC Radio Perth's Brekky Book Bank appeal which resulted in more than 7,000 books being donated in September for local schoolchildren. The annual ABC Radio Brisbane Community Spirit Awards took place in November, acknowledging the compassion and kindness of individuals and organisations who are making a real difference. Around 100 invited guests joined ABC staff in the presence of Queensland Governor, Dr Jeannette Young, to celebrate the efforts of individuals and teams across different categories. Local news when it counts Community engagement has become an integral part of building relationships with ABC audiences, uncovering new stories and growing its reach, awareness and understanding. Newsrooms have conducted numerous in-person and virtual roundtable events, workshops and dinners to engage in deeper conversation with everyday Australians. The Brisbane newsroom's October 2021 networking dinner with the Pacific Islander community forged connections that proved invaluable for the ABC's coverage of the Tonga volcanic eruption in January 2022. In early 2022, the Anxiety Project - a special ABC News series examining the rising prevalence of anxiety in Australia - organised an audience callout and round table events with young people from a range of backgrounds. 22 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022The ABC's community engagement underpins a better understanding of a diverse range of views, including those of the Indian-Australian community in Melbourne's western suburbs, first-time voters, women in economics and people living with a disability. Participants in forums are also invited to join the ABC's national talent database, providing a broader range of backgrounds and experiences from which to draw in all forms of coverage. ABC News established pop-up newsrooms and embedded reporters in outer suburban areas where they made new contacts and unearthed more stories that matter to those communities. News' work with educational institutions - including running skills workshops and work experience with Chifley College in Sydney's Mt Druitt and Warrawong High School in Port Kembla - continued to foster a diverse talent pipeline into the ABC. Partnerships have been formed with Macquarie University, Victoria University and Charles Darwin University, with discussions underway with four more tertiary institutions. Sadly missed ABC Perth Breakfast host Russell Woolf, who died in 2021. At the community media level, partnerships were forged with Indigenous Community TV, Koori Mail, FNMA, Ngaarda Media, Pasifika TV & Radio and 2ME Arabic Radio as well as culturally and socially diverse groups such as First Languages Australia, the Asian-Australian Leadership Summit and Siren Sport. Indigenous Radio A unique podcast, Word Up reflects the community-driven language maintenance and revival underway in regional and remote communities in UNESCO's Decade of the World's Indigenous Languages. Word Up extended its reach into diverse language revival communities across Australia including the critically endangered Kaiadilt/Kayadild (Bentinck Island, Gulf of Carpentaria) and the Rrembarngga (central west Arnhem Land) languages. The Indigenous Radio team's Speaking Out and Awaye! consistently delivered distinctive Indigenous content addressing issues such as structural racism, out-of-home care, cultural heritage protection and the repatriation of cultural property. Awaye! turned its coverage to COVID-19 hotspots such as Dubbo and Wilcannia as the virus spread rapidly into those communities. In the lead-up to the 2022 federal election, Speaking Out exclusively featured then-Minister for Indigenous Affairs Ken Wyatt, his Labor counterpart Linda Burney and Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe. As floodwaters continued to rise, Awaye! covered the emergency in far northern New South Wales. Speaking Out 's Larissa Behrendt and Awaye! 's Rudi Bremer presented live at the Sydney Opera House for All About Women, a festival held in conjunction with International Women's Day. Awaye! and Speaking Out are now replayed on Koori Radio, Sydney's local Indigenous community broadcaster. 23As Australia emerged from COVID-19 lockdowns, the ABC rallied national spirits with its arts programming. Audiences celebrated their favourite music with the biggest ever turnout for the ABC Classic 100 Countdown in June 2022, themed around Music for the Screen. More than 200,000 music lovers voted, with John Williams' classic score for Star Wars topping the list. Over on triple j history was also made when beloved Australian children's band The Wiggles, with their joyful Like a Version cover of Tame Impala's psych-rock track Elephant became an internet sensation and went on to win the Hottest 100 song in January 2022 in a landslide. The Hottest 100 reached 50% of Australians aged 16+, an estimated 9.5 million people, with an estimated audience of 3.6 million listening live to the countdown on January 22, 2022. As lockdowns eased around the country, ABC Classic & ABC Jazz embraced the chance to go live, recording over 20 concerts per month in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. This included live to air Myer Music Bowl concerts and three live nights with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, bringing artists and their music back to our national audiences. In April 2021 the Double J team went to the Byron Bay Bluesfest, where they recorded live sets and broadcast highlights from one of the first music festivals to re-emerge post-Covid. In November 2021, triple j's Blak Out program hosted the National Indigenous Music Awards live on air when the Darwin event was cancelled due to Covid. An artistic highlight was the 2021 Boyer Lectures delivered by actor and theatre director John Bell. Over four luminous lectures on Shakespeare: Soul of the Age , Bell reminded us of Shakespeare's relevance to modern life with his insights into gender, power and the role of imagination in shaping a better world. On screen, the ABC's weekly arts program Art Works with Namila Benson was back for its second series. In the playful series Tiny Oz , comedian Jimmy Rees and artist JoAnne Bouzianis-Sellick united with some extraordinary craftspeople to re-create moments from our nation's history in glorious miniature. Space 22 saw recording artist Natalie Bassingthwaite bring together seven troubled strangers to see whether art really could change lives. In The Exhibitionists , four talented women discovered that only 25 per cent of art in the Australian collection of the National Gallery was by women. Raiding the vaults, they uncovered forgotten works of art and told scandalous tales of sexism. Actor Claudia Karvan took us on a journey in Books that Made Us , celebrating our love of books and meeting some of our greatest writers, including Charlotte Wood, Helen Garner and Christos Tsiolkas. Australian writing was also on the agenda for ABC Radio National's second annual Big Weekend of Books in August 2021 featuring top local and international writers from Alice Pung and Craig Silvey to Lisa Taddeo and Andrew O'Hagan, plus workshops to inspire and coach budding authors.

Andy Bessie Holland, Bridie Carter, Mandy McElhinney and Veronica Milsom in The Exhibitionists . 25Connecting communities ABC listen has improved opportunities for audiences to discover their local news and programs through the implementation of station pages for all of capital city and regional radio stations. Story Stream was introduced in May 2022, providing continuous Australian stories, reflecting diverse lived experience across states and territories with a focus on regional and rural voices; skippable, on-demand and updated each weekday. ABC listen also hosted a dedicated pop-up station for local Anzac Day services on 25 April 2022 throughout Australia, as well as the Dawn Services from Gallipoli and Villers-Bretonneux. ABC iview saw the addition of the Your Australia category which includes 'Stories From' and 'News From' collections, allowing audiences to access content from and about a chosen region. In 2022, the Takeover program took place outside of the city for the first time. Designed to give young people a voice to tell their stories from their communities, Shepparton in northern Victoria hosted the event in May. The Takeover team worked with local schools and organisations to support more than 1,000 teenagers to share the issues important to them, speaking at local events and on ABC platforms. triple j also teamed up with the ABC's Shepparton Takeover, taking the stories and culture of this young, multicultural regional hub to a national audience.

ABC R&L trainee Gladys Serugga, pictured at ABC Gippsland before moving to Adelaide to work on Behind the News . 26 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Takeover Shepparton is the latest initiative to build on the successful Heywire model, which has been empowering young people to share their stories and develop ideas to improve their communities for 24 years. Heywire's Takeover Melbourne took place for the second time in 2021, extending the Heywire model to give a platform and voice to young people in Australia's capital cities. The 32 winners of the Melbourne competition had their stories featured across the ABC from November 2021, culminating in a gala screening in Melbourne's Federation Square, in March. In June, the Heywire Trailblazers Summit took place in Canberra, giving 15 young regional leaders the chance to be heard on the ABC, present at Parliament House and access dedicated grants. The Trailblazers tackled issues ranging from pathways for women in aviation, awareness of invisible illnesses and outback robotics. The ABC continues to nurture music at the grassroots level in a wide range of genres. ABC Country produces the iconic Saturday Night Country with singer-songwriter Beccy Cole each week, celebrating the stories and music from country artists from across the country. Saturday Night Country is also broadcast on regional and local radio around the country. triple j Unearthed partners with music festivals around the country to uncover the best local artists in those communities and give them the opportunity to open the festival main stage. The ABC's Music and Creative Development team has provided valuable support to the live music industry as it commenced its recovery from COVID lockdowns in 2021-22. The Double J team was at the twice-cancelled Bluesfest in Byron Bay in April, one of the first festivals to run in the country post-COVID. The team recorded live sets and broadcast highlights from the event across the Easter long weekend for national audiences on Double J and ABC Radio. triple j increased partnerships and tour promotions to spread the word about festivals and gigs. Its 'Get Vaccinated' campaign encouraged people to get back to gigs, while the music industry's pressing needs for assistance to recover from COVID-19 challenges were explored on Hack and the Double J and ABC News co-production The Gig Economy . triple j's Australian music program was deliberately raised in 2022 to an earlier timeslot and the launch of a new Unearthed website, enhanced local artists' visibility for a national audience. triple j also increased awareness of First Nations music with the creation of Blak Out . This important First Nations music program hosted the 2021 National Indigenous Music Awards live to air when the event was unable to go ahead due to COVID lockdowns in Darwin. ABC Classic and ABC Jazz forged ahead with an ambitious commissioning strategy to support composers and performers, with in-studio recordings and live performances. ABC Classic commissioned acclaimed singer- songwriter Katie Noonan to compose a new work for the ABC's 2021 Classic Choir. In 2022, ABC Classic dedicated its Friday Lunchtime Concert program to contemporary Australian artists and moved its new releases program earlier in day to showcase this content for a larger audience. In 2022, as lockdowns eased around the country, ABC Classic and ABC Jazz recorded more than 20 concerts each month in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. In advance of the broadcast of Fires , the six- part fictionalised account of the Black Summer bushfires, the scripted team engaged with various external stakeholders and colleagues from Regional & Local, News and the Emergency Broadcasting team to ensure support services were in place for audiences as well as practical information about preparing for extreme weather events. The ABC and Screenwest partnered in a Factual Formats initiative to develop and commission a returnable series for Tuesday at 8pm primetime and ABC iview from a Western Australia producer. Three successful formats were selected to go into development, with at least one going into production later in 2022. 27For 90 years, Australians have turned to the ABC for the best Australian storytelling on our screens. Comedy, drama, children's TV, documentary and special events all have a home at the ABC. The ABC's vibrant storytelling over the year reflected Australians' diverse enjoyments and interests and broadened our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Australian stories on Australian screens The six-part miniseries Fires was inspired by the experiences of people and communities impacted by the devastating Australian bushfires over the summer of 2019-20. With storylines traversing regional Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, Fires saw key growth in regional markets and received glowing Quality & Distinctiveness survey scores of over 90% for quality and diversity. Highlighting stories of hope, survival, community spirit and resilience, Fires won the AACTA and Logie awards for most outstanding miniseries alongside key performance awards. The same bushfires were at the heart of moving long-form observational documentary, People's Republic Of Mallacoota , which followed the traumatised survivors of a bushfire-ravaged coastal community trying to save their town from dying. Continuing the story of outback politician Alex Irving, played by Deborah Mailman, the second season of drama series Total Control returned audiences to Parliament House and the gripping story of an Indigenous woman battling sexism and racism in the corridors of power.

Production support during COVID The ABC supported productions during all stages of the pandemic to help minimise the impact to the production sector and ensure the continued delivery of high-quality content for Australian audiences. ABC teams developed COVID-safe production protocols at each stage of the pandemic that were in line with the local state regulations and guided by a cautious ABC directive, thereby ensuring the highest level of safety. The ABC provided practical support where COVID-19 affected any stage of a production by offering editorial workarounds, advice and remote working scenarios. The ABC supported any production suffering a delayed delivery and assisted with financial workarounds or additional funds where the pandemic impacted production budgets. The ABC contributed more than $2 million to productions to cover additional costs incurred due to COVID in the 2021-22 financial year, bringing its total contribution to COVID costs during the pandemic to $6.5 million. 30 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Local community contacts developed by the Parramatta team ensured a diversity of voices were heard. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic in many ways continued to dominate the lives of Australians and their communities in 2021 and into 2022. As every state and territory wrestled with cases, vaccinations and restrictions, audiences again came to the ABC in huge numbers for clear, accurate information. RN's specialist program The Health Report , along with the daily podcast Coronacast , delivered the latest information to audiences about new variants, vaccines, public health advice and research. During the almost four-month lockdown in Sydney from late June 2021, the NSW team established a dual-crew system to cover the story from Western Sydney, at the centre of the harshest restrictions, while maintaining strict safety protocols. Local community contacts developed by the Parramatta team ensured a diversity of voices were heard. When Melbourne entered its sixth lockdown in early August, coverage ranged from the personal stories of essential workers to the violent protests that erupted in September. State Political Reporter Bridget Rollason won a Quill Award for breaking the news of the Victorian Government's decision to shut down construction sites. Both NSW and Victorian News teams won praise for a series of in-language social videos delivering health messages and addressing misinformation among CALD communities. 7.30 host Sarah Ferguson. 31Mystery Road Origin: COVID case study The continuation of crime series Mystery Road began pre-production when the eastern states were going back into lockdown during the Delta COVID outbreak of July 2021. The series was shot entirely in WA while the state government's strict closed border policy was in place, adding an extra degree of difficulty to the production process. Due to the border closures, 80% of the crew on the series was from within the state. This provided welcome opportunities for the WA production industry at a time when no other scripted series was filming. Moving some cast and heads of department across the border into WA was problematic, and a portion of the ABC's COVID contribution to the production budget paid for their expenses in their transit state. It also covered the added costs of keeping the cast within the state throughout production rather than the standard practice of flying them in and out. Mystery Road received COVID funding from the ABC, Screen Australia and Screen West. Without this support the series would have been delayed and the WA production industry would have gone into indefinite hiatus. On location in Western Australia filming Mystery Road: Origin . 32 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Stories that boost the economy The ABC-commissioned Deloitte Access Economics report, published in December 2021, quantified for the first time just how important the ABC's commissioned content is to the viability of the Australian production industry and workforce. The report covered screen content produced internally by the ABC and commissioned in partnership with the independent sector and included the genres of arts, children's, documentaries, drama, comedy, Indigenous and entertainment. From 2017-18 to 2019-20, the ABC commissioned 433 screen productions that delivered more than 2,500 hours of Australian content to viewers. Those productions contributed $744 million in total to the Australian economy and supported more than 8,300 full-time equivalent roles across multiple sectors, building the capability, capacity and depth of the local screen production industry. The report also found those screen productions played a crucial role in supporting economic activity across the country, with every dollar spent by the ABC on external commissions generating $1.11 from other funders. Educating Aussie kids In 2021-22, ABC TV Education increased its broadcast hours and ABC iview content offering in line with the home-schooling needs of our audience. ABC Kids Early Education currently offers more than 500 engaging, curriculum aligned resources including curated programs from ABC Kids and ABC Kids listen, along with a variety of bespoke educator web notes for screen-free follow-up in early education and care settings around the country. The team works in conjunction with the ABC Kids program makers to embed critical research and updated advice into all ABC Kids in-house content such as Play School , with over 150 curriculum aligned videos published on the site. In 2021, Early Education has continued to build targeted partnerships in the early education sector with more than 25 organisations including Playgroup NSW, Playgroup WA, the NSW Department of Communities and Justice, Community Connections Solutions Australia, Community Early Learning Australia, Early Childhood Australia, the Alannah & Madeline Foundation, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, the University of Wollongong - Early Start Discovery Space and Raising Children Network. ABC Children's Administrative assistant, wheelchair tennis champion Ben Weekes, competed in the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics. Ben's competitive world trip in 2021 increased his world ranking from 42 to 33. \"I am very proud of this achievement and thank you again for all the support that you and the ABC give me to allow me to achieve these things,\" Ben said. 33News and investigations with impact Brave public interest journalism that serves the community is at the core of the ABC's News, Analysis & Investigations division. Its work results in real change around the country, every week. In 2021, a Four Corners joint investigation with The Age and Sydney Morning Herald exposed alarming practices in the multibillion-dollar cosmetic surgery industry and shone a light on a regulatory system that was failing to protect patients. 'Cosmetic Cowboys' led to a wide-ranging review into the cosmetic industry. Also in 2021, ABC News went to the Supreme Court in two states to fight for the right to tell the stories of vulnerable people who had been trapped in the guardianship system. Reporting led by Anne Connolly revealed the stories of people who had been stripped of their assets and prevented from talking by gag laws. People trusted ABC journalists to tell their stories. ABC Sport's Russell Jackson told harrowing accounts of the alleged sex abuse of young people in cricket and AFL, leading to the launch of civil actions and changes in the sporting bodies. In the Hobart newsroom, an investigation into child protection failures and a callout to the community led to 700 people nationwide submitting their experiences. As a result, children have been removed from unsafe environments and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus has promised to investigate what he described as 'horrific' findings. Across the 2021-22 year, ABC teams and journalists won numerous major reporting awards, including Journalist of the Year in Tasmania and South Australia, the Gold Award at the SA Press Club Awards and Walkley Young Journalist of the Year. Among other awards, disability affairs reporter Nas Campanella was named Disability Confident Changemaker of the Year, and sports reporter Tracey Holmes won a string of prizes for journalistic, visual and technical excellence in online news plus two major international awards including the International Olympic Committee's Women and Sports Award for Oceania, recognising her contribution to women's sport and mentorship of the next generation of women sports' journalists. One of the most-awarded pieces of journalism in Australia during the year was by Gabriella Marchant in the Adelaide newsroom, whose moving and compelling reporting on a terminally ill teenager, 'Rhys's Final Wish', opened an important discussion about voluntary assisted dying. 34 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022The ABC was the top destination for Australians during the South Australian election in March 2022 and the 2022 federal election. During the six-week federal campaign in April and May, teams from across all content areas combined to deliver daily news and analysis, with a strong focus on live and on demand across all platforms. Outside broadcasts enabled voters from around Australia to share their perspectives. Innovative projects included State of the Suburbs , which drove engagement with diverse communities; Politics Explained , an Instagram- first series of video explainers targeting first-time voters and women; and The Hidden Campaign , which monitored how voters were targeted on social media. More than 1.5 million people completed the civic engagement tool Vote Compass.

Outside broadcasts with candidates took place across the country. ABC Darwin held its Politics in the Pub in the seat of Solomon, which was also livestreamed on Facebook, while the Victorian Country Hour broadcast from an orchard in the Goulburn Valley, examining water politics in the marginal electorate of Nicholls. Innovation Lab's First-Time Voters project supported content teams to create digital content for young people and new migrants voting in Australia for the first time in the 2022 federal election. The series comprised social video explainers created for Instagram to engage first-time voters and help build their understanding of how politics and the voting system work, where different parties stood on key policies and issues, and what they needed to know throughout the campaign. The videos were also translated into Mandarin for ABC Chinese audiences on YouTube and Facebook and were repurposed into on-platform digital explainers to capture search audiences. triple j's Hack covered the federal election for a younger audience, ensuring their voice and key concerns were heard by politicians. The Hack team travelled to regional centres across the country, covering the issues that mattered and providing first time voters with the information they needed to make their vote count, with content created across platforms to reach young people wherever they were. The ABC launched a new Election '22 tab within the ABC NEWS app in April 2022. Designed to cut through the competitive digital political news environment, the new tab delivered independent news and analysis through a range of features engineered to support long-term, post-election audience loyalty and growth. The tab put political news and information at the fingertips of ABC NEWS app users following either heavy or lighter political news coverage. The tab recorded more than half a million first-time (unique) views in the four weeks leading up to federal election night on 21 May. On polling day, the ABC was the No 1 broadcast television network with a combined reach of 5.3 million viewers and posted very strong numbers on streaming services ABC iview and ABC listen.

Investing in the skills and technology to connect with audiences in the way they prefer will build an ABC able to connect with every Australian. The digital audience experience of the future is now The ABC continues to improve the experience of audiences using mobile devices and on-demand platforms. Work continues to evolve the ABC's core set of digital products to optimise budget and grow reach, as well as expand personalisation to increase relevance and engagement. The ABC continues to embrace emerging technologies such as interactive voice assistants where news services have been expanded on Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. ABC iview and Login to Watch updates ABC iview was the No 1 Australian BVOD service in 20211. With the addition of login to watch personalisation features it has transformed from a catch-up service to a standalone destination for on-demand content. The volume of content available on ABC iview also increased from around 3,000 hours to more than 4,500 hours in the past year, due in part to our efforts to expand digital rights and increase the lifespan of licenced content. Following the introduction of Login to Watch ABC accounts in March 2022, mandatory logins were rolled out across ABC iview platforms over an eight-week period. Research by the ABC in June 2022 showed weekly active logged-in audiences grew from 60,000 to 1.4 million in the previous 12-month period. It also revealed that people who have logged in spend double the amount of time on the platform compared to anonymous users and engage more often to watch programs. Personalising your experience The ABC Personalised Audience Experience (PAX) program has focused on building tools and capabilities to bring the ABC's personalisation vision to life. In addition to implementing and driving uptake of Login to Watch across digital platforms, the program focuses on enabling audiences to discover relevant content more easily. This has resulted in the delivery of new personalisation features on ABC iview including program recommendations, watchlists, and the ability for users to pick up a show where they left off across multiple devices. Engines designed to serve different content to different audiences have also linked newsletter subscriptions with account information. The PAX program has led to greater privacy settings for audiences across all ABC iview platforms. This includes giving people more control over their personal data by requiring consent to use browser tracking cookies, as well as improved and more visible privacy notices. 1 Source: [1]OzTAM VPM, Total BVOD co-viewing minutes from Jan-2021.Evolving the digital experience 36 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022ABC listen app ABC listen was the No 1 Australian Radio App in 2021 (source: ABC Audio Survey 2021).

Community outreach has been integral in helping ABC journalists better understand the needs, issues and concerns of different sectors of the Australian community. The lead-up to the federal election saw reporters seeking the opinions and insight of people living with disability as well as those from ethnically, socio-economically and geographically diverse backgrounds. This helped inform story commissioning and ensured the right questions were being asked on behalf of all Australians. The 50:50 Equality project continued to support News in maintaining balanced gender representation in stories and telling more stories prioritising women's experiences and perspectives through tracking talent, content analysis, innovative storytelling projects and experimenting with distribution channels. In March 2022 ABC News again published its female representation figures alongside other global organisations in the BBC's 50:50 Impact Report. Publishing the results demonstrates progress, encourages transparency and invites public discussion about the importance of this initiative. The project expanded its focus to include other under-represented groups: people with a disability and culturally diverse and Indigenous Australians. This is also being achieved through tracking, content analysis and supporting community engagement. News commissioned 55 people with disabilities to tell stories through the annual International Day of People with Disability campaign and our Inclusive Commissioning project. This work also saw more than 150 people with a disability added to the centralised diverse contact database in Zendesk. 4190 years of child's play For 90 years our globally recognised, culturally distinctive programs have formed part of the Australian childhood.

Bluey makers Ludo Studio worked extensively with Deaf Connect Queensland, interpreters and children from the deaf community in the creation of the character. The designers and animators worked with Auslan interpreters to help get the correct hand shapes and signs to make the episode as accurate as possible. Because the characters have only four fingers it was difficult for some of the signs to be completely accurate. The ABC consulted with Deaf Connect and the deaf community to create a range of complimentary content, including an Auslan version of the episode which both the deaf community, and all Bluey fans, can enjoy. The Auslan version was made available on ABC iview, enabling families to take their time with the episode learning and discussing the Auslan signs and follow-up \"instruction\" clips were posted on the ABC Kids Community Facebook page and ABC Kids YouTube.

In this context, the reach of the ABC's broadcast TV offering softened in 2021-22 compared to 2020-21. This is consistent with declining viewing of broadcast TV more broadly. Metropolitan The total ABC Network metropolitan average weekly reach in 2021-22 was 7.4 million people, or 41.6% of the five city metropolitan population. This was down compared to 2020-21 (7.9 million; 44.6%). 43 Total ABC Network metropolitan TV share during daytime softened in 2021-22. Across the four channels, ABC TV achieved a metro daytime total TV share of 20.0%, below 20.8% in 2020-21. 44 Total ABC Network metropolitan share during prime time also decreased in 2021-22 compared with the previous year. Prime time total TV share for the ABC Network across the five metropolitan cities was 13.7% in 2021-22 (14.8% in 2020-21). 45 Regional In the combined aggregated regional markets, including Tasmania, total ABC average weekly reach in 2021-22 was 3.3 million people or 44.3% of the regional population. This was down compared to 2020-21 (3.4 million; 46.7%). 46 In 2021-22, total ABC regional TV share during the day increased to 20.0%, (19.5% in 2020-21). Total ABC regional share during prime time was 14.3% in 2021-22, a decrease from 15.0% in 2020-21. 47ABC ABC iview achieved further growth in 2021-22, up 17% to an average of 2.6 million weekly unique users. 48 Time spent viewing also increased by 3 minutes to 1 hour 35 minutes per week. ABC iview was the top broadcaster video on demand (BVOD) service in Australia in 2021-22, achieving a 24.9% share of total BVOD minutes viewed, up from 24.3% in 2020-21. 49 The number of Australian households with connected TVs surged during the pandemic; they were estimated to be in 66% of households by end of 2021. 50 This aligns with a growth in ABC iview viewing via this technology - smart TVs accounted for 72% of consumption in 2021-22, up from 59% in 2020-21 51 - and contributed to strong growth in live streaming of ABC channels via ABC iview. Live-streamed minutes increased by 55% in 2021-22 on 2020-21, with a record set in August 2021 driven by COVID-19 lockdowns in some parts of Australia. Video-on-demand viewing on ABC iview also grew in 2021-22, with minutes increasing 42% on 2020-2021. 52 All program genres experienced growth in minutes viewed in 2021-22 compared to 2020-21. The most dominant across 2021-22 were ABC KIDS, drama and news and current affairs, with 75% of minutes coming from these three genres. Non-children's program highlights for ABC iview across 2021-22 included Muster Dogs, Annika Series 1, Innocent Series 2 and The Newsreader . Top children's programming included Bluey , various Julia Donaldson animations, Peppa Pig and The Wiggles series.53 43 OzTAM Consolidated 28 Data 2020-21, 2021-22 (Total ABC includes ABC TV, ABC Kids/TV Plus, ABC ME & ABC News); 24hr reach based on 5-minute consecutive viewing 44 OzTAM Consolidated 28 Data 2020-21, 2021-22 45 OzTAM Consolidated 28 Data 2020-21, 2021-2246 Regional TAM Consolidated 28 Data 2020-21, 2021-22; 24hr reach based on 5-minute consecutive viewing (including spill)47 Regional TAM Consolidated 28 Data 2020-21, 2021-22 (including spill)48 Google Analytics, ABC iview web, apps, connected TVs and KIDS iview and ABC ME, 5 July 2021 - 3 July 2022 vs 29 June 2020 - 4 July 2021.49 OzTAM VPM, Total Co-viewing minutes are included 2021.50 Digital Consumer Study 2022.51 OzTAM 2022.

Regularly top performing RN titles included RN Breakfast , Late Night Live , All In The Mind , The Health Report and Life Matters , all of which were among the most popular ABC podcasts in 2021-22, with greater numbers of downloads compared to 2020-21. Big Ideas was also a top 10 series, with a slightly softer audience compared to last year, down 6%. Conversations with Richard Fidler and Sarah Kanowski by ABC Audio Studios remained the most downloaded ABC podcast in 2021-22 despite recording 8% fewer downloads compared to 2020-21. ABC Audio Studios podcasts recorded a monthly average of 7 million downloads in 2021-22, slightly less than in 2020-21. The softening was due to fewer downloads in the second half of 2021, although activity increased in 2022 with June recording the highest ever monthly downloads for the network at more than 9 million. 54 ABC Podsights, Global downloads, incl. downloads to all MP3 files, July 2020-June 2021 and July 2021-June 2022. 64 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022International The ABC has been broadcasting to audiences overseas since 1939.

A positive, inclusive and diverse workplace culture is built on strong values, which inform decision-making and ways of working at every level. All ABC staff are expected to model the ABC's values of integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation, and to align their conduct with the ABC Principles. The ABC Principles set clear expectations about working at the ABC as individuals, as leaders, and together. The ABC Principles are: We are ABC Straight talking People focused Accountable Open and transparent. In March 2022, the ABC reviewed its Code of Conduct to confirm it remains fit for purpose. The Code consolidates all the expectations and standards of workplace behaviour and conduct at the ABC into one document and is underpinned by key policies and guidelines which provide further guidance. The Code was communicated to all staff to reinforce expectations and standards of workplace behaviour. Over the last year, the ABC has operated in an environment with heightened risk due to rising COVID-19 cases and staff witnessing the impact of this and other disasters on their communities. In response, the ABC has expanded its suite of resources and training to support workforce resilience and reinforce desired behaviour. A clear roadmap to recovery, underpinned by a commitment to workplace flexibility through hybrid working, has guided these developments, reinforcing new managerial and team-building skills to support resilience and performance. These, together with regular, effective communication and visible leadership modelled on the Code of Conduct, has ensured the desired culture is nurtured within the organisation. Employee engagement The Employee Engagement Survey gave all staff the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience at work. The ABC achieved an engagement score of 73%, which is an increase of two percentage points from 71% in 2020-21. The score was slightly higher than the Australian benchmark of 72%. Based on the Employee Engagement Survey responses, the ABC implemented several streams of work to improve employees' experience of working at the ABC. This work included enhancing learning and career development opportunities by launching the Learning Hub, a one-stop-shop that brings together all available training in the ABC's learning management system (People Hub) and other resources across different ABC sites and platforms. The ABC also continued to expand virtual learning sessions, as well as adding more than 40 additional courses to People Hub, including an Emerging Leaders Program that provides a new career development opportunity for aspiring future leaders. People Hub now offers more than 330 courses from which staff can choose. In addition, in response to the engagement survey feedback, the ABC updated its Working From Home Guidelines to support flexible work practices and the introduction of hybrid working arrangements in the post-pandemic era. The ABC also provided staff with more opportunities to hear from and talk to senior leaders. These included Managing Director David Anderson's Town Hall series, which were held in each State, and Gender Forums, which were held with female and male leaders. These forums sought to identify actions the ABC can take to help everyone, and particularly women, thrive and succeed at the ABC. 71The ABC reaffirmed its commitment to diversity and inclusion by launching Diversity and Inclusion Commissioning Guidelines for Screen Content, as well as issuing new manager resources and training to help build an inclusive and culturally safe work environment, launching a Diversity Advocates Network, and working to increase the representation of diverse staff at the ABC. Change management and employee engagement In November 2021, the ABC ran a 'Where and How You Work' survey to understand the experiences of staff during the second year of the pandemic, including whether they mostly performed their work from home or on-site and their preferences for the future. Seventy-four per cent of respondents indicated a preference for a hybrid model involving a mix of time worked on-site and from home. Insights from this survey, aided by best practice and benchmarking from other organisations, guided the review of the ABC's Working From Home Guidelines and an effective approach to the introduction of hybrid working. The ABC engaged with employee network groups and divisional leadership teams to develop an extensive change plan and develop the skills needed by staff and leaders to function successfully under a hybrid work arrangement. During the remainder of 2022, the ABC will test and track the performance of hybrid working and reset where necessary. The ABC continued to prioritise activity that builds leader and employee capability in workplace flexibility. An online learning module targeting managers was released in June 2022 to support the practical application of the changes to the Working From Home Guidelines. In mid-2022, the ABC began a series of workshops to support the transition to hybrid work. These focused on adapting to the workplace of the future, productive leadership in a hybrid workplace and building a connected culture. 72 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Capability, development and training Learning and development continued to play a critical role in building the capabilities of ABC people to bring the ABC Principles to life and deliver on the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-2025 . The smooth transition from face-to-face to virtual delivery achieved during the previous year allowed learning and development to continue across 2021-22, providing timely, relevant and effective development for staff regardless of their working location or circumstances. In total, 2021-22 saw 50,775 learning completions recorded, which is consistent with the number recorded in the previous year. The bulk of this learning (81%) was completed via e-learning. Virtual learning facilitated via Zoom and Teams continued to be popular, comprising 17.3% of all completions, while a loosening of COVID-19 related restrictions also saw the first face-to-face facilitated sessions for some time, representing 1.7% of total completions. The range of learning options available to ABC staff continued to grow across 2021-22, with 154 new courses added during the year, bringing the total number of courses available to 494, with more than 330 available through People Hub. These new learning options focused on addressing new and emerging capability needs within the organisation in key areas such as social media, editorial policies and the de-escalation of hostile situations. This internal catalogue of learning options was complemented with a range of learning activities facilitated by external vendors in areas such as service experience design, drone flying and data storytelling. ABC staff continued to take advantage of the learning opportunities available to them, participating in 33,842 hours of learning, again in line with 2020-21. This activity was made up of face-to-face delivery (64 sessions), virtual delivery (1,058 sessions) and online learning. Feedback from staff about the learning they received was overwhelmingly positive, with 95% of respondents saying they would recommend it to others.Technological change Delivering learning to support technological change continued to be a focus for 2021-22, with the continued transition to a new version of the ABC's content management platform, Core Media. In total there were 1,651 participants in a combination of online courses and virtual sessions, with 5,199 hours of learning delivered. Feedback from participants continued to be overwhelmingly positive. Editorial standards Learning about editorial standards continued to be a critical component of the learning and development offering. Capability building on editorial standards starts with an introductory online course, which is supplemented with more targeted face-to-face and virtual sessions that build on these introductory concepts to explore how editorial standards apply to specific circumstances and/or contexts. In 2020-21, there were 299 completions of the online introductory module, representing 224 hours of learning in total. A further 1,391 completions were recorded for the supplementary face-to-face and virtual sessions, representing an additional 1,432 hours of learning. Specific focus areas for 2021-22 included editorial standards on domestic and family violence, election coverage and social media. 73Child protection During the reporting period, the Employee Relations team continued to roll out Child Protection Training to ensure content makers understand the legal framework and obligations that apply to working with and making content for children. The team conducted 33 training sessions, which were attended by 260 staff. The ABC's child protection framework was enhanced in 2021 by the recruitment of a dedicated Child Protection Advocate. Personal use of social media The Employee Relations team also conducted face-to-face training sessions for staff and managers covering the ABC's Personal Use of Social Media Guidelines to ensure they understand their obligations regarding the personal use of social media. These programs were attended by 301 staff, including managers. Bullying, harassment, and discrimination Bullying, harassment, and discrimination remained an important area for learning in 2021-22. All new staff are required to complete mandatory learning in these areas. Topics covered by the different courses on offer include: Bullying and harassment Indigenous Cultural Awareness Disability Awareness LGBTQIA+ Awareness Building a culture of inclusion The ABC grievance process Social media self-defence. In 2021-22, a total of 3,513 hours of learning related to these topics was delivered, with a total of 7,069 completions recorded.Targeted leadership With all leadership development courses converted to virtual delivery, 2021-22 saw an increase in activity over the previous year. In total 2,836 hours of leadership development were delivered across 2021-22, with a total of 326 completions recorded for the period. The suite of leadership development courses was increased during 2021-22 with a focus on targeted learning to address the needs of specific leadership groups. New courses included a gendered leadership extension program and training to support leaders who manage teams of experts. Indigenous, diversity and inclusion Learning and development have always been an important tool for building a diverse and inclusive ABC. Key activities for 2021-22 included: Piloting a new mentoring program to support culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and female staff to grow, develop and thrive. These pilots proved to be very successful, and the programs are now being offered on an ongoing basis. Launching a revised LGBTQIA+ awareness online course. Delivering training to support the roll-out of the new ABC workplace adjustment guidelines. Developing a new workshop to help managers effectively support the needs of new and existing staff with disabilities. Piloting cultural competency training. These new activities add to an already strong diversity and inclusion offering which saw more than 3,962 completions recorded across topics such as building an inclusive culture, cultural awareness and inclusive recruitment. 74 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Entry level programs Entry level programs are an important way for the ABC to identify and develop future talent, as well as tap into non-traditional employment pathways. They fall broadly into three streams: cadetship and graduate programs, traineeships and internships. During 2021-22, the ABC centralised the governance of all entry level program activity to ensure that it was consistent and aligned with the strategic goals of the organisation. This improved visibility of entry level program activity and enhanced outcomes for program participants. All three of these entry level program streams were active during 2021-22, with 20 cadets and 30 trainees either commencing or completing and more than 30 interns active across the year.Succession planning Ensuring that the ABC has plans in place to cover key roles, should the incumbent leave the organisation, is of critical importance. Across 2021-22, the ABC has focused on ensuring that it has a robust and holistic model in place to identify and develop successors for critical roles at executive levels. In future years, this focus will be expanded to include critical roles at all levels of the organisation. 75Diversity and inclusion The ABC has a responsibility to reach all Australians and to accurately reflect the nation's rich cultural diversity. To do this, the ABC needs a workforce with broad perspectives, backgrounds and approaches to create a strong and diverse public broadcaster. Commitment to diversity The ABC recognises that a broad range of perspectives, approaches and ideas makes a stronger, more creative public broadcaster that is better able to engage with the Australian community. The ABC's Diversity & Inclusion Plan provides a strategic roadmap to help it develop an inclusive culture throughout the Corporation. The Plan covers a three-year period from 1 September 2019 to 31 December 2022 and focuses on five key diversity areas: cultural and linguistic diversity (CALD), Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, disability, gender and LGBTQI+. The three strategic goals outlined in the Diversity & Inclusion Plan are: A diverse workforce: To recruit, develop, motivate and retain a diverse workforce that reflects the make-up of the Australian community. An inclusive workplace culture: To foster a workplace culture that is inclusive, collaborative, accountable and supportive. Inclusive content, products and services: To reflect and represent the diversity of the Australian community in the content, products and the services provided. The workforce targets outlined in the Plan are: 15% CALD content makers 15% CALD executives 8% 20% women technologists 50% women executives 3.6% Indigenous employees.Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee The Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee is a body representing all ABC divisions, employee network groups and the Bonner Committee. It leads the development, implementation and review of the ABC's diversity and inclusion strategy. This includes: Developing targets and implementing the current Diversity & Inclusion Plan Supporting and championing employee network groups and their strategic plans Advising, informing and escalating issues to the ABC Leadership Team as appropriate when the organisation is not meeting diversity and inclusion goals and targets (content, workforce and culture) Elevating diversity and inclusion to ensure that executive teams are supporting and implementing the Diversity & Inclusion Plan and Reconciliation Action Plan, including ensuring that diversity and inclusion is a standing agenda item on divisional executive and commissioning meetings Educating and supporting staff in relation to the ABC's Indigenous, diversity and inclusion goals, where needed Creating alignment, collaboration and clarity across divisions on diversity and inclusion work Championing and demonstrating diversity and inclusion practice to increase business-wide awareness. 76 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Development opportunities The CALD mentoring stream was launched in June 2021 and continued in 2022. The program is part of the ABC's broader mentoring program and is designed to build a pipeline of culturally diverse staff and increase the retention of high-potential CALD staff. CALD staff from all ABC divisions were selected to participate. The program includes Individual and group mentoring, as well as interactive participant-driven learning. Indigenous employment The ABC has continued its specialist Indigenous recruitment strategy, launched in 2020, to increase Indigenous representation across the organisation with 20 centrally funded roles. The initiative is part of the employment objectives outlined in the ABC's Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-2022 (RAP). The RAP champions initiatives which recognise and embrace Australia's Indigenous history and cultures. This includes a commitment to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, voices and names within the ABC's programs, so that this may become a part of the vocabulary of the nation. The objectives in the RAP which relate directly to Indigenous employment include: Ensuring all ABC divisions develop an action plan for reaching Indigenous employment and other RAP targets. Ensuring the proportion of Indigenous staff is at least as high as the proportion of the Australian Indigenous population. The ABC's Indigenous employment target for 2022 is 3.6%. Increasing the number of Indigenous employees in content-making, editorial and management decision-making roles at senior and executive levels. Encouraging awareness of potential careers at the ABC through targeted recruitment campaigns, talent databases, industry and tertiary networks and social media campaigns. Maximising the retention of Indigenous employees through career development planning, mentoring, emerging and executive leadership training, and mobility support. Contributing to the growth of Indigenous employment in the wider media industry Increasing opportunities for Indigenous suppliers to work with the ABC. The Bonner Committee is the ABC's primary advisory body on issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, content, and communities. It is also responsible for monitoring progress against the RAP, with the Committee Chair reporting to the Managing Director on matters arising from the Committee's work. Committee members are a mix of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff drawn from around the country. The Committee is named in honour of the first and only Indigenous ABC board member, Senator Neville Bonner. Gender profile Women make up 54.9% of the ABC's workforce. This is a 0.1% increase from June 2021. The ABC has achieved gender parity in its executive group, with 54.8% of executive positions being held by women. The target was 50%. The ABC has also increased the representation of women technologists to 20.8% against a 2022 target of 20%. A gender pay analysis was conducted in 2021 across the ABC workforce to identify meaningful pay gaps (defined as +/ 3%) unfavourable to women at any level in the ABC. There is only one meaningful pay gap of 3.9% at Band 9, and this is favourable to women. This gap has significantly reduced from 7.9% in 2020 and is closing. Based on these results, the ABC believes its pay practices are equitable and that it pays fairly for roles at each level in the organisation. There continues to be a whole-of-organisation pay gap of 5.3% favourable to men. This reflects the higher representation of women in the lower-paid bands in the ABC's structure, rather than inequitable pay practices or bias during pay decisions. 77In 2021, the ABC launched its first Gendered Mentoring Program. Through group mentoring and learning sessions, this program further developed confidence, communications skills and career goals. The program ran again in 2022 as an extension of the ABC's Mentoring Program. A tech gendered mentoring stream was also launched in 2022. A Gendered Leadership Program ran for the first time across the ABC in June 2022. It had previously been piloted within the News division. The ABC is also a member of the Champions of Change Coalition, a globally recognised, innovative strategy for achieving gender equality. As part of the National 2016 Group, the ABC is committed to delivering change and achieve equal representation of gender in leadership positions. Accessibility The ABC is committed to providing a respectful and inclusive workplace by ensuring there is accessibility for all. These initiatives include: An Affirmative Measure recruitment program to help attract people with disability into the ABC's workforce. Reviewing the ABC's Workplace Adjustments Guidelines to outline the expectations and process for providing accommodations to meet the needs of current and future staff with disability. 'Accessibility by Design' Guidelines implemented by ABC Property to ensure the accessibility of ABC premises. This has included several upgrades to ABC buildings, including the installation of automatic door openers, ensuring appropriate working spaces, planned upgrades to toilets and tactile ground-surface indicators for vision-impaired staff and visitors at ABC entrances. An online Digital Accessibility e-learning module that explains accessibility, inclusive design principles and the ABC's commitment to them, as well as sharing simple techniques to overcome significant barriers, like adding text alternatives to important images, and guiding participants to further resources.The ABC has also partnered with key organisations and programs to ensure business best practice is adopted, including: A partnership with JobAccess to increase the representation of staff with disability and to achieve best practice in the recruitment of people with disability. JobAccess is a government-funded organisation focusing on disability employment. Partnership and involvement in the Australian Human Rights Commission, and its IncludeAbility Employment Project. By participation in this project, the ABC has access to best-practice initiatives being developed by other employers and the Disability Discrimination Commission. In 2021, the ABC partnered with International Day of People with Disability on a content collaboration that delivered three weeks of content consistently displaying stories and presenters with disability; previously, the ABC had delivered a single day of such programming. To support this event, the ABC asked content makers with disability to pitch their story ideas and received more than 1000 submissions, from written articles and short films to social media campaigns and radio audio series. Other diversity initiatives The ABC won three Australian LGBTQ Inclusion Awards and retained the coveted title of Gold Employer for the second consecutive year for its achievements in creating a more inclusive workplace and more diverse content for all Australians. The awards are based on the Australian Workplace Equality Index, which measures the impact of LGBTQ inclusion initiatives in organisations. ABC Managing Director David Anderson was named CEO of the Year for his work in inclusion and as Executive Sponsor of ABC Pride. The ABC also won the award for Best External Media Campaign for the podcast Innies & Outies , which was created, hosted and produced by ABC Queer Content Lead and ABC Pride member Mon Schafter. 78 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Employee network groups - ABC Belong, ABC Pride and ABC Inclusive - are an important part of ABC culture. In 2021-22, their work included the following events and initiatives: ABC Pride helped bring Mardi Gras home to the ABC for the first year of a three-year commitment to broadcast the Mardi Gras parade. ABC Pride also created a new three-year plan, identifying initiatives and goals to continue to make the ABC a safe and welcoming place for all staff in LGBTQIA+ matters. ABC Belong, an employee network group that supports CALD staff and allies of all backgrounds, grew 52 per cent to 167 members. ABC Belong held a number of organisation-wide events, including celebrations of Lunar New Year, Harmony Week, NAIDOC Week, and Diwali and Deepavali. During Harmony Week in March 2022, ABC Belong led the ABC's first content initiative that celebrated and elevated content created by, for and about CALD people. The campaign was featured on the ABC Homepage and other platforms such as ABC iview, ABC listen and ABC Education and demonstrated a strong appetite for CALD stories by audiences. ABC Inclusive led the visibility of people with Disabilities through network-led events, including Global Accessibility Awareness Day and collaboration on the International Day for People with Disability initiative expanding from a one-day event to a three-week content initiative. Disability Affairs Reporter Nas Campanella was named Changemaker of the Year at the Australian Network on Disability's inaugural Disability Confidence Awards in June 2022. ABC Inclusive developed and rolled out Inclusive Meeting guidelines, which have been integrated into wider training and senior meetings. The Disability Leadership program was co-designed with ABC Inclusive and piloted in June 2022. 79Management of WHS The ABC introduced a range of initiatives targeting the physical and mental wellbeing of staff during the 2021-22 financial year, including: De-escalation training for hostile behaviours - a purpose-designed e-learning training module to equip managers and staff to deal with hostility and aggression encountered when dealing with the public. Mental health and wellbeing - psychosocial risks remain a key focus, with specific programs addressing risks arising from traumatic news coverage, coping with COVID-19, and online bullying and harassment especially in the social media environment. Working from home - new resources developed to assist those working from home to correctly set-up their workstations and optimise their work environment. Driving for work - an action plan was implemented to improve safety of workers who drive for work through improved hazard awareness, planning and fatigue management, especially for extended or remote driving trips. Training provided A comprehensive range of training programs were provided in 2021-22 to effectively manage and reduce WHS risks. More than 13,000 WHS-related training interventions were undertaken during the year.Health and safety training completions 2021-22 ContentStaff Trained ABC pre-start induction 1,352 ABC security awareness 5,004 Asbestos safety 24 Aviation safety 10 COVID-19 important information for staff 1,113 Driving safety 638 Electrical safety 629 Emergency training 54 Ergonomics: setting up your workstation 685 Flying drones 13 Let's talk Safety - WHS consultation 115 Managing fatigue in the workplace 371 Managing injury and illness 9 Mental health training 133 Radio frequency safety 14 Situational awareness training scan for safety 100 Social media self-defence 197 WHS hazard and incident reporting 894 WHS risk management 528 Workplace behaviours 1,534 Total 13,417 Health and safety committees The ABC has WHS committees covering the four higher-risk divisions (News, Analysis & investigations, Regional & Local, Entertainment & Specialist and Product & Content Technology), with alternative consultative arrangements in place for the remaining divisions.

Comcare notices and investigations In 2021, Comcare initiated an inspection under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act)1 into a matter raised by the Australian Workers Union. Comcare issued two Inspection Reports, which found that the ABC had complied with its duties under the WHS Act and Regulations but did recommend additional actions. The ABC completed action plans to address these recommendations and, on 21 March 2022, Comcare wrote to advise the inspection has been closed. The ABC was not issued any prohibition notices or improvement notices in 2021-22. Outstanding commitments as of 30 June 2022 The ABC has no outstanding commitments as of 30 June 2022. Claim statistics Of the 239 work-related incidents reported in 2021-22, five resulted in workers' compensation claims being accepted by Comcare, compared to 13 claims accepted in 2020-21. Analysis of the accepted claims in 2021-22 shows injuries and conditions were primarily due to physical injuries including body stressing, injuries from falls, slips and trips in the workplace or vehicle accidents in the course of work. 1 An inspection is a regulatory activity that Comcare inspectors undertake to monitor compliance with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act). An inspection may involve a site visit or be a desktop activity, https://www.comcare.gov.au/scheme-legislation/whs-act/comcare-inspections . 81Number of claims by mechanism of incident group Mechanism of Incident Major Groups 2021-22*2020-21 2019-20 2018-19 2017-18 Falls, trips and slips of a person 2 3 2 8 2 Being hit or hitting an object - - - 2 2 Body stressing 1 5 1 4 4 Stepping, kneeling or sitting on objects - - - - - Mental stress 1 - 5 3 - Being assaulted - - - 1 - Vehicle accidents 2 1 - - 1 Long-term noise exposure - 2 - - - Other/Unspecified - - - 1 1 TOTAL CLAIMS 6 11 8 19 10 Average cost-to-date (2021-22)**$40,484 $26,459 $99,432 $63,432 $99,419 * The ultimate number and cost of accepted claims may differ from the data reported, as new claims may be lodged in a later period.

Workers' compensation premiums The ABC's workers' compensation premium for the 2021-22 year was $3,314,066 (ex GST). Comcare has provided the ABC with an indicative premium calculation for the 2022-23 year of $3,823,928. The overall Commonwealth premium rate for all Commonwealth Agencies has increased from 0.79 % in 2021-22 to 0.83%. The ABC's indicative prescribed premium rate for 2022-23 is 0.77% (up from 0.60% in 2021-22). The increase reflects the costs of claims across the scheme and higher-than-expected ABC claims costs for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 years due to increased mental stress claims.

The ABC actively manages these risks through its dedicated in-house staff and is working in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Office to publish materials that support the broader media community. Specific social media 'self-defence' training e-learning modules have been developed for staff, and a range of resources have been developed to empower staff in social media safety. Developments during the year included specific advice for working with external talent, risk assessment at content commissioning and social media safety while covering the Federal Election. These resources will continue to be promoted on key awareness days and through frequent training of teams. In addition to the e-learning training, 46 facilitator-led training sessions were conducted through the year for identified at-risk teams. During the year, the ABC's social media wellbeing advisor has assisted with 94 incidents and proactively reached out to 48 staff following recognition of high-risk of abuse, such as trending on Twitter or media mentions. Training The past 12 months have presented several challenges for ABC staff, including COVID-related anxiety, fatigue and resourcing issues in conjunction with covering the NSW and Queensland floods, Ukraine war and Federal Election. In response to these, a number of training sessions on mental health-related issues were delivered to employees across all ABC Divisions. In total, 27 sessions addressed a range of topics, including psychological wellbeing and resilience, vicarious trauma, managing COVID anxiety and fatigue, and depression and anxiety.The ABC expanded the scope of its Peer Support Program to include mental health, social media wellbeing, trauma, bullying, discrimination and harassment, and suicide awareness and intervention. To date, 59 existing and new Peer Supporters have been trained in these areas and are available to support any ABC employee experiencing any of these difficulties. Enforceable Undertaking The ABC entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) in June 2020 in connection with underpayments to some ABC staff. The underpayments resulted from the practice in some areas of the ABC of paying casual staff flat rates of pay designed to be high enough to compensate for penalty rates and overtime provided for by the Enterprise Agreement. In some cases, the flat rates were insufficient to achieve this aim and resulted in staff being paid less than they were entitled. The ABC took immediate steps to rectify the error and improve its systems to ensure future compliance. The ABC has also apologised to impacted current and former employees. As part of the EU, the ABC committed to and has implemented several measures to ensure future compliance with Commonwealth workplace relations laws. Measures ongoing during the year included: Independent assessment by an external independent expert of the methodology and calculations made to impacted employees. This assessment was completed and the draft report was delivered to the FWO. The second of three annual audits by an external independent expert to confirm ongoing compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws commenced in June 2022 and is due for completion in September 2022. A review of Schedule D of the ABC Enterprise Agreement (Meal Allowance Transition and Compensation Provisions) to ensure compliance with this provision. The review was completed and staff who were underpaid a meal allowance compensation entitlement were identified and paid their correct entitlements. 83 Implementation of an electronic record keeping system to accurately record rosters and actual time worked for all staff is underway. The system was initially due to be implemented by June 2022 but has been delayed in part due to the difficulty of finding adequately skilled staff. The ABC is liaising with the FWO on the revised implementation date. Review into buyouts and Band 1 classifications In addition to the EU obligations, the ABC has separately undertaken a review of payments to current and former employees who were engaged on a buyout or on a Band 1 classification. Under a buyout, employees are paid a loading in lieu of overtime, penalties, allowances and other entitlements provided by the ABC Enterprise Agreement. The Band 1 classification is appropriate for entry-level employees. The review found that in many cases staff were inadvertently paid less than their entitlement. The ABC has made payments to most of the current and former employees impacted by the error and is continuing to consult with some employees in relation to their review outcome. The ABC has apologised for the error and implemented several measures to ensure employees are paid accurately in the future. These measures include additional checks on buyouts for current and future employees prior to any buyout arrangement commencing, careful monitoring of buyout arrangements and limiting the use of the Band 1 classification. The ABC is liaising with the FWO and the Community and Public Sector Union and Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance in relation to the review and the measures it is implementing. COVID-19 recovery The ABC has continued to proactively manage the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with the advice from health authorities and health and safety regulators. During the reporting period, the ABC COVID Recovery Incident Management Teams formed in 2019 to manage the crisis continued to meet periodically to review advice from health authorities and ABC risk profiles, update COVID operational advice and the ABC COVID Safe Plan, and keep managers and workers informed. A COVID-19 Vaccination Policy was introduced in 2021 which requires ABC workers and others to be vaccinated in certain 'high-risk' circumstances, and where required by public health orders. A range of measures have been implemented to support the wellbeing of workers, including those working from home, throughout the crisis, with a particular emphasis on mental health. As community restrictions ease across jurisdictions, the ABC is taking steps to safely transition those parts of the workforce who have been working remotely back to the workplace. Targeted COVID training modules have been developed and are being implemented for all workers. A number of psycho-educational sessions have also been delivered to ABC employees targeting COVID-19 related anxiety, fatigue and self-care. Ways of working and workplace flexibility The ABC continued to have a considerable proportion of staff work from home in response to the pandemic over the 2021-22 year. The ABC's Future of Work program helped the organisation prepare and respond to this significant workplace change by evolving the approach to workplace flexibility. It embraced a hybrid working model, facilitating a mix of working from home and onsite or in the field. This was acknowledged in changes to the ABC's Working From Home Guidelines in March 2022. This enhanced workplace flexibility will prepare the ABC to attract and retain talent and support a diverse and inclusive workforce that can quickly adapt to the changing media landscape. 84 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Editorial quality ABC editorial policies The ABC Editorial Policies and associated guidance outline the principles and set the standards that govern ABC content. They are a day-to-day reference point for content makers and are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its statutory obligations and the expectations of audiences. They provide the basis for the ABC Code of Practice, which the ABC provides to the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). In addition, the Editorial Policies give practical shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act, in particular the obligations to provide service of a high standard, maintain independence and integrity, and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Editorial management and guidance No changes were made to Editorial Policies, but existing guidance was revised including: Impartiality, revised December 2021 (substantial rewrite). This revision provides guidance on factors to consider when assessing 'overtime' under the hallmarks of impartiality, and additional guidance on dealing with marginal or offensive views, what to do when people or organisations won't be interviewed, as well as advice on point-of-view documentaries and solutions journalism. Respecting Indigenous people and culture in ABC Content, revised November 2021 (title change and substantial rewrite after consulting with internal and external stakeholders). This revision provides guidance on First Nation practices and community consultation, recognises work underway to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, nation names and place names into content, updates advice over bereavement practices and audience warnings, and addresses requests to remove sensitive online content by family or authorised family representatives.Editorial reviews The ABC consistently reviews its own performance against the editorial standards. Content makers and program teams regularly review their own work, and the ABC also commissions reviews that are independent of content makers and carried out by a range of internal and external reviewers. The 2021-22 reviews and ABC responses to those reviews are published on the 'Editorial reviews' page of the ABC's corporate website: http://about.abc.net.au/howthe-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/abc-editorialstandards/editorial-reviews/ . Corrections and clarifications The ABC publishes a 'Corrections and clarifications' page on its website ( https:// www.abc.net.au/news/corrections/ ) that lists corrections and clarifications made to ABC content across radio, television and digital platforms, whether as a result of complaints or for any other reason. In 2021-22, 47 corrections or clarifications were published on the 'Corrections and clarifications' page (53 in 2020-21). Where online transcripts existed, editor's notes and corrections to copy were also published. 85Election Coverage Review Committee The Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) is convened during each federal, state or territory election campaign to monitor ABC coverage and ensure ABC editorial standards are met. The Committee is chaired by the Editorial Director or a senior editorial policy advisor and comprises representatives from all relevant ABC divisions. It is principally a committee of review and does not supplant the usual lines of editorial authority in each division during an election campaign. For federal elections, the ECRC reviews externally commissioned share of voice data to ensure appropriate editorial balance is maintained and no single political party is disproportionately represented. This is done while recognising that there are a range of factors which can and will affect the amount of time or share of voice of each party. For state and territory elections, the ECRC monitors content, internal records and feedback to ensure editorial balance. Audience complaints related to election coverage are reviewed by the Committee and the Chair of the ECRC is also responsible for administering the free broadcast time allocated to eligible political parties. Broadcast slots are provided on television and radio for policy announcements by political parties who meet the eligibility criteria. The ECRC was convened for the South Australian Election in March 2022 and for the Australian Federal Election in May 2022. 86 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Infrastructure The ABC continued to advance the Sydney Accommodation Project, which will enable the move of approximately 300 staff to a new Parramatta site and allow the refurbishment of the Ultimo building to contemporary standards while supporting flexibility in the workplace and maximising the utilisation of office space. A preferred Parramatta site was selected and a Heads of Agreement for the lease signed. Various approvals will be sought in coming months, including from the federal Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, with a view to having staff relocate into the new Parramatta office space in early 2024. At the conclusion of the Ultimo refurbishment, ABC staff will be accommodated in a collaborative and flexible workspace within a smaller footprint, allowing possible sub-leasing of vacated office space. ABC Property supported the identification and occupation of five new regional locations, including Bateman's Bay, Hervey Bay, Warragul, Carnarvon and Charleville, further enhancing the Corporation's regional Australian footprint. The team successfully relocated the ABC's Karratha Bureau into new premises designed to allow continued broadcast during cyclone or other events. This was achieved with no disruption to broadcast operations. 87Corporate services Audience In 2021-22, the Audience team's activities focused on the ABC's 90th birthday celebrations, local and international philanthropy, and emergency broadcasting awareness. Ukraine Appeal In March 2022, ABC Gives partnered with the Emergency Action Alliance (EAA) on the Ukraine Appeal. In total, the appeal raised more than $4 million in public donations and government contributions for victims of the Ukraine humanitarian disaster. The EAA estimates that approximately 70% ($1.6 million) of the funds donated by the public resulted from the ABC Gives campaign which included the ABCTV Plus rebroadcast of the Concert for Ukraine, a two-hour event bringing together leading musicians. 90 for 90 Volunteering initiative To celebrate the ABC's 90th year of connecting communities, a partnership with Volunteering Australia encouraged Australians to pledge 90 minutes of their time to giving back to their local community or a cause they find meaningful. Emergency broadcasting awareness ABC content and initiatives developed this year aimed at helping Australians prepare for emergencies included: A unique incident map on the ABC Emergency website aggregating information from key emergency and support services, including rural and regional fire services, state emergency services and the Bureau of Meteorology. It allows users to check emergency events in their locality, as well as in other locations around the country. A campaign to increase awareness and trust in the ABC's local Emergency Broadcasting services, run across ABC TV, radio and digital channels, and a Stay Connected toolkit distributed nationally in partnership with Red Cross to help communities prepare for emergencies, saw trust in the ABC improving in outer suburban and regional/rural areas (ABC Corporate Tracker April 2022).ABC 90 brand campaign A creative brand campaign marking the ABC's 90th year saw 90 people coming together in four locations across the nation to perform the song I Am Australian by Bruce Woodley AO and Dobe Newton and create the ABC's iconic Lissajous logo in a variety of ways. Highlights included the Central Australian Aboriginal Women's Choir singing on Arrernte Country in Pitjantjatjara language, and Sydney Dance Company telling the story of the ABC's evolution through Artistic Director Rafael Bonachela's choreography. Support program for Login to Watch Rolled out over the first half of the year, the ABC iview Login in to Watch project allows audiences to personalise their user experience across multiple devices and supports targeted program recommendations, watchlists and the ability to leave and resume favourite viewing. To assist with the transition, a 24/7 help centre was available online with a suite of FAQs, videos, guides and tips. This included a live chat feature providing real-time responses and support together with a call-back facility for those needing further assistance. At the end of the reporting period, there were 1.2 million average weekly logged-in ABC iview users enjoying these services. Strategy ABC Strategy provides a range of Corporation-wide functions. During 2021-22, the Corporate Strategy team led a body of work to identify and assess potential amendments to the ABC Five-Year Plan. To promote longer-term thinking, the team developed plausible scenarios for the media environment of 2032 and conducted workshops with the ABC Board and senior managers to consider strategic responses to those scenarios. 88 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022In January 2022, the Content Ideas Lab was renamed Innovation Lab to reflect the evolution of its remit to supporting innovation across the ABC. During the year, the team developed an Innovation Opportunities roadmap for the Corporation and collaborated with a range of ABC teams on projects derived form that roadmap. In February 2022, the ABC Education team moved into Strategy while developing a new Corporation-wide strategy for educational content at the ABC. The International Services team, comprising International Broadcast and Digital Services and International Development, continued its work to amplify the ABC's position as the pre-eminent Australian media organisation in the Indo-Pacific region. The team successfully attracted new funds and projects from the Australian Government, enhancing the ABC's ability to provide high-value public-interest broadcasting to audiences and to engage in media capacity-building with partners across the Region. Following the Federal Election in May 2022, ABC Corporate Affairs briefed the incoming Government, new members of Parliament and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts on the Corporation's activities and priorities. The team also hosted Parliamentarians at set visits on ABC productions across the country. ABC Communications played a key role in communicating major ABC initiatives, including the rollout of new mini-bureaux in regional Australia, which were enabled by commercial deals with the digital platforms, and the introduction of ABC iview Login to Watch, which required extensive work to explain the rationale for the initiative and technology and privacy issues.Legal services In 2021-22, ABC Legal supported the delivery of valued services to its audiences and the priorities set out in the Five-Year Plan by: providing prepublication advice on breaking news 24/7, investigations, podcasts and general programming, together with specialist legal briefings to content teams handling legal complaints, defending defamation claims, and managing other litigation, including challenging suppression order applications making submissions on law reform matters (see Appendix 10 on p 223 for a list of submissions) providing regulatory advice and corporate governance services contracting production, finance and rights agreements, content licences, music and publishing agreements, and by providing intellectual property and commercial law advice negotiating commercial and technology contracts to support all aspects of the ABC's operations conducting property sales, leasing, management and maintenance matters providing rights management services including a rights hotline service for content makers supporting major projects across the ABC, the ABC's international operations, and the management of the ABC IP portfolio delivering training on a range of topics including privacy, media law updates, contracting, and rights management strategically using technology to create automated legal documents and processes, improving legal knowledge management, and by innovating ways to deliver legal services. 8990 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Responsibility In this section: Corporate responsibility 92 Environmental responsibility 96 Social responsibility 101 News Breakfast hosts Michael Rowland and Lisa Millar. 91Corporate Responsibility The ABC is committed to corporate responsibility and aims to deliver content with integrity, diligence and transparency, and to act in the interests of citizens. Delivering products and services that satisfy the needs and expectations of audiences, and that meet the ABC's editorial standards, is the essence of the ABC's existence. The ABC is committed to fulfilling its corporate objectives across all business and media activities in a manner that is ethically and financially responsible, and in particular pursues environmentally and socially responsible business practices. The values of integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation are the foundation of the ABC's activities. Reporting performance The ABC reports its corporate responsibility and sustainability performance each financial year in the Annual Report, with additional information available in the Diversity and Inclusion Report, and then throughout the year on the Corporate Responsibility webpage http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/whatguides-us/corporate-responsibility/ . Other than references to the ABC's international activities, the Annual Report is limited to domestic operations within the direct control of the ABC. Sustainability information about the ABC's investments in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited is not included in the report. Any additional limitations to the scope or completeness of particular data are identified within the reported data. Stakeholder inclusiveness The ABC provides opportunities for its audiences and other stakeholders to provide input into its content and activities through the ABC YourSpace audience community. The YourSpace community provides audiences with opportunities to provide feedback on ABC content through its Quality and Distinctiveness studies, where members are asked regularly to rate the content that have been watching, reading or listening to. More ad-hoc and informal feedback is sought through YourSpace and via survey links on the ABC website and through ABC Social Channels (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). In 2021-22, other mechanisms for engaging with external stakeholders included: formal audience contacts and complaints processes - see p 118 and Appendix 4, p 207 ABC Advisory Council processes - see p 111 online feedback mechanisms specific to ABC content areas. Protecting freedom of expression Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises freedom of expression as a fundamental human right. Freedom of expression is enshrined in the ABC Editorial Policies. The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the importance of diverse sources of reliable information and a plurality of views within a healthy democracy. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the following: a balance that follows the weight of evidence fair treatment open-mindedness opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed.Corporate responsibility 92 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression with respect for privacy. Press freedom The ABC's commitment to public broadcasting, public interest journalism, and a strong media culture to support Australian democracy is unswerving and is a key part of the ABC Five-Year Plan. The ABC is a founding member of the Global Task Force for Public Media (GTF) and an active participant in this key body, established in 2020 to defend the values and the interests of public media. The GTF offers an industry-led approach to key issues affecting public broadcasters around the world, a perspective that spans countries, languages, and cultures. It provides a way for public broadcasters to support each other's work at a time when public broadcasting and press freedom is under attack in so many jurisdictions. The GTF comprises the leaders of eight major public media institutions: the ABC, ZDF (Germany), France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions (France), BBC (United Kingdom), RNZ (New Zealand), SVT (Sweden), KBS (South Korea) and CBC/Radio-Canada (Canada). The GTF is currently chaired by Catherine Tait, President & CEO of CBC/ Radio-Canada. During the reporting period, the GTF expressed concern about evidence of sustained and destabilising pressure on public media in Slovenia and condemned a Russian attack on a TV tower and broadcasting facilities in Kyiv that appeared aimed at depriving Ukrainian citizens of accurate information in the midst of a war. All eight members expressed formal support for the Brussels Declaration, a new global initiative to fight for journalists' safety and freedom of the press that was launched at the Public Broadcasters International (PBI) conference in Brussels in September 2021.The ABC is also a member of Australia's Right to Know (ARTK), a coalition of leading Australian media outlets and organisations that advocate for media freedom. During the reporting period, the ABC contributed to four ARTK submissions (see Appendix 10 ). Accessibility of content and services The ABC strives to ensure its websites, mobile apps, content, publications and social media are accessible. Launched in 2020 across its broadcast television channels, the ABC's audio description (AD) service provides an optional soundtrack describing visual content to improve understanding and enjoyment of television shows by audiences with vision impairment. During 2021-22, the ABC sought to add AD to high-usage inventory and increase the availability of AD content. The ABC chooses audio-described content according to suitability and priority. Suitable content contains visual material that is necessary for understanding and has sufficient space to insert it in gaps in the primary audio. Across the year, the ABC broadcast 1,260 hours of unique audio-described content including many programs' premiere or first-possible release, across its broadcast multi channels. This represented 173% of its annual target of 785 hours. Selected content included: 436 hours of drama, including features like Mystery Road, Barons, Fires, The Newsreader and Total Control 349 hours of children's content, like Bluey, Play School, First Day and Kangaroo Beach 162 hours of factual programs, including Gardening Australia, Back Roads and Back to Nature 144 hours of documentary, such as Outback Ringer, Muster Dogs, Love on the Spectrum and Australia Remastered. The 2022 Budget included an allocation of $1 million per year over the coming funding triennium to continue the AD service and extend it to ABC iview. 93You Little Ripper , a daily podcast hosted by Kurt Fearnley and Georgie Tunny, was broadcast throughout the 2021 Paralympics. The 30-minute episodes were available on the ABC listen app. The podcast was also translated into Auslan and made available on YouTube. Over the past 12 months, the ABC took other measures to increase accessibility, including: an ABC NEWS collaborative project to improve the accessibility and discoverability of podcasts by automating transcription an Auslan-interpreted news bulletin broadcast at 6pm Sunday on the ABC NEWS channel and available on-demand on ABC iview sign language and closed captions in broadcasts of live news emergency events and COVID press conferences captioning all social video content across ABC TV and ABC iview, ABC KIDS and ABC ME social media accounts holding digital accessibility workshops for content makers aimed at improving the accessibility of social media content. Protecting young or vulnerable audiences The ABC takes seriously its role of protecting young or vulnerable people from harmful content and practices. The ABC's Editorial Policy framework sets out guidelines to protect vulnerable audiences such as children. Advice and training in the ABC Editorial Policies is delivered on an ongoing basis (see p 85). Upward referral - a key concept within the policies - ensures complex decisions are not made in isolation. All television programs other than news, current affairs and sporting events, are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. The ABC ensures that graphic or distressing news content is preceded by a warning, to give readers, listeners or viewers the opportunity to avoid the content if they choose. triple j has strategies in place to ensure its younger audiences are protected from harm. Editorial content which is likely to cause harm or offence to younger sections of the audience is scheduled in appropriate time periods, such as later in the evening. Warnings are given before playing music containing language or content that is assessed as likely to offend the triple j audience and prior to other types of content which risk causing harm to vulnerable audiences. Content created especially for children and available on ABC iview or apps is accompanied by classification advice and warnings where appropriate. As with broadcast, children's content on digital properties is restricted to G and PG. Classification has progressively exhibited heightened sensibilities with respect to editorial concerns in children's programming, which has led to a significant increase in the number of episodes being referred for review. Children's programming is subject to greater oversight than other ABC content in terms of the content's compliance with non-classification matters, such as ABC Editorial Policies. Both the ABC KIDS and ABC ME apps include parental filters so parents can control their children's viewing boundaries. Additionally, ABC iview now features sub-profiles, enabling parents to create profiles for children confined to ABC Kids, ABC ME or both. The ABC's websites and apps for children follow strict protocols to minimise risk to children and protect their privacy. The ABC believes online protection of children and young people under the age of 18 is a shared responsibility between the ABC, the parent or guardian and the child, and aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with the ABC's online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them. 94 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Digital literacy ABC Education's Media Literacy website https:// www.abc.net.au/education/media-literacy/ provides resources for primary and high school aged students to improve their understanding of and ability to navigate media and information. In October 2021, ABC Education created new material for Media Literacy Week, an annual global initiative recognised by UNESCO, in keeping with the year's theme, 'Media and Information Literacy for All'. This material included content from Entertainment & Specialist and News assisting students in understanding the media and misinformation, such as a collection of segments from ABC Comedy's Question Everything . ABC Education continued to be an active member of the Australian Media Literacy Alliance, an unincorporated group of publicly funded organisations with closely aligned objectives in the area of media literacy. In 2021, the ABC's Head of Education was appointed as Chair of the Alliance. The Remote Media Literacy team delivers workshops to students in remote communities that support them to responsibly consume media. Locations visited in 2021-22 included Bamaga in north Queensland, Alice Springs in the NT and Warakurna in WA. In November, the team produced a podcast with students at Champion Bay School in WA. Titled Question What You Hear , it comprised a series of interviews by high school students about how media is made and consumed. In February 2022, the ABC's Heywire team delivered media literacy workshops to high school students on Christmas Island. Participants' podcasts were distributed via the ABC Education portal. Editorial and broadcasting responsibilities There was no change to the classification process during the reporting period. The Classifications team focused on small, tailored training sessions based on requests by producers and managers. News, Analysis & Investigations is committed to continually improving editorial standards through regular reviews of its output and editorial processes combined with craft and editorial policy training delivered with the Editorial Policy division. These initiatives are informed by input from a wide variety of stakeholders and feedback from audiences both through direct contact and the complaints process. In November 2021, News appointed award- winning journalist Matt Brown to the new position of News Standards Editor to drive continual improvement in the quality of content. Working closely with the Manager of Editorial Policy, his duties include reviewing quality control processes, providing additional training in craft skills associated with accuracy and fairness and raising awareness of the Editorial Policies. October 2021 also the appointment of multi-award-winning journalist Sashka Koloff to the new position of Managing Editor, Standards and Compliance to ensure greater editorial oversight of contentious programs and provide support to content teams. This role will also evaluate the editorial process across factual commissions for both screen and audio, providing recommendations to ensure the processes properly protect and support Editorial Managers, particularly for controversial or sensitive programming. Editorial Policy training continues to be adapted to current circumstances. In the lead-up to the Federal Election, most reporters and producers attended information and training sessions reinforcing impartiality standards and informing staff of processes used by the ABC to monitor output during the campaign. In addition, the ABC provided specialist training in domestic violence reporting and investigative journalism, as well as ongoing general training on Editorial Policies for new staff and cadets. 95Environmental responsibility The ABC is committed to significantly reducing the impact of its operations on the environment. In February 2022, the ABC Board established a committee to oversee targets, policies, initiatives and reporting. A Head of Sustainability was appointed in April 2022. The Head of Sustainability will chair a working group of employee representatives across ABC divisions to recommend, implement and report on initiatives. Sustainability enhancements were significant drivers in a range of minor capital works, including LED lighting and motion sensor installations into existing sites, as well as replacement of end-of-life air conditioning units, boilers and chillers with more energy efficient units. At the end of the reporting period, feasibility studies into the installation of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels were underway, particularly considering their potential integration into the ABC's complex electrical infrastructure. The ABC expects to begin pilot installations to further validate these findings in the coming year. Emissions During the year, ABC worked with external consultants to estimate the ABC's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions baseline based on activity and spend data, calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Climate Active Standard. The estimated baseline is 58,000 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) reflecting the scope and breadth of the ABC's connection with audiences in the smallest towns and largest cities in Australia. This includes emissions from ABC operations (referred to as Scope 1 and 2 emissions) - principally, electricity consumption in offices and studios. It also includes emissions as a result of ABC activities that occur from sources not owned or controlled by the ABC. Known as Scope 3 emissions, these make up more than 50% of the ABC's emissions. The major source are emissions from suppliers who distribute and transmit ABC content to audiences across the country. This work is used to identify and prioritise initiatives that will inform a GHG emissions target in line with climate science. Initiatives will include reducing the ABC's demand for energy by improving energy efficiency in its buildings, investigating PV solar panels and renewable energy sources, and working collaboratively with its production partners and suppliers. The GHG emissions reported below are emissions from ABC operations (Scope 1 and 2). They do not include Scope 3 emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the ABC. Hence, the total emissions reported 27,739 tCO2e is lower than the baseline of 58,000 tonnes. As noted above, the ABC will be working collaboratively with its suppliers over the next year to explore opportunities to reduce emissions from products and services they supply to the ABC. 96 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Emissions 2021-22 CategoriesRaw figure and unit -2.55% Diesel Oil 1,500 2,000 L 4.59 0 0 5 5.4 0 0 5 -15.00% E10 29,316 55,679 L 61 0 10 71 114 0 18 132 -46.21% Gasoline (ULP) 99,893 131,768 L 231 0 12 243 293 0 16 309 -21.36% Automotive Diesel (Transport) 118,720 179,498 L 323 0 17 340 406 0 21 427 -20.37% All categories 27,739 29,930 Note on emissions methodology: Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG for Electricity and Gas is obtained directly from suppliers' invoices, scope 3 GHG for energy (Electricity and Gas) and diesel consumption is calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (referred to as the Scope 3 Standard)\" and the National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) Factors prepared by the Department of the Environment and Energy, October 2020.

Energy consumption 2021-22 State/ Territory2021-22 2020-21 97All capital cities use a contracted waste provider who removes waste, batteries and fluorescent tubes. ABC offices contain collection points for mobile phones and Planet Ark receptacles for printer and toner cartridges. Major metropolitan sites use multiple-bin waste systems to separate waste streams. These include up to four bins that collect organic, co-mingled, soft plastic and landfill waste. Regional sites have different recycling arrangements depending on the local provider. Where available, these include multi-stream waste collection arrangements.Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Travel and transport The ABC encourages the use of sustainable travel to commute to and from work, such as walking, cycling or public transport. Most capital city and some regional sites provide end-of-trip facilities, including secure bike parking, showers and lockers, and information about public transport is provided for staff on the ABC intranet. When it comes to the ABC motor vehicle fleet, the ABC views every vehicle replacement as an opportunity to improve the fleet's environmental profile by considering if there is a need to replace the vehicle or whether there is a hybrid alternative that meets operational requirements. During the reporting period, the ABC significantly refreshed its fleet, including ordering a number of hybrid vehicles to replace non-hybrids. The new vehicles will be delivered early in 2022-23. Waste and recycling Recycled and landfill waste 2021-22 data that informs this report is sourced from billing information of the ABC's waste contractors for the capital cities only. This method is identical to that used to report for the 2017-18 financial year. 98 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Domestic fleet travel 2021-22 2020-21 Difference Domestic kms travelled 3,451,914 3,351,045 100,869 No. of vehicles 295 294 1 Hybrid 34 23 11 % Hybrid 11.5% 7.8% 3.7% Travel by air 2021-22 2020-21 Difference 7,317,746 6,160,661 Heritage strategy The ABC has prepared a Heritage Strategy in accordance with s. 341ZA of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).

This included 308 emergency events in 2021-22, compared with 212 events the previous year. The 'Emergency broadcasting' section on p 19 has more information about the ABC's work during times of emergency. Content impact The ABC makes a difference for audiences through the impact its content has for the communities it works with, delivering cultural and social change. The section titled 'This is the ABC' on p 16 provides more details of the way the ABC reached and influenced diverse Australian communities in 2021-22. Social responsibility in the community Community service announcements The ABC's Local Radio services broadcast community service announcements (CSAs) to assist and inform local communities. CSAs are frequently run as part of emergency broadcasting, focusing on preparation and awareness before an event and providing information after an event. CSAs are played in Indigenous languages where appropriate. Charity and fundraising In 2021, the ABC brought all its charity and fundraising events together under one name - ABC Gives. For the first time, its end-of-year charity fundraisers ran under the ABC Gives banner in all states and territories. The ABC partnered with trusted local and national charities, raising $1.7 million to support Australians in need. The end-of-year fundraising is part of many activities that local teams undertake throughout the year to help their local communities. For example, in September 2021, ABC Radio Perth's Brekky Book Bank appeal resulted in more than 7,000 books being donated for local schoolchildren. In April 2021, the ABC signed a three-year media partnership agreement with the newly formed umbrella body Emergency Action Alliance. The EAA brings together 15 of the best-known Australia-based international humanitarian relief agencies. The first major activity under this agreement was focused on Ukraine. On 30 March 2022, the ABC rebroadcast the Concert for Ukraine, staged earlier in the week in the UK, as the centrepiece of a month-long campaign run through the ABC Gives webpage. The EAA Appeal raised more than $4 million, which added significantly to donations made to its individual partner organisations. Connecting with communities The ABC connects with communities through a wide range of broadcasting and services. One example of this is the Embedded Reporting Project, which enables content makers to spend up to 10 days in communities building meaningful relationships, helping them to share perspectives and draw out stories that might otherwise not be told. The initiative was broadened to provide more opportunities for journalists to spend longer periods of time in communities that are underrepresented in the media, producing content for ABC platforms. Content makers have travelled to Palm Island and to the western side of Cape York to the Indigenous communities of Kowanyama and Pormpuraaw to uncover stories affecting the local community. They have also visited Heron Island and the Nullarbor. 101International development ABC International Development (ABC ID) partners with media, civil society, and government organisations in the Indo-Pacific region to assist in designing and delivering media development initiatives and research. ABC ID is funded through donor projects and worked on a wide range of projects in 2021-22. The Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS) undertakes media capacity-building activities across Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. In 2021-22, ABC ID undertook a range of Phase 3 activities, including economics and business reporting, women in media, training for broadcast technicians and in fact checking, 'Curb the Infodemic' research. It also conducted many country-specific initiatives, including election and parliamentary reporting. PACMAS is funded by the Australian Government through DFAT. Content initiatives included: The Pacific Collection contributes content from ABC archives to the Pacific Virtual Museum, making digitised items of Pacific cultural heritage publicly accessible. The Young Pacific Change Makers project celebrates and supports Pacific Islanders aged 18 to 30 inspiring and leading positive change in Samoa, Tonga, and Solomon Islands. Pacific Prepared is a radio co-production with six Pacific nations on disaster preparedness that broadcasts on ABC Radio Australia and Pacific stations across the region. The Media Development Initiative is a DFAT-funded project focused on partnering with media organisations to support content development and capacity-building. In 2021-22, this included addressing COVID-19 health information and misinformation (including PNG Social Media Tracker research), National General Election reporting and church media story grants. The DFAT-funded Women in News and Sports project trained and mentored women journalists across the Indo-Pacific to cover both community and major regional sporting stories and events. Training included best-practice radio and podcast production, mobile storytelling, and remote reporting and commentary. The Girls Online (GO!) project, funded under the Australian Government Cyber and Critical Tech Cooperation Program, works with young women in Tonga and Vanuatu to develop resilience and solutions to the threats they face online. The SAFE project provides technical assistance to behaviour change communication initiatives across the Pacific on sexual and reproductive health issues, funded by the Australian Government through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The Climate Story Telling project promotes effective information sharing between Pacific media and climate change bodies and experts, to improve media coverage. It is administered through the Australia Pacific Climate Partnership, funded by the Australian Government. In the USAID-funded Information Integrity project, ABC ID worked with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) across the Pacific, to build capacity among media and social media influencers to create accurate COVID-19 reporting and build strategies to understand and prevent misinformation. ABC ID worked with Oxfam and Timor Leste media to promote inclusive and accurate COVID-19 coverage. This is part of the Australian Government's Australian Humanitarian Partnership (AHP). In partnership with AHP and Oxfam, ABC ID worked with disability organisations and media to promote inclusive disaster reporting and media coverage in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Timor-Leste. 102 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Under the AHP, ABC ID provided technical support to PNG churches on theological messaging about COVID-19 prevention. Through the AHP and Oxfam, ABC ID is also working with Australian and PNG non-government organisations to support risk communications and community engagement on COVID-19 and countering misinformation. Both initiatives were implemented with the Church Partnership Program and the Church Agencies Network - Disaster Operations. International relations The ABC contributes to a number of international bodies that foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing between public service media organisations. It is a member of the Public Media Alliance (PMA), and has a seat on the PMA Board, as well as the DG8 international broadcasting group, the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) and the Association for International Broadcasting. The ABC's Managing Director, David Anderson, is a member of the Global Task Force (GTF) for public media, a group of eight leaders of major public media services from around the world formed to defend the values and the interests of public media. Due to COVID-19, the 2021 Public Broadcasters International (PBI) conference was held as an online conference hosted from Brussels. The Managing Director spoke on a virtual panel on Coping with Economic Pressure. The ABC also provided a representative on the PBI Steering Committee. During the year, the ABC championed a move to reserve a seat on the ABU Administrative Council, the second-tier decision making body for the ABU, for a member from a Pacific nation. The Head of International Services, Claire Gorman, participated in virtual panels with CEOs from media organisations across the Pacific region. She is also the chairperson of the ABU Program Bureau.Social responsibility in the supply chain In December 2021, the ABC published its second annual Modern Slavery Statement https://about. abc.net.au/reports-publications/fy2021-modern-slavery-statement/ to satisfy its legislative obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 and to demonstrate its ongoing commitment to addressing modern slavery risk in its operations and supply chain. In its second statement, the ABC increased its focus on the countries of origin of the goods that it purchased, raising staff awareness of modern slavery risks, and delivering the initiatives outlined in the ABC's Modern Slavery Road Map. The ABC continues to work with small suppliers to ensure its supply chain risk measures do not prevent them from participating in business opportunities. To achieve this, the ABC is continuously simplifying its procurement process and building staff capability around supplier engagement. These activities also support adherence to the ABC Supplier Code of Conduct https://about.abc.net.au/ wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Supplier-of-Code-Final-Approved-August-2020.pdf , which supports a values-based approach to supplier performance. By working with suppliers that share the ABC's values and reflect those values in their own supply chains, the ABC is taking a collaborative approach to managing modern slavery and other supply chain risks. Addressing the risk of modern slavery is also a commitment of the ABC Social and Sustainable Procurement Strategy , which is guided by ISO 20400:2017 Sustainable Procurement and places a focus on human rights, as well as other core issues like labour practices, the environment, and community involvement and development. As part of its commitment to community involvement, the ABC prides itself on its multi-faceted approach to supporting Indigenous businesses and values its close partnership with Supply Nation https://supplynation.org.au/ since 2016. 103As a Supply Nation member, the ABC actively engages with Supply Nation to raise ABC staff awareness of Indigenous businesses and conducts regular Indigenous supplier webinars to promote ABC business opportunities. The ABC's partnership with Supply Nation is a key enabler of its ability to meet the supplier diversity objectives of the ABC Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-22 https:// about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ABCElevateRAP201922.pdf .

This included: The Newsreader and Fires - to provide feedback on awareness and community engagement with the programs, responses and reactions to the programs and the types of drama that Council Members and their communities would like to see more of. Members found Fires emotionally engaging as they, and many in their communities, had recently experienced the trauma of the Black Summer fires.

The ABC must adapt to technological changes, shifts in demographics, evolving audience demands and structural changes in the broadcasting, media and entertainment industry. As one of Australia's most important civic and cultural institutions, the ABC also faces unique public expectations and financial challenges. The Board recognises that risk management and internal compliance and control are vital to effective governance. The ABC's Risk Management Policy and Resilience Policy set out the ABC's approach to managing risks and disruptions. It is the responsibility of ABC employees at all levels to identify, manage, review and report on risks relating to the objectives they are accountable for delivering. Underpinning these policies is a standardised, enterprise-wide risk management process to identity, assess, monitor and manage significant risks, while disruption is managed using the Prevention, Preparedness, Response and Recovery Model. The Risk and Resilience function is responsible for building risk management and resilience capability and consistent application of these processes. In 2021-22, the Leadership Team and the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed the ABC's risk profile and received regular risk management reports and resilience information. These reports considered the ABC's people, audience, reputation, financial, technology, legal and compliance exposures. Additional reporting examined the operational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ABC's risk appetite was also deployed. This supports and informs Board and management decision making in accordance with the ABC's Five-Year Plan.Insurance The ABC has acquired appropriate insurances from Comcover, including directors' and officers' liability insurance. The 2021-22 premium for directors' and officers' liability insurance was $235,925. The ABC has indemnified each Board member for legal costs and liabilities incurred in their capacity as a Board member of the ABC under a Deed of Access and Indemnity. Board members were permitted to vote on the Deed pursuant to a declaration by the Minister for Communications under s. 15 of the PGPA Act. 116 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Audit Privacy Group Audit has a key role within the ABC's governance framework. It reports independently to the Audit & Risk Committee and contributes to the achievement of the ABC's goals and objectives by: providing objective assurance of the design and operation of the ABC's internal controls, including recommending improvements to management playing a role in developing and maintaining a culture of accountability and integrity, including conducting investigations in relation to fraud or public interest disclosure allegations responding to the ABC's changing requirements and applying a continuous improvement mindset, including using technology and data to assess internal control performance. Group Audit prepares and delivers the ABC's Internal Audit Plan, which is approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. A risk-based audit approach is adopted to ensure Group Audit focuses its work on the ABC's key strategic objectives and operational areas. Group Audit works closely with Group Risk to ensure that all aspects of risk are considered in the development of the risk-based Internal Audit Plan, including operational, strategic, people and financial risk. Audits are conducted in accordance with international auditing standards. In 2021-22, Group Audit completed 24 audit assignments (23 assignments were completed in 2020-21), covering editorial, content delivery, operational, finance, information technology, risk management, people and culture, health and safety, and project management processes. Group Audit uses in-house employees and external providers to deliver the Internal Audit Plan. External providers provide expertise in specialist areas, supplementing internal resources and experience. Group Audit liaises with the ABC's external auditors, the Australian National Audit Office, and their nominated representative, KPMG. This includes seeking advice on proposed areas of focus and ensuring minimal duplication of audit coverage. The ABC complies with the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). The ABC Privacy Policy is published on the 'Privacy' page of the ABC website. The policy sets out the information the ABC collects, the circumstances in which it may use and disclose such information, how individuals may access their personal information, and how and to whom individuals may complain about a breach of privacy. The ABC is committed to high standards of privacy management and governance. In the 2021-22 period, the ABC updated its Privacy Management Plan in accordance with the Privacy (Australian Government Agencies - Governance) APP Code 2017. The Plan articulates measurable privacy goals for the ABC. In addition to its Privacy Management Plan, the ABC has a comprehensive framework in place for privacy management, including a privacy impact assessment process, data breach response plan, personal information collection statements, and detailed privacy policy. The ABC was a supporter of the 2022 Privacy Awareness Week, an initiative between the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and other state and territory privacy regulators to raise awareness of the importance of protecting and respecting personal information. During Privacy Awareness Week, the ABC Privacy team conducted several internal training sessions to promote privacy awareness and best practice. Data breach notification Data breach notification laws make it mandatory for the ABC to report a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to any affected individuals. Notification must be made to the affected individuals and the regulator. In 2021-22, the ABC did not experience any data breaches that required notification to the Privacy Commissioner. 117Editorial complaints management Audience and Consumer Affairs Written complaints that are potentially editorial - about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content - are referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs, a unit which is independent of ABC content teams. Where a written complaint suggests the ABC may have breached its Editorial Policies or Code of Practice, Audience and Consumer Affairs assesses the complaint to determine appropriate handling in accordance with the ABC Complaint Handling Procedures. Audience and Consumer Affairs may investigate the complaint and determine whether ABC editorial standards have been met. Where the matters raised are less serious, Audience and Consumer Affairs may refer the complaint for direct handling to the content area responsible. In cases where a complaint is investigated and the ABC's editorial standards have not been met, the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in part). Complaints can also be resolved where appropriate action is taken to remedy a matter. Overall complaint handling During 2021-22, Audience and Consumer Affairs assessed 7,093 written complaints. The unit provided a personal response to 1,918 of these complaints. 2,196 complaints were referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response and no substantive response was required for 2,979 complaints.

Trust in media and public institutions declined through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Being a trusted source of news and information is important across all aspects of the ABC, and it remains the most trusted media source in Australia. In 2021-22, 77% of Australians trusted the information provided by the ABC - this is significantly higher than all other media institutions and information providers. The ABC will continue to prioritise building understanding and, where appropriate, enhancing the transparency of its efforts to ensure accurate and impartial journalism that the Australian public can trust. Another initiative implemented by the ABC to support trust is the appointment of the ABC Ombudsman in August 2022. Priority: Strengthen local connections Strengthening the role that the ABC plays in local communities is a key strategic priority that has grown in importance.

However, during this period, it was the least distinctive of our products (78%) given similar news and information exist in other places and news formatting is relatively consistent across providers. Highly distinctive content produced included Backroads , Landline , Sammy J Hell , Media Watch , Radio National and triple j. The ABC will increase its focus on showcasing programs that appeal to uniquely Australian stories, interest, and perspectives. Priority: Invest in the workforce of the future Employee engagement surveys provide detailed data and insights for leaders and managers to use to improve the workplace. Organisational responsiveness to employee feedback leads to higher retention rates, lower absenteeism, improved productivity, higher service levels and better employee morale.

The ABC's Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) sets out the targets for the representation of Indigenous employees at the ABC. The target of 3.6% was set in 2019, for achievement by 2022. The difference of 0.3% against this metric is 13 employees across the organisation. Reconciliation Australia has approved an extension of the ABC RAP to June 2023 to achieve this target amongst other initiatives, acknowledging the effect of COVID-19 on the recruitment pool throughout the life of the RAP. The RAP outlines opportunities for Indigenous staff including measures to increase the number of Indigenous employees in content-making, editorial decision-making, and management roles, particularly at a senior level. Increasing the representation of Indigenous content encourages awareness of potential careers at the ABC aiding in both retention and recruitment. The ABC has also ensured all divisions have an action plan for reaching Indigenous employment and other RAP targets.

The ABC continues to recruit and retain culturally diverse executives in a demanding and competitive job market. Quarterly diversity reporting maps the representation of CALD executives, including updates on the retention of culturally diverse staff. Recruitment reporting tracks the representation of CALD candidates through the recruitment process, and further inclusive recruitment training has been developed for the next financial year to refine ABC processes. The ABC is also focusing on internal career development opportunities including a mentoring program tailored to staff from culturally diverse backgrounds to attract and retain staff. External opportunities for career development include attending networking sessions, masterclasses and coaching sessions provided by the ABC's membership of several national diversity organisations. 2 Targets based on annual measurement from 1 September to 31 August, as required by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 . 3 Represents employees who voluntarily self-identify as indigenous and are verified by the ABC. 4 Percentage is based on 84.7% of employees voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2022.5 Percentage is based on 82% of employees voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2021.6 Represents employees who voluntarily self-identify as coming from a non-English speaking background.7 Percentage based on 93% of executives voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2022.8 Percentage based on 92% of executives voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2021. 125Measure Measure Source Data Source2021-22 Target2021-22 Result2020-21 Result Culturally makers 2,5,4ABC Corporate Plan 2021-22Employee data 15% 12.8%911.3%10 Analysis: Target not met.

ABC estimates that the total population of Australia able to receive ABC digital terrestrial transmission services is at least 98.71% via the 420 transmission services located across Australia under fully managed services provided by BAI Communications. The ABC does not have coverage information about the 77 services provided by RBAH. The remainder of the population have access via VAST. The ABC receives feedback from our audience on a regular basis. Transmission faults effecting audience access are escalated BAI for investigation when an audience member reports a disruption to transmission services of which ABC Audience Support Team are not aware. This can include transmission faults, input faults, existing faults, or planned works.

All relevant transmission issues raised with the ABC by audiences were escalated to BAI Communications Australia. 22 VAST transmission can reach all homes in Australia, so digital coverage is 100%. The appropriate equipment (including a satellite dish) is required to access radio and television services via VAST. 23 This result may include a small number of duplicates arising from limitation in the reporting process. 130 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Transmission Transmission of the ABC's radio and television content is provided by a third party and managed by the ABC via Transmission Service Agreements. The effective management of these agreements is fundamental to ensuring the ABC reaches and engages with as many Australians as possible.

This measure identifies that the majority of audiences, for most of the year, were provided ABC transmission services. Television and analogue radio service performance improved in FY22 over the previous year. This was significantly influenced by the reduced impact of weather conditions on broadcasting over the year. Additionally, the ABC saw a reduction in the impact of long delays in repairing the Class E Digital Radio services. These services are under a contract for digital radio services but were originally built by commercial radio broadcasters to provide low powered infill transmission services. The time to repair has improved in 2022 but these services remain the worst performing in the network. These services do not have the same standby power and other facilities as the fully managed services and are provided on a break and fix maintenance contract. Measure Measure Source Data Source2021-22 Target2021-22 Result2020-21 Result Operation of transmission facilitiesABC from BAI Communications Australia100% 99.47% 100% Analysis: Target not met. Six services in regional and remote Tasmania operated below their targeted performance because of the extended wet weather, storms, and the impact on the electrical power supply network and the off-air program input signals that these services depend upon. Several were off-air for extended periods whilst the electricity network operator, TasNetworks, reconnected the electrical power supplies. The affected services do not have standby electrical power. Large capital replacement works including ongoing roll out of new FM transmitters around the country, major antenna replacement works and the addition of commercial broadcasters' services at the ABC transmission sites occurred throughout the year as planned works in periods of least impact to the ABC audiences. The most notable projects were the replacement of the FM antennas for Illawarra, NSW services and AM antennas for Bunbury WA. Temporary FM services were established from adjacent towers with the assistance of BAI and the ACMA to provide ongoing coverage and alternative services for audiences during the projects. 131ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2021-22 Performance24 BAI Communications Fully Managed National Transmission Network Services ABC ServiceNo. of Transmitters (See Note 1)BAI Communications Transmission Network (See Note 2)Total Network Availability (See Note 3)Total 'On-Air' Availability Target %2020-21 99.66 99.73 99.78 99.81 Digital Radio - 11 99.88 99.99 99.97 99.27 98.81 99.89 99.90 NA 69.75 90.60 82.87 99.91 State Analogue Radio NSW/ACT 182 ServiceNo. of TransmittersTotal Network AvailabilityTotal 'On-Air' Availability 99.66 98.16 99.66 99.83 132 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 202224 Further information on transmission: 1. No. of Transmitters: The number of transmitters includes Analogue Radio, Digital Television and Digital Radio operated by BAI Communications on behalf of the ABC. If a transmitter was operational during the period for one or more days, it is included in the report. Transmitter numbers for Digital Television do not include the six standby transmitters operated in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, and Sydney, which operate as a backup to the main transmitter in those areas. 2. BAI Communications Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The transmission network performance data is reported by BAI Communications in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This is a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network, or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed by ABC Transmission Network Services and this year identified changes in BAI monitoring and reporting systems resulted in revisions of the formal reporting. This work is ongoing. There are 13 Class E digital radio services that are provided by BAI Communications for the ABC where contract performance is not measured as a target of overall uptime. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across both national and commercial and community broadcasters. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case-by-case basis. The largest discrepancy in reported data was in the categorisation of the faults where most of the audience continued to receive services but the transmission services did not meet the full technical specification. ABC continues to review the performance data related to the affected services. 4. Total 'On-Air' Availability: The figures show 'off-air' occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity. It is important to note that the majority of maintenance activity is undertaken after midnight to reduce audience impact. 5. RBA Holdings Transmission Network (Self Help Services): The transmission network performance data is reported by RBA Holdings in the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. This is a contracted deliverable and is provided for ABC information purposes to record outage times and respond to audience requests for information. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across regional Australia. 6. RBA Holdings Reporting Quality: The RBAH provided transmission services do not have the same reporting obligations as BAI Communications' National Transmission Network. Maintenance operator data provided by RBAH is incomplete. The ABC has relied upon the MediaHub off-air fault reports, Seven Qld and BAI Communications fault reports for RBAH facilities in FY2022. RBAH has undertaken to implement performance reporting improvements.International Emmy Kids Award-winning ABC ME television series First Day .

At the time of preparation of this report, the October 2022 Federal Budget planned by the Labor Government had not been handed down. The 2022-23 budget has been prepared based on funding announced in the March 2022 Federal Budget, and in alignment with the ABC Five-Year Plan, with deliverables to further build on the work undertaken since the Plan was launched in July 2020. The main areas of focus include enhanced personalised content experiences for audiences, increased digital products available for on-demand content, and additional content focused on younger audiences. In addition, the 2022-23 budget includes the reinvestment of revenue from digital news content agreements to strengthen services in regional Australia through the establishment of approximately 70 additional roles, more localised content and multiple platform delivery models. These initiatives will contribute towards achieving the Five-Year Plan priorities of delivering personalised digital experiences, remaining Australia's best and most trusted source of news and information, strengthening local connections, and prioritising quality over quantity. The ABC remains committed to prioritising available resources to enable it to most effectively deliver on its Charter obligations and remain relevant to audiences in Australia's cultural and media landscape into the future. 137$1,319 $886$ Millions Years6006507007508008509009501,0001,0501,1001,1501,2001,2501,3001,350 22/2321/2220/2119/2018/1917/1816/1715/1614/1513/1412/1311/1210/1109/1008/0907/0806/0705/0604/0503/0402/0301/0200/0199/0098/9997/9896/9795/9694/9593/9492/9391/9290/9189/9088/8987/8886/8785/86Comparative Revenue from Government The 2022-23 operational revenue from Government of $886 million represents a decrease in real funding of $433m or 32.8% since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart Current Ratio (b) 1.19 Equity (c) 58% 54% 52% 76% 76% (a) Net cost of services is total expenses less total own-source income (b) Current assets divided by current liabilities(c) Equity as a percentage of total assetsABC operational Revenue from Government Including Capital indexed at 2021-22 levels - December 2021, six months CPI index - 32.8% reduction from 1985-86 to 2022-23 138 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Independent Auditor's Report GPO Box 707, Canberra ACT 2601 38 Sydney Avenue, Forrest ACT 2603 Phone (02) 6203 7300 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT To the Minister for Communications Op inion In my opinion, the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the Entity) for the year ended 30 June 2022: (a) comply with Australian Accounting Standards - Simplified Disclosures and the P ublic Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 ; and (b) present fairly the financial position of the Entity as at 30 June 2022 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended. The financial statements of the Entity , which I have audited, comprise the following as at 30 June 2022 and for the year then ended: Statement by the Directors and Chief Financial Officer; Statement of Comprehensive Income; Statement of Financial Position; Statement of Changes in Equity; Cash Flow Statement; and Notes to the financial statements , comprising a s ummary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for o pinion I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Audi tor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Entity in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by the Auditor -General and his delegates . These include the relevant independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) to the extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor- General Act 1997 . I have also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Accountable Authority's responsibility for the f inancial statements As the Accountable A uthority of the Entity , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board are responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the Act) for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards - Simplified Disclosures and the rules made under the Act. The Board is also responsible for such internal control as the Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Board is responsible for assessing the ability of the Entity to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the E ntity's operations will cease as a result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Board is also responsible for di sclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting , unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate . 139 Auditor's r esponsibilities for the audit of the f inancial s tatements My o bjective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high leve l of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: i dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform au dit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f the Entity's internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority; conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the E ntity's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the E ntity to cease to continue as a going concern; and evaluate the over all presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Accou nt able Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget Explanations are provided for significant variances between actual results and the budget, as reflected in the Portfolio Budget Statements 2021-22 (PBS) of the Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications Portfolio, published in May 2021. Significant variances include variances of $20,000,000 or more, and variances which are otherwise materially relevant to the performance of the ABC. The budget is not audited. Values in this Note are rounded to the nearest thousand, consistent with the PBS. The ABC's surplus after income tax for the financial year to 30 June 2022 was $116,000 which was $2,671,000 favourable compared to the budgeted deficit of $2,555,000. Total Comprehensive Income for the financial year was $55,335,000 which was favourable compared to the budget mainly due to a change in the asset revaluation reserve, as detailed in the explanations provided under the headings C. Changes in asset revaluation reserve and F. Assets classified as held for sale. A. Employee benefits expenses Employee benefits expenditure of $538,841,000 was $35,266,000 higher than the budget of $503,575,000. This was mainly due to the allocation of greater than budgeted own-source revenue towards additional content making positions, including new regional journalism roles. The variance is also partly due to the increased use of employees for content creation as compared to suppliers. This resulted in an offsetting reduction against suppliers' expenses.B. Suppliers' expenses Suppliers' expenditure of $287,504,000 was $27,574,000 lower than the budget of $315,078,000. This was mainly due to one off savings in costs such as travel, largely due to COVID-19. In addition, supplier expenses were lower than originally budgeted partly due to the increased use of employees for content creation. C. Changes in asset revaluation reserve Changes in the asset revaluation reserve of $55,219,000 relates to the revaluation of the ABC's Artarmon New South Wales property prior to reclassification as an asset held for sale. No budget was assigned to this item as no asset revaluations were originally expected during the period. D. Other investments The ABC's Other investments balance at 30 June 2022 was $237,500,000 which was $69,744,000 higher than the budget of $167,756,000. Other investments comprise investments of surplus cash in term deposits with an original maturity of more than three months. The favourable balance is mainly due to a higher than budgeted opening balance on 1 July 2021 and the investment of proceeds received from the sale of the ABC's Elsternwick Victoria property. In addition, cash outflows for capital projects have been delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 on supply chains, resulting in a temporary increase in surplus cash invested in term deposits at the end of the reporting period. Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2022 148 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022E. ABC owned non-financial assets - land The balance of land assets at 30 June 2022 was $222,879,000 which was $56,010,000 lower than the budget of $278,889,000. The variance was partly due to the reclassification of the ABC's Artarmon New South Wales property as an asset held for sale during the 2022 reporting period, and partly due to a lower than budgeted opening balance on 1 July 2021 due to the reclassification of the Elsternwick Victoria property as an asset held for sale in the financial year ended 30 June 2021. F. Assets classified as held for sale The balance of assets classified as held for sale at 30 June 2022 was $88,776,000 due to the reclassification of the ABC's Artarmon New South Wales property as an asset held for sale. No budget was assigned to this item as no reclassifications were originally expected during the period. G. Employee provisions The ABC's employee provisions balance at 30 June 2022 of $157,232,000 was $485,000 higher than the balance at 30 June 2021. The balance at 30 June 2022 was $25,455,000 higher than the budgeted amount of $131,777,000 mainly due to a higher than budgeted opening balance on 1 July 2021. H. Cash received - proceeds from sale of land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles The ABC received cash proceeds of $26,313,000 from the sale of land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles in the 2022 reporting period. This was mainly due to the completion of the sale of the ABC's Elsternwick Victoria property. No budget was assigned to this item as the contract of sale was executed after the budget had been set. 149Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20222. Overview The ABC is a Corporate Commonwealth, not-for-profit entity incorporated in Australia. The ABC's head office is located at ABC Ultimo Centre 700 Harris Street Ultimo New South Wales Australia (GPO Box 9994 Sydney NSW 2001). Its functions are set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Those functions are reflected in the statement of purpose in the ABC Corporate Plan 2021-22, which was prepared in accordance with section 35 of the PGPA Act. The continued existence of the ABC in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament. The Basis of Preparation The financial statements are required by section 42 of the PGPA Act. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: (a) the FRR; and (b) Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations- including simplified disclosures for Tier 2 Entities under AASB 1060 issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. New Accounting Standards AASB 1060 General Purpose Financial Statements - Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2021 and replaces the reduced disclosure requirements (RDR) framework. The application of AASB 1060 involved some reduction in disclosure compared to the RDR with no impact on the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the ABC. There were no other new or revised standards effective for the current reporting period that had a material effect on the ABC's financial statements. Income Tax The ABC is exempt from all forms of taxation except Fringe Benefits Tax and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Any income tax benefit or expense, asset or liability, presented in the financial statements and accompanying notes, is attributable to joint operations. Any income tax expense or benefit is recorded as Income tax (expense)/benefit attributable to joint operations in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. A tax asset is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position in Tax assets. Changes to comparatives Where appropriate, comparatives have been reclassified from the prior period to align with the current period presentation. 150 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The ABC has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. In addition, the ABC has taken the fair value of plant and equipment to be the depreciated cost. The ABC has applied estimates and assumptions to the following significant items: Depreciation and amortisation, as detailed in Note 3C Depreciation and amortisation on ABC owned assets , and Note 7A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles ; Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 3E Program amortisation , and Note 7D Inventories; Valuation of land, buildings, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 7A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles ; Leased assets and lease liabilities, specifically identification of leased assets and lease liabilities where the ABC has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits, as detailed in Note 7B ABC right-of-use assets and Note 9B Lease Liability ; and Employee provisions, as detailed in Note 11 Employee Provisions . No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.Events After the Reporting Period There were no subsequent events after the reporting period which required any adjustments or additional disclosures to be incorporated in these financial statements.Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The ABC has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The ABC has elected not to recognise right- of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets (less than $10,000). The ABC recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the year to 30 June 2022, expenditure on short-term leases was $852,000 low-value leases was $7,000 (2021 $30,000) and expenditure on variable lease payments which were not included in the measurement of a lease liability was $82,000 (2021 $78,000). Depreciation on ABC owned assets Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Depreciation rates are initially based on asset useful lives, reviewed each year and adjusted as appropriate. Useful lives applying to each class of depreciable asset are referenced in Note 7A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles . Amortisation of ABC owned intangibles Intangibles comprise software for internal use. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2021 3-8 years). 153Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20223.

The depreciable period extends from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset if earlier. Amortisation of purchased programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy for amortisation of produced programs. Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. 154 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Amortisation of produced programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs, Live Programs, Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics \u2014 100% on first screening; Children's', Education and Movies \u2014 straight-line over three years from completion of production; ABC iview-only programs \u2014 100% on first release; and Programs not covered above \u2014 100% on first screening. In addition to the above, programs that are assessed as no longer having any service potential are 100% expensed at the time of the assessment. The costs of programs produced for Radio and ABC International are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. The valuation of inventory is addressed in Note 7D Inventories . Finance costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on the liability attributable to right-of-use assets Interest is calculated on the monthly outstanding balance of the lease liability (refer Note 9B Lease liability ). Assumptions surrounding uncertainty \u2014 interest costs on the liability attributable to right-of-use assets The valuation of the lease liability is influenced by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly basis, by the Commonwealth Department of Finance. The corresponding interest charged on the outstanding balance is a function of the incremental borrowing cost derived from the discount rate applicable at the commencement of the lease. The carrying balance of the lease liability is reviewed regularly and an assessment is made of the potential impact of a change in discount rates on this balance upon any lease modifications or reassessments.Impairment loss on financial instruments Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments , impairment of financial assets is provided for on the basis of future expected credit losses (ECLs) rather than as and when existing debts are deemed to be impaired. This allows for the expectation of credit losses to be adjusted in response to certain factors, for example prevailing or anticipated market conditions. Accounting Policy Write-down and impairment of other assets Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment is made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the ABC were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. At 30 June 2022, the ABC had performed assessments to determine the extent of any indications that assets may be impaired and the resultant financial impact has been incorporated in the table above. 155Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20223.

Own-Source Income (continued) Accounting Policy Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers Royalties Royalty income arising from sales and usage- based royalties are recognised at the later of when the subsequent sales or usage occurs, or when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Therefore, royalty income is recognised at a 'point in time'. Content sales Licence fees from program content are recognised on the later of the start of the licence period (taking into account any holdback dates) or when the ABC's performance obligations have been satisfied. For content sales the performance obligation is generally to deliver the associated program to the customer, therefore income is recognised on delivery of each episode or package of content. Joint Operations Revenue attributable to joint operations represents the ABC's 50% share of revenue from the ABC's joint operation, MediaHub Australia Pty Limited (MediaHub). This revenue comprises services fees recognised 'over time' in line with when the services (predominantly for broadcast presentation) are provided.Grants and Services Contracts Revenue for grants and services contracts with specific performance obligations (primarily for international aid and development projects) is recognised 'over time' in line with when the services are provided, on an expense reimbursement or on a stage of completion basis. Pursuant to AASB 1058 Income of Not- for-Profit Entities , Grants from Government departments without specific performance obligations are recognised as income in the financial year that they relate to. Co-productions Co-production income is recognised on delivery of the related materials or on a stage of completion basis, depending on the nature of the contract with the customer. Other Contract Revenue Other contract revenue includes items such as commissions and distribution fees which are recognised at the later of when the subsequent sales or usage occurs. Interest Revenue Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method and if not received at balance date, is reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a receivable. 158 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Note 4C to 4F Notes2022 $'0002021 4,145 Total other revenue 4,360 4,145 4D Net gain from disposal of assets Total proceeds from disposal - 81 Total carrying value of assets disposed - (46) Total costs of disposal - (23) Total net gain from disposal of assets - 12 4E Net foreign exchange gain Non-speculative 826 848 Total net foreign exchange gain 14B 826 848 4F Insurance recoveries Insurance recoveries insurance recoveries 1,725 (2,726) prior years write-downs and impairments for:Land and buildings 48 - Derecognition of existing leases 117 - Total reversals of previous asset write-downs and impairments 165 - Operating lease revenue commitments 2022 $'0002021 $'000 One year or less 2,146 1,855 From one to two years 1,466 1,600 From two to three years 1,016 1,303 From three to four years 1,026 1,169 From four to five years 955 984 Over five years 3,086 2,773 Total operating lease revenue commitments 9,695 9,684 159Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20224. Own-Source Income (continued) Accounting Policy Lease and other revenue Other revenue largely comprises revenue from lease or hire of ABC owned or controlled facilities. Rental income from the lease of ABC owned or controlled premises is recognised as lease income under AASB 16 Leases and disclosed separately to other revenue from customers disclosed under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . For the year to 30 June 2022, revenue earned from sub-leased right of use assets was nil (2021 nil). Gains from disposal of assets Gains from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. For the year to 30 June 2022, gains or losses arising from sale and leaseback transactions were nil (2021 nil). Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. Gains and losses are taken to surplus/(deficit), except for transactions classified as cash flow hedges which are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity if material in value.Insurance recoveries This amount is primarily comprised of the insurance claim for the ABC Ultimo cladding project. The amount for the comparative period was the component of the claim that was assessed as being no longer virtually certain of reimbursement as at 30 June 2021. Operating lease revenue commitments These commitments, largely relating to rental income for letting out office space, are presented exclusive of GST. Lease terms are typically between 1 to 5 years in duration and income is subject to increases in accordance with CPI or other agreed increments. Operating lease revenue is earned via leasing of spare capacity within the ABC's properties and resources. The ABC leases out spare capacity only on assets it controls. There are no rights-related risks associated with the underlying assets that are being leased. 160 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Financial Position 5. Financial Position Accounting Policy Acquisition of assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The Corporation has adopted the following general policies relating to the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 \u2014 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 \u2014 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 \u2014 unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. The fair value of land is determined by reference to the market value of the land component of ABC property because it is possible to base the fair value on recent sales of comparable sites. The Corporation's independent valuers detail these reference sites in valuation reports for respective properties. No observable market data is available for the ABC's buildings, given their highest and best use as specialised broadcasting facilities. The fair value of these assets is based on depreciated replacement cost (Level 3 inputs). Plant and equipment assets are measured based on depreciated cost (Level 3 inputs). Intangibles (software for internal use) are measured at cost less subsequent accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Generally, the fair value of the Corporation's other financial assets and liabilities is deemed to be their carrying value as it approximates fair value. The fair value of long-term loans is the net present value of future discounted cash flows arising. The Corporation holds a freehold property classified as held for sale, which was tendered for sale in an open market as disclosed in Note 7C Assets classified as held for sale . The sale process has been administered at arm's length by an independent agent. Apart from the asset held for sale, the Corporation does not hold any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that are valued using Level 1 inputs (i.e. with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and non-interest-bearing financial liabilities (except for derivatives used for hedging) of the Corporation, are measured at amortised cost, which approximates their fair value. There have been no recurring fair value measurements transferred between the respective levels for assets and liabilities for the year to 30 June 2022. The aforementioned accounting policy is summarised for each class of asset and liability in Note 5A Fair value measurement . 161Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20225. Financial Position (continued) Measurement of right-of-use assets and accompanying liability under AASB 16 Leases Leased right-of-use assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise the initial lease liability amount and initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease, less any lease incentives received. An impairment review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right-of-use asset that is impaired. Leased right-of-use assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition in Commonwealth agency, general government sector and whole of government financial statements. Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Lease liability Refer to the commentary in Note 9B Lease liability under the same heading. 162 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20225A.

The carrying value of the impairment allowance loss is monitored against the value of debts likely to be considered at risk of being non-recoverable. At 30 June 2022, the balance of the impairment loss allowance is $145,000 (2021 $97,000). For the year to 30 June 2022, this amount was sufficient to cover outstanding debt attributable to customers at risk of non-recoverability.

Non-Financial Assets (continued) Accounting Policy Land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles The measurement basis for land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles is set out in Note 5A Fair value measurement . Asset recognition threshold Purchases of land, buildings, plant, equipment and intangibles are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Revaluation Following initial recognition at cost, ABC owned land, buildings and plant and equipment are measured at fair value (or an amount not materially different from fair value) less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary from the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The ABC commissions an independent expert valuer to complete a comprehensive valuation of land and building assets every three years. This process was completed in the year ended 30 June 2020 and will next be completed in the year ended 30 June 2023. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class, previously recognised through surplus/(deficit). Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through surplus/(deficit) except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Impairment of non-current assets The aforementioned classes of assets have been and continue to be subjected to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets as at 30 June 2022. Impairment is assessed with consideration of the asset's remaining service value. Disposals An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected.

Accounting Policy General principles Right-of-use assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise the initial lease liability amount and initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease, less any lease incentives received. Following initial recognition, an impairment review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right-of-use asset that is impaired. Right-of-use assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition in Commonwealth agency, general government sector and Whole of Government financial statements. Land The ABC's right-of-use land is measured at cost, in accordance with the requirements of the PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 .Buildings Right-of-use buildings largely consist of regional broadcasting offices and the ABC's overseas reporting bureaus. Plant and equipment Right-of-use plant and equipment comprises: a satellite transponder for digital television distribution; decoder boxes and dishes for satellite downlink services to support television transmission; transmission facility assets for digital terrestrial television transmission; transmission facility assets for terrestrial radio transmission; and vehicles. 169Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20227. Non-Financial Assets (continued) Depreciation The depreciation rates for right-of-use assets are based on the period of the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Derecognition of existing leases Leases derecognised during the period include leases that were terminated prior to the end of their lease term, as well as arrangements that have ceased to meet the relevant control test under AASB 16 Leases .

During the period the ABC's Elsternwick Victoria was derecognised as an asset held for sale, following settlement of the contract of sale in January 2022. In February 2022 the ABC entered into a contract of sale for its property at Artarmon New South Wales. The contract is due to be settled in January 2023. As required under AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , the ABC remeasured the value of the Artarmon New South Wales asset immediately before it was reclassified as held for sale and a revaluation increment of $55,219,000 was recognised. The asset was subsequently impaired by $1,274,000 based on the costs to sell. Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, identified and measured based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and digital distribution. The cost of these programs includes co-production fees, direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position. The amortisation of inventories is addressed in Note 3E Program amortisation. 170 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Write-down of inventory held for distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential, and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the value of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Write-down of retail inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as an inventory expense reduction in the period in which the reversal occurs. Impairment of prepayments No indicators of impairment were found for prepayments. 171Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20228.

At 30 June 2022, MediaHub had drawn loans under nine (2021 seven) facilities with the ANZ, with an aggregate balance of $4,535,000 (2021 $5,423,000). The ABC's share, as reflected in its Statement of Financial Position, is $2,268,000 (2021 $2,711,000). These facilities are generally repayable over five years. The facility is provided on an average variable interest rate to 30 June 2022 of 1.90% (2021 1.85%).Lease liability Note 9B Lease liability is the present value of future contractual payments, for the remaining life of the contracts. The present value of the lease liability is $505,188,000 (2021 $579,173,000). The life of the contracts includes extension options which the ABC is reasonably certain to exercise. The total cash outflow for leases for the year ended 30 June 2022 was $66,091,000 (2021 $59,376,000) The undiscounted value of future lease payments is $544,217,000 (2021 $622,966,000). The average discount rate, determined with reference to the Commonwealth Department of Finance incremental borrowing rates, issued quarterly, was approximately 1.05% (2021 1.10%). 173Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20229. Interest Bearing Liabilities (continued) Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Lease liability The valuation of the lease liability is influenced by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly basis, by the Commonwealth Department of Finance. The carrying balance of this item is reviewed regularly and an assessment is made of the potential impact of a change in discount rates on this balance upon any lease modifications or reassessments. For all new contracts entered into, the ABC considers whether the contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. Once it has been determined that a contract is, or contains a lease, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or the department's incremental borrowing rate.The corresponding asset value, as disclosed in Note 7B ABC right-of-use assets , is initially measured based on the value of the liability. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability is reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification to the lease. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or profit and loss depending on the nature of the re-assessment or modifications. 174 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 202210.

Make good provision The provision for make good includes the estimated make good cost for leased properties at the end of the lease term. The estimated cost is based on management's best estimate of the cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. The provision also includes the estimated make good cost for the Artarmon New South Wales property based on the requirement to remediate the site under the contract of sale.Building maintenance provision During the year, the ABC provided nil further amounts (2021 nil) for remediation works to replace the external cladding on the Ultimo, NSW building, to ensure compliance with the current BCA Fire Safety Standards. For the year to 30 June 2022, expenditure incurred on this project was $9,000 (2021 $3,431,000). The remaining balance of the provision, $452,000 , was reversed resulting in a nil balance at 30 June 2022 (2021 $461,000). 175Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2022People and Relationships 11. Employee Provisions Note 11 2022 $'0002021 $'000 11 Employee provisions Annual 156,747 (a) The settlement of employee leave provisions is based on the individual employee's entitlement to leave. Where an employee has a current entitlement to leave (i.e. is presently entitled to take the leave) or will have a present entitlement within 12 months, the value of that entitlement is included in the employee provisions expected to settle in no more than 12 months. Where the Corporation expects that an employee will be entitled to leave in the future but will not yet be entitled to that leave in 12 months, the value of the leave is included in the employee provision expected to settle in more than 12 months. (b) A provision is made for estimated historical salary and wages, and superannuation entitlements owed to certain employees. This estimate is based on an extrapolation of entitlements calculated for a portion of potentially affected employees and factors in risks and uncertainties associated with the settlement of the liability. The provision for superannuation also includes an amount in respect of an outstanding employer contribution to a defined benefit superannuation scheme. Accounting Policy Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period minus the fair value at the end of the reporting period of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Leave Leave liabilities are calculated based on employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The calculation is based on the anticipated length of time taken for an employee to fully settle their leave entitlement. The long service leave liability is calculated by an actuary.This amount is determined by reference to attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. This discount rate is based on the Commonwealth Government bond yield for a bond with a similar term to the liability. Redundancy A provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The ABC recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan that will result in the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the plan. Superannuation ABC employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-Commonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. 176 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance's administered schedules and notes. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee defined benefit superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions in the same manner as contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised at 30 June 2022 represents outstanding historical contributions at the end of the period. Expenses Expenses attributable to the aforementioned employee benefits and provisions are reported in Note 3A Employee benefits . Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Measurement of leave liabilities The discount rates used in valuing leave liabilities are based on Australian government bond rates with maturities that closely align with the length of the liability. The ABC regularly reviews leave liabilities and the impact of any adjustment to bond rates on these balances. Leave liabilities are also impacted by assumptions surrounding future salary inflation. The ABC regularly monitors factors that are likely to impact future salary inflation. 177Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 202212.

These items do not fall under the definition of financial instruments: Notes2022 $'0002021 $'000 Total financial assets stated in the Statement of Financial Position adjusted for:259,683 234,879 - Net GST receivable from the Australian Taxation Office 6B (6,173) (4,648) Total financial assets classified as financial instruments 253,510 230,231 Total payables and interest bearing liabilities stated in the Statement of Financial Position adjusted for:646,065 728,816 - Lease liability 9B (513,666) (579,173) - wages (including separation and redundancies) 8B (24,438) (19,319) - Trade creditor amounts payable to the ATO 8A - (5,359) - Superannuation 8B (690) (602) - Unearned revenue 8B (22,920) (22,093) financial liabilities classified as financial instruments 84,351 102,270 14B Categories of Financial Instruments (continued) Accounting Policy (continued) Financial Assets (continued) Effective Interest Method Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through surplus/(deficit). The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss or surplus/(deficit) Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit) where the financial assets: have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; are derivatives (except for derivative instruments that are designated as, and are highly effective hedging instruments); or are parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and have a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Forward exchange contracts in this category are classified as current assets. 184 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Financial assets at fair value through surplus/ (deficit) are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit). The net gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit) incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through surplus/(deficit) except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity if material in value.

These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contracts are entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 185Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 202214. Financial Instruments (continued) The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge, where material, is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in surplus/(deficit). Immaterial gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in surplus/(deficit). Amounts taken to equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit) when the hedged transaction affects the surplus/(deficit), such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit). If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to surplus/(deficit). 14C Financial Risk Management The Corporation's financial risk management policies and procedures are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Corporation, to set appropriate risk limits and controls to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a regular basis. To meet the Corporation's regular financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested in short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as other receivables .The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. Under Section 25B of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , the Corporation's Foreign Exchange Policy is conducted to reduce or eliminate risk on the Corporation's known exposures and activities and is recorded under accepted accounting standards. The Corporation's aims, by entering into foreign currency hedging arrangements, are outlined in Note 4 Own Source Income under the heading Foreign currency transactions . 14D Fair Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 30 June 2022 this was a net receivable of $58,000 (2021 receivable of $62,000). The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using Level 2 inputs based on the forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period using assumptions that are reflective of market conditions at the end of each reporting period. 186 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Loans The fair values of any long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. 14E Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, short term investments and derivative instruments. The Corporation has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of at least A as assigned by Standard & Poor's.The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of the expected credit loss provision, of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts. 14F Hedging Instruments Foreign Exchange Hedges The Corporation enters into non-speculative forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments. The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period.

Accounting Policy Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when the likelihood of settlement is greater than remote. Quantifiable and significant remote contingencies The Corporation has neither material contingent assets nor remote contingent liabilities at 30 June 2022 (2021 nil).Unquantifiable contingencies In the normal course of activities, claims for damages and other recoveries have been lodged at the date of this report against the Corporation and its staff. The Corporation has disclaimed liability and is actively defending these actions. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments which may be required or amounts that may be received in relation to any of these claims. Commitments Lease revenue and capital purchases commitments are disclosed in Note 4 Own- Source Income and Note 7 Non-Financial Assets respectively. 188 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Anna Torv and Sam Reid in the ABC's hit drama series The Newsreader. 189190 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Appendices In this section: Appendix 1 - ABC Charter and duties of the Board 192 Appendix 2 - ABC Board and board committees 193Appendix 3 - ABC organisational structure 196Appendix 4 - ABC Code of Practice (& associated standards) 197 Appendix 5 - Employee profile 208 Appendix 6 - Executive remuneration reporting 210 Appendix 7 - Television content analysis 215 Appendix 8 - Commissioned Australian content (screen) 221 Appendix 9 - Enhanced News Gathering and Regional Presence 221 Appendix 10 - Law reform 223 Appendix 11 - Population coverage terrestrial transmission 223 Appendix 12 - Television transmission channels 224 Appendix 13 - Radio transmission frequencies 229Appendix 14 - Radio Australia and ABC Australia distribution and transmission 237 Appendix 15 - ABC offices 238 ABC staff celebrating Gold Employer status at this year's LGBTQ Inclusion Awards. 191 Appendix 1 - ABC Charter and duties of the Board From the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 6 Charter of the Corporation (1) The functions of the Corporation are: (a) to provide within Australia innovative and comprehensive broadcasting services of a high standard as part of the Australian broadcasting system consisting of national, commercial and community sectors and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide: (i) broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of, the Australian community; and (ii) broadcasting programs of an educational nature; (b) to transmit to countries outside Australia broadcasting programs of news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment that will: (i) encourage awareness of Australia and an international understanding of Australian attitudes on world affairs; and (ii) enable Australian citizens living or travelling outside Australia to obtain information about Australian affairs and Australian attitudes on world affairs; and (ba) to provide digital media services; and (c) to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia.

Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under paragraph 8(1) (e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the ACMA'). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) ('the BSA') to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. The ACMA has a discretionary power to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. Section 151 of the BSA provides that the ACMA may investigate the complaint if it thinks that it is desirable to do so. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150-151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the eSafety Commissioner has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 to the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either 'prohibited content' 1 or 'age-restricted content'.2 The eSafety Commissioner is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code, which is registered as an industry code with the eSafety Commissioner under clause 85 of Schedule 7 to the BSA.The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: subsection 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act. II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic free-to-air television services. Complaints about content on the services named above fall within the scope of the Code except where: the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.1-5.8) or Privacy (Standard 6.1). 1 Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, and violence or drug use. 2 Age-restricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. 197 the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air radio or television services, unless the complaint is accepted for investigation on the grounds that is appropriate to do so, having regard to: -the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; -the seriousness of the alleged breach; -the reason(s) for the delay; -the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and -any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards Preamble The ABC belongs to the Australian people. Earning and retaining their trust is essential to fulfilling the ABC's charter and its responsibilities under the ABC Act to provide innovative and comprehensive services of a high standard to Australian and international audiences. The principles and standards set out below are the means by which the ABC seeks to meet these obligations.They uphold the fundamental journalistic principles of accuracy and impartiality, to protect the ABC's independence and integrity. They recognise that ABC content must be created in a way that is respectful towards audiences and mindful of community standards in areas like harm and offence. At the same time, they recognise that the ABC needs to be adventurous, brave and creative: Adventurous in encouraging new and sometimes confronting forms of art and entertainment. Brave in reporting without fear or favour, even when that might be uncomfortable or unpopular; and Creative in finding new ways of telling Australian stories, reflecting Australian culture and sharing in the Australian conversation. By holding to these principles and standards, the ABC seeks to be accountable to the Australian people who fund us. 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations - for accountability and for high quality - can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression. 198 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20222. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of fact-based content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all fact-based content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: the type, subject and nature of the content; the likely audience expectations of the content; the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than second-hand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong.Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory information. 3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. 199Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external content-makers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: the type, subject and nature of the content; the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; the likely audience expectations of the content; the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate.Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another. 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants 5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause. Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to respond. 200 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your own. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used by the ABC or its co-production partners to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: (a) justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or (b) consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or (c) the deception is integral to an artistic work. In all cases, the potential for harm must be taken into consideration. 6. Privacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances.7. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. This involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. It can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. However, the community recognises that what is and is not acceptable in ABC content largely depends upon the particular context, including the nature of the content, its target audience, and any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read. Applying the harm and offence standard, therefore, requires careful judgement. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content through the use of classification labels or other warnings or advice. 2017.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways - as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself.In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. V. Associated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decision-makers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. 202 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL G programs may be shown at any time. G programs, which include programs designed for pre-school and school-aged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children.The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. 203Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown in accordance with Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent.Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous.M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category - the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a strong impact, and not be gratuitous. 204 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, MA15+ programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category - the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous.Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact.In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: be infrequent, and not be prolonged, and not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown but should not be promoted or encouraged.More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. 205There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Possible reasons might include, for example, the need to schedule programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, in timeslots most suitable for their target audiences. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia but ordinarily receives the ABC's New South Wales TV services. Given the time zone difference, some programs are broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program. 7.3.5 Classification of Live Content Many live programs fall into the classification exemption categories (news, current affairs and sporting events). Some, such as live music or comedy programs, do not fall into the exemption categories and pose a particular challenge to classify accurately. The ABC makes reasonable efforts to classify these programs accurately by reviewing scripts, lyrics, outlines, and any pre-recorded material, and briefing program makers and talent as required.A failure to provide an accurate classification symbol or consumer advice prior to a live (or as-live) program will not be regarded as a breach of standards as long as reasonable efforts were made to classify it and appropriate steps are taken to mitigate any harm or offence.

Commonwealth entities are required to present remuneration for key management personnel, senior executives, and other highly paid staff, as defined in the PGPA Rule. Key management personnel Key management personnel (KMP) are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity. The Corporation determined KMP as the members of the Board, the Managing Director, Content Team Directors, and the Chief Financial Officer. Senior executives Senior executives are employees employed in a position equivalent to classification Groups 9 to 11 of the table in Schedule 1 to the Public Service Classification Rules 2000. The Corporation determined senior executives as executive directors who are not KMP (Senior Executives). Other highly paid staff Other highly paid staff are employees who are neither KMP nor senior executive and whose total remuneration paid during the year exceeded $235,000 (Other Highly Paid Staff).Total remuneration Total remuneration is defined in the PGPA rule as the sum of the following (calculated on an accrual basis): Base salary Performance pay and bonuses Other benefits and allowances Superannuation contributions (made by the employer) Long service leave Other long-term benefits Termination benefits. Executive and employee remuneration policy At the core of the ABC's approach to remuneration is a need to ensure the Corporation can realise its strategic priorities through an ability to attract and retain employees who deliver on its priorities and deliver value for audiences into the future. 210 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Remuneration principles Remuneration frameworkEquitable We ensure our remuneration approach is consistent and equitableMarket competitive We attract and retain the best talent to meet our current and future workforce needsPerformance aligned We recognise and reward for contribution to performance goals and targetsTransparent We have a transparent and disciplined approach to managing remuneration decisions and costs Fixed remuneration At risk remuneration Element Fixed remuneration comprises base salary, superannuation, and benefits.The ABC removed at risk pay as an element of remuneration for executive KMP, senior executives and other highly paid staff with effect from 1 January 2021. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal) has consented to the removal of at risk pay from the position of Managing Director (MD) from 1 June 2018. Performance Reviewed annually to reflect the experience, competence and contribution of individuals whilst remaining conservatively competitive against the market.Some other highly paid staff are eligible to receive a one-off bonus payment in lieu of a salary increase for exceptional performance in accordance with the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2019-22.

Remuneration and other terms of employment are formalised as follows: executive KMP and senior executives (executives): Individual employment agreement other highly paid staff: individual employment agreement or engaged through either the ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2016 or the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2019-22 . During the year ended 30 June 2022, ABC's Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) assisted the Board in fulfilling its governance responsibilities in relation to remuneration. Outlined below is the ABC's approach for setting, monitoring and approving remuneration policy and amounts. Note that the Managing Director's (MD) remuneration arrangements, including the MD's annual total remuneration amount, are set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal) .Non-executive director (NED) remuneration All ABC NEDs are appointed by the Commonwealth of Australia through the Shareholder Ministers. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body overseeing the remuneration of key Commonwealth offices, determines fees for all ABC NEDs. ABC is required to comply with the Tribunal's determinations and plays no role in the consideration or determination of NED fees. The Tribunal sets annual Chair, Deputy Chair and Board Member fees (exclusive of statutory superannuation contributions) which are inclusive of all activities undertaken by NEDs on behalf of the ABC (that is, inclusive of Committee participation). Statutory superannuation is paid in addition to the fees set by the Tribunal. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal determination for the relevant period set the following ABC Board fees: Chair: $178,190 Deputy Chair: $87,970 Member: $58,670 MD ARC ABC Board Recommend Executive KPIs Review and recommend to the Board Executive remuneration structures and incentive plans, policies and practices including any changes to those plans Review and approve recommendations referred by the ARC Evaluate and provide recommendations regarding remuneration structures and incentive plans for Executives, including any changes to those structures or plans Approve Executive remuneration with respect to individual remuneration arrangements, KPIs, performance assessments and remuneration outcomes Approve performance assessments and remuneration outcomes for Other Highly Paid Staff, as recommended by ABC's managers 212 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2022Key management personnel remuneration Name Position titleShort-term benefitsPost- employment benefitsOther long-term benefits Termination benefits and allowancesSuperannuation contributionsLong 1. All Executive Managers served for the full reporting period in 2022 except as follows: a. Gaven Morris served from 1 July 2021 to 3 December 2021 (resigned). b. Justin Stevens served from 4 April 2022 to 30 June 2022. 2. All Board members served for the full reporting period in 2022. Peter Tonagh was appointed Deputy Chair on 11 November 2021.3. The above key management personnel remuneration excludes the remuneration and other benefits of the Portfolio Minister. The Portfolio Minister's remuneration and other benefits are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid by the Corporation. 4. The above table is prepared on an accrual basis, including remuneration at risk which is included under bonuses. Remuneration at risk is recognised in the period in which the decision to pay the entitlement is made. Short term employee benefits also include the movement in the employees' accrued annual leave entitlements during the period. Other long-term employee benefits: Long Service Leave reflects the estimated entitlement to long service leave that was accrued during the period, calculated in accordance with the methodology explained in Note 10 Employee Provisions in the financial statements. This includes changes to the value of an employee's accrued leave entitlement that resulted from a change in their salary during the period and changes to the discount rate and other factors used to calculate the present value of the liability. 5. Remuneration of the Chair and Directors of the Board is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. In addition to the remuneration of the Chair and Directors of the Board disclosed above, the Board incurred expenses of $272,843 .. 213Senior executive remuneration Senior Executives are employees employed in a position equivalent to classification Groups 9 to 11 of the Table in schedule 1 of the Public Service Classification rules 2000.

repair and maintenance of transmitters at 77 sites across Australia. The sites were created as part of the switchover to digital television around a decade ago, and were the responsibility of RBAH. Following the failure of one of the transmitters at Eastgrove near Goulburn in New South Wales on 6 August 2020, the ABC agreed to fund the maintenance of these transmission services provided by RBAH.
