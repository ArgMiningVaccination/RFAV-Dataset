This affirmation has existed in some guise in the world's religions and perennial wisdom for thousands of years. It has also been integral to the advancement of the Sciences, including the evolution of accepted schools of thought in both academic and public circles. Consider some of the following startling ideas that form part of our reality: Despite all of our intellect and intelligence we still do not use most of our brain power, nor can we clearly articulate where conscious resides. The fact that there is scientific evidence to support a non-locality theory of consciousness means that identity could possibly shift towards something more universal in nature. Secondly, atoms are mostly made up of empty space, causing many to revisit what it means to live in a solid universe. If this can be realized in a technological sense, we might be able to explain all kinds of phenomena related to the natural world, space and the laws of physics. Thirdly, we can only perceive a small bandwidth of light which forms visible reality and the part we can decode is limited by our biology. Lastly, according to quantum theory and planetary scientists, not only is it possible for our cells to carry the particles of ancient dinosaurs, but most of the elements found in the human body were made in stars, some of which are recorded as being over one hundred times the size of our sun. Compare a concept such as this to the long-debated question, \"are we alone in the universe?\", and the grounds for its improbability shrink faster and faster by the minute. Dr. Greer moves a step up, introducing us to CE5 contact protocols that can be used to make direct contact with ETs In his documentary, Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, Dr. Greer goes far beyond the themes explored in his 2017 film, [Unacknowedged](http://livinglifefearless.co/2018/features/unacknowledged-the-pervading-myths-and-truths-of-our-non-terrestrial-encounters/), where he talked about black secret projects, the military industrial complex and its agenda, rogue shadow governments, and his 2001 National Press Club expos\u00e9 which brought to light evidence of the existence of UFOs and non-terrestrial life, supported by credible corporate and military witnesses. Dr. Greer moves a step up, introducing us to CE5 contact protocols that can be used to make direct contact with ETs without the need of an intercessor, something that has been reported and documented by thousands of witnesses all across the world. The evidence supporting the existence of extra-terrestrial civilizations is, to borrow Dr. Greer's phrasing, \"an embarrassment of riches,\" however there has been a host of suppressive countermeasures as described by the once infamous [NASA website hacker](https://www.wired.com/2006/06/ufo-hacker-tells-what-he-found/), Gary McKinnon. Only time will tell how this knowledge will change the way we think and live. Suppression of Alien Visitation and Technology Since the 1940s, the American government, including the NSA and other agencies, have systematically colluded with other powers in one of the biggest cover ups in modern history: that Earth's alien visitation by advanced civilizations is real. There is a mix of theories as to why this knowledge has been suppressed. Open questions raised in all Dr. Greer's documentaries explore the breakdown effect introducing free energy systems would have on economies and societies worldwide. Next there is the age-old conspiracy touted by Verner von Braun who claimed that advanced, reversed engineered alien technology will be used to create a hoax alien threat and usher in an interplanetary war. Another notion is that key information is hidden to dissuade people from discovering the black military projects that are funded in the billions of dollars every year. In fact, evidence supplied in the past by Dr. Greer has top officials strongly suggesting that the UFO issue was, and is, more closely guarded than nuclear secrets and at one time was considered of even greater importance that the H-bomb. According to the doctor and founder of CSETI (Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence) the suppression of technologies include zero point energy systems, anti-gravity, advanced energy propulsion systems, resource matter generators (or trans-dimensional interstellar manufacturing), electronic telepathy, and spacecraft guidance systems controlled through conscious-interfacing technology. If his claims prove to be true, it could bring deep and immediate changes to all human civilization. There is the age-old conspiracy touted by Verner von Braun who claimed that advanced, reversed engineered alien technology will be used to create a hoax alien threat One of the most arresting revelations to come out of Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind relates to a document released ten years ago by the FBI. According to ' [memorandum 6751](https://conspiracy.fandom.com/wiki/Memorandum_6751)', a declassified file created in 1947, a US government official confirms the extraterrestrial phenomenon as real, and gives information specific to their origins, mission and technological capability. In this we learn of a 'non-excarnate' off-world people with a peaceful agenda intent on settling on Earth. The document details further where the human-like visitors come from: \"They do NOT come from any \"planet\" as we use the word, but from an etheric planet which interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to us...The region from which they come is Not the \"astral plane\", but corresponds to the Lokas and Talas. Students of esoteric matters will understand these terms.\" Furthermore evidence of UFOs or identified ETVs (extraterrestrial vehicles) has allegedly broken through into mainstream media, leading the Pentagon and the U.S. Navy to admit the validity of the videos captured by their pilots. Tucker Carson had this to say on Fox News last year: \"The Navy admitted that several UFO videos are in fact real, that cannot cannot be explained, and they show aerial phenomenon that baffles everyone including people who know a lot about it.\" While some people are skeptical calling the videos evidence of some kind of secret military program, Professor Michio Kaku commented on the live news broadcast that, \"the burden of proof used to be on the believers to prove that UFOs are real. Now the burden of proof has shifted to the government and the military to prove that they are not real. But the evidence is overwhelming.\" Full Spectrum Dominance of a One-Superpower World Perhaps more alarming than withholding UFO disclosure from the public are the ideas behind why an official narrative perpetuated by world governments and mainstream media seeks to deride any truth seeker as conspiracists or citizens of kookville. Numerous revelations reveal the involvement of these global powers in 'problem-action-solution' type events' such as the US and foreign military engagements in Vietnam, South America, and the Arab Spring; denial of access to key information requested by Presidents who are supposed to be at the top of the chain of command; and the many thwarted requests submitted to both the CIA (which at one time claimed they had no such documents) and the NSA (which once refused requests by a Federal Court Judge on the basis that the information should be kept secret) for the release of UFO related documents under the Freedom of Information Act - a process which nuclear physicist and UFO researcher, Stanton T. Friedman, discovered didn't always receive full cooperation or was deliberately hindered to stop the dissemination of sensitive information. Is it because it threatens national security or do they think revealing this to the populace will endow them with too much revolutionary power? Greer reveals that we are being indoctrinated into believing that the existence of UFOs is real but they are violating airspace and present a threat to our sovereignty. He goes on to state that: \"this is the next big thing that they want the public to be afraid of.\" Curiously, the planet's most important closely guarded secret could be encouraging the world's highest governing powers to rapidly expand their dominance, a move a growing number of people consider to be an anti-progressive creep towards oppressive dictatorships and ultimately the creation of a one-world government. Constitutional Attorney, Daniel Sheehan, comments on how citizens have experienced this covert development: \"They've been raised their entire political and professional career [which] has been designed to have this kind of artificial construct: [that] there's this national airspace and nobody can come into the airspace unless we say so, and they've got this super control mechanism going and they're right at this really important place right now where they're attempting to establish a kind of one world government. You know they've gotten the communication systems up, the transportation systems up and they want to establish a planetary government. And there's nothing that is going to motivate the creation of a one world government like the discovery of an ultimate other.\" Other information produced in Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind goes on to say that one of the U.S. governments post-Cold War successes is \"the integration of the leading democracies into a U.S. - led system of collective security and the creation of a democratic 'zone of peace.'\" While it sounds like a mission of good will, conflicting statements reveal more sinister intentions over claims that the ultimate goal of the U.S. military force is for future forces to achieve global, dominant superiority: \"The United states must maintain its overseas presence forces and the ability to rapidly project power worldwide in order to achieve 'full spectrum dominance.'\" The Science of Consciousness and Making Peaceful Contact What is consciousness? Some might describe it as a state of awareness. Go deeper and it shines light on the incredible, inherent faculty of humans to perceive and examine their own wakefulness. Nobel Prize winner, Dr Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, argued that, \"[t]he total number of minds in the universe is one. In fact, consciousness is a singularity phasing within all beings.\" This understanding that we are one of many evolved forms of life (plants, animals, and stars included) that developed in such a way as to be able to contemplate ourselves, the planet, our solar system and our greater collective connection to the cosmos demonstrates an advanced ability to examine the place or role human civilization has in the universe. The very idea that we can think of our thoughts, that these thoughts are electrical signals and chemicals, and that these in turn transmit to others our personalities and allow us to decode complex information in the environment around us into meaning is an incredible psychological feat. And it is something that is shared by the extraterrestrial civilizations that have been purportedly been visiting Earth. According to Dr. Steven Greer's book, Contact: Countdown to Transformation, attaining higher states of consciousness through deep meditation is the key to establishing contact. It is the \"rosetta stone of interplanetary, extraterrestrial, interspecies communication.\" Far from it being a fictionalized imagining of First Contact with alien life, Greer argues that Contact Groups around the world (including his own) have for decades made peaceful contact with EBEs (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities) through a series of peaceful protocols he designed. This information is also supported with a declassified letter from former President, Nicolas Sarkozy, that details the success of contact established by the French government. Greer argues that Contact Groups around the world (including his own) have for decades made peaceful contact with EBEs Just imagine the empowering impact such a revelation would have were there evidence of alien visitation. And Dr. Greer reports to have plenty of it. In the documentary he arguably supplies some of the best, startling modern UFO footage and 'contact experiences' ever captured. A small volume of video evidence is supplied in the documentary and while viewers should take these clips on board with a healthy dose of skepticism (as everything unexplainable could be potentially classed as aerial phenomenon) it is worth noting that, in Stanton T. Friedman's explosive book TOP SECRET/MAJIC, Friedman discovered that professional researchers into the 'Project Blue Book Special Report 14' created in the '50s (which included over 3000 sightings, 600 of which were unexplainable) determined that the \"probability of 'unknowns' simply being missed 'knowns' was less than one percent.\" The same principle could be applied to Greer's research and encounters. However, instead of going the way of information dumping and listing even more evidence to corroborate and support his claims the doctor pushes people to break their own perceptive boundaries by creating their own Contact Teams that \"understand the technologies of the science of consciousness\" and investigate for themselves. Those with altruistic intentions will experience contact, he promises. Greer goes on to argue that the way out of the oppressive states created by Fascistic demagogues is to come together as non-violent ambassadors of universal peace to these civilizations, comparing it to the citizen diplomat efforts who established peaceful contact with the Soviet Union during the darkest days of the Cold War. It requires a social movement led by a deeply informed citizenry to generate and facilitate this change. He clarifies this further by saying: \"This entire movie is about the empowerment of people coming together to make contact... Real disclosure is humans making contact with these civilizations directly. And these civilizations are waiting for us to "}
