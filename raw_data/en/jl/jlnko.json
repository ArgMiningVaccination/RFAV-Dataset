Use real-time heart rhythm coherence biofeedback and evidence-based techniques to live a healthier, happier life. Elevate your mental and emotional wellness Learn to elevate your emotional state in the moment and become aware of and release accumulated stress so you feel better and think more clearly. Backed by 30 years of pioneering heart-brain research, the Inner Balance Coherence Plus measures and translates your heart rhythm patterns (HRV) into real-time coherence scores. This trains you to get your heart and brain in sync, which prevents and reduces stress, anxiety, and overwhelm, improves health and performance, and clears your thinking for more effective choices. With just a few minutes of daily practice, heart coherence becomes easily accessible for more balanced, effective, and healthy living. Over time, you'll be equipped with a skill set that you can apply, even without the app, in all aspects of your life. The Science Behind the Inner Balance Coherence Plus Our heart rate is always changing, creating a pattern. Heart rhythm patterns, also called heart rate variability (HRV), are a powerful window into our health and emotional wellness. Feeling Stressed When we are out of sync (stressed, frustrated, anxious, etc.), our heart rhythm patterns are jagged and chaotic. Feeling Appreciative When we are in sync (composed, easeful, grateful, etc.), our heart rhythm patterns look like smooth sine waves. We can learn to change our heart rhythm patterns to change how we feel and perform. Inner Balance Coherence Plus translates your heart rhythm patterns into a real-time coherence score that you can use to build your heart coherence. Out of sync Jagged HRV Out of sync Lower Score In sync Smooth HRV In sync Higher Score How the Inner Balance Coherence Plus Sensor Works HRV biofeedback to decode the language of your heart The Inner Balance Coherence Plus uses professional-grade photodetectors to measure your pulse wave 500 times a second. This data is then translated into highly accurate HRV, which reflects how your heart rate changes over time. HRV offers a powerful window into the quality of communication between the heart and brain, which directly impacts how we feel and perform. Our proprietary algorithm then translates your heart rate data and HRV patterns into a real-time score that updates every 5 seconds. This measurement helps you understand which thoughts, emotions, attitudes, or techniques increase or decrease your heart coherence \u2014 so you can train yourself to access this highly beneficial state.

Evidence-Based Benefits of Heart-Brain Coherence REDUCES STRESS & ANXIETY Coherence helps regulate the stress response, reducing the effects of chronic stress and anxiety on the body and mind. IMPROVES EMOTIONAL REGULATION Achieving coherence supports the ability to manage emotions effectively, promoting emotional stability and resilience in the face of challenges. ENHANCES COGNITIVE FUNCTION Coherent states are associated with improved mental clarity, focus, decision-making, creativity, and innovation. INCREASES RESILIENCE Coherence training builds resilience to stressors, helping individuals adapt and recover more quickly from challenging situations. IMPROVES PHYSICAL HEALTH Coherent states have been linked to a more efficient cardiovascular system, reduced inflammation, and enhanced hormonal balance and immune function, all of which contribute to overall health and well-being. OPTIMIZES PHYSICAL AND ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE Coherence has been shown to improve endurance, sensory-motor integration, reaction times, and access to flow states. ENHANCES PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND SELF-REGULATION Practicing coherence can lead to an increased sense of inner peace, more effective emotional self-management and lower reactivity, positively impacting psychological health. CREATE HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIPS Being in coherence helps us listen more deeply and communicate more effectively, bringing more care and kindness to our relationships.
