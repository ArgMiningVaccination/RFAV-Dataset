My daughter suffered from temporal lobe partial absence seizures from age two. Many medicines helped but none were fully effective.Based on an article on congenital defects in lipid metabolism, I had the flash insight that maybe seizures are related to an inborn ability to form just the right kinds of fatty acids in the brain- since brains are almost entirely formed by conglomerates of proteins and fatty acids.So I started my daughter on Omega-3 fish oil from Costco- two a day. From the day she started the fish oil capsules her seizures stopped.", "sitename": "Epilepsy Foundation", "date": "2005-06-16", "cleaned_text": "Community Forum Archive Possible cure for absence seizuresThu, 06/16/2005 - 20:53 [Medication Issues](https://www.epilepsy.com/connect/forum-archive/medication-issues) Comments Re: Re: Re: Possible cure for absence seizures Submitted by MASON S MOM on Thu, 2006-09-28 - 09:52 Re: Re: Possible cure for absence seizures Submitted by Cyndie Z on Thu, 2006-02-09 - 21:00 Re: Re: Possible cure for absence seizures Submitted by kelly411 on Tue, 2006-04-11 - 18:24 kelly - I have started the Submitted by akepi on Thu, 2006-09-28 - 13:26 Re: kelly - I have started the Submitted by angel_grover on Wed, 2006-10-11 - 23:43 Re: Re: kelly - I have started the Submitted by Terri N. on Sat, 2006-10-28 - 13:24 Re: Re: kelly - I have started the Submitted rocknroll on Tue, 2007-04-17 - 22:59 Re: Re: Re: Possible cure for absence seizures Submitted by liz4143 on Tue, 2006-10-03 - 18:50 Did the Omega 3 fish oil work for you?

Your 8 year old son is taking fish Omega 3 fish oil. I have a 8 year old son who suffers from absence seizure (Petit Mal). He was on Lamictal and Keppra, but Keppra made him very moody and mentally sluggish. He had behaviour issues at schools and lot of other related problems. Currently he is on Lamictal and Ethosuximide. This drug requires him to have a blood test done every month. I would like to start my son on fish oil. My question is, what is the dosage that you are giving your son and which is the brand. You have also mentioned flaxseed oil, can you please give me more details. Do you administer these fish oils in the morning? Thankyou Parent2rith This is in response to sweetpea. Your 8 year old son is taking fish Omega 3 fish oil.

Thankyou Parent2rith Re: Possible cure for absence seizures Submitted by gsastro12 on Thu, 2008-03-13 - 19:42 Dear all, Currently, I am taking 900 mg of lamictal !! I also take 160 mg of inderal (to decrease the tremors caused by lamictal). I recently completed my Ph.D. studies. It took me 8 years to complete it. Normally, students complete it within 4-5 years. I think the very high dose of lamictal that I am taking has made me mentally very sluggish. Now, I want to start working as a postdoctoral scientist. I am afraid that my employer will not tolerate things going slow and I will loose my job. I want to some how decrease the amount of lamictal to something like 200 mg so that I will be able to think faster. Can you all tell me the type, amount and brand of fish oil that works for you all? I want to take the same oil and the same amount to see whether my seizures go away. Thanks Dear all, Currently, I am taking 900 mg of lamictal !!

After reading this forum, I have started taking them. Havent seen any drastic difference in my health status, because seizures were pretty much controlled previously by taking a very high dose of lamictal. I have to start experimenting now by slowly decreasing the drug level. I think you should try to give your kid fish oil capsules, coenzyme q and the medicines she is currently taking and see whether there is any difference. lf not go to someother physician and tell him/her to prescribe a higher dose or may be try a different drug. Most important, try to create a stress free environment around her. Take care. Hi, Try fish oil from Nature Made (1200 mg/day capsules) and coenzymeQ10 from nature made (1 a day).

One of the most problematic side effects was hand tremors. The Dr. told me it is one of the side effects of sodium valproate. So I started taking lamictal only. I completely removed carbamazapine and sodium valproate. However, I still had hand tremors. So I started taking inderal (propranolol). Hand tremors are still present, but they have definitely decreased. My main problem is lamictal. I take 900 mg - that's a super high dose and it effects my thinking ability - makes me mentally sluggish. So I want to decrease it somehow. If you don't mind, can you tell me what was the dosage of valproate and other drugs your kid was taking before you halved the dosage of valproate. At what times in the day was she taking the drugs? Was it with food or without food? Is she taking fish oil at a specific time in the day or at the same time as she is being given depakote? Which brand of fish oil is she taking? Is she on a special diet? I am a vegetarian and have a high carbohydrate diet. Sorry too many questions, but I just hope the answers you give me will help me in decreasing my medicine uptake.

I have a 7 year old and we are having problems with finding the right drugs. She is having a hard time in school and she too maxes out on all the medications.

I'm a chemistry who work since 1981 in a neurological cliinic of university. Recently I had write a paper (medical Hypotheses, 2008), suggesting thaat there are not the ketons the responsable of anticonvulsant effetc of ketogenic diet, but neuropetide y (NPY). In fact NPY is stimulated by, stress, i.e. starvation, used at Biblcal time to control seizure, intestinal nutrients as fats, ketogenic diet and your omega-3, medium chain tryglicerids, an endogenous as it's showned by many studies on it. SSRIs antidepressant drugs increases intestinal serotonin, it's explain their anticonvulsant effects (Their were considered pro-convulsants, but our paper demonstred that they are anti-convulsants). Also antiepileptic drugs increase intesinal serotonin. With the aim to confirm it we had registered a food supplement (Serplus Giofarma srl, [info@giofarma.it](mailto:info@giofarma.it)) containing alpha-lacatlbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in triptophan and poor in the other large neutral amino acids competing to it to intestinal absorption and to cross blood brain barrier. The results obtained both in clinical studies and in animals allow to ALAC to enter in the screening program of NIH.
