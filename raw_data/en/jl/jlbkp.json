Apologies were noted from Dr Stephen Bergin, Dr Ms Tracey McCaig and Ms 40/22 Item 2 - Declaration of Interests 40/22.1 The Chair asked if anyone had interests to declare releva nt to any items on the agenda. Mr Clayton advised that in advance of any discussion on the terms of reference for the COVID -19 Inquiry, he should declare - | Page 2 | - an interest as he is involved in some work around this in his role in Unison. 41/22 Item 3 - Minutes of previous meeting held on 24 March 2022 41/22.1 The minutes of the Board meeting held on 24 March 2022 were APPROVED as an accurate r ecord of that meeting. 42/22 Item 4 - Matters Arising 42/22.1 42/22.2 42/22.3 42/22.4 42/22.5 The Chair noted that in relation to Action 1 on the living wage, he had asked Mr Clayton to provide more information on this which he then shared with all members. He asked Mr Clayton to explain what his query is. Mr Clayton said that he is seeking to clarify if PHA has the budgetary headroom to ensure that the real living wage is paid by organisations with which it has contracts. Mr O'Connor said that PH A is awaiting information from the Department on its budget for 2022/23 and that there should be further information on this at the next meeting. 30/22.1 Cont act Tracing Service Ms Henderson asked about the status of the Contact Tracing Service. The Chi ef Executive reported that a process is being worked through whereby staff in the Service are having face to face meetings with HR. He said that the Service will cease at the end of June and those staff in substantive roles will revert back to those roles . He advised that there will be discussions with those staff who have employment rights and those not on contracts will be released in line with HR policy. The Chief Executive advised that there is a celebration event taking place on 27 June at which the Minister and Chief Medical Officer are both due to attend and he was going to speak to the Chair about inviting representation from Non- Executive Directors. Ms Henderson asked what would happen if COVID -19 were to break out again in the autumn. The Chief Executive said that PHA is working with the Department on a contingency plan as it is important that PHA has the ability to stand up contact tracing again in some form. He added that if there is a surge in the autumn, it will be important to maintain a bank of staff. He advised that part of the plan will be to use those PHA staff who helped out previously during last summer and winter. He said that PHA is working with HR to ensure that any new staff contracts will indicate that staff will have to assist with contact tracing if required as it is important to maintain that skill set. He commented that it took up to 6 months to get the levels of Service up. Mr Clayton expressed his concern that the previous waves of cases hit earlier than anticipated and there was some criticism of the PHA response. He said he assumed that PHA will be retaining some form of contact tracing service. The Chief Executive advised that this needs to - | Page 3 | - 42/22.6 42/22.7 42/22.8 42/22.9 be worked out and he would come back with further information (Action 1 - Chief Executive) . The Chair asked what is happening in other jurisdictions and the Chief Executive replied that their Services have already been stood down. Dr Owen said Northern Ireland is behind in that regard. The Chair noted that existing staff would only need to have refresher training. 30/22.16 Vaccination Programme Ms Henderson noted the comment in the previous minutes that the PHA would run the vaccination programme at risk and asked if there were any financial resources to accompany it. The Chief Executive explained that part of that discussion related to running the Contact Tracing Service until the end of June but there are ongoing negotiations with the Department to agree the budget and the vaccination service is being flagged up as being part of the COVID -19 response. He said that Ms McCaig and her team are tracking this. The Chief Executive advised that, against Action 4, he had met with Ms June Turkington to discuss the COVID -19 Inquiry and that it was a constructive meeting. He reported that Ms Turkington is seeking to determine what sort of resource will be required to steer the region through the Inquiry, but he pointed out that there has not yet been a determination on whether there will be a local Inquiry for Northern Ireland. He said that administrative, solicitor and barrister support will be required. The Chie f Executive said that correspondence has been received from Ms La'verne Montgomery in the Department regarding a regional steering group and PHA has been asked to put forward a nomination for that group. He reported that Mr Stephen Murray will be the nomi nee. Ms Mann -Kler asked if there was an indication of a timeline, but the Chief Executive said that he has not seen one but he noted that the terms of reference have now been signed off. He undertook to check and come back to the Board (Action 2 - Chief Executive) . Ms Mann - Kler asked that the terms of reference be shared with Board members. The Chief Executive agreed to do this (Action 3 - Chief Executive) . 43/22 Item 5 - Chair's Business 43/22.1 The Chair began his Report by welcoming the receipt of correspondence from the Permanent Secretary's office regarding senior recruitment. Mr Stewart also said that it was very welcome but added that it puts greater weight on the Board and Chief Executive to ensure that recr uitment is done in a timely fashion. If it is known that individuals are going to retire, he said that the process for recruitment should commence sooner. The Chair said that PHA should ask HR for timelines. The Chief Executive said that it is welcome t hat the Permanent Secretary has given that operational responsibility back to AL Bs and it will help to accelerate - | Page 4 | - 43/22.2 43/22.3 43/22.4 43/22.5 recruitment, but only if it is a like for like replacement, and that if a post is being substantially changed there will need to be approval. Mr Stewart asked whether there is an SLA with BSO HR for recruitment timescales. Mr Wilson replied that although there is an SLA, it is quite loose in terms of KPIs. He added that in terms of job evaluation, that process is being prioritised for new jobs rather than existing ones, and that existing posts can take up to 11 months to be evaluated. Mr Stewart said that PHA should have clearly defined KPIs with BSO. The Chief Executive advised that following a meeting he had with the Chief Executive of BSO , it was agreed that it would be useful to have a joint meeting and two issues that PHA will wish to put on the agenda are HR and IT. The Chair said that he continued to have concerns about the lifetime allowance on pensions and he queried whether HSC sta ff should be exempt given the early loss of staff because of punitive taxation on high-level pensions . In regard to the need to make efforts to retain nursing staff the Chair questioned whether individuals in their 50s and 60s find working Shifts lasting 13 hours attractive. Mr Clayton agreed that shifts are an issue and flexibility is a major point and this is more affecting younger people. He added that COVID -19 has exacerbated the trend. He said that staff shortage is a major issue and there has been a discussion about strengthening the bank and aiming to reduce the reliance on agency staff. The Chair asked about 12 -hour shifts. Mr Clayton said that people can make more money doing a 12- hour shift through an agency. The Chief Executive commented that there are two sides to this argument because some nurses may prefer to do 12- hour shifts in order to get through their contracted hours more quickly. Mr Morton advised that the Chief Nursing Officer had commissioned a piece of work on recruitment and retention of nurs es and flexible working was one of the findings. He suggested that this is an issue that resonates not only in nursing. The Chair advised that there will be a discussion on anti -microbial resistance (AMR) at a future meeting as he had raised this with the Chief Executive. The Chair noted that the uptake of the third and fourth vaccines for COVID -19 vaccines has reduced by 25 and 50% in Israel and Chile. He posed the question as to whether or not PHA should seek to change the message to the public on the need for vaccination. He suggested that people may have become more relaxed since they perceive that the risk of ending up in intensive care has been greatly reduced. The Chair advised that he met with the Chair of the Food Standards Agency and that the FSA is currently under a lot of pressure as much of their time is taken up dealing with food safety issues. He noted that the Government has now reversed its decision to put a ban on junk food advertising before 9pm which may have been due to pressure fr om the industry. - | Page 5 | - 43/22.6 The Chair reported that Non -Executive Directors had met with EY this morning and it was a n extremely useful discussion. 44/22 Item 6 - Chief Executive's Business 44/22.1 44/22.2 44/22.3 The Chief Executive said that PHA continues to work on matters relating to the COVID -19 pandemic and it has now taken on responsibility for the vaccine management programme, the first part of which was the spring booster programme. He advised that PHA has engaged with SPPG, the Department and GPs in this work. In terms of management information, he reported that there has been a 60% uptake in care homes and among the over 75s through GP practices so the target of 80% by the end of May is on track. He said that a lot of work has been undertaken with GPs and community pharmacies as the uptake at one point was sitting at only 12%. The Chief Executive reported that the review of PHA is under way and EY facilitated a workshop with senior PHA and Department staff last week with a second workshop to take place next week. He added that there will be two \"Town Hall\" sessions organised for PHA staff which will be led by EY. He advised that a meeting has taken place with Trade Unions and he and Mr Robin Arbuthnot had met with the BMA earlier today. He said that there have been three Programme Board meetings and that the proposed finish date for Phase 1 has been pushed back to mid-June and that there will be a report. Wit h regard to Phase 2, he advised that a business case has been completed and he hoped it would be formally submitted within the next month. He said that the progress to date has been good and the work is on track. The Chair said that the Programme Board s hould have time for reflection rather than have the next stage formulated for them and the Chief Executive replied that, following a meeting he had with Ms Heather Stevens, it was agreed that the Programme Board would meet on its own without EY representat ives. The Chief Executive reported that the process is under way to identify \"critical friends\" for the next stage, but no approaches have yet been made. Mr Clayton asked whether there were any information on how the autumn booster programme would be res ourced and if PHA is going to be required to buy the vaccine. The Chief Executive explained that PHA will buy the vaccine but will be given the funding, and that work is ongoing with regard to other costs. Mr Clayton asked how expansive the programme wil l be or if it will be limited to over 75s. The Chief Executive said that PHA has not been advised. Dr Owen explained that the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will make the recommendations for PHA to follow. The Chief Executive advised that PHA is working on an extensive plan as previously the vaccination programme would have been delivered through Trusts so a model of delivery through community pharmacies is being explored. Dr Owen added that this will be an ongoing vaccination programme and that it may be aligned with the season al flu programme. - | Page 6 | - 44/22.4 44/22.5 44/22.6 Ms Mann -Kler asked about clarity for the longer term and if the vaccine will always be targeted for certain groups. Dr Owen said that PHA is not close to the decision making process and it is up to JCVI to decide. The Chair commented that when the Department agreed to take on the first programme, he was relieved because it was a huge undertaking. He asked if PHA needs more human resources for the vaccination programme . The Chief Execut ive said that it will, and that part will be part of the planning and the business case. He added that there will be a separate business case for the Vaccine Management System (VMS) and its development for both COVID and non- COVID vaccinations. He noted that there is perhaps a feeling in general society that the pandemic is over. The Chair said that he wished to pay tribute to all of the staff who have been working in this area for the last two years. The Chief Executive said that he had two clinical issues to update on. With regard to monkey pox, he advised that PHA is working with the Department and Trusts to ensure public safety is maintained. Secondly , he reported that there is significant work ongoing by the health protection team to l ook at the Hepatitis cases affecting children and young people. He commented that both of these are on top of dealing with COVID -19 related work so is placing additional stress on the health protection team. He said that PHA is working with UKHSA and oth er relevant agencies. The Chief Executive advised that PHA has received an overall satisfactory audit opinion for 2021/22. He reported that the audit of Board Effectiveness has come in with a limited assurance, but it was noted that over 60% of the recom mendations in it were now completed. The Chair said that there is a need to develop an action plan following that report and have regular progress updates at Board meetings. 45/22 Item 7 - Finance Report (PHA/0 1/05/22) 45/22.1 45/22.2 Mr O'Connor presented the year -end Finance Report which he said remained subject to audit scrutiny, although he added that the auditors have not raised any issues to date. He advised that PHA ended the year with an underspend of \u00a392k which is within the t arget of \u00b10.25%. He noted that this is a different position from what was reported at the end of February, but that there were some actions taken to manage the challenges that were present. He advised that there was a \u00a31.6m overspend in the COVID -19 budg et but this was managed throughout the year. Mr O'Connor highlighted the risks facing the PHA, some of which will be carried forward into 2022/23, but management will be working to address these. Moving onto the section on capital expenditure, he reporte d that there was an underspend relating to COVID -19 and ICT which was due to a reduction in the amount of money required for one element of spend. - | Page 7 | - 45/22.3 45/22.4 45/22.5 45/22.6 45/22.7 Mr O'Connor said that the summary position is a positive one and reiterated that it is subject to review. H e advised that the draft Annual Report and Accounts were submitted to the Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) and shared with Governance and Audit Committee members. In terms of the 2022/23 budget, he said that this remained unclear as there is no Execut ive, although PHA has received an indicative allocation letter, but it is a pared down allocation. He advised that Ms McCaig has been working with the Department on a set of assumptions on what can be shared with Trusts. He reported that the allocation i s \u00a3121m with \u00a32m of COVID -19 funding for up until the end of June. He said that work is currently ongoing internally to look at the budget for 2022/23, and to identify any potential slippage areas and ensuring there is a clear plan for the year ahead. He advised that the plan will be presented at the June Board meeting. Ms Henderson reported that she had contacted Ms McCaig to commend the work the Finance team had done. She noted Mr O'Connor's comments that the situation for this year is quite uncertain and she hoped that PHA does not find itself in the same position next year in terms of trying to find ways to spend its budget. She said that the organisation cannot be thinking about underspends and that this is going to be a very challenging year. She suggested that after only two months into the year there is likely to be an underspend in the management and administration budget and she did not want PHA to be using June, July and August coming up with spending ideas that align with its priorities. The Chief Executive advised that he has instigated quarter ly accountability meetings for Directors with himself and Ms McCaig so there will be more clarity around potential underspends. He added that PHA is developing a less risk -averse approach to spend earlier in the financial year and will go at risk on initiatives that are aligned with its priorities. He said that he appreciated the work that Ms McCaig's team did to help PHA achieve a break even position and he hoped that the actions he outlined will help in the future. Ms Henderson said that she felt more assured that there is now a more robust system in place. She also commended the work of the Finance team and hoped that this would not have to be repeated. She added that Non- Executives will wish to know if there are any surplus funds. The C hair fulsomely commended the work of the finance team. He said he was keen at some future date to have a list of the many benefits which accrue from the requirement to break even each year . Mr Stewart commented that the quarterly meetings will place more expectation on Directors to step up and declare any surpluses. The Chief Executive said that the information provided by the Finance team is helpful in steering the quarterly meetings. The Board noted the Finance Report. At this point Mr O'Connor left the meeting. - | Page 8 | - 46/22 Item 8 - Update on 46/22.4 46/22.5 46/22. 6 46/22. 7 Owen presented the latest data relating to COVID -19 and she noted that as P CR testing has been stood down, the information PHA has in terms of the number of daily cases there are is not useful since only a small number of the population is being tested and even then many individuals fail to report their results. She said that the ONS data, which is published every Friday, is more useful and that last week it indicated that 1 in 55 people in Northern Ireland is infected, which is the lowest rate in the UK. She advised that incidence remains at around 300 cases per day. Dr Owen showed the breakdown by age which indicated that cases are falling across all age groups. In terms of hospital admissions, she reported that these are also reducing as is the number of people in ICU and the number of deaths. Dr Owen reported that the number of outbreaks in care homes has reduced from 160 to the current level of 67. Dr Owen showed data relating to the uptake of the COVID -19 vaccine and highlighted the uptake of the booster. She said that the delivery model is different as this is being done through community pharmacies rather than through the Trusts. She reported that the uptake in care homes is 60.3% and it is 59.8% among the over 75s who received it through their GP. She added that the rate is around 29% for those over the age of 12 who are immuno- suppressed, but is at 2.5% for children in the 5- 11 age group. She advised that planning is ongoing for the autumn booster programme but PHA is awaiting the JCVI recommendation. She said she hoped that the booster programme would be completed by the end of May. In summary Dr Owen said that cases, hospital admissions and death s are decreasing as is the number of outbreaks in nursing homes, and that work is continuing with the rollout of the booster programme and the de - escalation of the Contact Tracing Service. Mr Clayton noted that at the meeting in March there had just been an announcement about testing in care homes ending and he asked if there was a n end date. Dr Owen advised that the testing was not ending, but it would be less frequent. Mr Clayton said that the vaccination uptake in the 5- 11 age group is extremely low and he asked if there has been any reflection on how it is being delivered. He suggested that if it was being delivered through schools i t may be higher, but it is through a Trust portal. Dr Owen agreed that normally vaccination programmes for children are delivered through schools. She pointed out that when the vaccine was introduced the country was over the peak in terms of case numbers so parents perhaps felt the vaccine wasn't needed. She added that at the - | Page 9 | - 46/22. 8 beginning children weren't being offered vaccines as prevalence was lower and the risk was small but as the case numbers increased it was decided to offer it. She said that there i s learning in terms of how it is delivered going forward. Mr Clayton commented that it is not a topic of conversation among parents and he asked what the plans are for the autumn programme. Mr Wilson advised that from a communications point of view, any messaging will focus on three groups - the over 75s, pregnant women and those who are immuno- suppressed. Ms Mann -Kler noted that in China there is another lockdown and asked if there was any intelligence from that. Dr Owen said that she did not know the detail, but from her understanding, it seemed that the vaccines developed in China were not as effective as in other parts and there was a low uptake among the elderly population. 47/22 Item 9 - Update from Chair of Governance and Audit Committee (PHA/0 2/05/22) 47/22.1 47/22.2 47/22.3 Mr Stewart began his update by informing members that the Governance and Audit Committee (GAC) now has a full complement of members with Mr Irvine having joined. He said that all members took their role on the Committee seriously. He advised that at the last meeting of the Committee, which took place on 15 April, there was a lengthy agenda, mainly dealing with procedural matters. Mr Stewart reported that the Committee had approved the Internal Audit plan for the year which consists of five audits, the first of which is the financial review audit. He said that the second audit relates to the management of screen ing programmes, an area that members have been discussing for some time as there are matters relating to the IT systems that support these programmes. He added that there will be an audit on emergency planning. He advised that the final audits are in the areas of performance management and risk management. He commented that the performance management audit will be a follow up to the audit that received a limited assurance last year and will look at the new processes that have been put in place. He added that there are some issues around risk management concerning SBNI and that there needs to be clarity on PHA's relationship with SBNI. In total, he advised that the audit programme will cover 104 days. Mr Stewart advised that the Committee had considered the latest Corporate Risk Register and that a new risk has been added around the awarding of Direct Award Contracts (DACs) and whether these are reviewed before contracts are due to expire. He noted that this is a risk that the Chief Executive requested be added to the Register. He advised that a risk has been removed regarding the ability of third party providers being able to deliver commissioned services. He added that there was a proposal to review a risk relating to staff resilience but the Committ ee felt that this risk needed to be re- drafted to note that while progress has been made, some issues still remain. - | Page 10 | - 47/22.4 47/22.5 47/22.6 47/22.7 47/22.8 47/22.9 Mr Stewart said that a report was received on progress against the implementation of outstanding audit recommendations and that this is sitting at 78% which he said requires further action from Executive Directors. He noted that Ms McCaig had also raised concerns about this, but he pointed out that some of the actions are not solely for PHA and added that he has always had a concern that audit recommendations should only be those for which PHA has full oversight. Mr Stewart reported that an update was received on two suspected fraud cases, but both were given a clean bill of health. He added that the Committee had also considered the Nur sing directorate risk register, and although it has been reviewed and revised, it remains a work in progress. He said that the Corporate Risk Register was due to be presented at today's meeting but will be brought to the next meeting and he asked that all Non-Executives give it their full scrutiny as it is not the Committee's Risk Register but belongs , and is the responsibility of, the whole Board. The Chair asked about the fraud cases and queried that if PHA provides funding for a third party, does it have responsibility for where that funding goes. Mr Stewart explained that in the two cases, either the suspected fraud was not in an area which directly related to PHA funding, or there was no fraud found . The Chief Executive echoed the view that the Corporate Risk Register belongs to all members and there is a responsibility to ensure that it is properly managed and any risks identified are proactively dealt with. Ms Henderson said that the she looked forward to receiving the Register and noted that the main risks appear to be in the areas of staff, staff training and IT issues. She commented that these are major areas of risk but she hoped that during this year there will be some movement on those. The Chair conveyed thank s to Mr Stewart, Ms Mann -Kler, Mr Clayton and Mr Irvine for the very extensive work which they undertake as member of the Governance and Audit Committee. The Board noted the Governance and Audit Committee update. 48/22 Item 10 - Update from Chair of Remuneration Committee 48/22.1 48/22.2 The Chair advised that the Remuneration committee had met on 7 March and that one issue which remains unresolved is the ongoing legal case against PHA. He advised that he has asked for a further update from BSO HR officials on this. The Chair noted that the Board has not yet received feedback on the Culture Assessment Survey. While he said he was aware that Mr Arbuthnot has set up a working group, he would like feedback at the next Board meeting (Action 4 - Chief Executive) . - | Page 11 | - 49/22 Item 11 - PHA Business Plan 2022/23 (PHA/0 3/05/22) 49/22.1 49/22.2 49/22.3 49/22.4 Mr Wilson advised that members had seen the draft PHA Business Plan for 2022/23 at a workshop and that this Plan has gone through several iterations. He said that the structure of the Plan has changed whereby it now captures a small number of high priorit y actions broken down into five thematic areas with agreed KPIs, and alongside this sits a more detailed action plan which contains other priorities the organisation will be taking forward. He added that individual directorate plans have been compiled as part of the new performance management approach. He said that this Plan is being brought to the Board for approval. Mr Clayton said that he believed this revised approach of picking out the key corporate priorities is the right one and is in line with th e recommendations made by Internal Audit. He added that he would also like to see the action plan. He commented that the narrative at the start of the Plan is useful as it outlines that this Plan is not the totality of PHA's work. In terms of managing t he COVID -19 response, he noted that the Plan highlights some of the key actions, but he asked what success would look like, for example what target is being set in terms of the autumn booster programme. In the second section on population health, he said that he was not clear as to what PHA is doing apart from developing an action plan, and he asked what the priorities are for the action plan. He noted that there has been a discussion around a refresh of Making Life Better. He noted the action plan aroun d screening, and said that this may link with the report being presented later in the meeting. He agreed that it was legitimate that PHA is looking at staff absence, but he asked why the target is 2.56%. He said he welcomed the format of the Plan and tha t it is more accessible. Mr Wilson replied that many of the comments raised will be picked up within the action plan. He took on board the feedback regarding the presentation of the Plan and said that this could be reviewed but commented that the approac h was to make the Plan as succinct as possible. Mr Clayton said that this would be welcome, particularly with regard to the KPIs. The Chief Executive said that PHA's Business Plan processes are still evolving and based on previous discussion about the need to have a more succinct approach, it was agreed not to have more than 10 KPIs and that there were would be further detail in the directorate business plans which would be subject to quarterly review and any matters being flagged as \"red\" or \"amber\" reported to the Board by exception. In terms of a target for the spring booster programme, he advised when the Plan was being drafted PHA did not have a target. He added that in the autumn there will be a review of the Plan and there is a KPI in terms of the delivery of the Plan. He said that he wishes to work with the Board as this process evolves. Mr Clayton commented that if the Plan is being reviewed every quarter, targets need to be clear as the year goes on. Ms Mann -Kler said that she welcomed the br eadth of thematic areas in the P lan but sought clarity on how the KPIs and progress will be - | Page 12 | - 49/22.5 49/22.6 49/22.7 49/22.8 49/22.9 reported. She asked if there are plans to reorganise all the KPIs under each thematic area. For next year's Plan, she asked if it will be possible to have it signed off by March 2023. Mr Wilson commented that across the HSC, Business Plans tend to be signed off late, but as PHA is driving this process and the process is evolving, he hoped in future to have the Plan completed sooner, and to have the Board involved in that. In terms of reporting, he said that there will be quarterly reporting and as part of PHA's approach, the KPIs will be packaged together and he reiterated that there will be reporting by exception on matters within the directorate plans. The Chai r asked if there are any impediments to bringing the Plan to the Board earlier. Mr Wilson said that there are not as the Business Plan is a live document. Mr Stewart reminded members that Internal Audit will be carrying out a follow up audit on performance management as this area was given a limited level of assurance so there is a need to strengthen performance reporting. Professor Rooney said that she welcomed this Plan as it now represents an opportunity to receive information by function r ather than by professional area. She queried whether there was a way the quarterly reports could be presented more easily without being lengthy e.g. through the use of PageTiger. Mr Morton advised that going into 2023/24 there will be a change in the framework to r eflect the new planning model, and that there are plans to design a single planning approach that will affect all HSC bodies, including PHA. From a PHA perspective, he said that it will look at areas such as improving access to healthcare, health protecti on and health improvement. Ms Henderson agreed with the approach used in this Plan, but said that some areas feel a bit vague and still need to be worked through. She said that if she was reading this as an outsider, she can see what PHA aims to do, but she asked what failure would look like. She suggested that failure may be not developing a workforce plan by the end October, which could then result in not being able to deliver a 24/7 health protection response. She commented that the Plan helps PHA understand its business more. Mr Wilson thanked members for their comments and said that he would take those away and look at how the Plan is presented. He added that the aim for today was to bring the outline to ensure that members were content. Ms Henderson advised that she would like to see the KPIs relating to the new Integrated Care System (ICS) model before they are signed off by PHA. The Chief Executive commended the efforts of Mr Wilson's team in bringing this new approach, which he said is s till evolving. He said that PHA has begun to develop dashboards and suggested bringing some of those to a future meeting. In terms of the ICS model, he said that Ms Martina Moore was due to attend today's meeting, but that has been - | Page 13 | - 49/22.10 deferred to a future m eeting. He added that PHA will have an involvement in population health planning. Ms Mann- Kler said that it would be helpful to have a one page visual on this work. The Chief Executive advised that it will take 12/18 months to get this work in place. Mr Whittle explained that at present, the ICS model is not yet established and the Local Commissioning Groups will be in place for at least the next six months, but perhaps for longer due to the situation with the Assembly. Ms Henderson said that even if t he update is delayed, she would like to get an overview of the five key public health areas. The Chief Executive advised that each area may have its own priorities, but there may be one overarching regional plan. He added that as this work is developing, he and Ms Sharon Gallagher have agreed that there will be monthly PHA/SPPG senior team meetings to help develop these processes and to ensur e that there is joint development on the key priority areas. The Chair asked if there is an opportunity to influence the content and membership of the ICSs. Mr Morton advised that there is a Framework Document that outlines the role of the ICSs, and it also sets out the roles and responsibilities of PHA. The Board APPROVED the PHA Business Plan for 2022/23. 50/22 Item 1 2 - Performance Management Report (PHA/04/05/22) 50/22.1 50/22.2 50/22.3 50/22.4 50/22.5 Mr Wilson said that this Report is the final update on progress against objectives from the 2021/22 PHA Business Plan. He added that he had taken on board the feedback from the previous report. Mr Wilson advised that of the 53 actions, none were rated \"red\" and nine were rated \"amber\". He explained that these actions would be completed but with a slig ht delay. He said that the remaining 44 were rated \"green\". He added that three actions had moved from \"amber\" to \"green\" and one action from \"green\" to \"amber\". He said that the actions rated \"amber\" have been grouped together at the start of the repor t. Mr Morton commented that while actions may be rated \"amber\", there has been substantial action. He gave the example of an action in his area where \u00a320m of funding was only allocated in October to recruit posts and although 90% of staff have now been a ppointed, the action was not complete, so he felt this context was important. The Chair suggested that instead of using the wording \"slight delay\", there should be a revised date. Mr Wilson pointed out that this is the extant reporting approach and will be changed. Ms Henderson asked about the Homeless Inclusion Service and how achievable that action is. Mr Morton advised that there is a well - established homeless hub in Belfast which is seen as an exemplar across the region, but it has not been possible to replicate it on that scale. He said that he and Mr Whittle are working to develop a health and wellbeing framework but additional investment is required. He - | Page 14 | - 50/22.6 50/22.7 50/22.8 advised that a meeting took place earlier in the week about mental health and there is a need to start to link various pieces of work in that area. He declared an interest in that he is a Board member of the Simon Community. Ms Mann -Kler noted that this is the Report as at 31 March 2022 and asked if there is any way of tightening the timescales. The Chief Executive noted that there was no meeting in April as the workshop had taken place, but there will be quarterly reporting going forward. Professor Rooney asked about information about impact. Mr Wilson said that going forward there will be an increased focus on outcomes. The Board noted the Performance Management Report. 51/22 Item 1 3 - Update on Population Screening Programmes (PHA/05/05/22) 51/22.1 51/22.2 51/22.3 51/22.4 Dr Owen said that this update is to give members an overview of screening programmes, to highlight the impact of COVID -19 on those programmes, give an overview of ongoing work PHA is doing and conclude with some horizon scanning. Dr Owen advised that PHA' s role in screening is not to deliver the programmes but to commission and quality assure them. She added that the population screening programmes are advised by the National Screening Committee and PHA is key in supporting their implementation. She said that there are currently eight programmes which are co- ordinated by a small team in PHA. In Mar ch 2020, she reported that all five adult programmes were paused due to the pandemic. She said that patients had stopped coming or had cancelled appointments, and staff were being redeployed so a Ministerial decision was made to pause the programmes. However, she said that the programmes for children continued as they are time critical . She added that breast screening continued for higher risk cases and diabetic eye screening continued for pregnant women. At different times during the summer and autumn of 2020 she said the programmes commenced again but each faced its own challenges in terms of recovery and she highlighted some of these. She commented that w hen trying to get the programme s back on track, it is important to maintain the same quality and standard. Dr Owen gave an overview of the quality assurance activities, most of which she said continued during COVID -19. She said that where site visits wer e not possible, desktop peer review exercises were conducted instead. Dr Owen advised that PHA is involved in a number of large change projects, including modelling work and a project around replacing mammography equipment and IT equipment. - | Page 15 | - 51/22.5 51/22.6 51/22. 7 51/22. 8 51/22. 9 Dr Owen said t hat it is important that individuals have access to information to make an informed choice about screening as it has been recognised that screening can do harm. She advised that PHA works with the Women's Resource and Development Agency (WRDA) to help to encourage uptake among those less likely to participate. She added that during the pandemic these sessions moved online. In terms of horizon scanning, Dr Owen outlined how the National Screening Committee has recently changed its remit. She advised that it is currently consulting on screening for lung cancer. She added that it is also looking at the use of Artificial Int elligence and self -reporting. She commented that screening programmes have mushroomed in the last 10 years. Mr Clayton thanked Dr Owen for the update which he said was comprehensive. He noted that there is a different approach to address the backlog with regard to cervical screening and he assumed that part of the assessment is that screening could do more harm than good. He asked if the proposal to catch up through the normal screening run is in line with national standards. Dr Owen advised that the recommendation is to invite women every five years, or three years for younger women, but no recommendation has been made following COVI D-19. She said that in Northern Ireland there is closer working with the service so there is an awareness that at present there no capacity for GP services to do this as there are issues for people being able to access their GP. She added that the situat ion has been compounded by the pressures currently being faced by laboratories due to staff being redeployed or having retired. She said that services have struggled, hence this backlog has built up. She explained that cervical screenings pick up a very small number of changes , but changes that may turn into cancer are the issue. However, she said that a delay may not make a significant difference in the long term, but she recognised that it is an issue. Mr Clayton asked if COVID -19 has exacerbated inequalities with regard to screening programmes. Dr Owen advised that uptake rates have not changed and that when people are invited for screening, they do attend. Ms Mann -Kler asked whether any consideration has been given to screening for lung cancer given numbers have remained relatively constant. The Chair asked whether illnesses that can't be cured are screened. Dr Owen explained that the National Screening Centre uses an evidence- based approach and every three years it puts out a call for any new conditions that should be screened. She added that it is a very structured process and that there is a number of criteria that has to be met, for example there needs to be an obvious screening test that can identified and there has to be a cost effectiv e treatment available. She advised that there is a website which contains information on this. She noted that there needs to be clarity in the difference between screening and testing. - | Page 16 | - 51/22.1 0 51/22.1 1 The Chair thanked Dr Owen for her comprehensive report and recorded that the Board greatly appreciated the information which she had provided. The Board noted the update on Screening Programmes. 52/22 Item 14 - Annual Report on the Specialist Training Programme in Public Health (PHA/06/05/22) 52/22.1 52/22.2 52/22.3 52/22.4 52/22.5 For this item Ms Mann -Kler declared an interest in her role as a lay member for the General Medical Council. Dr Owen advised that PHA is required by the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency (NIMDTA) to produce this Annual Report. She explained that PHA is the lead employer and training provider for public health and dental public health practitioners and at present there are 12 specialist registrars, doing the public health and dental public health training programmes. She added that this is the first year there has been a dental registrant. Dr Owen said that last year, each of the other UK nations introduced multi- disciplinary training and in April last year PHA took on its first non- medical multi -disciplinary trainee, and there are now 4 on the programme which she said brings a new dynamic. She advised that the Hussey Review had identified a need to train specialist registrars and there is presently a workforce review of public health specialists which may inform the future number of trainees. Dr Owen advised that the programme is run over five years and during the first year entrants undertake a Masters and then they come to PHA, although they may have other attachments elsewhere. She said that there is now a move to the UK recruitment process. She reported that NIMDTA will be taking ove r from PHA as the lead employer for junior doctors and medical public health trainees, but PHA will retain responsibility for multi -disciplinary staff and those on Agenda for Change terms and conditions. The Chair said that he is keen that non- medical individual apply for these programmes and he sought clarity on who would be their employer. Dr Owen confirmed that it would be PHA. Dr Owen noted that an issue had been raised about pay parity for out of hours work as there are different terms and conditions for medical and non- medical staff, but she said that the issue will shortly be resolved. As part of the quality assurance of the programme, Dr Owen explained that PHA has an annual meeting with NIMDTA. She added that the GMC undertakes an annual survey of trainers and trainees, and this year's survey highlighted some concerns, many of which related to COVID -19, for example remote working, so work is ongoing to address these. She added that trainees will be working for specific teams. She hoped that the next survey will be more positive. - | Page 17 | - 52/22.6 52/22.7 52/22.8 52/22.9 52/22.10 52/22.11 Dr Owen advised that going forward, the next update will be presented to the Board in 12 months' time. Mr Morton said that although this report talks about consultants, there are also nursing staff going through an NM C process and through the Nursing and Midwifery Taskforce, there is an aim to get more public health nursing consultants to promote a public health nursing approach. He said that there would be public health practitioners in district nursing. The Chair asked what level these staff would be, and Mr Morton advised they would be at 8d level. Mr Morton added that there is a requirement to develop a new public health nursing framework to complement the public health agenda in Northern Ireland. Mr Irvine said that he had two queries, the first of which related to the module in the Masters programme and if these included business management and performance management. He also asked if there is a clear pathway for graduates coming through this programme to prog ress in the organisation. Dr Owen advised all those who come through the programme are eligible to apply for public health consultant posts. Mr Irvine said with regard to individuals who have a specific medical background, there is a need to have experti se in that area, but these individuals should also have skills in performance management and financial management to allow them to progress beyond a narrow specific delivery role. He added that it is about them not only doing their jobs but ensuring that other individuals are satisfactorily doing their jobs and are able to manage that accountability. He said that he did not have an understanding from this paper. He added that in any other organisation there is a requirement to have all the required areas of competency in an appropriate subject. Dr Owen said that she could verify what is on the Masters programme, but she pointed out that this is a training programme, individuals have a study budget and can dip into training and that individuals must carry out up to 56 hours of CPD annually. Mr Irvine said that he would like to see a requirement that additional qualifications are obtained in order to gain additional competencies. The Chief Executive advised that this type of proposal has been mooted befor e but has never progressed. He added that it was something the IHM wanted to put in place but that organisation no longer exists. He said that many HSC staff will do Masters courses but for senior management posts there is no specific qualification requi red, and that all applicants have fair access to employment opportunities. He cited the example of the regional procurement training scheme which looks at how many senior managers are required and then trains that required number, but it is the only schem e with that type of approach. Mr Dawson commented that the biggest issue for the HSC is that once trainees are qualified, they can apply for posts anywhere and many doctors move abroad once they have their F2 qualification. He said that - | Page 18 | - 52/22.12 52/22.13 52/22.14 the HSC is not go od at managing its investment. He advised that when he was a trainee he was obligated to work in the HSC for three years after completing his training scheme, but there were no guarantees of jobs. He suggested that this as PHA develops its HR plans, it c an look at how it can create opportunities for which people can apply. Mr Irvine commented that skills are transferrable and nothing should be left to chance and that people should be given an opportunity to use their skills. Professor Rooney asked what Agenda for Change banding a public health consultant would be, and Mr Morton replied they would be at 8d level. Professor Rooney commented that the lack of psychologists in the organisation had already been noted as a gap on many occasions, when looking at areas such as behav ioural change and mental health. She said that opening public health consultant posts to psychologists could be an opportunity to fill that gap. The Chair asked at which level individuals are recruited into PHA. The Chief Executive advised that throughout the HSC there are many graduate training schemes, for example the general management training scheme, as well as schemes in finance and HR which are all managed through the Leadership Centre. He added that PHA recruits staff at all levels from Band 2 to consultant nurses. He noted that while PHA does not employ psychologist roles, there are staff with psychology backgrounds. The Chair asked about recruitment below graduate level. The Chief Executive advised that there is an inter n scheme and recently interns with PHA have secured permanent employment. Mr Morton said that it is important to recognise that staff are well trained and have some form of leadership training. He added that coaching and mentoring also take place. The B oard noted the Annual Report on Specialist Training programmes. 53/22 Item 15 - Any Other Business 53/22.1 With there being no other business, the Chair drew the meeting to a close. 54/22 Item 16 - Details of Next Meeting Wednesday 16 June 2022 at 2:00pm Stormont Hotel, Belfast Signed by Chair: Date: - | Page 1 | - minutes Title of Meeting Meeting of the Public Health Agency Governance and Audit Committee Date 11 April 2022 at 10am Venue Fifth Floor Meeting Room, 12/22 Linenhall Street, Belfast Present Mr Joseph Stewart Mr John Patrick Clayton Mr Robert Irvine Ms Deepa Mann- Kler - - - - Chair Non-Executive Director (via video link) Non-Executive Director (via video link) Non-Executive Director (via video link) In Attendance Mr Stephen Wilson Mr Stephen Murray Ms Tracey McCaig Mr David Charles Mrs Catherine McKeown Mr Roger McCance Mr Robert Graham - - - - - - - Interim Director of Operations Interim Assistant Director of Planning and Business Services Interim Director of Finance, SPPG (via video link) Internal Audit, BSO (via video link) Internal Audit, BSO(via video link) NIAO (via video link) Secretariat Apologies None 12/22 Item 1 - Welcome and Apologies 12/22.1 Mr Stewart welcomed everyone to the meeting. There were no apologies. 13/22 Item 2 - Declaration of Interests 13/22.1 Mr Stewart asked if anyone had interests to declare relevant to any items on the agenda. No interests were declared. 14/22 Item 3 - Minutes of previous meeting held on 27 January 2022 14/22.1 The minutes of the previous meeting, held on 27 January 2022 were approved as an accurate record of that meeting. - | Page 2 | - 15/22 Item 4 - Matters Arising 15/22.1 15/22.2 15/22.3 15/22.4 15/22.5 Mr Stewart said that with regard to Action 1, on the recruitment of vaccinators, the Chair was due to speak to the Head of Legal Services regarding this matter. Mr Stewart noted that with regard to Action 3 on the closure of HSCB, Ms Marti na Moore is attending the PHA Board meeting on 19 May. Ms McCaig advised that she would give members an update on Action 6, regarding the data matching exercise, later in the meeting as part of the Fraud Liaison Officer Update Report under Item 8. Mr Wilson reported that under Action 4, the rationale for downgrading the risk with regarding to Lifeline was because a Direct Award Contract (DAC) has been put in place for the information management system. 9/22.10 Anti-Fraud and Anti -Bribery Policy and Response Plan Mr Stewart confirmed that Ms McCaig had shared with him the revised Plan following comments at the last meeting and he had approved it. 16/22 Item 6 - Internal Audit 16/22.1 16/22.2 16/22..3 Mr Rodney Morton joined the meeting for this item and the next item. Internal Audit Progress Report [GAC/ 07/04/22] Mr Stewart thanked Mr Morton for coming off his annual leave to join this morning's meeting to discuss the Internal Audit report on Serious Adverse Incidents (SAIs), and the nursing directorate risk register. He invited Mrs McKeown to first of all give members an overview of the SAI audit report. Mrs McKeown reported that a limited level of assurance was being provided for the SAI process, although she recognised that action has been taken through t he development of a Joint Improvement Plan which has resulted in some improvements. In terms of the findings of the audit, she advised that there needs to be more formality in the relationship between PHA and SPPG (Strategic Planning and Performance Group) and a need to update the relevant circulars. Secondly, with regard to the dissemination of learning, she said that there have been delays in this work due to the redeployment of staff in PHA with delays ranging from 178 days to 626 days. She cited instances where learning letters had been retracted, but not re- issued, and where learning matters articles had not been published. Mrs McKeown said that a number of professional group meetings had been cancelled, but there was a contingency arrangement in pl ace. She advised that while learning from SAIs did feature in the Annual Quality - | Page 3 | - 16/22.4 16/22.5 16/22.6 16/22.7 Report, this did not give a sense of the number of letters outstanding. She added that the last detailed report on SAIs was presented to the PHA Board in 2015. She noted that a Joint Improvement Plan has been produced and that 4 of the actions have been fully implemented. She said that management have accepted all of the recommendations. Mr Stewart commented that there is a fundamental issue in terms of PHA's role, in that it is not obvious why PHA is involved in this process given it has no powers of enforcement. He suggested that this area should be included as part of the review of PHA. He added that the range of what is determined as SAIs is very wide, and queried how many actually relate to clinical issues. He said that while he welcomed the report, it raised more questions than it answered. Ms Mann -Kler agreed saying that she does not understand the current split in terms of the governance arrangements and there is a lot of risk. She said that she is not sure if this split is normal and queried whether there is now an opportunity to have a proper review of this given the establishment of SPPG. She noted the reference to Board oversight as this has been a particular issue for PHA Non- Executives. She said that as PHA has a role in terms of learning, best practice and improvement, she looked forward to receiving more reports on this at Board level. She said that capturing the learning early will help in the context of any Inquiries. Ms Mann -Kler said that the pandemic challenged organisations to make significant decisions at a fast pace and it wasn't possible for the Board to be across every element and now that the implications of some of those decisions are coming out, she queried if there are any issues that the Board does not know about or have oversight of, and if t his should link with the Internal Audit plan. Mr Clayton commented that this report gives food for thought and he thanked Mr Morton for the report on the actions taken to date. He said that there is a fundamental issue about the role of PHA in the SAI process as it appears that PHA does a lot of the legwork, but it is not clear what HSCB did, and perhaps now that HSCB has closed, there is an opportunity to look at this as it appears to be unbalanced and given the impact of COVID -19, he said he was not surprised to see that there is a backlog. He asked whether PHA has the workforce to be able to support this work and he queried whether this should be placed on the Corporate Risk Register in order to give it more oversight at Board level. He added that there may now be a situation where there are more SAIs as a result of COVID -19. He agreed with Ms Mann- Kler's view that following the closure of HSCB, this area is now an issue and should be considered as part of PHA's Internal Audit plan. He asked whether there needs to be a focus on this from a workplace planning perspective. He asked who is leading this work in SPPG and what PHA's role will be going forward. He felt that previously it seemed that HSCB's role was to hold PHA to account. - | Page 4 | - 16/22.8 16/22.9 16/22.10 16/22.11 Mr Morton thanked Mrs McKeown and Mr Charles for their work on this audit. He said that at the time of the audit, it was a period of transition with the Joint Improv ement Plan being developed and he surmised that if the audit were to be re- done now, it would have a different outcome given the work that he and Mrs Lisa McWilliams have initiated. He explained that in his role he inherited the responsibility for support ing the PHA response to SAIs and this is co- joined with HSCB as outlined in the Circular. He advised that HSCB has the primary responsibility for ensuring that performance in relation to SAIs is discharged in line with the Circular and PHA has a pivotal r ole in disseminating the learning. He noted that not every SAI involves clinical guidelines, but it would involve professional guidelines. He added that PHA and SPPG have a joint responsibility and it is not up to SPPG to hold PHA to account, but where t here is a partnership there needs to be an escalation protocol so that any matter can be escalated to the Chief Executive or Board. He advised that a Partnership Agreement is going to be developed to deal with the governance arrangements. He added that h e did not disagree with the view that this is an area that should be looked at as part of the review of PHA. Mr Morton noted that within PHA, HSCQI has a role in terms of quality and it is important that safety and quality are not separated into silos, so he and Mrs McWilliams are aiming to strengthen integrated working, hence there is now a Directors' Forum to look at safety and quality. He added that there will be a Safety Framework developed which will look to triangulate data from areas such as SAIs, complaints, untoward incidents and claims. He advised that the Framework will look at the detection of issues and the development of improvement plans and it will assure the Board and the public that the HSC is a learning system. He said he hoped to bring the Framework to the Board for consideration shortly. Mr Morton advised that PHA is awaiting the RQIA review of SAIs and SAI management as it will make a series of recommendations that will inform the role of PHA and SPPG. He added that following the I HRD review, there was a series of recommendations about SAI s and the citizen experience of SAIs. Given PHA's role in PPI and Patient and Client Experience, he said that it has been heavily involved in work to support citizens who have had an adverse healthcare experience and this is being done in conjunction with the Patient Client Council. Mr Morton said that the Partnership Agreement will address some of the key findings from the audit and then the review of PHA and the RQIA review will also influence it. He added that a biannual report will come to the Agency Management Team (AMT ) and the Board about PHA's performance in safety and quality and the SAI process. He agreed with the comment about capacity issues and noted that one area that PHA struggled in was in relation to maternity and paediatrics. He advised that there has been an appointment made for a paediatric nurse consultant and although that is a positive step, it does not fully resolve - | Page 5 | - 16/22.12 16/22.13 16/22.14 the problem. He explained that the volume of SAIs is continuing to increase which is putting more demand on healthcare staff to deal with SAIs. He said that is an area that is being kept under surveillance, and that he and Mrs McWilliams have put in strict parameters around the monitoring of SAIs. Mr Morton advised that all immediate learning is issued to the system, and the delays are largely reminders of best practice. Over recent weeks, he said that there has been an effort to clear the backlog and this is on target to be achieved and the aim is that going forward under the new system, there will not be a backlog. Ms Mann -Kler thanked Mr Morton for his comments which she said were very helpful. She asked about the extent to which the number of SAIs is increasing that is reflective of the pressure on the system as a whole. She said that Mr Morton had alerted members to the challenge about staff time and felt that if this situation continues, it will escalate further. Mr Morton said that one of the reasons for establishing the Directors' Forum is to look at the system's ability to deal with this work . He explained that if a Trust flags up an issue, these issues are being logged and passed onto colleagues in Commissioning. He said that there is a need to ensure that issues are identified and appropriately raised. He advised that capacity does create a challenge when it comes to safety as there has been a number of SAIs, for example, delays in individuals awaiting a cancer diagnosis, and this is unfortunately a reality of the pandemic. Mr Stewart said that what has been put in place seems a satisfactory interim solution, but he felt that this is a complex area and PHA needs to be sure as to what its statutory responsibilities are. He said that the Board will be very interested in seeing this report and the comprehensive response provided to the findings. Mr Morton noted that last year he had prepared a paper outlining PHA's role in the SAI process and he undertook to review that paper and include some commentary based on this audit to i nform the discussion at a Board meeting (Action 1 - Mr Morton). 17/22 Item 7 - Corporate Governance 17/22.1 17/22.2 Nursing Directorate Risk Register as at 31 March 2022 [GAC/ 11/04/22] Mr Stewart asked Mr Morton if there were any particular issues he wished to highlight from the nursing directorate risk register. Mr Morton said that there were 3 key issues he wished to update on, the first of which related to strengthening capacity within his directorate by filling vacant posts. He advised that there is a recovery plan in place and that where 6 months ago there were up to 13/14 senior vacancies, he hoped that within the next 6 months progress will have been made now that a number of these posts have been approved to proceed. He - | Page 6 | - 17/22.3 17/22.4 17/22.5 17/22.6 17/22.7 said that another issue is about capacity and capability in areas such as financial control, busi ness case management and management of DACs. He advised that a number of internal processes have been put in place to ensure that staff are complying with requests and training is being provided for staff on business cases. In the last month, he reported that a business partner arrangement has been put in place and an individual appointed. He reported that the third issue related to the transition to SPPG as there is a significant number of staff in his directorate who are involved in areas such as planning and commissioning and going forward the role of his directorate in this work needs to be reviewed as nursing, midwifery and AHP work is inextricably linked across all programmes of care. Mr Stewart said that he was pleased to see that the Register had been updated as it is important that the risk s are kept up to date. Given the protracted nature of the recruitment process, he queried whether it was necessary to start planning for a recruitment 12 months in advance. He noted that the Permanent Secretary is no longer able to join the PHA Board workshop on 26 April as he wished to raise with him the issue of why approved posts have to be approved again by the Permanent Secretary. Mr Irvine asked if there was an underlying issue which explained why direc torate risk registers were being brought to the Committee as normally it would only be the Corporate Risk Register. Mr Stewart advised that the Committee considers the Corporate Risk Register but feel that it is good practice to look at the directorate on es as it gives the Director an opportunity to tell the Committee what is happening at their level. Mr Irvine commented that the document is lengthy and he would prefer to see a more consolidated report with additional information appended. He added that the document is not easy on the eye, and he noted that in the summary there is no information about the previous status of the risks or what changes have been made to their ratings. Therefore he said it is difficult to determine what action has been taken if a risk has been escalated and this needs to be clear. He added that the document needs to be more readable. Mr Clayton thanked Mr Morton for bringing the directorate risk register to the Committee and said that it was helpful to see what is going on on a rotational basis. He noted that Mr Morton had addressed the issue of vacancies and while there is a process under way in the nursing directorate there is still a high number of vacant posts. He asked for more clarity about the nature of the risk rel ating to the managed care network for maternal health and wellbeing and what action is being taken. Mr Morton clarified that the Committee wished to carry out a more in depth review of directorate risk registers. He agreed that there is a need - | Page 7 | - 17/22.8 17/22.9 17/22.10 to find a different way of tracking the movement of risks and to do this on a summary page. With regard to vacancies, he said that not only in his own directorate, but across PHA to think about the right structure and to make use of resources where there are signif icant gaps. In terms of the care network, he explained that there was a delay in establishing this due to the pandemic, but there is a maternity collaborative. He added that the development of a new maternal health and wellbeing network designed to look at the needs of children, women and young people has been delayed. Mr Wilson said that in terms of the methodology, any changes in the risk register are made in green font, including any changes to the rating of risks. He agreed with the point about the register being shorter, and although the aim is to make the register dynamic and useful, he would take that feedback away. Mr Irvine commented that visually impaired people would not pick up the changes in green font. Mr Wilson said that this would also be looked into. Mr Stewart thanked Mr Morton for his attendance Members noted the nursing directorate risk register. 18/22 Item 5 - Chair's Business 18/22.1 Mr Stewart advised that he had no Chair's Business. 16/22 Item 6 - Internal Audit (ctd.) 16/22. 16/22.16 Internal Audit Progress Report [GAC/ 07/04/22] (ctd.) Mrs McKeown presented the Progress Report and advised that 5 days originally held for another audit were used to carry out the re- run of the Board Effectiveness survey and follow up interviews with a sample of Board members. She referred to the KPIs and said that there needs to be improvement in terms of the length of time to receive management comments. She gave an overview of the progress of the various audits and explained that following completion of the Board Effectiveness audit, she will be able to give her Head of Internal Audit opinion. Mrs McKeown reported that following the Financial Review she was giving a satisfactory level of assurance regarding non- pay expenditure, budgetary control and reporting to the Board, but a limited level of assurance regarding payments to staff. Mrs McKeown advised that the audit had found th at 48 staff had received 211 incorrect enhancements due to the incorrect completion of the electronic timesheet. She said that a lot of work needs to be done in that are but she is aware that Finance has been liaising with Payroll in that regard. She explained that one of the issues is that part time staff have been claiming overtime before they have worked 37.5 hours and - | Page 8 | - 16/22.18 16/22.19 16/22.20 16/22.21 there have been instances where staff have received Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holiday enhancements in error. She added that there have been delays in processing new starts, leavers and contract changes and that staff in post reports did not pick up or identify these changes. She said that 108 staff have not assigned to a line manager on the structure, but she noted that 77 of these were bank staff and issue with the remaining 31 has now largely been resolved. She noted that 8 staff out of a sample of 48 had not been assigned the correct line manager. She highlighted issues about timesheets not being processed on a timely basis and that there was an insta nce where a link load spreadsheet had been submitted using an electronic signature. She said that management had accepted all of the recommendations. Mr Stewart asked how many of these overpayments related to the Contact Tracing Servic e. Mrs McKeown said that the vast majority of them related to contact tracing. Mr Stewart said that last year the Committee had asked for an audit of that Service, and the terms of reference had been agreed by the previous Interim Chief Executive, without approval by the Committee and in breach of established procedures. Had that not been the case and had the Committee been in a position to influence the terms of reference of the audit, he felt that this issue would have been picked up at that point. He added that given the rapid expansion of the Service in response to the pandemic these findings were not really a surprise. Mr Clayton agreed that there seems to be an issue within contact tracing and particularly because the Service has been scaled up and down continually. He suggested that there is a further risk because the Service is about to be scaled down again and work needs to be done to ensure that staff are not overpaid and all outstanding issues are dealt with. He said he would welcome an insight into how that will be handled, and suggested it was an issue to do with line management. He expressed concern about the lack of clarity in terms of line management and staff not having appropriate support. He asked whether agency staff fell within the scope of this audit. Mr Clayton raised a concern about the SBNI issue. He asked, given that SBNI is a separate entity that is hosted by PHA, where the responsibility lies for implementing that recommendation. He appreciated that there is a risk in asking individuals to carry out that work but whether this requires resolution by the Department or elsewhere. Mrs McKeown said that the responsibility for implementing that recommendation lies with SBNI, and assistance will be sought from the Directorate of Legal Services (DLS) and BSO HR. With regard to the line management issues, Mrs McKeown clarified that the issue is with staff not having a line manager on the HRPTS system, not in their day to day work. She clarified that HRPTS does include agency staff and advised that the second finding related to bank staff , but the issue was not as significant as bank staff work less hours. - | Page 9 | - 16/22.22 16/22.23 16/22.24 16/22.25 16/22.26 Ms Mann -Kler commented that in the future it is not inconceivable that PHA would have to recruit an extra 600 staff again, and she asked how confident PHA is that these issues have been addressed and ther e are adequate staff, and if PHA can flex up and down depending on business need. Ms McCaig said that on the HRPTS system, there should not be any posts where there is no manager identified and that this is an HR process that starts with the manager. She added that this is an issue between Payroll and the Manager Self Service function, and although guidance has been given out, these events were inevitable. She explained that there was support from HR but the issue now relates to Payroll. She said that this situation could happen again, but she pointed out that this is not a situation that is unique to PHA and the system does need to be able to pick up on these issues. Ms McCaig advised that the staff in post reports are key and she has asked Ms Andrea He nderson to review these as this is a critical control within Payroll and is relied on regardless of whether PHA is scaling up or down. She said that following a review there will be monies that need to be recovered and there is a regional exercise ongoing regarding this with each case being gone through one by one to ensure that Payroll is taking the appropriate action. She undertook to update members on how that work is progressing. Mr Stewart said that there appear to be 2 issues, the first of which is adequate supervision of what is happening and that the right processes are in place and the second relates to having a system that can flag up if staff are only contracted part time. Ms McCaig concurred with Mr Stewart's assessment but noted that there are complexities, for example in dealing with virtual rotas. However, she agreed that as a first step there needs to be better controls. Mr Stewart asked that if this issue has been ongoing for some time, is the system not capable of being refined. Ms Mc Caig noted that there have been challenges with the systems and commented that there could be a situation where every manager is doing the right thing but the system is still not as modern as it could be. She conceded that when something is being done at pace, there is the opportunity for things to go wrong. She said that normally the situation is very stable, but this audit has picked up issues. She added that HR colleagues have been asked to give further guidance and support. Mr Irvine said that an underlying problem has been identified and this issue needs to be flagged up to IT to say that any future system will need to able to rectify this glitch. He asked what the likelihood is of the system being changed. Ms McCaig advised that at this stage the system will not be changed and while some improvements have been made, it will be another 2 years before it is replaced. Mr Irvine suggested that the improvements are like a sticking plaster. He noted that there is a reliance on people following guidanc e and that any follow up audit is likely to pick up the same issues. He said that an answer - | Page 10 | - 16/22.27 16/22.28 16/22.29 needs to be found as it is unacceptable that a problem has been identified but is not being dealt with and there is a reliance on HR providing further guidance that will require a further intervention. He suggested that there needs to be a higher level of accountability placed on this. Ms McCaig said issues regarding the system are HSC -wide, but there has been little impact on PHA previously. She noted that any s elf- service system will have an element of risk. She said that contact tracing staff have been made aware of the issues, HR has prepared guidance and her staff are replicating reports to help. Mr Irvine said that there is a fundamental issue about ownership of recommendations emanating from audits. From an organisation business improvement perspective, he said that Directors should be working with each other and taking joint ownership and this is something the Board may need to look at. He added t hat the number of recommendations is starting to increase. He suggested that there may be an underlying issue with regard to the structure of the organisation and in order to determine how this can be dealt with in the right way across the organisation, i t may need to be discussed with the Board. Mr Stewart advised that as far as the Contact Tracing Service is concerned, PHA is only now assuming control of the Service as that responsibility had lain with the Department of Health. However, he said that wi ll not deal with the glitch in the Payroll system so additional measures need to be put in place to deal with these issues. He noted that these have been extraordinary circumstances, but these circumstances could come round again so PHA needs to have a le vel of control over and above what the system can provide and there is something that the Board needs to raise with the Chief Executive. Ms McCaig said that for the current scaling down of the Service, managers are aware of the issues and have sought HR g uidance on what is the right thing to do, and she will take a retrospective look at what has happened. She agreed that there are lessons to be learnt and it would be helpful to have those written up. She said that these issues arose at the beginning, but since the audit new controls have been put in place. She conceded that the situation is less than ideal, but she undertook to give a further update at the next meeting (Action 2 - Ms McCaig) . Mr Stewart expressed concern as to why an in issue relating t o SBNI featured in this PHA audit report. Mrs McKeown explained that it is because SBNI was included in the sampling for the Payroll element of this audit. Mr Charles added that when this payment was identified and followed by SBNI, there was no clarity as to whether this issue had been raised with HR or DLS, hence it was included in the report. Mrs McKeown added that PHA does have a hosting arrangement with SBNI, but accepted that this is an issue for SBNI to resolve. Mr Stewart said that his concern i s that this finding is contributing to a limited assurance, but Mrs McKeown said that was not the case. Ms McCaig said that SBNI operates under the formal governance of PHA, and while she - | Page 11 | - 16/22.3 0 16/22. 31 16/22. 32 16/22.3 3 16/22.3 4 16/22. 35 accepted that it is unusual that this would appear in this audit, s he felt that it is important that there is oversight of SBNI's expenditure. Ms Mann -Kler commented that this is another area where she does not have clarity and she asked if there was anything that needed to be discussed at Board level. Mr Stewart said t hat this could be picked up as part of the review of PHA especially as the work of SBNI is not within PHA's statutory remit. He suggested that this should be referred to the Chief Executive to pick up as part of the review. Ms McCaig noted that there was a recommendation relating to a link and load payment, but said that this should not have been processed if the correct person was not cc'd in the e- mail. While she accepted the process was not ideal, she said that the payment should have been rejected by Shared Services . Mrs McKeown advised that this is an issue that is routinely picked up because the timesheet spreadsheet is a workaround for HRPTS and therefore it does contribute to a limited assurance being given. She noted that there has been progres s in that Shared Services have created a new template that does not allow Bank Holiday enhancements to be paid for anything else apart from a Bank Holiday. She added that she was encouraged to note that Ms McCaig's team is going to run reports. Ms McCaig said that the issue she was referring to related to a non- pay link and load from the accounts payable side. Members noted the Internal Audit Progress Report. Year End - Follow up on Outstanding Internal Audi t Recommendations [GAC/08 /04/22] Mrs McKeown advised that Internal Audit conducts follow up work twice a year on the outstanding recommendations from previous audits and this reports shows that 78% of the 59 recommendations are now fully implemented with 13 recommendations partially implemented. She drew members' attention to the summary table and then to the section giving further detail on those which remain partially implemented. Mrs McKeown reported that the oldest recommendation not yet fully implemented relates to procurement. She advised that there are 3 recommendations which relate to screening programmes, but there will be a future audit of screening programmes. She noted that the 1 recommendation relating to PPI should be closed off shortly. Mrs McKeown advised that there are 2 recommen dations relating to the Family Nurse Partnership programme, one of which relates to the IT system, but she is aware that there is work ongoing in that area. She said that there are 2 issues relating to information governance, one of which relates to the need to ensure that PHA contracts are compliant with GDPR, but she noted that a Band 7 Information Governance Manager has been appointed. - | Page 12 | - 16/22. 36 16/22. 37 16/22. 38 16/22. 39 16/22. 40 16/22. 41 16/22. 42 Mrs McKeown reported that there are 2 recommendations relating to the recent audit on performance management where a limited assurance was given, and that one of these has 5 elements. She said that progress on some of those has been made in that performance reporting to the Board has improved, but there is still work to do in the development of a Performance Management Framework. Mr Stewart commented that some of the other issues are not likely to be resolved until the Framework is in place. Mrs McCaig advised that at the next Board meeting the Chief Executive will inform members that he has initiated a series of meeti ngs with Executive Directors to discuss their budgets, but also the need to reduce the number of DACs and to get outstanding audit recommendations completed. Mr Stewart added that the issue about DACs has been added to the Corporate Risk Register. Mrs Mc Caig reiterated that there is a push to get these outstanding recommendations completed. Mr Stewart said that he would like to see a higher level of completion and while he accepted that the last 18 months has been challenging, there is a need to get some of these over the line in the next 6 months. Mr Wilson said that in terms of the Performance Management Framework, this is currently being addressed, and is germane to the discussions around business planning. He hoped to have a draft brought to the Board inside the next few months. Members noted the update on outstanding Internal Audit recommendations. Internal Audit Plan 2022/23 [GAC/09/04/22] Mrs McKeown explained that this is a 1- year Plan due to the ongoing organisational review. She advised that she met with all Directors and the Chief Executive where it was a felt that a 1- year Plan would be more appropriate given the current context so she would await the outworking of the review before committing to the development of a 3- year Plan. Mrs McKeown gave an overview of how the Plan was developed and the nature of the assurance that can be given. She outlined the breakdown of the number of audit days and explained the relationship between Internal Audit and other stakeholders. Mrs McKeown outlined the programme of proposed audits and advised that given the recent re -run of the survey for the Board Effectiveness audit in March, a further audit would not be conducted next year. She added that the audit on vaccination programmes has been deferred to 2023/24 given that there is already an audit on screening programmes. She sought the Committee's approval of the Plan. Mr Clayton said that he understood the rationale for not doing both the screening and vaccination audits during the same year. With regard to the financial review audit, he asked what areas this would be looking at - | Page 13 | - 16/22.4 3 and if there would be follow up to the previous audit. Mrs McKeown advised that there will be an element of follow up and that this year, more time has been allocated to the audit. She said that while it will include areas such as payments to staff and non- pay expenditure, there are other areas such as legal payments or use of ext ernal consultants that are looked at rotationally. Members APPROVED the Internal Audit Plan 2022/23. 17/22 Item 7 - Corporate Governance (ctd.) 17/22.1 0 17/22. 11 17/22. 12 17/22. 13 17/22. 14 Corporate Risk Register as at 31 March 2022 [GAC/ 10/04/22] Mr Wilson presented the Corporate Risk Register which he advised has been reviewed as at 31 March 2022. He explained that a number of changes have been made, including the addition of a new risk relating to DACs which is an issue of particular concern to the Chief Executive and one which he wishes to monitor closely and ensure that these are eliminated as much as possible. He added that the Chief Executive has added this to each Director's objectives for the year. Mr Wilson reported that 2 risks have been removed, risk 52 relating to the ability of third party providers to deliver commissioned services which has been placed on the Register during COVID -19 but was no longer felt to be an issue, and risk 58 relating to staff resilience where it was felt that a number of areas had been addressed. He advised that 2 other risks have had their rating reduced. Mr Stewart said that given PHA will be assuming full responsibility for both the Contact Tracing Service and the COVID -19 Vaccination Programme, he queried if this needed to be included on the Register, but he suggested that that may be a discussion for the full Board. Mr Clayton asked for more detail on the rationale for removing the risk on staff resilience. He said that the Board has been concerned about what staff have had to cope with and a concern about staff being able to take leave, so he asked whether now that staff are transitioning out of redeploym ent, are they able to take leave and is it too early to remove this risk or can AMT give an assurance that the picture has improved. Mr Wilson said that he understood the concerns. He explained that the measures identified to be taken forward have been t aken forward and managers have impressed on staff about the need to take leave. He added that given PHA is going through a period of recovery, it was felt appropriate to downgrade this risk and manage it through staff appraisals and team meetings , but AMT will keep a watching eye on it. He said that it is likely that staff resilience will be picked up as part of the review and that the review will highlight a number of challenges for PHA. Mr Clayton noted that there are 2 risks which relate to workforce capacity and recalled that there had been previous discussion about - | Page 14 | - 17/22. 15 17/22. 16 17/22. 17 17/22. 18 having a single risk. While not seeking to diminish the issues that exist within health protection and HSCQI, he said that this was clearly an issue across the organisation. Mr Wilson agreed, but noted that during the period that the Register was being reviewed the Director of HSCQI was on leave so it was felt best to leave it as it was this time around, but to look to amal gamate it in future. Mr Stewart said that he felt that this is a corporate risk for the whole organisation and should feature on the Register as a single risk. Ms McCaig noted that there is a risk missing from the update as there had previously been a new risk added about PHA's ability to achieve a break even positon. She said that the risk remains low. Mr Irvine commented that normally a Corporate Risk Register would only contain 8/10 high level risks that have been escalated by Directors. He said that the 2 risks on staffing and the risk on staff resilience could be culminated into 1 high level risk. He suggested that there should be discussion at the workshop about what is deemed as a high level corporate risk and where there is overlap, these shoul d be combined. Mr Stewart welcomed those observations and said that it was something he had already discussed with Mr Wilson and Mr Murray. He said that while some progress has been made in refining the risks, there is still some work to do. He added that the Chief Executive would agree that there needs to be a discussion about what the high level risks are, but at present AMT is erring on the side of caution. Mr Wilson assured members that AMT is looking at this. Mr Stewart said that he thought that t he risk regarding the PHA website could be removed. Mr Wilson agreed that this will be the case. Mr Stewart also said that the risk on leadership needs to be brought up to date. Members APPROVED the Corporate Risk Register which will be brought to the P HA Board in May. 19/22 Item 8 - Finance 19/22.1 19/22.2 Timetable for ALB Annual Accounts 2021/22 [GAC/12/04/22] Ms McCaig advised that as per the Circular from the Department, PHA must have its financial position resolved by 25 April and draft accounts submitted to both the Department and NIAO by 6 May as well as any consolidation schedules. She said that she would share the accounts with Committee members when at the same time as they are sent to NIAO. Ms McCaig said that the audit of the accounts will be completed in advance of the GAC meeting of 9 June and following approval by the Board at its June meeting, they will be signed and submitted to the Department in advance of 24 June deadline. She noted that it is a - | Page 15 | - 19/22.3 19/22.4 19/22.5 19/22.6 19/22.7 19/22.8 lengthy process, but the first key date is the 25 April for submission of the financial position followed by the draft accounts being submitted by 6 May. Members noted the t imetable for the Annual Accounts. Fraud Liaison Officer Report [GAC/13/04/22] Ms McCaig presented the latest Fraud Report and began by giving members an update on two investigations into alleged fraud relating to third parties. For the first case, she advised that following an investigation there was no evidence of fraud committed against the PHA and there was no PSNI investigation. She advised that she has written to the Director of Finance in the Department to outline what work PHA has done regarding this matter. In the second instance, she reminded members that this related to a counselling where PHA had contributed costs to pay for rent for premises where services were provided. Following some indications of impropriety, she advised that a third party was brought in, but no issues were found for PHA and that matter has also been closed. Ms McCaig reported that significant progress has been made against the Fraud Action Plan, although some Fraud Liaison Officer training remains outstanding. She adv ised that NIAO has recently produced some useful guidance in the area of fraud. Ms McCaig returned to the outstanding action from the previous meeting regarding high risk duplicate records found in the National Fraud Initiative data matching exercise. Sh e explained that there could be instances where there are two records with the same company, the same value, but different bank accounts. However, she assured members that all duplicate payments had been flagged up by accounts payable through internal processes and there was no suspicion found of any fraud. Mr Irvine noted that in the update on the second suspected fraud investigation, it noted that although no fraud was found, the GAC could seek assurance through a forensic review and therefore it needs to be put on record whether that suggestion will be taken forward. Ms McCaig agreed and reiterated that there was no evidence of fraud found. Mr Irvine said that it should be stated that the Committee had agreed that there was no need to undertake any further investigation. This was agreed. Mr Clayton noted the fraud alert included in the paper regarding a scam on COVID -19 text alerts and given the changes in testing where there is now potentially a cost for people to get tested which increases the risk of receiving such scams, he queried if PHA should disseminate information warning people about this. Mr Wilson advised that there was a meeting with the Department last week about the changes in testing, and this - | Page 16 | - 19/22.9 was picked up. He said that PHA will be undertaking proactive messaging. Members noted the Fraud Liaison Officer Update report. 20/22 Item 9 - Draft PHA 20/22.2 20/22.3 20/22.4 20/22.5 20/22.6 Mr Wilson advised that t he draft Annual Report is the current version and requires significant work, as well as the inclusion of other parts, including the finance sections. He said that the performance section focuses mainly on the pandemic response over the last 12 months. He advised that since this version was issued he has made significant changes and reduced the narrative. He felt that it would not be appropriate to approve this version as the draft. Ms Mann -Kler said that she did not get any sense of equali ty, diversity or inclusion in the Report and this needs to be reflected throughout the document, not as a standalone section. She added that she was unclear as to the presentation of the performance analysis page, but agreed that it would be useful to shorten the report. She welcomed the addition of pictures in the Report. Mr Wilson said that he would be happy to pick up with Ms Mann- Kler outside of the meeting in terms of the some of the issues raised. Mr Irvine commented that in the first part of the Report, it outlines 5 key outcomes, but the narrative after that does not follow these and all the sections need to be more interrelated. Mr Clayton agreed that as this is a work in progress it would be best to defer approval. He agreed with Ms Mann- Kler's comment about the need to include commentary about equality and diversity citing low vaccination uptake as an area. In terms of screening, he noted that this is a significant area of PHA work but it appeared that there was only informa tion on 2 of the programmes. He added that the redeployment of PHA staff during the year is referenced at various points throughout the Report but perhaps needs to be more upfront. He said that the section on Health Improvement appeared to be more internally focused rath er on its impact on the public. He added that he was mindful that PHA's Corporate Plan has expired so there may need to be some narrative in the Report to say that it has been extended. He said that compared to previous Annual Reports he had found this one easier to follow, but he would welcome seeing a summary version. Mr Wilson thanked Mr Clayton for his comments, all of which he said were very worthwhile points. Mr Stewart said that at this time the Committee can give a nod of approval to the Report but would anticipate that the Report will be in better shape in advance of the Board meeting on 26 April. Members noted the draft PHA Annual Report. - | Page 17 | - 21/22 Item 10 - Draft PHA Governance Statement 2021/22 [GAC/15/04/22] 21/22.1 21/22.2 21/22.3 21/22.4 21/22.5 Mr Wilson advised that there are also gaps in the draft Governance Statement as it needed some information from Internal Audit as well as some narrative around the transfer of the vaccination programme. Mr Stewart said that the Com mittee would not be in a position to approve the Statement today. Mr Irvine noted that Ms McCaig's attendance at Board meetings had not been included in the attendance section. It was agreed that this would be rectified (Action 3 - Mr Wilson) . Ms Mann -Kler asked if the Chief Executive would be attending a meeting of the Committee. Mr Stewart said he intended to write to him to formally invite him to attend, but noted that he was due to attend the last meeting, but was unable to. Mr Wilson advi sed that the Chief Executive is keen to attend (Action 4 - Mr Stewart). Mr Clayton noted that there had been discussion before about a need for the Information Governance Steering Group to be reconvened and a report back to the Committee. It was agreed t hat Mr Murray would look into this (Action 5 - Mr Murray) . Members noted the draft PHA Governance Statement. 22/22 Item 11 - Governance and Audit Committee Annual Report [GAC/16/04/22] 22/22.1 22/22.2 Mr Stewart noted that this Report was also a work in progress and would need to be brought back to the Committee. Members noted the Governance and Audit Committee Annual Report. 23/22 Item 12 - Any Other Business 23/22.1 Mr Stewart thanked members for their attendance at today's meeting and apologised for his oversight in not formally welcoming Mr Irvine to his first meeting. He said that he looked forward to working with Mr Irvine and benefitting from his experience of having sat on other Committees. 24/22 Item 13 - Details of Next Meeting Thursday 9 June 2022 at 10am Fifth Floor Meeting Room (or via Zoom). 12/22 Linenhall Street, Belfast, BT2 8BS - | Page 18 | - Signed by Chair: Joseph Stewart Date: 9 June 2022 item 11 Title of Meeting PHA Board Meeting Date 16 June 2022 Title of paper PHA Annual Report and Accounts 2021/22 Reference PHA/0 2/06/22 Prepared by Stephen Wilson / Tracey McCaig Lead Director Stephen Wilson / Tracey McCaig Recommendation For Approval For Noting 1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to seek approval of the PHA's Annual Report for 2021/22. 2 Background Information The Public Health Agency is required to produce an Annual Report and Accounts.

The Public Health Agency - our role, purpose and ac tivities The Public Health Agency (PHA) is the statutory bod y responsible for improving and protecting the health of our population and an inte gral part of the Health and Social Care (HSC) system, working closely with the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB), local Health Trusts (HSC Trusts), the Business Serv ices Organisation (BSO) and the Patient Client Council (PCC). Central to our main responsibilities is working in close partnership with individuals, groups and organisations from all sectors - communi ty, voluntary and statutory. The PHA was set up with the explicit agenda to: protect public health; improve the health and social wellbeing of people in Northern Ireland; work to reduce health inequalities between people in Northern Ireland; and work with the HSCB, providing professional input t o the commissioning of health and social care services. The PHA is a multi-disciplinary, multi-professional body with a strong regional and local presence. During 2021/22, the PHA continued to work and be gu ided by our purpose, vision and values, as set out in our Corporate Plan 2017 - 2021, which was rolled forward 2 into 2021/22 as advised by the Department of Health (DoH); however our focus was on responding to the challenges of COVID-19. Our purpose to protect and improve the health and social wellb eing of our population and reduce health inequalities through strong partnersh ips with individuals, communities and other key public, private and volun tary organisations. Our vision all people and communities are enabled and support ed in achieving their full health and wellbeing potential, and inequalities in health are reduced. Our values we put individuals and communities at the heart of everything we do in improving their health and social wellbeing and reducing heal th inequalities; we act with openness and honesty and treat all wit h dignity, respect and compassion as we conduct our business; we work in partnership with individuals, communiti es and other public, private, community and voluntary organisations to improve th e quality of life of those we serve; we listen to and involve individuals and communiti es; we value, develop and empower our staff and strive for excellence and innovation; and we are evidence-led and outcomes-focused. HSC values In addition we subscribe to the values and associat ed behaviours that all staff working within Health and Social Care (HSC) are exp ected to display at all times. 3 HSC Value What does this mean? What does this look like in practice? - Behaviours Working Together We work together for the best outcome for people we care for and support. We work across Health and Social Care and with other external organisations and agencies, recognising that leadership is the responsibility of all. I work with others and value everyone's contribution I treat people with respect and dignity I work as part of a team looking for opportunities to support and help people in both my own and other teams I actively engage people on issues that affect them I look for feedback and examples of good practice, aiming to improve where possible Compassion We are sensitive, caring, respectful and understanding towards those we care for and support and our colleagues. We listen carefully to others to better understand and take action to help them and ourselves. I am sensitive to the different needs and feelings of others and treat people with kindness I learn from others by listening carefully to them I look after my own health and well-being so that I can care for and support others Excellence We commit to being the best we can be in our work, aiming to improve and develop services to achieve positive changes. We deliver safe, high-quality, compassionate care and support. I put the people I care for and support at the centre of all I do to make a difference I take responsibility for my decisions and actions I commit to best practice and sharing learning, while continually learning and developing I try to improve by asking 'could we do this better?' Openness & Honesty We are open and honest with each other and act with integrity and candour. I am open and honest in order to develop trusting relationships I ask someone for help when needed I speak up if I have concerns I challenge inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour and practice 4 Chair's Foreword On behalf of the Board I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the Public Health Agency for their unswerving and diligent response t o a second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staff have also worked tirelessly in orde r to restore those services which either had to be reduced or paused at the height of the pandemic. I am delighted that in this year the PHA was able t o appoint a permanent Chief Executive. Aidan Dawson took up his post on 1 July 2021. Prior to his appointment, Aidan held a range of director positions in Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland, as well as having served in the voluntary sector. I would like to thank Olive Macleod OBE who underto ok the role of Interim Chief Executive at the commencement of the pandemic. She oversaw the establishment of the contact tracing service and ensured that the PH A acted promptly to reduce the major health threats caused by the virus and its va riants. I also wish to express my immense appreciation to t he Department of Health and in particular to Professor Sir Michael McBride for ste adfast leadership during the last two years. In the birthday honours list of 2021, Pr ofessor McBride's contribution was fittingly recognised with a knighthood. The Department of Health and the PHA are now in the process of designing and implementing a new operating model. This new model will both refresh and reshape the PHA in order to address effectively the public health needs of the people of Northern Ireland into the next decade and beyond. The PHA is keen to ensure the appointment of indivi duals from a broad range of disciplines to become public health consultants. Th e Board continues to review its committee structure and looks forward to contributi ng to this new model in every way possible. 5 I wish to record the contribution of two local coun cillors who served on the Board of the PHA for almost 10 years. Alderman Paul Porter a nd Alderman William Ashe MBE brought great understanding and knowledge of co mmunity issues to our deliberations in the boardroom. We were delighted in October 2021 to welcome two ne w local government appointees to the Board in Councillor Robert Irvine from Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Alderman Phillip Brett from An trim and Newtownabbey Borough Council. Alderman Brett previously served on the Board of th e Northern Ireland Housing Executive and Councillor Irvine presently serves on the Board of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service. In addition Mrs Anne Henderson OBE has been appoint ed as non-executive director with financial experience. Mrs Henderson is a forme r Chair of the Parades Commission for Northern Ireland and a former Vice C hair of the Board of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. I want to record appreciation and thanks to members of the Board, both executive and non-executive, who went above and beyond the ca ll of duty in a particularly demanding year. We look forward in the coming year to ensure refres hed clarity of focus for the objectives of the PHA, not just in the immediate ye ars but for the decade ahead. Andrew Dougal OBE Chair of the Board Public Health Agency for Northern Ireland 6 Chief Executive's Report The past year has proven to be extremely demanding as we continued to face the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic while trying to get on with normal business as much as possible. PHA staff met those challenges head-on, delivering solutions that have made a difference while continuing to work to improve the general health and wellbeing of our communities. Since joining the PHA, I have been tremendously imp ressed with the resolve and professionalism of PHA staff, working as a team wit h drive and determination. Our people have not been found wanting, and have contin ually risen to whatever has been asked of them. The organisation has had to be agile and adapted qu ickly to the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and peaks in case numbers. We inc reased our staff complement at the height of the pandemic, and evolved new serv ices including enhancements to the Contact Tracing Service to meet the significant rise in COVID-19 cases. Growing the organisation in such a short timescale has been demanding, especially in the middle of a pandemic when many staff have been work ing remotely. I am immensely proud of the effort that has been put into adapting how we work quickly and effectively. This has resulted in lives being saved . Adversity brings with it opportunity and one of the most significant developments has been the targeted use of data science, information and analytics. We have taken significant strides forward in developing leading e dge real-time information streams which underpin our surveillance and analytics syste ms, relying on greater automation than at any time previously. This work h as helped target our interventions during the pandemic, and the learning we have taken from it will be of significant benefit in how we do things in future. Genomic sequencing and behavioural science capacity has become further established within Northern Ireland, and through pa rtnerships with academia, tech, HSC and other partners, we have brought a targeted focus underpinning the pandemic response. 7 Vaccination has played a major role in the battle a gainst coronavirus, and the roll-out of new vaccines across society formed the biggest b reakthrough in this pandemic. The PHA has, together with the wider HSC family, pl ayed a key role in achieving approximately 90% uptake amongst the adult populati on - in line with other regions across these islands. Of course this, and the gener al actions which people have taken to help protect themselves and others through out the pandemic, is testament to the responsibility and responsiveness that the p ublic has shown in taking on board the significant and often fast-moving messaging as evidence emerged and responses were developed. In 2022, responsibility for coordination of the COV ID-19 vaccination programme is moving to the PHA, which will again require a new l evel of focus to ensure that we have the capacity available to deliver it as part o f our existing vaccination programmes. The annual report provides a snapshot across a rang e of work undertaken during the year, with a particular focus on the management of COVID-19. The Department of Health advised that our corporate strategy would be rolled over for 2021/22, and our business plan for 2021/22 acknowledged that while t he focus of the programme would be the COVID-19 response, where possible we w ould hope to return to non- COVID business as soon as possible. However, the emergence of the Delta and laterally O micron variants has resulted in PHA staff at various stages during the year steppin g in to provide additional sustained support to Health Protection and contact tracing functions. This has had an impact on the delivery of some key objectives, b ut notwithstanding good progress has been achieved. Work has also continued across o ur areas of responsibility including health improvement, screening, Nursing an d Allied Health Professionals, quality and safety, and Research & Development. Change has been a constant feature over the past tw o years and will undoubtedly continue as the pandemic transitions into an endemi c state in the future. Looking ahead, we can envisage a period of major st rategic change in health, beginning with the closure of our commissioning par tner the HSCB and its transfer of 8 functions into the Department of Health in the form of a new Strategic Planning and Performance Group. This will be closely followed by the roll-out of a new integrated care planning system that will help to ensure that the people's health needs are best met through a population health planning approach, including prevention and early intervention. We currently have a unique 'reset' opportunity and to this end the PHA, together with the Department of Health, have commenced a review p rocess which will bring forward plans for taking on board the hard-earned l earning from the last two years while ensuring that the PHA is best placed to lead on the response to the key strategic challenges locally, nationally and intern ationally in the months and years ahead. While we work our way through the future stages of the pandemic, there will be new public health challenges that we need to be ready t o face. For example, we already know there are significant health inequalities expe rienced by people living in the most deprived areas compared with those in the leas t deprived, leading to ill-health and earlier death. The cost-of-living crisis, with increased costs for food, fuel and other necessities, could exacerbate this further an d have a real detrimental impact on health and wellbeing, so we need to be creative, collaborative and effective in how we work to reduce this within a public health c ontext. We have gone through an unprecedented couple of yea rs which impacted on all of our lives - no one has been untouched by this pande mic. As we emerge and look to the future, the hard work of our staff and the lear ning we have taken from our experiences will enable the PHA to move forward eve n more effectively in helping to protect and improve people's health and wellbeing. Aidan Dawson Chief Executive Public Health Agency 9 Performance Analysis The PHA Annual Business Plan 2021-2022 sets out the key actions for the year commencing 1 April 2021 and ending 31 March 2022 to meet ministerial priorities and deliver on outcomes set out in the Corporate Pl an for 2017/21 which was rolled forward to 2021/22 at the request of the Department of Health due to the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 response. Staff across the PHA , as well as Board members, were engaged with, and contributed to, the content of the plan. The plan was also developed in alignment with the Draft Programme for Government 2016-2021 , Making Life Better 2012-2023 , Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together and the evolving community planning arrangements. A key element identified at the time of developing the Annual Business Plan was the overriding priority of focusing on the ongoing COVI D-19 pandemic and ensuring that key interventions needed to contain and manage the virus, such as testing, contact tracing, surveillance, roll out of the vaccination programme and public behaviour messaging were effectively implemented, whilst also endeavouring to balance 'business as usual' as far as possible. In the cont ext of guidance from the Department of Health, the Annual Business Plan 2021-2022 contains 53 targets to take forward the five agreed key outcome themes: 1) COVID-19 Response; 2) Health Protection; 3) Health Improvement; 4) Shaping future health; and 5) Our organisation works effectively. Progress is reported to the PHA Board through quart erly progress reports. Performance against these targets has been of a hig h standard. The figures in the following table set out the posi tion at 31 March 2022. 10 Green On target 44 Amber Slight delay 9 Red Significant delay / will not be completed 0 TOTAL 53 The following pages highlight some of the key actio ns taken forward during 2021/22. They reflect work across all of the PHA Directorate s and functional areas. It should be noted however, that as we had to flexibly refocu s our activities during 2021/22 to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic with staff redeplo yments, a lot of work commenced throughout the year has had to be paused for periods of time. 11 COVID-19 Timeline A brief timeline for some of the key events that ha ve marked the pandemic to the end of March 2022 is illustrated in the following t imeline. 12 13 14 The Public Health Agency response to COVID-19 As Northern Ireland entered the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was evident that the demands facing the PHA were set to continue and would require an even greater level of dedicated professional resour ces. The logistical challenges in rolling out a new and complex vaccination programme across the population while continuing to respond t o the unpredictable trajectory of emerging variants of concern would demand an unprec edented level of synergy across the HSC family, in partnership with all aspe cts of society in Northern Ireland. Central to this was the role, support and work of t he PHA. This report describes some of the work undertaken b y the PHA during 2021/22, providing an insight into the breadth of the PHA re sponse across directorates and functions. These areas include: The role of health protection in the response to COVID-19; Development of the Northern Ireland Contact Traci ng Service; Support for the education sector; Supporting the care home sector; Infection prevention and control during the pande mic; Collaborative approach to surge management; The Research and Development response to COVID-19 ; Vaccination programmes; The impact of COVID-19 on screening services; Health and wellbeing improvement initiatives; Supporting mental health and emotional wellbeing during COVID-19; The key role of communication during a pandemic; Planning and operational response; and Health & Social Care Quality Improvement (HSCQI) response to the pandemic. 15 The role of PHA Health Protection in the response t o COVID-19 The PHA Health Protection directorate has continued to provide sustained and intensive leadership, intelligence and health prote ction expertise during 2021/22, in addition to delivering essential ongoing acute resp onse and proactive health protection programmes. Over 38,000 enquiries regarding COVID-19 have been managed through the PHA Health Protection Acute Response Service, which is responsible for investigating and managing clusters and outbreaks of infectious d isease. The service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a w eek and has provided the professional lead for a large number of multi-disci plinary incident control teams for the management of outbreaks in a range of settings including churches, care homes, schools and colleges, workplaces, and health care s ettings. The service works in close partnership with HSC Tru sts, Local Councils, the Health and Safety Executive and the Education Authority to prevent and bring outbreaks under control and has continued to collaborate full y with colleagues from UK and Republic of Ireland to share learning, assess evide nce and influence policy. The PHA has produced and contributed to the develop ment of guidance and policies in relation to COVID-19 across many different setti ngs, including for the general public, vulnerable people, care homes, hospitals, f uneral directors and schools. A dedicated guidance cell was established to respond to queries about application of COVID-19 guidance, and has managed almost 1,000 enq uiries to date. During spring and summer 2021, a further wave of in fection with the more transmissible and more severe Delta variant was man aged. Initial steps included mandatory ten days hotel quarantine for returnees f rom 'red list' countries and mass testing of residents in targeted areas to find and isolate cases. Incident management teams were held to control outbreaks, and to reduce onward transmission. 16 There was a further surge of infection when schools went back after the summer holidays, and the PHA worked closely with schools a nd the Education Authority to support them in managing cases and clusters. This i ncluded the production of a suite of letters, guidance and information resources for schools, parents and children. In November 2021, the PHA stood up a response to th e emerging Omicron variant first identified in South Africa. This included lia ising directly with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa to obtain real time information to inform our risk assessment and planning. Rapid work was un dertaken to characterise the risk from this new variant in terms of transmissibi lity, growth advantage, immune escape and severity. Staff from across the PHA were mobilised to assist with the operational Health Protection response, and in part icular to support care homes during the peak. The Omicron variant posed particular challenges in health care and residential care settings in terms of health care acquired infection s due to its increased transmissibility, and also the reduced staffing lev els they were experiencing at the time. As well as providing guidance and advice to m anage the outbreaks, the PHA also assessed if there were any broader issues of c oncern, for example with staffing or PPE, and escalated these appropriately. Critical to the PHA response has been the further e volution of our systematic surveillance systems. Surveillance is the continuou s process of collection, analysis and interpretation of data related to communicable disease and environmental hazards. To target interventions to prevent and con trol outbreaks, the health protection surveillance team draw from a range of i nformation sources including laboratories, hospitals, GPs, HSC Trusts, UKHSA and lighthouse laboratories. Waste water surveillance has been used to analyse t he trajectory of COVID-19, identify the burden of disease and which age groups and geographical areas are most affected. Outputs are used to inform public he alth decision making, and policy. A bi-weekly early warning report has continued to b e produced, identifying geographical areas of concern within Northern Irela nd where increased resources and testing need to be directed. 17 Confirmed COVID-19 cases by postcode area (week end ing 14 November 2021) COVID-19 case rates and proportion positive by Loca l Government District (7-day rolling average, week ending 9 January 2022) Source: Virology database. 18 COVID-19 internal dashboard During 2021/22 a series of additional refinements h ave been made to the COVID-19 internal dashboard, including information on virolo gy, testing, trends, mortality and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Weekly reports on CO VID-19 and care homes were produced for the public. Source: Virology database. WGS results have been used to monitor emerging new variants of 'concern' or 'under investigation' and were key in the managemen t of the Delta and Omicron waves in 2021. The WGS team within Health Protectio n Surveillance collaborate with colleagues in UKHSA (formerly PHE), Republic of Ire land, Queens University Belfast, HSC laboratories, the Regional Virology La boratory (RVL) and COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK). Mutations (VAM) profiles and WGS epidemiological reports were produ ced to support this work. A 19 pathogen genomics service development group was con vened in October 2021 to develop the genomics service within Northern Irelan d and to expand to other pathogen in the future. Dedicated surveillance systems are in place to moni tor COVID-19 in high risk populations and settings. For example, care home su rveillance identifies outbreaks in care homes and helps target the advice and suppo rt given. The hospital acquired COVID-19 infection dashboard has provided information on COVID-19 infections in patients who have been admit ted to hospital in Northern Ireland. This information is updated on a daily bas is and can be broken down by HSC Trust, hospital and individual ward level. This enables the PHA and HSC Trusts to quickly identify health care associated infectio ns (HCAIs) and outbreaks, ensuring early investigation and intervention to help to pre vent further spread of COVID-19 in the hospital setting. The dashboard also enables mo nitoring of trends in infection and mortality associated with hospital acquired COV ID-19. PHA health protection staff are represented on nati onal groups to ensure that standardised definitions and methodology are used t o categorise hospital acquired COVID-19 infections to enable comparison with other UK nations. Over the course of the year the PHA has also continued to monitor othe r healthcare associated infections including S. aureus bacteraemias, C. difficile infection, Gram negative bloodstream infections and multi-drug resistant org anisms throughout the pandemic. 20 Hospital Acquired COVID-19 cases in all HSC Trusts: March 2020- March 2022 (extracted from Hospital Acquired COVID-19 Dashboar d 22/03/22 From August 2021, the PHA has led on the roll out o f COVID-19 vaccination for all children and young people (including those at risk) and is currently leading on the vaccination of all over fives. Final preparations a re in place for the roll out of the 'Spring booster', which will be delivered during Ap ril and May 2022. A PHA Low Uptake Group was set up during the year t o identify and implement targeted interventions to support fair access and f air opportunity for everyone to receive their vaccine and thus contribute to increa sing overall population vaccine coverage. An online toolkit for professionals and wider community groups has been developed to use when trying to target areas of low vaccine uptake. This contains a number of examples of good practice from across Nor thern Ireland, as well as practical guides and patient testimonials. 21 Testing for COVID-19 The first positive COVID-19 case in Northern Irelan d was tested on 26 February 2020. In total, at the time of reporting (30 March 2022), a cumulative number of 5,702,409 COVID-19 PCR tests had been completed in Northern Ireland, and 3,012,210 lateral flow device (LFD) tests had been reported. Tests (PCR and LFD) by specimen date, 23 February 2 020 - 30 March 2022. Source: Department of Health: COVID-19 Daily Dashbo ard. The testing programme has evolved in the course of the pandemic to include a variety of technologies. During 2021/22 the PHA tes ting team has continued to work with colleagues across the region, including local test site partners, the Northern Ireland Expert Advisory Group for COVID-19 testing and the Northern Ireland Pathology Network, to develop the testing programme and ensure that it is delivered to a high standard. Staff have linked closely with colleagues working on the testing programmes in England, Scotland and Wales to share knowledge and resources. Pillar 1 Pillar 1 tests are those conducted within the Healt h and Social Care system. Initially this was only through laboratory-based PCR testing but in the course of the pandemic there has been an expansion in the number of technologies available. All HSC Trusts are able to provide COVID-19 testing to their patients and staff. In addition to standard PCR tests, there are now furth er laboratory-based tests with 22 shorter turnaround times and point of care tests wh ich can be done without the sample being transferred to a laboratory. These qui cker tests allow for rapid decision making in the healthcare system. Pillar 2 PCR testing Members of the public are able to access community testing by PCR through Pillar 2 testing sites. For example, during the last quarte r of 2021/22 there were up to five 'drive through' regional test sites and nine 'walk through' local test sites in Northern Ireland, accompanied by a fleet of mobile testing u nits. These mobile units are temporary sites that can be set up quickly in respo nse to local demand. Home testing kits are also available. Information on the Pillar 2 PCR testing sites is available on the PHA website. Lateral flow device (LFD) testing In the course of the last year, there has been sign ificant expansion in LFD testing in Northern Ireland. These rapid tests allow asymptoma tic individuals to test at home, with a result available within 30 minutes. Around o ne third of those with COVID-19 can have no symptoms, so taking a LFD test can iden tify the virus and help individuals to take appropriate steps to stop the s pread of the virus to others. Members of the public are able to order LFD tests o nline for home delivery or can collect them at local collection sites, including p harmacies. In addition, LFDs are available for staff in a variety of settings, inclu ding workforces, health and social care settings and care homes. In schools, all pupils in years 8-14 and all staff were offered LFDs. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) testi ng In 2021, worked with the Education Authorit y and Queen's University Belfast to introduce a programme of LAMP testing fo r pupils and staff at special schools in Northern Ireland. LAMP is a saliva-based test and was felt to be easier than nose and throat swab LFD testing for some chil dren who attend special schools. 23 The LAMP testing programme now uses a second labora tory, based at Ulster University, in addition to Queen's University Belfa st. The testing has been made available to some staff in HSC Trusts as an alterna tive to LFDs. 24 Contact Tracing Centre (CTC) The PHA Contact Tracing Service continued work in 2 021/22. While the successful introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine meant less sev ere disease in many people; the delta and omicron variants were much more trans missible and led to much higher numbers of cases than in previous waves. The PHA responded to this increased demand not only by increasing the headcount of our workforce at pace, but also by introducing a different model of working. We introduced a Tracing Technician role to trace non-c omplex cases which were triaged by the senior team. This also allowed us to focus effort on increasing the uptake of the Digital Self Trace platform which increased to around 30% at the peak of the delta wave. We refined the tracing script in response to each wave in orde r to ensure that the public health interventions for close contacts were timely. The return of schools and colleges in September 202 1 coincided with the peak of the delta wave. This caused a much higher workload for school leadership teams who had been supporting contact tracing by identifying in-school contacts. The definition of a school-aged contact was then revised in line w ith practice across the UK, and the PHA undertook the entire process. In parallel w e worked closely with colleagues in the Education Authority to support the establish ment of a helpdesk where they were the first point of contact for mainstream scho ols and PHA contact channels remained open for support for special schools. In order to provide resilience for the Contact Trac ing Service we continued to train staff from the wider PHA who were able to support d uring the delta and omicron waves when case numbers reached previously unseen l evels. Throughout the year, the PHA responded to various c hanges in policy and operations including for returning travellers, isol ation periods and close contacts. We supported the investigation of clusters, outbreaks and new variants. We provided vital information through our analytics strands tha t influenced modelling and 25 decisions on societal restrictions. The PHA continu ed to perform well even when case numbers exceeded all expectations. We are inc redibly proud of our achievements this year and the people who made them happen. The following charts illustrate the levels of contr act tracing cases over the period May 2020 to March 2022. CTC Cases per week 26 COVID-19 Vaccination Programme Under the direction of the Department of Health, th e COVID-19 vaccination programme has been successfully rolled-out in North ern Ireland, with over 3.7 million doses given to date (achieving 88.38% uptake of fir st doses in those over the age of 12). The PHA has been instrumental in supporting the del ivery of this programme with strategic involvement from the outset, through the provision of a public communication strategy, developing resources to enh ance the campaign, producing PGDs to facilitate vaccine administration, and prov iding expert advice to healthcare professionals and the general public. The programme has substantially reduced the risk from severe COVID-19 and is estimated to have prevented between 23.7 and 24.1 million infections and between 119,500 and 126 ,800 deaths in the UK to date. In advance of the transition of the COVID-19 vaccin ation programme to the PHA, the children's and young people vaccination programme h as been guided by the PHA immunisation team. In conjunction with paediatricia ns and Child Health Heads of Services, the PHA worked to identify cohorts of chi ldren requiring vaccination. Children were issued letters inviting them to bespo ke clinics arranged by each HSC Trust. The PHA communications team also worked to p roduce children-specific information leaflets for parents. While overall upt ake was low (approximately 35% of the estimated cohort), the child health teams were able to deliver vaccines to CEV children under very short timescales with most HSC Trusts offering clinics within three weeks of the announcement in July despite cha llenges such as venue and staff availability. In September 2021, the programme was extended to al l 12 to 15 year olds. Historically, immunisation programmes in school set tings have been successful, with Northern Ireland achieving excellent uptake rates f or other teenage immunisations such as HPV and School Leaver's Booster. With this model in mind, the PHA Immunisation Team worked with HSC Trust school nurs ing teams to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. With the assistance of the Educat ion Authority, the programme 27 was rolled-out through schools and vaccination was offered to all eligible post- primary school children in Northern Ireland by the end of January 2022. Surveillance of the COVID-19 vaccination programmes has been enhanced via a new digital analytics platform, the Vaccine Managem ent System (VMS). This functions as a clinical information system to captu re vaccine administration at the point of care and also permits multi-layered interr ogation of the data. It is used to generate dashboards to display vaccination uptake r ates and identify locations which may require additional resource or an increase in t he accessibility and convenience of vaccination availability. These dashboards have been used to re-invigorate CO VID-19 vaccine low uptake groups. This is a cross-directorate taskforce conve ned within the PHA to target interventions within communities and enable fair ac cess and opportunity for individuals to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. An action plan has been agreed to focus the efforts of all stakeholders within the lo w uptake groups, and a digital toolkit created which offers a collection of resources to s upport the development of targeted initiatives. The whole scale provision of this vaccination at a population level has had an impact on other vaccine programmes. In addition to monitor ing and responding to the anti- vax protests associated with this vaccination and i n particular the schools programme, there has been ongoing efforts across he alth and social care to make provision for all other vaccines. Despite this, the re has been a significant reduction in uptake of other vaccines including HPV, childhood v accine programmes, school leaver's vaccines and the shingles vaccine programm e. As the COVID-19 vaccination programme becomes embed ded into routine healthcare practice and transfers to a business as usual model, there is a planned transition of the adult vaccination programme to th e PHA. The investment and leadership demanded of this extensive programme has been reviewed and will require additional staffing resource, a review of c urrent processes and pathways in addition to new ways of working across the Health P rotection Directorate and the PHA. 28 HSC Research and Development There have been many direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and wellbeing, often exacerbating existing h ealth inequalities. The last 24 months have made patients, practitioner s, policy makers and the public more aware of the importance of research. They have seen how the development of vaccines and diagnostic tests and the identificatio n of treatments that both work, and don't work, for COVID-19 has relied on research, in particular clinical trials. Research conducted during the pandemic has made an immense p ositive impact on so many people's lives and offers us all hope for the futur e. The PHA Health and Social Care Research and Develop ment Division (HSC R&D) has been at the forefront of the coordination, admi nistration, support and funding of the HSC research ecosystem in Northern Ireland, in particular clinical trials infrastructure (see footnote page 30), to effective ly manage the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure we save lives, protect our HSC services and rebuild services to ensure the health and wellbeing needs of society are effec tively addressed. Almost 30,000 participants from Northern Ireland including staff, patients, carers, students, children and the wider public have now been recruited to par ticipate in COVID-19 research. As society seeks to look beyond the pandemic, HSC R &D Division is acutely aware that the recent priority focus on COVID-19 research , the re-direction of research resources to the care of COVID-19 patients and the impact of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 has had negative effects for other areas of research. Many studies were slowed or paused, while others have be en abandoned and some that were due to start are still pending. We now need to seize the opportunity to re- invigorate research in NI and build on the successe s seen with COVID-19 to re-start and grow research activity across all areas of heal th and social care. Clinical research has been critical to the treatment of citi zens during the pandemic and is even more crucial for our recovery. We need to move forward with research, setting an agenda that focuses on and is responsive to the most pressing health and social care needs of our society. 29 30 In addition to core R&D business, the Division was on call to support cross-agency activities, such as providing a Scientific and Tech nical Cell during the acute phase of the pandemic, re-deploying team members to support the contact tracing centre, and leading on activities in partnership with other gov ernment and academic institutions. These included: coordinating a local antibody serology study in pa rtnership with the universities and DAERA colleagues, which fed into the pandemic m odelling group; supporting the roll-out of the UK-wide COVID-19 in fection survey in Northern Ireland in partnership with the UK Office of Life S ciences, Department of Health and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency ; convening a Behaviour Change Group, drawing stakeh olders from across government and academic sectors to provide insights to various Departmental and Executive groups; and contributing to the creation of a UK-wide research participant registry of volunteers willing to take part in vaccine trials a nd other research with colleagues from the Department of Health and Social Care, the National Institute of Health Research and our counterparts from Chief Scientist Office in Scotland and Health and Care Research Wales. We are most grateful to all our partner organisatio ns with whom we were able to play our part in a highly effective response to the COVI D-19 crisis. *The clinical trials infrastructure refers to the n ecessary resources (human capital, financial suppor t, patient participants, information systems, regulato ry pathways, and institutional commitment) and the manner in which they are organised and brought toge ther to conduct a clinical trial. 31 Infection Prevention and Control During the year the PHA-led Infection prevention a nd control (IPC) Cell has continued to be an important forum for ensuring reg ional consistency of IPC practices across Northern Ireland and also for prov iding advice and guidance for organisations such as the Department of Education a nd care home providers. The PHA also has representatives on the National IPC Ce ll which ensures Northern Ireland input and influence to national guidance in cluding the development in year of 'Infection prevention and control for seasonal resp iratory infections in health and care settings (including SARS-CoV-2) for winter 202 1 to 2022' within Northern Ireland. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importanc e of IPC and therefore the PHA has commissioned work to develop a Regional IPC Framework and a Managed Care Network. This framework will be an excellent o pportunity to shape IPC practice across the HSC, improve standardisation and build c apacity of IPC Teams. We also aim to establish a Managed Care Network and this wi ll replace the current Regional IPC Cell. During the year, effective regional cluster and out break management has been undertaken by PHA Health Protection and HSC Trust I PC Teams with support from the IPC Cell. The IPC Cell has recently developed a standard operating procedure (SOP) to support Care Homes with the management of outbreaks. This outlines the actions required to be taken and will streamline th e process avoiding duplication. 32 Health Intelligence COVID-19 prompted a step change in the demand for p opulation health intelligence to inform the public, media, policymakers, health s ervice planners and researchers. Healthcare data were used to manage the direct care and contact tracing of patients, to measure the incidence and severity of COVID-19, to improve healthcare safety, to project the course of the epidemic and to address h ealth inequalities. The scale and pace of this data has continued durin g 2021/22 requiring adoption of new approaches towards work-flow, data architecture , storage, analysis and dissemination. We have used cloud-based architectur e, scheduled reports, deployed dashboards and leveraged each-others' knowledge by sharing code in an internally- hosted GitHub. We now have integrated health survei llance across routine datasets, including genomic data, following our participation in the COG-UK programme. PHA Analysts have over the course of the year been able to provide evidence about public knowledge, attitudes and behaviours associat ed with getting the COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and how mental health and social factors may influence the equity of vaccine coverag e (through work undertaken through the BSO Honest Broker Service). Direct public engagement about the use of health da ta was undertaken by the Northern Ireland Trusted Research Environment, supp orted by Health Data Research UK. The PHA participated in the HDR-funded Data and Connectivity Vaccines Pharmacovigilance research study and CO-CO NNECT project, which both featured exemplary personal and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). Our ability to deliver population-level health insi ghts at scale and speed has been greatly enhanced. 33 Population Screening Programmes Very high risk breast screening, newborn bloodspot, newborn hearing and screening for infections in pregnant women have continued uni nterrupted throughout the pandemic. All staff involved in these programmes sh ould be commended for ensuring that these critical services continued to be delivered to high standards and in a timely way during challenging times. A number of the population screening programmes wer e temporarily paused during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, so efforts in 2021/22 have focused on recovering these services and addressing the res ulting backlogs in invites. As each programme is delivered in a different way, the y have each faced different challenges in this rebuild process. The Breast Screening Programme has taken significan t steps to recovering the round length of screening (the time between screeni ng invites). While the standard is that women should be offered screening every 36 mon ths, this had stretched to 40 months by October 2020. Through the provision of ad ditional screening clinics, both in hours and out of hours, within mobile and static sites, as well as the engagement of Action Cancer to provide an additional 2,000 app ointments during 2021/22, by the end of March 2022 appointments were being offered t o women just 5 weeks over their due invite date. The Cervical Screening Programme has found it more difficult to recover backlogs due to continued pressures in primary care, laborat ories and colposcopy services. The programme continues to operate with a 5 month d elay in invitations and we will continue to keep this under close review exploring any possible opportunities to address and improve this position. The Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, aimed at m en aged 65, has taken some time to re-establish access to all their scree ning sites and has been working through the cohort of men who were due for screenin g in 2020/21. By the end of March 2022, 97% of the 2020/21 cohort were invited for screening and it is intended that the remaining will be invited by the end of Ju ne 2022. Invitations to men within 34 the 2021/22 cohort commenced in January 2022 and PH A continues to work with the Belfast Trust to explore options for further expand ing the capacity of the service to reduce these backlogs. The Diabetic Eye Screening Programme moved rapidly to a new model of providing services at a smaller number of fixed sites rather than at individual GP practices. As capacity has been limited due to constraints such a s social distancing and infection control requirements, a two year screening interval was also introduced for those at lower risk of sight threatening retinopathy. The pr ogramme has worked extremely hard over the last 18 months to screen as many part icipants as possible, and continues to identify and secure new screening venu es across Northern Ireland to support ongoing recovery and modernisation of the p rogramme. The Bowel Cancer Screening Programme introduced a n ew test for screening in January 2021, Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT). One of the key benefits of FIT is that it is an easier test kit to complete and st udies elsewhere had demonstrated that moving to FIT had increased participation in s creening. After one year of FIT in Northern Ireland, and despite the ongoing challenge s of the pandemic, provisional data suggests that we are in fact seeing improvemen ts in screening uptake, which is to be welcomed and will ultimately result in more c ancers being identified and treated at an early stage. The programme continues to opera te with backlogs in invites as a result of the pause in 2020. These are being reduce d in a managed way, with the anticipation that the programme will be fully resto red by autumn 2022. The pandemic has also created opportunities to show flexibility and to explore and trial new ways of working. A long term project with the Women's Resource and Development Agency (WRDA) to promote informed choic e in cancer screening moved from face to face sessions with community gro ups to a virtually delivered service. This ensured that this important work to p romote participation in cancer screening continued successively during the pandemi c. As we now move once again to in person meetings, the mode of delivery is shif ting back again. This hybrid model of service delivery is now likely to continue into the future to better meet the needs of the target population. 35 Allied Health Professionals (AHP) Development of Post-COVID syndrome services During the year PHA AHP and Nursing teams worked in collaboration with HSCB colleagues to lead the development and implementati on of services to support patients suffering the longer terms effects of COVI D-19 (post COVID syndrome). This ensured the appropriate allocation of AHPs and nurses in the primary care- facing multi-disciplinary clinics, bespoke pulmonar y rehabilitation services and post- ICU follow up clinics. Services are now available r egionally. AHP Non-medical prescribing (NMP) education and tra ining resources Education and training resources are now available to support the ongoing continued professional development of our AHPs involved in th e management of medications. This was identified as a gap through the Regional A HP NMP forum. Online mandatory training was developed in partnership wit h the Clinical Education Centre and will be available to support over 1,300 AHPs. T he PHA has worked with colleagues in the DoH and Northern Ireland Centre f or Pharmacy Learning and Development (NICPLD) to secure access to NICPLD res ources for the 200 AHP independent and supplementary prescribers. This wil l ensure NMP AHPs are able to maintain their competencies through ongoing continu ed professional development. Promoting health and wellbeing of residents in care homes PHA AHP and Nursing teams established and led a reg ional Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) with care home activity coordinators to promote meaningful activity and social interaction in their work with residents. These ECHO sessions allow sharing of information, advice and resources and provide an opportunity for activity coordinators to meet regio nally. In year sessions have included the themes of meaningful activity in care homes; bringing music activities to people living in care home settings; Christmas acti vities; intergenerational activity ideas; Montessori approach for ageing and dementia; and healthy ageing and physical activity awareness. Engagement in meaningful activity was also promoted by developing, in partnership with occupational therapy and care home partners, a resource to support care home 36 staff to promote meaningful activity. This resource is aimed at care home staff and provides helpful tips and advice on the importance of promoting activity and selecting suitable activities. AHPs in public health The Northern Ireland AHP Public Health Group, led b y the PHA, is responsible for progressing the goals of the UK AHP Public Health S trategic Framework 2019-2024. Over the course of the last 12 months the group has focused on key areas of the UK AHP Public Health Strategic Framework to highlight and strengthen the impact of AHPs in Northern Ireland. This includes population health, preventing and reducing health inequalities, raising awareness both among A HPs and throughout the HSC of the public health role of AHPs and highlighting the impact of AHP interventions on population health and health inequalities. We also established communication networks and accessibility to resources to support AHPs in developing their public health roles and sharing best practice, representin g AHPs in wider HSC staff health and wellbeing initiatives. 37 Partnering with People - Delivering on Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) and Patient Client Experience (PC E) The PHA has continued to support cultural change wi thin the HSC so that the active involvement of and partnership working with people with lived and living experience becomes the norm. In 2021/22 the PPI team focused o n building understanding, skills, knowledge and expertise in involvement, co- production and partnership working with HSC staff, service users and carers. Some 200+ participants have now undertaken the Lead ing in Partnership programme. A number of staff were also facilitated to achieve their Certificate of Professional Development or Advanced Practitioners Certificate in Involvement and our webinar series had almost 1,000 people engaged. This is key in helping to build capacity to effect real change through meaningful i nvolvement leading to improvements in quality, safety and efficiency. In 2021/22 there was growing commitment to embeddin g PCE methodologies into care homes in Northern Ireland, reaching out to res idents, relatives and staff. This included leading in collaboration with the Patient Client Council on an online survey to inform the Executive Plan for Visiting in Care H omes. Over 1,400 returns were analysed and provided valuable insight into how to improve the experience for residents, relatives and staff. This approach ensur ed the PHA Guidance on Visiting in Care Homes was person-centred and offered a balance to delive r a safe and meaningful plan. The work in care homes continues t o grow with development of a Snapshot survey and the implementation of the Onlin e User Feedback Service (OUFS) across the care home sector to support the v oice of residents and families. In 2021/22 Public Health Agency continued to lead o n the implementation of the OUFS, Care Opinion, across the whole of the HSC. Th ere are currently over 5,000 stories collated through the service and over 150 c hanges recorded as informed by the stories. This service delivers a two way feedba ck mechanism between the author and the service and the PHA have supported thematic analysis of key areas including vaccinations, primary care, general surge ry, children and young people and maternity and neonatal, to ensure the voices impact decisions at a strategic level. 38 Health Improvement Health Improvement has developed a 'Recovery Plan' focused on short term actions (2021/22), medium term (2022-25) and long term (202 5+). The Recovery Plan is presented using a theory of ch ange approach. The plan sets out a series of outcomes we have achieved over the 2021/22 financial year and those we are planning for the next four years, incl uding whom we need to work with and the actions we will undertake to meet the desir ed outcomes. Central to implementation of the Recovery Plan this year was the need to adjust and maintain health improvement services within the con text of COVID-19 and to enhance cross agency and external partnership worki ng. Progress against the desired outcomes of the Recove ry Plan has been strong. However, our ability to deliver at the anticipated pace and scale across all 20 thematic areas has been adversely impacted over the last few months by public health guidance/regulations and redeployment of 70% of staff. Some of the highlights across the four pillars of the plan for 2021/22 financial year are: 1. STRATEGY - Influence and align the policy of others to addr ess health inequalities and the wider determinants of heath: influence the tender process for rural support net works from the Department for the Agriculture, Environment and Rur al Affairs to include health inequalities; the submission of a collective response to the Men tal Health Strategy 2021-2031 and a response to the Crisis Services Rev iew; and implementation of Nutritional Standards across hea lthcare settings. 2. SYSTEM - Enhance multi-disciplinary working across our org anisation and towards a wider health and care system: establishment of a new internal team PHA Strategic Team for Mental and Emotional Wellbeing and Suicide Prevention and comm itment from local 39 PLIGS and Drug and Alcohol Coordination Teams to wo rk on common mental health, suicide prevention and drug and alco hol issues. 3. INFRASTRUCTURE - Work in partnership to plan and deliver for the places and communities we live in, and with: preparatory work with Department of Health, PHA, E nvironmental Health and local Council representatives regarding enforce ment for new legislation relating to smoking in cars with minors and age sales of electronic cigarettes. Tobacco Control Officers (fu nded by PHA) to have joint enforcement duties alongside the Police Servi ce of Northern Ireland. 4. PEOPLE - Deliver evidence based services: Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK to mai ntain both Needle and Syringe Exchange Service and Take Home Naloxone ser vices throughout the pandemic; and all PHA mental health, emotional wellbeing and sui cide prevention services and training programmes have been maintain ed and enhanced where needed throughout the last year, making adapt ations to manage COVID restrictions / guidance where necessary. Ser vices moved on-line and via telephone, with face to face services been maintained where necessary (within COVID guidelines). This includes regional services such as Lifeline and the Self Harm Intervention Pro gramme (SHIP). Lifeline received 33,979 calls and SHIP pr ovided support for almost 3,000 individuals and carers /families. This is only a snapshot of outcomes identified by s taff leads across health improvement for the 2021/22 Recovery Plan. A schema tic of the theory of change model is provided in the table overleaf. 40 Kings Fund Population Health Model Health Improvement (HI) Recovery Plan Strategic Pillars HI Recovery Plan Strategic priorities (conditions to be met) Making Life Better Themes PHA Corporate Outcomes Societal outcomes (PfG) The wider determinates of health Strategy (policy) Influence and align the policy of others to address health inequalities Give Every Child the Best Start Equipped Throughout Life Creating the Conditions Develop Collaboration All children and young people have the best start in life.

Through the group the PHA provide s advice and support, and shares learning across the HSC. Annual Quality Report In line with the implementation of the Quality 2020 Strategy , the PHA and HSCB have continued to produce an Annual Quality Report to showcase work that improves the quality, safety and effectiveness of h ealth and social care services. The report was developed to cover a range of topics and focuses on areas of work which firstly transform the culture of our organisa tion. It highlights the PHA/HSCB safety and quality governance structures and descri bes how we have worked to create a learning culture and continue to seek new ways to improve how we learn from errors. On World Quality Day in November 2021 the report wa s launched alongside other HSC Annual Quality Reports. Launching the reports o n World Quality Day enabled the PHA/HSCB and other HSC organisations to reinfor ce the importance of reviewing our work through an 'improving quality' l ens; and it enabled us to highlight the HSC system-wide approach to improving the quali ty of health and social care. 42 Health and Social Care Quality Improvement (HSCQI) HSCQI Regional Learning System A key priority for HSCQI in 2021/22 was to make fur ther progress on the establishment a HSC Regional Learning System. This built on the 90 day learning cycle approach undertaken in 2020/21 which identifi ed three key themes, namely, Staff Psychological Wellbeing, Virtual Visiting and Virtual Consultations. HSCQI continued in partnership with the regional Ex tension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) project team to support shared learning with a focus on data and evidence for improvement through monthl y learning sessions. The evaluation summary of these is outlined below: 43 Further engagement across the HSCQI network continu ed throughout 2021/22. Informed by these discussions the HSCQI Hub team co nducted a literature review focused on learning systems to identify a robust sc ale and spread framework. The IHI Framework for Going to Full Scale (below) was p roposed and subsequently endorsed by the HSCQI Leads and the HSCQI Leadershi p Alliance. IHI Framework for going to Full Scale QI Capability HSCQI have completed a scoping exercise with HSC Tr usts to identify staff that have completed level 3 Quality Improvement programm es (aligned with the Q2020 Attributes Framework). Between January and March 20 22 HSCQI extended this scoping exercise across all PHA Directorates to obt ain baseline data which will support future planning of quality improvement trai ning and activity in the PHA. In addition the HSCQI Hub team have explored option s to facilitate the delivery of level 4 quality improvement training for Boards. Th is training will be focused on the leadership behaviours and approaches necessary to b uild safety cultures and learning systems. 44 Communications during the pandemic Communicating effectively is a core foundation of p ublic health in any context but in a pandemic it is particularly vital to ensure that information is shared at the right time to the right audience and in the most appropriate f ormat so that the population is able to understand, accept and adhere to critical p ublic health guidance. In facing the many challenges presenting throughout 2021/22, the PHA's Communications team has continued to work proactive ly with internal and external stakeholders to deliver a sustained and agile multi -channel programme of communications across all aspects of pandemic manag ement. Team members have been embedded in strategic planni ng and delivery of all elements of the Test, Trace and Protect programme, leading communication for the testing programme in Northern Ireland and promoting and explaining the role of the Contact Tracing Service. This also included targete d communications to increase uptake of testing in local communities as new varia nts emerged as well as use of apps and digital self-trace to support contact trac ing. Throughout the year a significant volume of communi cations activity was undertaken to inform, advise and influence behaviour change wi th key target audiences. This was done through the creation and delivery of multi -channel communications, including proactive issuing of news releases, handl ing extensive media enquiries, an ongoing programme of mass media advertising campaig ns, multiple publications including alternative formats - easy read, braille, ISl/BSL, translations and online information, and developing graphics and video cont ent for the agency's social media channels - Facebook (currently around a quart er of a million followers), Twitter (currently over 32,000 followers) and Insta gram (currently over 12,000 followers). In the case of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, a diverse programme of sustained communications was essential in informing and encouraging uptake, particularly when the programme was extended out to the under-50s and younger audiences. Against a crowded communications backdro p characterised by a 45 significant scale of misinformed claims and counter claims the PHA has sought to achieve cut through of its messaging by focusing on the available evidence base and promotion of authoritative commentary from leading health experts at all times. During the year it was a priority for the team to e nsure that other significant public health messaging (non-COVID-19) was advanced. We su ccessfully delivered a sustained programme of proactive messaging on a bro ad range of public health portfolios across directorate areas, helping to ens ure that people continued to be empowered and informed around looking after their h ealth and wellbeing. A total of six Living Well campaigns were delivered in over 500 community pharmacies. The campaigns included: know your limit s (alcohol); be cancer aware; boost your immunity - flu and booster vaccination; healthier choices (weight control). FAST stroke symptom awareness and portion control/h ealthy weight campaign were also delivered. PHA communications also lead in ra ising awareness and encouraging support for preventing smoking in cars and the use of nicotine inhalation products in accordance with regulations introduced February 2022. Finally, the PHA Communications programme has over the past 10 years successfully increased awareness of and support for Organ Donation in Northern Ireland. The passage of legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly (Final Stage on 8 February 2022) and subsequent Royal Assent on 30 March 2022, which will introduce a new Opt Out system was widely welcomed across Northern Ireland and reflects positively on the role played by the PHA C ommunications and Knowledge Management team throughout. 46 New Planning Model and Population Health Planning Framework During 2021/22, the PHA has further developed a fra mework for population health planning. The framework aims to provide a practical guide of principles and actions to enable the shift towards and consistent implemen tation of population health planning. It draws on existing literature, framewor ks and Northern Ireland's experience so far and is intended as a practical gu ide to embarking on population health planning. Population health has been a key strategic directio n in Northern Ireland for many years as set out in the Programme for Government , Making Life Better Public Health Framework and Delivering Together Strategy . These documents advocate for, and recognise that, in order to have a real and lasting positive impact on improving the health and wellbeing of and reducing inequalities i n the communities we serve we must consider: the impact of and need to address health inequalit ies; the impact of the wider determinants and where we live; the need for collaboration and for whole system ap proaches; and the need for shared longer term outcomes. It is extensively documented that a shift towards p opulation health requires collaboration and coordinated efforts across a rang e of sectors and wider communities. This also means that accountability fo r population health is spread widely across sectors, organisations and communitie s and is not concentrated in single organisations or within the boundaries of tr aditional health care services. The New Planning Model for HSC is being developed w ith this in mind and is focused on population health planning, the need for collaboration and a whole system approach. Northern Ireland has many, if not all, of the requi red building blocks for a successful shift towards a collaborative population health pla nning approach. The challenge lies 47 in how we build on and join these strategies and bu ilding blocks together alongside evidence-based initiatives to create a systematic a pproach to improving population health within and across our communities. 48 Mental Health, Emotional Wellbeing and Suicide Prevention Strategic Planning Team In July 2021, the Agency Management Team agreed the development of a Strategic Planning Team (SPT) for Mental Health, Emotional We llbeing and Suicide Prevention, following submission of a joint paper f rom the Operations, Nursing and AHP and Public Health Directorates. The team, comprised of representatives from across the organisation, will work together to collaboratively plan and deliver PHA pr iorities and functions relating to mental health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prev ention and will develop a shared, collaborative, outcomes-based planning and performa nce framework that sets out the PHA's role and priorities and a clear action pl an. Mental health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prev ention are key priority areas and a major focus for the PHA. As focus turns to post-C OVID-19 rebuild and recovery and to the preparations for implementation of a new planning model; as well as the development and publication of a number of strategi es including a new Mental Health Strategy; it is important that the organisat ion has in place a connected approach across the organisation on how it plans an d implements actions to effectively address these issues in relation to men tal health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prevention. Such a collaborative planning structure will enable the organisation to work closely together across teams and create a more aligned app roach through shared priorities for mental health, emotional wellbeing and suicide prevention; combine resources effectively and demonstrate impact and outcomes in relation to achieving Corporate Strategy goals and objectives; and also show how it is contributing to delivering on the higher level outcomes set by the Northern Irela nd Executive in its Programme for Government . The aim of the team, as well as being a pilot for f uture SPTs, is to consider how PHA can work in a more connected way, harnessing skills , experience and knowledge from across the organisation and to enable more eff ective delivery of functions, 49 facilitate stronger links with other key strategic and thematic policy areas and demonstrate corporate agreement of decisions and ac tions. This approach also ensures organisational flexibility and corporate ov ersight through cross-directorate planning and delivery and will help PHA to react to external influences, prepare to support the new planning system and also to adapt t o any new PHA structure and future while continuing to deliver on key functions , duties and responsibilities. 50 Planning and Operational Services During 2021/22, Planning and Operational Services c ontinued to provide essential support to enable the Contact Tracing Service to op erate effectively. It also provided information governance expertise in assessing data protection issues linked to the sharing of personal information and the operation o f digital platforms such as the vaccine management system. Surge planning work undertaken in early 2021/22 ide ntified the need to hugely expand the Contact Tracing Service workforce to mee t forecast levels of infection. In response, in June 2021, Operations staff worked to ensure that the capacity in the existing Contact Tracing Centre was maximised and a lso prepared additional satellite offices for Contact Tracing Service staff to work from Belfast, Armagh and Londonderry. This was part of a phased expansion pl an that was developed. Additional ICT resources were procured and delivere d and workstations for the Contact Tracing Service established on the 3 rd and 4 th Floors of Linenhall Street as well as in the Towerhill and Gransha offices. The establishment of the Belfast office also allowe d the organisation to pilot a new model of contact tracing using Band 4 staff. This m odel has been operating since August 2021 and has been highly effective in provid ing additional capacity to meet the significant levels of demand for contact tracin g experienced since late June 2021. The temporary development of other satellite offices facilitated the training and redeployment of core PHA staff as well as providing increased flexibility for existing Contact Tracing Service staff. In addition to managing the expansion of the operat ional infrastructure for the Contact Tracing Service, Operations also led on the development of the business case for the Contact Tracing Service to ensure that the necessary funding was secured to support the scale and model of service r equired to meet changing demand throughout the year. During 2021/22, there continued to be a large focus on providing information governance input to support the response to COVID-1 9. Information governance 51 support to the testing service continued during the year to support colleagues expand and develop the testing programme. Also during the year the PHA become joint data cont roller with the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB), which became the Strategic Plann ing and Performance Group (SPPG) from 1 April 2022, for the personal data hel d by the COVID-19 and Flu Vaccine Management System (VMS). There was a large information governance input required to ensure the necessary arrangements were in place for managing all personal data in line with the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). PHA has also worked along with the Department of He alth (DoH) and the HSCB on the development and delivery of the COVID Certifica tion Service (CCS) and are Joint Data Controllers with DoH, and HSCB up to its migra tion to the DoH on 1 April 2022, for the personal information processed in the CCS a nd mobile App. The CCS solution provides citizens with an easily accessibl e, streamlined process for obtaining a certificate for use when providing evid ence of their COVID-19 status when required. In all instances where personal information is coll ected and processed, the necessary Privacy Notices and Data Protection Impac t Assessments (DPIAs), as required, were in place. Additionally, where sharin g of information occurs, the necessary Data Access Agreements/Data Sharing Agree ments are in place. Freedom of Information requests continue to rise si gnificantly. There have been a large number of COVID-19 related Freedom of Informa tion requests submitted this year, along with a range of other non-COVID-19 requ ests. More detail on this is provided in the section on Information Requests on page 62 of this document. These continue to be managed in line with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 . Forward Look 2022/23 Looking ahead to 2022/23, the PHA can be expected t o continue to focus a significant element of our resources on addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 52 and ensure that key interventions to contain and ma nage the virus, such as further roll out of the vaccination programme, targeted COV ID-19 testing, contact tracing, surveillance and public behaviour messaging are dep loyed in a proportionate and effective way and in line with emergent policy deci sions. While the PHA will continue to prioritise all actio ns necessary to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic it is important that in 2022/ 23 the PHA also focuses as much as possible on returning to 'business as usual ' and addressing our wider corporate priorities, such as health inequalities, which have been further exacerbated during the pandemic. Significantly, 2022/23 will see several strategic c hanges within the planning and delivery of Health and Social Care across Northern Ireland. From April 2022 the Health and Social Care Board has been replaced by a new Strategic Performance Planning Group (SPPG) under the direction of the Do H. New arrangements for the planning and commissioning of services will be stoo d up during the course of the year as a new Area Based Integrated Planning system is rolled out. The PHA will be required to engage fully to ensure we successfully optimise the potential for population health outcomes to be realised in partne rship with the wider HSC and other key bodies. At the same time there is also a need to plan how t he PHA as the strategic lead for public health in Northern Ireland needs to change, taking on board the learning from the pandemic response to date and developments acro ss health and social care and wider society, so that we ensure we have the approp riate skills, knowledge and expertise to best address the significant public he alth challenges facing Northern Ireland both now and in the future. To that end res ource will be focused on supporting the PHA/DoH review of our operating mode l and structures that commenced in the final quarter of 2021/22. 53 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPORT The HSCB Director of Finance supports the PHA in th e delivery of its core functions, including Financial Planning, Financial Governance, Financial Management and Financial Accounting services. Financial Planning At the outset of 2021/22 it was clear that the fina ncial impact of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic would continue to necessitate agi lity in managing the resources available to the PHA. The variability of the requi red response of the changing landscape during COVID-19 and its impact on PHA's c ore business activities was closely monitored to the opening financial plan ass umptions. Looking forward into 2022/23, the ongoing response to managing the COVID-19 pandemic, inescapable cost pressures, rebuilding co sts, inflation and the 2022/23 budget settlement requires the whole HSC system to continue to work closely together to ensure that resources are prioritised a nd sound financial management continues. PHA Financial Management and Stability The PHA received a revenue resource budget \u00a3134m in 2021/22, along with income from other sources of \u00a34m and a further \u00a314m capita l funding was allocated to PHA in the year. The financial statements presented in this Annual R eport and Accounts highlight that PHA successfully delivered its breakeven duty with a small revenue surplus of \u00a394k being reported. This was achieved by significant an d diligent efforts on the part of PHA budget holders supported by the Finance Directo rate (HSCB), in managing the wide range of slippage and pressures across both Pr ogramme and Management and Administration budgets set in the backdrop of the C OVID-19 response. The following charts highlight how the PHA's revenu e funds have been utilised during 2021/22. 54 a. PHA Net Expenditure by Area 2021/22 b. Programme Expenditure by Budget Area 2021/22 \u00a339.3 M \u00a318.5 M \u00a316.3 M \u00a30.8M Commissioning Net Expenditure 2021/22 (\u00a3m) Health Improvement Health Protection Service Development & Screening Research & Development Campaigns Nursing & Allied Health Connected Health 55 COVID-19 Allocations and Expenditure During 2021/22, specific ring-fenced allocations ea rmarked for COVID-19 were allocated to the PHA from DoH. These allocations to talled \u00a313.6m which allowed the PHA to support the region in its response to the pa ndemic. This included initiatives such as the operation of the regional Contact Traci ng Centre, enhancing the level of staffing within Infection Prevention and Control Nu rsing and in Health Protection to provide ongoing support and guidance across the reg ion and to increase the level of flu vaccinations available to the public. Long Term Expenditure Trends The following chart highlights how the main categor ies of expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure (SoCNE) have moved over the last 5 years. This relates to the revenue expenditure of t he PHA. Long Term Expenditure Trends (\u00a3m) Note: 'Other' includes establishment and premises e xpenditure and other items such as depreciation. 56 The impact of the additional expenditure in respect of the PHA's COVID-19 response is largely illustrated by the increase in expenditu re levels from 2020/21 2021/22. Prompt Payment Performance a) Public Sector Payment Policy - Measure of Compli ance The Department requires that PHA pay their non HSC trade payables in accordance with applicable terms and appropriate Government Ac counting guidance. The PHA's payment policy is consistent with applicable terms and appropriate Government Accounting guidance and its measure of compliance i s: \u00a372,467 5,764 \u00a359,103 Total bills paid within 30 day target or under agreed payment terms 6,992 \u00a368,086 5,433 \u00a358,173 % of bills paid within 30 day target or under agreed payment terms 98.6% 94.0% 94.3% 98.4% Total bills paid within 10 day target 6,215 \u00a358,902 4,836 \u00a355,986 % of bills paid within 10 day target 87.7% 81 .3% 83.9% 94.7% The PHA performed well above the 95% target for pay ments within 30 days, at 98.6% (2020/21, 94.3%) and has performed well above the 70% target of payments within 10 days, at 87.7% (2021/22, 83.9%). b) The Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations 2002 The PHA paid no late payment fees in 2021/22 (\u00a3nil for 2020/21). 57 Sustainability - Environmental, Social and Communit y Issues The Northern Ireland Executive Sustainable Developm ent Strategy Everyone's Involved was published in May 2010, setting out a vision fo r a peaceful, fair, prosperous and sustainable society. The strategy is based on the following principles: Living within environmental limits; Ensuring a strong, healthy and just society; Achieving a sustainable economy; Promoting good governance; Using sound science responsibly; and Promoting opportunity and innovation. The PHA is committed to the principles of sustainab le development and endeavours to integrate these principles into our daily activi ties. We seek to increase awareness of sustainable development within the PHA generally and to ensure that wherever possible our overall business activities support th e achievement of sustainable development objectives. To meet these objectives we will encourage energy a nd resource efficiency in all our offices through: Working with landlords to maximise energy efficien cy where possible; reminding staff to turn of lights, computers and o ther electrical equipment when not in use; where possible reducing the amount of printing; an d as and when appropriate disseminate sustainable de velopment best practice guidelines to staff. To use our natural resources responsibly, through: using recycled materials where possible; and promoting recycling of appropriate waste. 58 To reduce our carbon footprint through how we work, in particular through: promoting the use of tele-conferencing and video-c onferencing to reduce travel; supporting the use of travel smart schemes to prom ote the use of public transport; and supporting the cycle to work scheme. Equality and Diversity During 2021/22 the PHA completed the Five Year Revi ew of Equality Scheme. The review drew on what members of Tapestry, the disabi lity network for staff working in the PHA and its 10 regional HSC partner organisatio ns, had to say about barriers they still face. It also involved input from a rang e of teams across the organisation. A number of commitments have been made as a result of the review for the next five years of Equality Scheme delivery. Facilitated by the BSO Equality Unit (who provide s upport to us on equality matters) we hold two Disability Awareness Days every year. A major achievement has been the rise in the number of participants of the days. Two days were delivered during the year: on Dementia (in December 2021) and on Att ention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (in February 2022). The days included a li ve online session with an expert in the field (a health or social care professional or an individual with lived experience of the condition). The ensuing discussion on both d ays showed a keen interest from staff who are carers of a person with a disability. Sessions are recorded and then made available on the Tapestry website. This has en sured that staff can access the session at a time convenient to them. Rural Needs Act The purpose of the Act is to ensure that public aut horities have 'due regard' to the social and economic needs of people in rural areas and to provide a mechanism for 59 ensuring greater transparency in relation to how pu blic authorities consider rural needs when developing, adopting, implementing or re vising policies, strategies and plans and when designing and delivering public serv ices. The Act seeks to help deliver fairer and more equitable treatment for peo ple in rural areas which will deliver better outcomes and make rural communities more sus tainable. The Rural Needs Act has been embedded into the PHA's processes; the completion of the Rural Needs Impact Assessments has focused minds on the i mportance of the needs of rural dwellers, so that these are considered from a n early stage in any project. The PHA has carried out a number of Rural Needs Imp act Assessments for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, as part of de signing public services. Details are included in the table below. Description of the activity undertaken by the public authority which is subject to section 1(1) of the Rural Needs Act (NI) 2016 1. The rural policy area(s) which the activity relates to 2. Describe how the public authority has had due regard to rural needs when developing, adopting, implementing or revising the policy, strategy or plan or when designing or delivering the public service 3. Bereaved by suicide project: Facilitation of support networks for people bereaved by suicide and their role in influencing policy and service delivery Broadband or Mobile Communications in Rural Areas Health of Social Care Services in Rural Areas The Bereaved by suicide co-ordination, development and facilitation project is not a service for individuals. It is a project that supports individuals bereaved by suicide to influence policy and service delivery. The project will encourage participation through bereavement groups and local protect life implementation groups which have representation from Rural Networks and Rural Support. There are no costs to participate in the project. Those that wish to participate can do so in person, by phone or by electronic means. Stakeholder involvement has been undertaken as part of the review of the project. This was carried out via an online electronic survey in line with COVID regulations and included identification of gaps and barriers in relation to the current service model. Of the 26 responses, only one comment was made in relation to the need to strengthen links in some rural areas. The PHA has also carried out a wider involvement process to determine how the Protect Life 2 Strategy actions, for which the PHA is 60 responsible, can be delivered. Through this process the following issues around rural service provision were identified; Barriers around digital access must be considered e.g. digital poverty, many do not have digital skills, smart phones or good internet connection in rural areas; conversely digital services were also highlighted as a means of helping people in rural communities to be reached with a blended approach and cross departmental working highlighted as a means of addressing barriers. Stakeholders outlined a number of user groups who require support accessing services which included rural dwellers. Additional requirements will be included within the project to ensure direct connection with Rural Networks to raise awareness of the project and to encourage participation from rural communities. Publication in relation to the project will be promoted to groups currently funded by the PHA which include rural networks and community and voluntary organisations located within rural communities. Early intervention Support Service (EISS) - Regional Family Support Service across Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services in Rural Areas Deprivation in Rural Areas The aim of EISS is to deliver and coordinate personalised evidence based early intervention for children, young people and their families to support families when problems first emerge before the need for statutory involvement. As part of the development of EISS comprehensive stakeholder engagement was undertaken facilitated through the Children's and Young People's Strategic Partnership Outcomes Groups and Locality Planning Groups in collaboration with the Directors of Social Services within each health and social care trust locality. A lack of service provision and difficulty accessing services due to transport issues were identified in a number of rural areas. The locations and geographic spread for each EISS was agreed based on local need, emerging need and gaps in service provision. It was clear from the strategies, ongoing monitoring Information, evaluations and stakeholder involvement there is a need to continue to offer the EISS to children, young people and families in both rural and urban communities. Provider 61 organisations will be required to deliver EISS within the geographic areas identified with the aim of ensuring that children, young people and families in both urban and rural areas are supported to access the service. Providers will be required to provide links with Family Support Hubs, other community and voluntary services and others working in related areas such as drugs and alcohol, mental health etc. to ensure families have the ongoing support when their engagement with EISS is completed. Travel to rural areas in winter months and during inclement weather can on occasions cause some difficulties. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic EISS have adapted ways of delivering the service as face to face visits were not possible for a prolonged period of time. All EISS have the necessary technology to offer the EISS using a blended approach of face to face visits and virtual sessions on Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Virtual sessions will continue to be used to offer support to families on occasions when home visiting cannot be offered as an option. Maintaining the integrity and functionality of the National Breast Screening system in Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services in Rural Areas The following issues were considered in relation to the social and economic needs of people in rural areas: Accessibility of healthcare services - the project will have neither a positive or negative impact on the accessibility of healthcare services. No change to the current service configuration is planned. Employment, training and commuting - No change to current staffing of Breast Screening Units is planned. No change to the location of Breast Screening Units is planned. Opportunities for appropriate training in the new system will be offered to all staff at their normal place of work, so no additional travel needed. All Breast Screening Units are represented in the project management structure and will contribute to the project implementation plan. 62 Complaints The PHA received 60 complaints in 2021/22, 25 of th ese were related to COVID-19 testing and 11 to the Contact Tracing service. Crit ically appraising complaints is important and strict procedures are followed. If n eeded, staff take action to ensure any lessons learned are embedded in practice to pre vent recurrences. Learning is also shared to enable others to embed this learning into their area of work. Information Requests Between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 the followin g requests were made and responded to: 200 Freedom of Information Requests; and 7 Subject Access Requests. During the COVID-19 pandemic the PHA received a sig nificant increase in the number of Freedom of Information requests from the public. For comparison, in our 2019/20 and 2020/21 Annual Reports, we reported rec eipt of 44 and 144 Freedom of Information requests respectively, compared to the 200 requests reported in 2021/22. The majority of the Freedom of Information requests in 2021/22 related to COVID-19 (71%) but an increase in non COVID-19 rela ted requests was also noted. One personal data incident was reported to the Info rmation Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with other HSC Organisations, during 2021/22 (27 July 2021) and concerned the NI COVID Certification Service (CCS). Immediate steps were taken to stop the incident, an investigation was completed a nd measures were taken to prevent a repeat of the error. A further incident concerning payroll data processed by the BSO Payroll Service Centre (PSC) during 2021 /22 has been identified during the first weeks of April 2022. The incident was rep orted to the Information Commissioners Officer and an investigation was unde rtaken. The ICO notified BSO in May 2022 that no further action is necessary by the ICO on this occasion. 63 On behalf of the PHA, I approve the Performance Rep ort encompassing the following sections: Performance Overview.

State whether applicable accounting standards as s et out in FReM have been followed, and disclose and explain any material dep artures in the financial statements. Prepare the financial statements on a going concer n basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the PHA will continue in operation; and. Confirm that the Annual Report and Accounts as a w hole is fair, balanced and understandable and take personal responsibility for the Annual Report and Accounts and the judgements required for determinin g that it is fair, balanced and understandable. The Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health as Principal Accounting Officer for Health and Social Care Resources in Nor thern Ireland has designated Aidan Dawson as the Accounting Officer for the Publ ic Health Agency. The responsibilities of an Accounting Officer, includin g responsibility for the regularity and 79 propriety of the public finances for which the Acco unting Officer is answerable, for keeping proper records and for safeguarding the PHA 's assets, are set out in the formal letter of appointment of the Accounting Offi cer issued by the Department of Health, Chapter 3 of Managing Public Money Northern Ireland (MPMNI) and the HM Treasury Handbook: Regularity and Propriety. As the Accounting Officer, I have taken all the ste ps that I ought to have taken to make myself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that PHA's auditors are aware of that information. So far as I am aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware . 80 GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 1. Introduction / Scope of Responsibility The Board of the Public Health Agency (PHA) is acco untable for internal control. As Accounting Officer and Chief Executive of the PHA, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal governance t hat supports the achievement of the organisation's policies, aims and objectives , whilst safeguarding the public funds and assets for which I am responsible in acco rdance with the responsibilities assigned to me by the Department of Health (DoH). As Accounting Officer, I exercise my responsibility by ensuring that an adequate system for the identification, assessment and manag ement of risk is in place. I have in place a range of organisational controls, commen surate with officers' current assessment of risk, designed to ensure the efficien t and effective discharge of PHA business in accordance with the law and Departmenta l direction. Every effort is made to ensure that the objectives of the PHA are p ursued in accordance with the recognised and accepted standards of public adminis tration. A range of processes and systems (including Service Level Agreements (SLAs), representation on PHA Board, Governance and Audit C ommittee and regular formal meetings between senior officers) are in place to s upport the close working between the PHA and its partner organisations, prim arily the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) and the Business Services Organis ation (BSO), as they provide essential services to the PHA (including th e finance function) and in taking forward the health and wellbeing agenda. Systems are also in place to support the inter-rela tionship between the PHA and the DoH, through regular meetings and by submitting regular reports. 2. Compliance with Corporate Governance Best Practi ce The Board of the PHA applies the principles of good practice in Corporate Governance and continues to further strengthen its governance arrangements. The 81 Board of the PHA does this by undertaking continuou s assessment of its compliance with Corporate Governance best practice by internal and external audits and through the operation of the Governance and Audit Committee, with regular reports to the PHA Board. The PHA Board has also completed a self-assessment against the DoH Arm's Length Bodies (ALB) Board Self-Assessment Toolkit. Overall this shows that the PHA Board functions well, and identifies progress f rom the previous year. An action plan has been developed to take forward further imp rovements. Arrangements are in place for an annual declaration of interests by all PHA Board Members and staff; the register is publically avail able on the PHA website. Members are also required to declare any potential conflict of interests at Board or committee meetings, and withdraw from the meeting w hile the item is being discussed and voted on. 3. Governance Framework The key organisational structures which support the delivery of good governance in the PHA are: PHA Board; Governance and Audit Committee; and Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee. The PHA Board is comprised of a Non-Executive Chair , seven Non-Executive members, the Chief Executive and four Executive Dir ectors. During 2021/22, the PHA Board met on eleven occasio ns. The PHA Board meets regularly, usually monthly, with the exception of J uly. The Board sets the strategic direction for the PHA within the overall policies a nd priorities of the HSC, monitors performance against objectives, ensures effective f inancial stewardship, ensures that high standards of corporate governance are mai ntained, ensures systems are 82 in place to appoint, appraise and remunerate senior executives, ensures effective public engagement and ensures that robust and effective arrangements are in place for clinical and social care governanc e and risk management. All Board meetings were quorate.

The GAC has an in tegrated governance role encompassing financial governance, clinical and soc ial care governance and organisational governance, all of which are underpi nned by risk management systems. The GAC meets at least quarterly and curre ntly comprises of four Non- Executive Directors and is supported by the PHA's I nterim Director of Operations and the HSCB's Director of Finance. Representatives from Internal and External Audit are also in attendance. During 2021/22 the GA C met on five occasions and all meetings were quorate. The Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee adv ises the PHA Board about appropriate remuneration and terms of service for t he Chief Executive and other senior executives subject to the direction of the D oH. The Committee also oversees the proper functioning of performance appraisal sys tems, the appropriate contractual arrangements for all staff as well as m onitoring a remuneration strategy that reflects national agreement and Departmental P olicy and equality legislation. The Committee comprises the PHA Chair and three Non -Executive Directors; it normally meets at least once every 6 months. Dur ing 2021/22, the Committee met on two occasions and the meetings were quorate. 4. Framework for Business Planning and Risk Managem ent Business planning and risk management is at the hea rt of governance arrangements to ensure that statutory obligations a nd ministerial priorities are properly reflected in the management of business at all levels within the organisation. The PHA Corporate Plan 2017 - 2021 , setting out the PHA purpose, vision, values and strategic outcomes, was approved by the PHA Boa rd on 20 April 2017 and by the DoH on 26 May 2017. This was rolled forward in to 2021/22 as advised by the Department of Health (DoH), in line with governance processes required during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Annual Business Plan 2021/2 2, which sets out the actions to be taken forward in the PHA Corporate Pl an, taking account of DoH 84 guidance and priorities, was approved by the PHA Bo ard on 17 June 2021. Both documents were developed with input from the PHA Bo ard and staff from all Directorates and engagement with external stakehold ers. The PHA's Risk Management Strategy and Policy expli citly outlines the PHA risk management process which is a 5 stage approach - ri sk identification, risk assessment, risk appetite, addressing risk and reco rding and reviewing risk, as follows: Stage 1 - Risk Identification Risks are identified in a number of ways and at all levels within the organisation corporately, by Directorate and by individual staff members. Risks can present as external factors which impact on the organisation b ut which the organisation may have limited control over or operational which conc ern the service provided and the resources/processes available and utilised. Withi n the organisation risk identification is related to the organisation's obj ectives (as detailed in the PHA Corporate Plan). Each risk identified is correlated to at least one of the corporate objectives. Risks are also aligned with the relevan t performance and assurance dimensions as identified in the DoH Framework Docum ent. Stage 2 - Risk Assessment Each risk is assessed to identify: The impact that the risk would have on the business should it occur, and The likelihood of the risk materialising. The PHA is committed to adhering to best practice i n the identification and treatment of risks and works to the principles, fra mework and processes for Risk Management as contained in ISO 31000: 2018 and also adheres to the HSC Regional Risk Matrix (April 2013; updated June 2016 and August 2018). 85 Stage 3 - Risk Appetite The PHA carefully considers its risk appetite, i.e. the extent of exposure to risk that is judged tolerable and justifiable. The PHA recogn ises that it is operating in an environment where safety, quality and viability are paramount and are of mutual benefit to service users, stakeholders and the orga nisation alike. Consequently, and subject to controls and assurances being in place, the PHA will generally accept manageable risks which are innovative and which pre dict clearly identifiable benefits, but not those where the risk of harm or a dverse outcomes to service users, the PHA's business viability or reputation i s significantly high and may outweigh any benefits to be gained. Risk appetite i s built into the risk assessment process as outlined above. Stage 4 - Addressing the Risk Whilst there are four traditional responses to addr essing risk (terminate, tolerate, transfer and treat), in practice within the PHA the vast majority of risks are managed via the \"Treat\" or \"Tolerate\" route, both of which are underpinned by the identification of an action plan to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the risk. Stage 5 - Recording and Reviewing Risk Within the PHA the risk management process is recor ded and evidenced through the maintenance of Directorate and Corporate level Risk Registers. To ensure the robustness of the PHA's system of int ernal control, fully functioning Risk Registers at both Directorate and Corporate le vels are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis, ensuring that risks are manag ed effectively and efficiently to meet PHA's corporate objectives and to continuously improve the quality of services. Processes are established within each Directorate e nabling risks to be identified, controls and/or gaps in controls highlighted and, w here relevant, action to be taken to mitigate the risk. Directors and senior officers also identify risks which require 86 escalation to the Corporate Risk Register. The Interim Director of Operations is the PHA Execu tive Board member with responsibility for risk management. The Corporate R isk Registers are reviewed quarterly by the Agency Management Team (AMT) and G overnance and Audit Committee (GAC). Directorate Risk Registers are als o reviewed by AMT and the GAC on a rotational basis. The minutes of the GAC a re brought to the following PHA Board meeting, and the Chair of the GAC also pr ovides a verbal update on governance issues including risk. The Corporate Ris k Register is brought to a PHA Board meeting at least annually, most recently on 1 7 June 2021. During 2021/22, guidance and support was provided to staff who are actively involved in reviewing and co-ordinating the review of the Directorate and Corporate Risk Registers. A system has been established where by the Senior Operations Manager meets with the planning and project manager s supporting each Directorate and Division at the end of each quarter to ensure feedback and consistency in the review of the Risk Registers, an d to share and learn from good practice. All staff are required to complete the PHA risk man agement e-learning programme. In addition, staff have also been provided with oth er relevant training including fire, health and safety, security and fraud awareness. All policies and procedures in respect of risk mana gement and related areas are available to all staff through the PHA intranet (Co nnect) site. 5. Information Risk The PHA has robust measures in place to manage and control information risks. The designated Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) for the management of information risk at Board level is the Interim Dire ctor of Operations. The Interim Director of Public Health as the Personal Data Guar dian (PDG) has responsibility for ensuring that the PHA processes satisfy the hig hest practical standards for handling personal data. Assistant Directors as Info rmation Asset Owners (IAOs) are 87 responsible for managing and addressing risks assoc iated with the information assets within their function and provide assurance to the SIRO on the management of those assets. The Interim Assistant Director Pla nning and Operational Services as the Data Protection Officer (DPO) has responsibi lity for monitoring and advising on data protection. The PHA's Information Governance Steering Group (IG SG) has the primary role of leading the development and implementation of the I nformation Governance Framework across the organisation, including ensuri ng that action plans arising from Internal and External Audit reports and the In formation Management Checklist are progressed. The Group is chaired by the SIRO an d membership includes all the IAOs, PDG, a Non-Executive Board member and relevan t governance staff. The IGSG is scheduled to meet three times per year and provides a report to the GAC following each meeting. During 2021/22 the IGSG met twice due to COVID-19 pressures faced by staff and a meeting to report th e year end position will take place in the first quarter of the 2022/23 year. The PHA's Information Governance Strategy (incorpor ating the Information Governance Framework) 2018-2022 sets out the framew ork to ensure that the PHA meets its obligations in respect of information gov ernance, embedding this at the heart of the organisation and driving forward impro vements in information governance within the PHA. The Strategy was reviewe d and approved in 2018 in line with UK GDPR and DPA 2018. This is supported b y annual Action Plans setting out how it will be implemented. Alongside this, a r ange of policies and procedures are in place, including Data Protection/Confidentia lity Policy, Data Breach Incident Response Policy and a Data Protection Impact Assess ment Policy and Guidance. The PHA has documented and agreed procedures in pla ce to ensure compliance with the requirements of UK GDPR and DPA 2018. The PHA 'Connect' intranet site provides staff with easy access to the latest PHA policies, news and resources. Through the use of th is site the PHA ensures that all staff have access to information governance policie s and procedures. 88 Information asset registers are in place, and are k ept under review. Information risks are assessed and control measures are identif ied and reviewed as required. Where appropriate, information risks are incorporat ed in the Corporate or Directorate Risk Registers. The HSC information governance e-learning programme , incorporating Freedom of Information, Data Protection, Records Management an d IT Security/cyber security continues to be rolled out to all staff. Specialise d training is also organised for the SIRO and IAOs however, during 2021/22, no training sessions took place due to COVID-19 pressures faced by staff within PHA. Duri ng this time staff were supported by the IG team. Uptake of training is m onitored by the IGSG. The PHA is represented on the regional HSC Cyber Se curity Programme Board, and works with BSO ITS, as our IT provider, to take nec essary measures in relation to cyber security risks. One personal data incident was reported to the Info rmation Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with other HSC Organisations, during 2021/22 (27 July 2021) and concerned the NI COVID Certification Service (CCS). Immediate steps were taken to stop the incident, an investigation was completed a nd measures were taken to prevent a repeat of the error. A further incident concerning payroll data processed by the BSO Payroll Service Centre (PSC) during 2021 /22 has been identified during the first weeks of April 2022. The incident was rep orted to the Information Commissioners Officer and an investigation was unde rtaken. The ICO notified BSO in May 2022 that no further action is necessary by the ICO on this occasion. 6. Fraud The Public Health Agency (PHA) takes a zero toleran ce approach to fraud in order to protect and support our key public services. We have put in place an Anti-Fraud and Anti-Bribery Policy and Response Plan, which wa s updated during 2021/22, to outline our approach to tackling fraud, define staf f responsibilities and the actions to be taken in the event of suspected or perpetrated f raud, whether originating internally or externally to the organisation. Our F raud Liaison Officer promotes fraud 89 awareness, co-ordinates investigations in conjuncti on with the BSO Counter Fraud and Probity Services team and provides advice to pe rsonnel on fraud reporting arrangements. All staff are supported in fraud awar eness in respect of the Anti- Fraud Policy and Fraud Response plan, which are kep t under review and updated as appropriate. A fraud report is brought to the GAC on a regular b asis. 7. Public Stakeholder Involvement In the HSC there is a statutory duty to Involve and Consult and there are PPI policy responsibilities for which the PHA carries leadersh ip responsibilities. In 2021 /22 the PPI team focussed on building understanding, skills , knowledge and expertise in Involvement, Co-Production and Partnership Working with HSC staff, service users and carers . Some 200+ participants have now undert aken the Leading in Partnership programme. A number of staff were also facilitated to achieve their Certificate of Professional Development or Advanced Practitioners Certificate in Involvement and our webinar series had almost 1,000 people engaged. The PHA has continued to support cultural change wi thin the HSC, to one where the active involvement of and partnership working with people with lived and living experience is the norm. In 2021/2022 Public Health Agency continued to lead on the implementation of the Online User Feedback Survey, Care Opinion, across the whole of the HSCNI. There are currently over 5000 s tories collated through the service and over 150 changes recorded as informed b y the stories. The PHA recognises that Personal and Public Involve ment (PPI) is core to the effective and efficient commissioning, design, deli very and evaluation of HSC services. PPI is the active and meaningful involvem ent of service users, carers and the public in those processes. In commissioning s ervices, PHA actively considers PPI in all aspects of the commissioning process, en suring that the input of service users and carers underpins the identification of co mmissioning priorities; in the development of service models and service planning; and in the evaluation and monitoring of service changes or improvements. 90 The PHA is also cognisant of recent policy developm ents in this wider area; the 'Co- Production Guide for Northern Ireland - Connecting and Realising Value through People ' (DoH, 2018) a practical guide, available at www.health-ni.gov.uk , to a co-production approach across the health and social care system. The guide was developed as part of the DoH's programme of work to transform he alth and social care as envisaged in 'Delivering Together 2026'. 8. Assurance The Governance and Audit Committee provides an assu rance to the Board of the PHA on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls in operation within the PHA. It assists the PHA Board in the discharge of its functions by providing an independent and objective review of : all control systems; the information provided to the PHA Board; compliance with law, guidance, Code of Conduct and Code of Accountability; and governance processes within the PHA Board. Internal and External Audit have a vital role in pr oviding assurance on the effectiveness of the system of internal control. Th e GAC receives reviews and monitors reports from Internal and External Audit. Internal and External Audit representatives are also in attendance at all GAC m eetings. The Chair of the GAC reports to the PHA Board on a regular basis on the work of the Committee. The PHA Board also receives regular assurances through the financial and performance reports brought to it by the HSCB Director of Finance and PHA Interim Director of Operations. The PHA Assurance Framework sets out a systematic a nd comprehensive reporting framework to the Board and its committees and is normally reviewed twice 91 yearly. However, following a review of the Assuran ce Framework by the GAC in April 21, it was agreed that fuller discussions sho uld take place regarding the Framework and it is considered as part of a wider r eview of all PHA Board Performance Reporting processes, which will be comp leted by September 2022. The PHA continues to ensure that data quality assur ance processes are in place across the range of data coming to the PHA Board. W here gaps are identified, the PHA proactively seeks to address these, for example by the development and regular review of the Programme Expenditure Monitor ing System (PEMS) to ensure comprehensive and robust information. Information presented to the PHA Board to support d ecision making, is firstly presented to, and approved by, the Agency Managemen t Team (AMT) and the Chief Executive, as part of the quality assuran ce process. Relevant officers are also in attendance at Board meetings when appropria te, to ensure that members have the opportunity to challenge information prese nted. The PHA has in place an effective whistleblowing po licy based on the HSC Whistleblowing Framework and Model Policy, develope d in collaboration with the DoH and HSC organisations in response to the recomm endations arising from the RQIA Review of the Operation of HSC Whistleblowing arrangements 2016. 9. Sources of Independent Assurance The PHA obtains Independent Assurance from the foll owing sources: Internal Audit Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQI A) In addition, the PHA receives an opinion on regular ity from the External Auditor in the Report to Those Charged with Governance. Internal Audit The PHA utilises an Internal Audit function which o perates to defined standards 92 and whose work is informed by an analysis of the ri sk to which the body is exposed and annual audit plans are based on this an alysis. In 2021/22 Internal Audit reviewed the following systems: System reviewed Level of Assurance* Financial Review Satisfactory - Non Pay Expenditure, Budgetary Control and Financial Reporting to the Board Limited - Payments to Staff Recruitment of Vaccinators Satisfactory Performance Management Limited Serious Adverse Incidents 1 Limited Board Effectiveness Limited 1 Joint HSCB and PHA audit * Internal Audit's definition of levels of assuranc e: Satisfactory : Overall there is a satisfactory system of governa nce, risk management and control. While there may be some residual risk identified, t his should not significantly impact on the achievement of system objectives. Limited : There are significant weakness within the governa nce, risk management and control framework which, if not addressed, could lead to th e system objectives not being achieved. Unacceptable: The system of governance, risk management and contr ol has failed or there is a real and substantial risk that the system will fail to meet its objectives. Limited Internal Audit Reports - Summary of Finding s/Recommendations Financial Review The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was split. Satisfactory assurance was provided in respect of Non Pay Expenditure, Bud getary Control and Financial Reporting to the Board processes but a limited assu rance was provided in relation to Payments to staff. The limited assurance was pro vided on the basis that issues were identified in relation to additional payments, largely relating to additional hours worked during the COVID-19 response. New starts, l eavers and contract changes were not processed on a timely basis, resulting in over and underpayments. There were no Priority 1 recommendations made in th is report and seven of the eight priority 2 recommendations are planned to be implem ented by June 2022. 93 Performance Management The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was limited. Limited assurance was provided on the basis that a formally defined p erformance management framework is not in place and a comprehensive perfo rmance report was not presented to the Agency Board. In addition, Key P erformance Indicators have not been developed and measured against for new service areas of PHA, for example Contact Tracing. There were 1 priority one and 1 priority two recomm endations made in this report. Some actions have already been implemented in relat ion to the priority one recommendation and all remaining recommendations ar e due for implementation by 30 June 2022. Serious Adverse Incidents The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was limited. The limited assurance was provided on the basis that significan t issues were identified in relation to the Serious Adverse Incident processes within the HSCB and PHA. In particular, internal audit findings highlighted that HSCB and PHA do not have a joint accountability mechanism in place to ensure e ach partner delivers their respective responsibilities. Also, delays in the d issemination of learning documentation and the cancellation of professional group meetings to consider serious adverse incident reports were highlighted b y internal audit. The lack of a detailed Annual Quality report to the PHA Board and also the need to take forward the Joint Improvement Plan to improve Serious Adver se Incident processes across PHA and HSCB were also noted. There were no Priority 1 recommendations made in th is report and of the six priority 2 recommendations two have already been im plemented and the remaining recommendations are due for implementatio n by October 2022. Board Effectiveness The internal audit opinion in respect of this repor t was limited as at the time of the audit fieldwork (November 2021). The limited assura nce primarily related to a need to improve understanding of, and working betwe en, Executive/Non Executive 94 roles and to improve performance management and oth er reporting to the Board. Internal Audit have noted that the issues leading t o a Limited assurance opinion in November 2021 have largely been addressed in the in terim period up to March 2022 however, whilst recognising the improvements, was of the view that there is a need, with time, to embed and consolidate Board w orking relationships / collaboration further. Follow Up on Previous Recommendations The Internal Audit Follow Up report on previous Int ernal Audit Recommendations, issued on 5 April 2022, found that of the 59 recomm endations with an implementation date of 31 March 2022 or earlier, 78 % (46 recommendations) were fully implemented and 22% (13 recommendations) were partially implemented. Work will continue during 2022/23 to address those recommendations that have not yet been fully implemented. 2 priority one weaknesses in control remain outstan ding: PHA Management of Contracts with the Voluntary/Com munity Sector audit, relating to the implementation of the PHA Social Ca re Procurement Plan; and Performance management systems at a corporate leve l. Both recommendations have been partially implemente d; however during the year progress was limited due to the re-prioritisat ion of staff to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic response. Work will continue in the 2022/23 year to fully address these recommendations. BSO Shared Services Audits A number of audits (summarised below) have been con ducted in BSO Shared Services, as part of the BSO Internal Audit Plan. T he recommendations in these Shared Services audit reports are the responsibilit y of BSO Management to take forward and the reports have been presented to BSO Governance and Audit Committee. 95 System reviewed Level of Assurance received Payroll Service Centre (PSC) Satisfactory - Elementary PSC processes Limited - End-to-End Manual Timesheet Processing, SAP / HMRC RTI Reconciliation Accounts Receivable Satisfactory Recruitment Shared Service Centre (RSC) Satisfactory - RSSC Processing Activities Limited - HSC Recruitment processes * Regional Interpreting Service Satisfactory Accounts Receivable Shared Service Satisfactory * It is appreciated that the HSC Recruitment proces s, and therefore this assurance, is outside BSO's sole responsibility and is relevant to all HSC orga nisations. Overall Opinion In her Annual Report, the Head of Internal Audit pr ovided the following opinion on the PHA's system of internal control: Overall for the year ended 31 March 2022, I can pro vide satisfactory assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisation' s framework of governance, risk management and control. However I would highlight that Limited assurance has been provided in a considerable proportion of audit s during the current financial year. I am satisfied that prompt Management action has al ready been taken in response to the significant matters raised in the Board Effecti veness and Performance Management audit reports in particular. All of the Limited assurances provided in 2021/22 are related at least in part, to the impact of COVID-19 on PHA operations and the organisation's focus on the COVID-19 respon se. In 2022/23, I advise PHA to address the remaining outstanding audit recommen dations and ensure Management focus is maintained on key governance, r isk and control processes across the core functions of the organisation. RQIA The HSCB/PHA has in place a Regional Safety and Qua lity Alerts Procedure which oversees the identification, co-ordination, dissemi nation and assurance on implementation of regional learning issued by the H SCB/PHA/DoH/RQIA and other independent/regulatory bodies. Once a Safety and Qu ality Alert (SQA) has been issued to Arm's Length Bodies (ALBs) it is the resp onsibility of the HSCB/PHA to 96 ensure adequate responses on assurances to the acti ons specified within relevant SQAs have been implemented accordingly. This proces s is overseen by relevant directors within the HSCB and PHA by way of weekly Safety Brief Meetings. External Audit For the year ended 31 March 2021, the Comptroller a nd Auditor General gave an unqualified audit opinion, without modification, on the financial statements. No findings were identified during the course of the a udit and no recommendations were made. 10. Review of Effectiveness of the System of Intern al Governance As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for th e review of effectiveness of the system of internal governance. My review of the eff ectiveness of the system of internal governance is informed by the work of the Internal Auditors and the executive managers within the PHA who have responsi bility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework, and comments made by the External Auditors in their management letter and other repor ts. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effe ctiveness of the system of internal control by the Governance and Audit Committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement to the system is in place. 11. Internal Governance Divergences a) Update on prior year control issues which have n ow been resolved and are no longer considered to be control issues Neurology Call Back Due to concerns being raised in relation to the pra ctice of a consultant neurologist at the Belfast Trust including work he undertook on be half of other Trusts and in relation to his private practice, the HSCB and PHA, at the direction of the DoH, 97 established a regional Coordination Group (which in cluded Trust representatives and relevant independent sector providers) to co-ordina te the work necessary to complete a call-back review of those patients who r emained under active review of the consultant (phase 1). This was followed by two call-backs of a defined cohorts of patients who had been seen by the consultant and wh ose care was subsequently returned to primary care (phases 2 and 3). The PHA has worked closely with the HSCB, Trusts an d independent providers to ensure that a consistent approach has been taken re lating to the call back and review of patients who may be affected including pr oviding consistent situation reports to the DoH on activity and progress. Phase 1 of the call-back exercise was completed in 2018 and a report on the activity and outcomes associated with Phase 1 was published. Phase 2 was completed in October 2019 and a report on the activity and outcomes associated with Phase 2 was published. Phase 3 of the call-back was completed in 2021 and a report has been submitted to the DoH in early 2022. This has yet to be publishe d. Cyber Security Incident at Queens University Belfas t A cyber security incident took place at Queens Univ ersity Belfast (QUB) in February 2021. As the HSC has multiple contractual interact ions with QUB, some concerning personal information, the HSC technology teams, wit h the backing of the HSC SIROs, took a number of actions to reduce potential disruption to HSC services, and continue to liaise with QUB on the impact of the cy ber incident. The impact on the HSC was fully investigated as described below. Following the incident, HSC Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and BSO progressed actions with supplier/partner organisati ons since the cyber-attack. These focused on: 98 1. Seeking assurance on the technical efforts being made by QUB to \"harden\" their defences and bring them to a level which would give sufficient confidence to HSC of the infrastructure and technical defences, inclu ding the training and awareness of staff. 2. Mapping and recording data flows between the org anisation affected, and the HSC, on an organisation-by-organisation basis. See king information on the measures being taken by the Supplier/partner to ass ure the security of HSC patient or client information held in partner/suppl ier systems, and determining what proof exists of a data breach due to the exfil tration of patient data from their systems during the cyber-attack. 3. Agreeing a protocol that all HSC organisations w ill use going forward, in order to restore data flows and technical connections throug h a risk-managed process, with the agreement of all HSC SIROs. 4. Bringing forward a revised corporate risk throug h Trust governance processes, which recognises the risk of an Information securit y breach through a supplier/partner cyber-attack. This will enable th e mitigation measures to be described and the risk appetite of organisations to be considered through corporate processes. HSC SIROs, BSO and lead officers in the cyber progr amme regionally met regularly throughout this process, to consider the position o n the impact to the HSC and to the restriction of our transfer of information to/from QUB. There was specific and detailed attention paid to the mitigation actions carried ou t to QUB and to the root cause analysis. On the basis of this information, and the assessed position, it was agreed that HSC SIROs would recommend a restoration of network conn ections with QUB, and that services should fully resume, subject to ongoing mo nitoring of the position with QUB through contract monitoring processes. All services were reconnected on 8 July 2021. 99 As work on this internal control divergence has com pleted no further action is required. b) Update on prior year control issues which contin ue to be considered control issues Financial Performance While the budget for Health and Social Care in Nort hern Ireland continues to be challenging and set in the context of managing sign ificant additional financial pressures relating to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSCB approved a financial plan in June 2021 on its financial posi tion and direct resources. Financial performance against this plan has largely remained in line this this plan during the financial year and HSCB achieved a breakeven financ ial position in 2021/22. Budget Position and Authority: The Assembly passed the Budget Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 in March 2022 which authorised the ca sh and use of resources for all departments and their Arms' Length Bodies for the 2 021-22 year, based on the Executive's final expenditure plans for the year. T he Budget Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 also authorised a Vote on Account to authorise departments and their Arms' Length Bodies' access to cash and use of resources for the early months of the 2022-23 financial year. This will be followed by th e 2022-23 Main Estimates and the associated Budget Bill based on the Budget agreed b y the incoming Executive following the Assembly Election. This will authoris e the cash and resource balance to complete for the remainder of 2022-23. Budget Forward position: Following the resignation of the First Minister and the subsequent lack of an Executive, a Budget for 2022- 23 could not be finalised. The Finance Minister wrote to departments to set out a way forward in the absence of an Executive to agree a Budget. This process involved DoF issuing departments with contingency planning envelopes for the 2022-23 fina ncial year. These envelopes provided departments with an assessment of the mini mum funding they could reasonably expect for 2022-23 and allowed departmen ts to plan for expenditure until such times as a Budget could be agreed. 100 An approach has been agreed with the Minister to en able opening allocations to proceed to continue to fund activity at current lev els in 2022/23 while controlling spending in line with the advice from the Finance M inister. However there remains a great deal of uncertainty on the future financial p osition. The Department's reliance on significant levels of non-recurrent funding in r ecent years means that we are expecting to face an extremely challenging financia l outlook. While we are anticipating significant allocations for Health onc e a Budget is agreed the 2022/23 budget will continue to require careful managing in order to develop a break even position. Management of Contracts with the Community and Volu ntary Sector Previous Internal Audit reports on the management o f health and social wellbeing improvement contracts have provided satisfactory as surance on the system of internal controls over PHA's management of health a nd social wellbeing contracts reflecting the significant work that has been under taken by the PHA. Service Level Agreements are in place, appropriate monitoring arr angements have been developed and payments are only released on approva l of previous progress returns. During 2021/22 we reviewed contract activ ity and agreed revised performance measures based on individual organisati ons ability to continue to deliver core services or re-purpose their resources to support wider emergency response plans. PHA has also highlighted to provide rs their legal duty to ensure they did not access duplicate funding under the Furlough scheme or other grant schemes available to cover costs already covered by PHA fun ding. An audit of the processes put in place to manage the COVID-19 response identi fied no significant issues. Work continues to fully address the partially imple mented priority one weakness in control relating to the implementation of the PHA S ocial Care Procurement Plan. PHA's ability to continue to implement the Procurem ent Plan since March 2020, has however been significantly impacted by the need to prioritise staffing resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021/22, the PHA Procurement Board has conti nued to progress plans for the re-tender of Drug and Alcohol services and Rela tionship and Sexual Education 101 services as far as possible given the limitations r esulting from the need to prioritise the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following an engagement exercise with stakeholders on the Drug and Alcohol re- tender process the PHA and DoH agreed a delay to th e procurement exercise to ensure maximum alignment with both the new regional Drug and Alcohol strategy launched by the Minister in September 2021 and ongo ing work in regard to the commissioning of mental health and suicide preventi on support services linked to the delivery of the Protect Life 2 strategy. Further implementation of the report of a Task and Finish Group established to review how the PHA could improve its planning and p rocurement processes has been delayed due to COVID-19. Two new senior planni ng posts appointed to provide additional specialist capacity to support planning for procurement have been re- directed temporarily to support the Contact Tracing service. Implementation of the recommendations remains a priority for the PHA and will be addressed when appropriate staff have the capacity to take forward this work. The PHA will continue to work closely with colleagu es in SPPG (DOH), BSO (Directorate of Legal Services and Procurement and Logistics service), HSC Trusts and the DoH, to ensure that procurement processes c ontinue to meet regional policy and guidance. PHA Staffing Issues The PHA has continued to work closely with DoH coll eagues to take actions to address the number of vacancies and posts filled on a temporary basis across all Directorates and at all levels of the organisation. It has been noted that budget reductions over the past number of years and on-goi ng budget constraints have curtailed the ability to further develop and grow t he workforce to meet new and increasing demands. This has impacted on the work of the PHA through constrained capacity across a number of key areas and functions . 102 While significant progress was made during 2020/21 to address staffing issues, most notably with the appointment of new Health Protecti on and Nursing/AHP staff and measures to recruit permanent staff to fill health improvement posts currently filled on a temporary basis it is recognised that some lon ger term actions are still required. This was highlighted in the report on the 'Rapid, f ocused external review of the Public Health Agency's resource requirement to resp ond to the COVID-19 pandemic over the next 18 - 24 months' conducted by Dr R Hus sey, December 2020. The DoH has since confirmed that a review of the PHA wi ll be undertaken beginning in 2022 and it is anticipated that an initial report w ill be completed by the end of June 2022. It is envisaged that this will produce a num ber of recommendations influencing the future operating model of the Agenc y and its staffing complement. The impact of COVID-19 on resourcing PHA's normal o perational business was also seen though the findings of Internal Audit in areas such as Serious Adverse Incidents and Performance Management reporting. Additionally there has been significant change in t he PHA senior management team over the past year, with one permanent and two inte rim appointments (Chief Executive, Director of Operations (Interim) and Dir ector of Public Health (Interim)). The new Chief Executive took up post in July 2021. PHA will continue to work with DoH colleagues to pr ogress these issues. COVID-19 The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the ou tbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Foll owing which the Department of Health and its ALBs immediately enacted emergenc y response plans across the NI Health sector. There is a UK-wide coordinated ap proach guided by the scientific and medical advice from respective Chief Medical Of ficers and Chief Scientific Advisers informed by the emergent evidence national ly and internationally. Evidence-based UK-wide policies and guidelines cont inue to be carefully followed in conjunction with the PHA issuing local guidelines a nd ensuring readily accessible and continually updated advice. 103 The pandemic has had extensive impact on the health of the population, all health services and the way business is conducted across t he public sector. Protecting the population, particularly the most vulnerable, ensur ing that health and social care services are not overwhelmed, saving lives through mitigating the impact of the pandemic and patient and staff safety has remained at the forefront throughout health's emergency response. Contingency arrangements were activated across all HSC organisations, including the PHA. Given the broad impact of COVID-19 and the need to react quickly to changing circumstances eg new variants and maintain a sustained pandemic response, this has impacted on the ability of the P HA to conduct core health business as resources were redirected to deal with the pandemic. In line with the Government advice to work from home where possible to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, the majority of staff have been working r emotely for most of the year. There has been a substantial resourcing impact acro ss the Department and ALBs to scale up the response and to ensure adequate staff resourcing to meet increasing demands which included calling on volunteers, retir ed medical staff and medical students to rally together to strive to enable an o ptimum response to the pandemic. In the case of the PHA, additional temporary and fu lltime staff had to be recruited to operate the contact tracing service and to enhance the health protection team to respond to the pandemic. The Department prepared a COVID-19 Test, Trace and Protect Strategy (May 2020) which sets out the public health approach to minimi sing COVID-19 transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The Department continues to have responsibility for oversight of the operation of the various eleme nts of this Strategy. The Strategy includes the COVID-19 testing arrangem ents. The Department's Expert Advisory Group chaired by the PHA has overse en the strategic approach in NI, working with the UK Coronavirus National Testin g Programme. PHA staff have worked closely with Departmental colleagues as part of both the strategic and operational management of the testing programme. 104 The Northern Ireland Contact Tracing Service, opera ted by the PHA, started contact tracing all confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 18 May 2 020. This is a seven day service which has adapted to changing circumstances as it strives to ensure that every effort is made to limit transmission and prot ect the population. During each wave of the pandemic PHA staff are redeployed to he lp in contact tracing in order to provide a timely response to cases. In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine was ap proved, with supplies received in Northern Ireland and the mass vaccination progra mme (for all adults) commenced. The COVID-19 vaccination programme is led by the De partment of Health and delivered by both HSC Trusts and primary care (gene ral practice and pharmacy). The PHA is represented on the programme board and i mplementation group, with responsibilities including the management of a sess ional COVID-19 vaccinator workforce to support primary care. PHA is leading on the vaccination of the 12-15 year age group and, in due, course will assume over responsibility for the COVID vaccination programmes (ie. in common with other ex isting population immunisation/vaccination programmes, such as MMR, s easonal flu, etc). It is anticipated that community transmission of CO VID-19 will continue for the next 12 to 18 months. The pandemic response has require d PHA to develop new services like 7 day contact tracing service, co-ord inate testing, increase communication with general public to ensure public awareness and engagement with core public health guidance, contribute to the vacc ination programme and mobilise the pandemic response in all Directorates in the PH A. This will continue to be a focus and a challenge in 2022/23, as the organisati on will also start to return to core business in the coming months. However, going forwa rd into 2022/23, there is some uncertainty as to the direction of government polic y (ie. given the general intention of 'living with COVID'). This will have implications f or PHA actions in terms of almost all COVID-related measures referred to in this document . 105 HSCQI The establishment of the HSCQI function, in April 2 019, was a key action from 'Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together'. The DoH established the HSCQI within the PHA, providing temporary funding through transformation monies for the Director of HSCQI and a number of additional posts. (The Safety Forum, already within the PHA, also became part of the new HSCQI D irectorate.) The budget allocation for 2021/22 includes funding for some HSCQI posts, however it does not cover the totality of posts required. While the PHA welcomes the funding allocation, given the remaining gap in funding, it will still be challenging for the HSCQI to deliver on the design intent. There is th erefore a risk that the HSCQI will be unable to fulfil its core function, service corp orate requirements or undertake additional requests from the HSC system to support work and training. This risk has been further exacerbated due to the redeployment of existing core HSCQI staff on occasions to support the PHA pandemic response. The PHA Chief Executive and Director HSCQI will con tinue to work with the Department and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance to agr ee the priorities for HSCQI (in light of constrained resources) and to discuss fund ing for HSCQI. Staff Resilience during COVID-19 As a result of the necessary response to COVID-19 t he PHA was required to move to 7 day working in April 2020. While organisation s are no longer required to maintain a 7 day working pattern, staff in the PHA have continued to face significant work pressures throughout the year, as they have wo rked to control and reduce the spread of COVID-19. PHA has however limited staff capacity, and while a dditional staff have been brought in during the year, there is concern that in order to maintain the ongoing response a significant proportion of staff have had to work ad ditional hours over a long and sustained period dating back to the beginning of th e Pandemic in March 2020. It is noted that staff are tired, with many also unable t o take all their leave for the second 106 successive year, and therefore there is a risk that staff may become ill and/or no longer be able to continue. A period of recovery f or the Agency's staff, whilst desirable cannot be guaranteed given the ongoing re sponse. The PHA will continue to work with the Director of Human Resources (BSO), the wider HSC and the Department to support staff and s eek ways to build resilience and reset to a business as usual position. The sta nding up of an Organisation Workforce Development group is one example of the s teps taken in year to help support staff. c) Identification of new issues in the current year (including issues identified in the mid-year assurance statement) and antic ipated future issues HRPTS system availability The Business Services Organisation (BSO) has a cont ractual relationship with a supplier providing the managed service for the HR, Payroll, Travel and Subsistence System (HRPTS) for Health and Social Care NI. A su b-contractor of this supplier provides a service incorporating servers hosted at data centres owned by this sub- contractor. The sub-contractor went into administr ation in late March 2022. BSO were advised of the position by the supplier in ear ly April 2022 and have been advised that the sub-contractor will continue to tr ade and operate their business as normal while their Administrators are exploring opt ions for the company's future, including re-negotiating contractual terms with its existing customers. BSO has invoked its business and technical continge ncy plans and set up Bronze Command. BSO has met with the Minister, Permanent Secretary, Trade Unions and all stakeholders has been informed of the situation and the contingency plans to address this issue. 107 12. Conclusion The PHA has a rigorous system of accountability whi ch I can rely on as Accounting Officer to form an opinion on the probity and use o f public funds, as detailed in Managing Public Money NI (MPMNI). Further to considering the accountability framework within the PHA and in conjunction with assurances given to me by the Head of Internal Audit, I am content that the PHA has operated a sound system of interna l governance during the period 2021/22. 108 Remuneration and Staff Report Section 421 of the Companies Act 2006 requires the preparation of a Remuneration Report containing certain information about the Dir ectors' remuneration in accordance with the requirements of Part 4 and Sche dule 8 of Statutory Instrument 2008. Remuneration Policy A committee of Non-Executive Board members exists t o advise the full Board on the remuneration and terms and conditions of service fo r Senior Executives employed by the Public Health Agency (PHA). While the salary structure and the terms and condit ions of service for Senior Executives is determined by the Department of Healt h (DoH), the Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee has a key role in assess ing the performance of Senior Executives and, were permitted by DoH, agreeing the discretionary level of performance related pay. The 2016/17 and 2017/18 Senior Executive's pay awar ds circulars 1/2021 and HSC(SE) 2/2021 were pa id during 2021/22, in line with the Remuneration Committee's agreement on the classification of Executive Directors' performance, categorised against the sta ndards of 'fully acceptable', as on the 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 Senior Executive pay awards had not been received by 31 March 2022 and r elated payments have not been made to Executive Directors. The salary, pension entitlement and the value of an y taxable benefits in kind paid to both Executive and Non-Executive Directors is set o ut within this report. None of the Executive or Non-Executive Directors of the PHA rec eived any other bonus or performance related pay in 2021/22. It should be no ted that Non-Executive Directors 109 do not receive pensionable remuneration and therefo re there will be no entries in respect of pensions for Non-Executive members. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the DoH un der the Public Appointments process and the duration of such contracts is norma lly for a term of 4 years. Details of newly appointed Non-Executive Directors or those leaving post have been detailed in the Senior Management Remuneration tabl es below. Executive Directors are employed on a permanent contact unless otherwis e stated in the following remuneration tables. Early Retirement and Other Compensation Schemes There were no early retirements or payments of comp ensation for other departures relating to current or past Senior Executives durin g 2021/22. Membership of the Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee: Mr Andrew Dougal - Chair Professor Nichola Rooney - Non-Executive Director Ms Anne Henderson - Non-Executive Director Alderman Phillip Brett - Non-Executive Director The Committee is supported by the Director of Human Resources (BSO). Non-Executive and Senior Employee's Remuneration an d Pension Entitlement The salary, pension entitlements, and the value of any taxable benefits in kind of the most senior members of the PHA were as follows, it should be noted that there were no bonuses paid to any Director during 2021/22 or 2 020/21. 110 Non-Executive Members (Table Audited) 2021/22 2020/21 Name Salary \u00a3000s Benefits in Kind (to nearest \u00a3100) Pension Benefits (to nearest \u00a31,000) Total \u00a3000s Salary \u00a3000s Benefits in Kind (to nearest \u00a3100) Pension Benefits (to nearest \u00a31,000) Total \u00a3000s Mr Andrew Dougal ( Chair ) 5-10 - John- Clayton 10-15 - - 10-15 5-10 - - 5-10 Mr Joseph 10-15 - - 10-15 5-10 - - 5-10 Councillor Robert Irvine (Joined 12 October 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 - - - - Alderman Phillip Brett (Joined 12 October 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 - - - - Mrs Anne Henderson (Joined 12 October 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 - - - - Alderman Paul Porter (Left 31 July 2021) 0-5 - - 0-5 5-10 - - 5-10 Alderman (Left 31 0-5 - - 0-5 5-10 - - 5-10 Notes: No Non-Executive Members may have received benefits in kind below \u00a350 which would have been rounded down to nil as specified in the 2nd column of the table above.

The rea l increases exclude increases due to inflation or any increase or decreases due to tr ansfer of pension rights, but include actuarial uplift factors and therefore can be posit ive or negative . A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the act uarially assessed capital value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are a member's accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme, or ar rangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arran gement when a member leaves the scheme and chooses to transfer their benefits a ccrued in their former scheme. 2021/22 Name Real increase in pension and related lump sum at age 60 \u00a3000 Total accrued pension at age 60 and related lump sum \u00a3000 CETV at 31/03/21 CETV Mr Aidan Dawson Interim Chief Executive 5-7.5 pension 10-12.5 lump sum 40-45 pension 85-90 lump sum 673 812 121 Dr Aideen Keaney Director of Quality Improvement 2.5-5 pension 0-2.5 lump sum 45-50 pension 95-100 lump sum 841 903 38 Dr Stephen Bergin Interim Director of Public Health 2.5-5 pension 0-2.5 lump sum 65-70 pension 145-150 lump sum 1,227 1,318 55 Mr Stephen Wilson Interim Director of Operations 2-2.5 pension 0-2.5 lump sum 30-35 pension 65-70 lump sum 601 650 32 Mr Rodney Morton Director of Nursing & Allied Health Professionals 0-2.5 pension 0 lump sum 35-40 pension 95-100 lump sum 726 765 22 Mrs Olive MacLeod Interim Chief Executive 1-1.5 pension 2.5-5 lump sum 30-35 pension 100-105 lump sum 784 807 32 113 The pension figures shown relate to the benefits th at the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pensio n scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which disclosure applies. The CETV figures and the other pension details incl ude the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the HSC pension scheme. They also include any addit ional pension benefits accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing addit ional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty o f Actuaries. Real increase in CETV - this reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase of accru ed pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the v alue of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement) and use s common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period. Howeve r, the real increase calculation uses common actuarial factors at the start and end of the period so that it disregards the effect of any changes in factors and focuses on ly on the increase that is funded by the employer. Pension contributions deducted from individual empl oyees are dependent on the level of remuneration receivable and are deducted u sing a scale applicable to the level of remuneration received by the employee. 114 Fair Pay Disclosures (Table(s) Audited) The relationship between the remuneration of the hi ghest-paid director and the lower quartile, median and upper quartile remuneration of the workforce is set out below. 2022 2021 Band of Highest Paid Director's Remuneration (band in \u00a3000s) 190-195 215-220 Percentage Change of Highest Paid Director -12% - Median Total Remuneration (\u00a3) 42,121 40,894 Ratio 4.56 5.28 The change to the ratio is impacted by the decrease in the highest paid director's remuneration.

Und er this multi-employer defined benefit scheme both the PHA and employees p ay specified percentages of pay into the scheme and the liability to pay benefi t falls to the DoH. The PHA is unable to identify its share of the underlying asse ts and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reliable basis. The Public Service Pensions Act (NI) 2014 provides the legal framework for regular actuarial valuations of the public service pension schemes to measure the costs of the benefits being provided. These valuations infor m the future contribution rates to be paid into the schemes by employers every four ye ars following the scheme valuation. The Act also provides for the establishm ent of an employer cost cap mechanism to ensure that the costs of the pension s chemes remain sustainable in future. The Government Actuary's Department (GAD) is respon sible for carrying out scheme valuations. The Actuary reviews employer con tributions every four years following the scheme valuation. The 2016 scheme val uation was completed by GAD 116 in March 2019. The outcome of this valuation was us ed to set the level of contributions for employers from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2023. An issue identified by the courts in the way that t he 2015 pension reforms were introduced has led to eligible members, with releva nt service between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2022, being entitled to different pens ion benefits in relation to that period. The different pension benefits relate to t he 1995, 2008 and 2015 HSC Pension Schemes. This is known as the 'McCloud Reme dy' and will impact many aspects of the HSC Pension Schemes including the sc heme valuation outcomes. Further information on this will be included in the HSC Pension Scheme accounts. Average Number of Persons Employed (Table Audited) The average number of whole time equivalent (WTE) p ersons employed during the year was as follows: 2022 2021 Permanently employed staff Others Total Total Commissioning of Health and Social Care 795 89 884 513 Less average staff number in respect of outward secondments (15) - (15) (9) Total net average number of persons employed 780 89 869* 504 *The increase in the 2022 staff numbers is primaril y due to an increase of c381 WTEs relating to Contact Tracing and COVID-19 Vaccinator s.

Redundancy and other departure costs have been paid in accordance with the provisions of the HSC Pension Scheme Regulations an d the Compensation for Premature Retirement Regulations, statutory provisi ons made under the Superannuation (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. Exit costs are accounted for in full in the year in which the exit package is approved and agreed and are included as operating expenses at Note 3. Where early retiremen ts have been agreed, the additional costs are met by the PHA and not by the HSC pension scheme. Ill-health retirement costs are met by the pension scheme and are not included in the table. 118 Sickness Absence Data The corporate cumulative annual absence level for t he PHA for the period from 1 April 2020 - 31 March 2021 is 2.73% (2020/21 2.39%) . There were due to sickness absenc e (2020/21 14,554 hours), or the equivalent of 47 hours (2020/21 42.8 hours) los t per employee. Based on a 7.5 hour working day, this is equal to 6 days per emplo yee (2020/21 5.7 days). Staff Turnover Percentage For a given period, the total turnover figure is ca lculated as the number of leavers within that period divided by the average employee headcount over the period. Voluntary turnover includes leavers classified unde r the categories of resignation, retirement or ill-health retirement. Involuntary tu rnover includes leavers classified under the categories of dismissal, end of fixed ter m contract or ill-health termination. Staff Turnover % 2022 2021 Total Staff Turnover 6.46% 11.82% 2.66% Staff Engagement Scores HSC organisations do not monitor Employee Engagemen t on an annual basis, but there is a Regional Staff Survey conducted every 3 years. The PHA employee engagement score from the most recent staff survey (2019) was 3.70 out of a possible 5. The response rate was 52%. In addition to the regional survey, the PHA conduct ed a Cultural Assessment survey in February 2020 which measured the culture within the organisation across 8 dimensions. Each of the 8 dimensions was scored out of 5 and the table below 119 shows the scoring against each dimension within PHA . The response rate for this survey was 37.4%. Because of the pandemic, PHA conducted the Cultural Assessment twice to see if, and how, culture was impacted. Reassuringly, the sc ores improved against most dimensions when the survey was completed for the se cond time in November 2020. Dimension Feb 2020 Score Nov 2020 Score Change Values 3.35 3.46 + 0.11 Vision 2.51 2.73 + 0.22 Goals & Performance 3.92 3.61 - 0.31 Quality & Innovation 2.96 3.09 + 0.13 Team Working 3.59 3.68 + 0.09 Compassionate Care 3.95 4.01 + 0.06 Compassionate Leadership 3.40 3.47 + 0.07 Collective Leadership 3.12 3.30 + 0.18 Staff Policies / Employment and Occupation During the year the PHA ensured internal policies g ave full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled person s having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. In this regard the PHA is fully committed to promoting equality of opportunity and good relation s for all groupings under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The PHA has a range of policies in place that serve to advance this aim, including, on the employment side, the Equality of Opportunity Policy. More information is available on the PHA's website at www.publichealth.hscni.net . Where an employee has become disabled during the co urse of their employment with the PHA, the organisation works closely with H uman Resources (BSO HR Shared Services) who are guided by advice from Occu pational Health. 120 Subsequently, reasonable adjustments can be made to accommodate the employee such as reduced hours, work adjustments including p ossible redeployment, in line with relevant disability legislation. This legislat ion is incorporated into selection and recruitment training and induction training and is highlighted in relevant policies where necessary. The PHA is fully committed to the ongoing training and development of all members of staff and through the performance appraisal syst em all staff are afforded this opportunity irrespective of ability/disability as w ell as having the same opportunities to progress through the organisation. The PHA also participates in the Disability Placeme nt Scheme which provides a six month placement for those with a disability wishing to return to the workplace. During their placement they receive support and guidance - for example, guidance on the completion of application forms when applying for f uture posts. Expenditure on Consultancy The PHA had no expenditure on External Consultancy during 2021/22 (2020/21, nil). Off-Payroll Engagements The PHA is required to disclose whether there were any staff or public sector appointees contracted through employment agencies o r self-employed which cost more than \u00a3245 per day and lasted longer than 6 mon ths during the financial year, which were not paid through the PHA Payroll. The PHA had 18 such 'off-payroll' staff resource en gagements as at 31 March 2022 (2020/21: 0). The following table provides further analysis. 121 Temporary off -payroll worker engagements as at 31 March 2022 Number of existing engagements as of 31 March 2022 18 Of which have: Existed for less than one year at time of reporting 3 Existed for between one and two years at time of re porting 15 These engagements were via a contracted Recruitment Agency and are in compliance with IR35 requirements. No penalty was imposed by HMRC resulting from non-compliance with off-payroll worker legisla tion. 122 Assembly Accountability and Audit Report Funding Report Regularity of Expenditure (Audited) The PHA has robust internal controls in place to su pport the regularity of expenditure. These are supported by procurement exp erts (BSO PaLS), annually reviewed Standing Orders, Standing Financial Instru ctions and Scheme of Delegated Authority and the dissemination of new guidance whe re appropriate. Expenditure and the governing controls are independently review ed by Internal and External Audit, and during 2021/22 there has been no evidenc e of irregular expenditure occurring. Losses and Special Payments (Table Audited) Losses Statement 2021/22 2020/21 Total number of losses 2 0 Total value of losses (\u00a3) \u00a35,880 \u00a30 There were no individual losses over \u00a3250k in the 2 021/22 financial year (2020/21, nil). Special Payments There were no other special payments or gifts made during the year (2020/21, nil). Other Payments and Estimates There were no other payments made during the year ( 2020/21, nil). Remote Contingent Liabilities (Audited) In addition to contingent liabilities reported with in the meaning of IAS37 shown in Note 19 of the financial statements, the PHA also c onsiders liabilities for which the likelihood of a transfer of economic benefit in set tlement is too remote to meet the definition of contingent liability. As at 31 March 2022, the PHA is not aware of any remote contingent liabilities, and there were none in 2020/21. 123 On behalf of the PHA, I approve the Accountability Report encompassing the following sections: Governance Statement.

The statement shows how the Public Health Ag ency generates and uses cash and cash equivalents by classifying cash flows as operating, investing and financing activiti es. The amount of net cash flows arising from operating activities is a key indicator of service costs and the extent to which th ese operations are funded by way of income from the recipients of services provided by the Public Health Agency. Investi ng activities represent the extent to which cash inflows and outflows have been made for resources which are intended to con tribute to the Public Health Agency's future public service delivery.

The SoCNE Reserve represents the total assets less liabilities of the Public Health Agency, to the extent that the total is not represented by other reserves and financing items. The notes on pages 135 to 163 form part of these a ccounts. 134 Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 135 NOTE 1 - STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 Authority These financial statements have been prepared in a form determined by the Department of Health (DoH) based on guidance from t he Department of Finance's Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) and in accordance with the requirements of Article 90(2) (a) of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 No 1265 (NI 14) as amended by Article 6 of the Audit and Accountability (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 and the Health and So cial Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009. The accounting policies contained in the FReM apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adapted or interprete d for the public sector context. Where the FReM permits a choice of accounting polic y, the accounting policy which is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Public Health Agency (PHA) for the purpose of giving a true and f air view has been selected. The particular policies adopted by the PHA are describe d below. They have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered mater ial in relation to the accounts, unless otherwise stated. In addition, due to the manner in which the PHA is funded, the Statement of Financial Position will show a negative position. I n line with the FReM, sponsored entities such as the PHA which show total net liabi lities, should prepare financial statements on a going concern basis. The cash requi red to discharge these net liabilities will be requested from the Department w hen they fall due, and is shown in the Statement of Changes in Taxpayers' Equity. 1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the histori cal cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and inventories. 1.2 Currency and Rounding These accounts are presented in UK Pounds (\u00a3) sterl ing. The figures in the accounts are shown to the nearest \u00a31,000, which may give ris e to rounding differences. 1.3 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment assets comprise Build ings, Plant & Machinery, Information Technology, and Furniture & Fittings. Recognition Property, plant and equipment must be capitalised i f: it is held for use in delivering services or for a dministrative purposes; it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential will be supplied to, the PHA; it is expected to be used for more than one financ ial year; the cost of the item can be measured reliably; and Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 136 the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000; or collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 where the assets are functionally interdependent, they had broadly s imultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or items form part of the initial equipping and setti ng-up cost of a new building or unit, irrespective of their individual or collectiv e cost. On initial recognition property, plant and equipmen t are measured at cost including any expenditure such as installation, directly attr ibutable to bringing them into working condition. Items classified as \"under const ruction\" are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position to the extent that money has been paid or a liability has been incurred. Valuation of Land and Buildings The PHA does not hold any land, and the buildings o ccupied by the PHA are held under lease arrangements. Assets under Construction (AUC) Assets in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Assets a re revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought into use. The PHA h ad no AUC in either 2021/22 or 2020/21. Short Life Assets Short life assets are not indexed. Short life is de fined as a useful life of up to and including 5 years. Short life assets are carried at depreciated historic cost as this is not considered to be materially different from fair value and are depreciated over their useful life. Where estimated life of fixtures and equipment exce ed 5 years, suitable indices will be applied each year and depreciation will be based on indexed amount. Revaluation Reserve An increase arising on revaluation is taken to the revaluation reserve except when it reverses an impairment for the same asset previousl y recognised in expenditure, in which case it is credited to expenditure to the ext ent of the decrease previously charged there. A revaluation decrease is recognised as an impairment charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a balance on the reserve for the asset and, thereafter, to expenditure. 1.4 Depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold land since land has unlimited or a very long established useful life. Items under construction a re not depreciated until they are commissioned. Properties that are surplus to requir ements and which meet the definition of \"non-current assets held for sale\" ar e also not depreciated. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 137 Otherwise, depreciation is charged to write off the costs or valuation of property, plant and equipment and similarly, amortisation is applied to intangible non-current assets, less any residual value, over their estimat ed useful lives, in a manner that reflects the consumption of economic benefits or se rvice potential of the assets. Assets held under finance leases are also depreciat ed over the lower of their estimated useful lives and the terms of the lease. The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the PHA expects to o btain economic benefits or service potential from the asset. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year end, with the effect of any chan ges recognised on a prospective basis. The following asset lives have been used. Asset Type Asset Life Freehold Buildings 25 - 60 years IT assets 3 - 10 years Intangible assets 3 - 10 years Other Equipment 3 - 15 years 1.5 Impairment loss If there has been an impairment loss due to a gener al change in prices, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount, with the lo ss charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a balance on th e reserve for the asset and, thereafter, to expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure (SoCNE). If the impairment is due to the consumptio n of economic benefits the full amount of the impairment is charged to the SoCNE an d an amount up to the value of the impairment in the revaluation reserve is transf erred to the SoCNE Reserve. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of the recover able amount but capped at the amount that would have been determined had there be en no initial impairment loss. The reversal of the impairment loss is credited fir stly to the SoCNE to the extent of the decrease previously charged there and thereafte r to the revaluation reserve. 1.6 Subsequent expenditure Where subsequent expenditure enhances an asset beyo nd its original specification, the directly attributable cost is capitalised. Wher e subsequent expenditure which meets the definition of capital restores the asset to its original specification, the expenditure is capitalised and any existing carryin g value of the item replaced is written-out and charged to operating expenses. The overall useful life of the PHA's buildings take s account of the fact that different components of those buildings have different useful lives. This ensures that depreciation is charged on those assets at the same rate as if separate components had been identified and depreciated at different ra tes. 1.7 Intangible assets Intangible assets includes any of the following hel d - software, licences, trademarks, websites, development expenditure, Patents, Goodwil l and intangible Assets under Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 138 Construction. Software that is integral to the oper ating of hardware, for example an operating system is capitalised as part of the rele vant item of property, plant and equipment. Software that is not integral to the ope ration of hardware, for example application software, is capitalised as an intangib le asset. Expenditure on research is not capitalised: it is recognised as an operating e xpense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally-generated assets are recognise d if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intang ible asset so that it will be available for use; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use it; the ability to sell or use the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable fu ture economic benefits or service potential; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the intangible asset and sell or use it; and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure at tributable to the intangible asset during its development. Recognition Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without p hysical substance, which are capable of sale separately from the rest of the PHA 's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. Intangible asset s are considered to have a finite life. They are recognised only when it is probable that f uture economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the PHA wh ere the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All single items over \u00a35,000 in value must be capitalised while intangible assets which fall within the grouped ass et definition may be capitalised if the group is at least \u00a35,000 in value. The amount r ecognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure inc urred from the date of commencement of the intangible asset, until it is c omplete and ready for use. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at fair value by reference to an active market, and as no active market currently exists de preciated replacement cost has been used as fair value. 1.8 Non-current assets held for sale The PHA had no non-current assets held for sale in either 2021/22 or 2020/21. 1.9 Inventories The PHA had no inventories as at 31 March 2022 or 3 1 March 2021. 1.10 Income Income is classified between Revenue from Contracts and Other Operating Income as assessed necessary in line with organisational a ctivity, under the requirements of IFRS 15 and as applicable to the public sector. Jud gement is exercised in order to Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 139 determine whether the five essential criteria withi n the scope of IFRS 15 are met in order to define income as a contract. Income relates directly to the activities of the PH A and is recognised when, and to the extent that a performance obligation is satisfi ed in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services p romised. Where the criteria to determine whether a contract is in existence are not met, income is classified as Other Operating Income with in the Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure (SoCNE) and is recogn ised when the right to receive payment is established. Income is stated net of VAT. Grant in aid Funding received from other entities, including the DoH is accounted for as grant in aid and is reflected through the Statement of Compr ehensive Net Expenditure Reserve. 1.11 Investments The PHA did not hold any investments in either 2021 /22 or 2020/21. 1.12 Research and Development expenditure Research and development expenditure is expensed in the year it is incurred in accordance with IAS 38. Following the introduction of the 2010 European Sys tem of Accounts (ESA10) from 2016/17, there has been a change in the budgeting t reatment (a change from the revenue budget to the capital budget) of research a nd development (R&D) expenditure. As a result, additional disclosures ar e included, where necessary, in the notes to the accounts. 1.13 Other expenses Other operating expenses for goods or services are recognised when, and to the extent that, they have been received. They are meas ured at the fair value of the consideration payable. 1.14 Cash and cash equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financia l institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash e quivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisi tion and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignifi cant risk of change in value. 1.15 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substa ntially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All oth er leases are classified as operating leases. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 140 The PHA as lessee The PHA held no finance leases during 2021/22 or 20 20/21. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expen se on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognise d initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straigh t-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land a nd buildings components are separated. Leased land may be either an operating l ease or a finance lease depending on the conditions in the lease agreement and following the general principle set out in IAS 17. Leased buildings are a ssessed as to whether they are operating or finance leases. The PHA as lessor The PHA did not have any lessor agreements in eithe r 2021/22 or 2020/21. 1.16 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) transactions The PHA had no PFI transactions during 2021/22 or 2 020/21. 1.17 Financial instruments A financial instrument is defined as any contract t hat gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity inst rument of another entity. The PHA has financial instruments in the form of tr ade receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial assets Financial assets are recognised on the Statement of Financial Position when the DoH body becomes party to the financial instrument contract or, in the case of trade receivables, when the goods or services have been d elivered. Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights have expi red or the asset has been transferred. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair v alue. IFRS 9 requires consideration of the expected credit loss model on financial asse ts. The measurement of the loss allowance depends upon the PHA's assessment at the end of each reporting period as to whether the financial instrument's credit ris k has increased significantly since initial recognition, based on reasonable and suppor table information that is available, without undue cost or effort to obtain. The amount of expected credit loss recognised is measured on the basis of the probability weighte d present value of anticipated cash shortfalls over the life of the instrument, wh ere judged necessary. Financial assets are classified into the following categories: o financial assets at fair value through Statement o f Comprehensive Net Expenditure; Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 141 o held to maturity investments; o available for sale financial assets; and o loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpos e of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised on the Stateme nt of Financial Position when the DoH body becomes party to the contractual provision s of the financial instrument or, in the case of trade payables, when the goods or se rvices have been received. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the li ability has been discharged, that is, the liability has been paid or has expired. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at f air value. Financial risk management IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the role that financi al instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks a body fac es in undertaking its activities. Because of the relationships with the DoH, and the manner in which they are funded, financial instruments play a more limited role with in HSC bodies in creating risk than would apply to a non-public sector body of a simila r size, therefore the PHA is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by bu siness entities. The PHA has limited powers to borrow or invest surp lus funds and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day to day operati onal activities rather than being held to change the risks facing the PHA in undertak ing activities. Therefore the PHA is exposed to little credit, liquidity or market ri sk. Currency risk The PHA is principally a domestic organisation with the great majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the U K and Sterling based. The PHA has no overseas operations. The PHA therefore has low e xposure to currency rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk The PHA has limited powers to borrow or invest and therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Credit and liquidity risk Since the PHA receives the majority of its funding from the DoH, it has low exposure to credit risk and is not exposed to significant li quidity risks. 1.18 Provisions In accordance with IAS 37, provisions are recognise d when the PHA has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a p ast event, it is probable that the PHA will be required to settle the obligation, and a re liable estimate can be made of the Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 142 amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligatio n at the end of the reporting year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present valu e of those cash flows as at 31 March 2022, using the discount rates issued by the Department of Finance (DoF) below. Rate Time period Real rate Nominal Short term (0 - 5 years) 0.47% Medium term (5 - 10 years) 0.70% Long term (10 - 40 years) 0.95% Very long term (40+ years) 0.66% Inflationary Year 1 4.0% Year 2 2.6% Into perpetuity 2.0% Note that Public Expenditure System issued a combin ed nominal and inflation rate table to incorporate the two elements - please refe r to this table as necessary, as included within circular HSC(F) 39-2021. The discount rate to be applied for employee early departure obligations is (1.30%) for 2021/22. The PHA has also disclosed the carrying amount at t he beginning and end of the year, additional provisions made, amounts used duri ng the year, unused amounts reversed during the year and increases in the disco unted amount arising from the passage of time and the effect of any change in the discount rate. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the re ceivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursements will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as a provision. An onerous contract is considered t o exist where the PHA has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeti ng the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to b e received under it. A restructuring provision is recognised when the PH A develops a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid e xpectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to imp lement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 143 The measurement of a restructuring provision includ es only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amo unts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated wi th on-going activities of the PHA. 1.19 Contingent liabilities/assets In addition to contingent liabilities disclosed in accordance with IAS 37, the PHA discloses for Assembly reporting and accountability purposes certain statutory and non-statutory contingent liabilities where the like lihood of a transfer of economic benefit is remote, but which have been reported to the Assembly in accordance with the requirements of Managing Public Money Northern Ireland. Where the time value of money is material, continge nt liabilities which are required to be disclosed under IAS 37 are stated at discounted amounts and the amount reported to the Assembly separately noted. Continge nt liabilities that are not required to be disclosed by IAS 37 are stated at the amounts reported to the Assembly. Under IAS 37, the PHA discloses contingent liabilit ies where there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose e xistence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the PHA, or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that a payment will be r equired to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured suf ficiently reliably. A contingent liability is disclosed unless the possibility of a payment is remote. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or no n-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the contr ol of the PHA. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is p robable. 1.20 Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Under the requirements of IAS 19: Employee Benefits , staff costs must be recorded as an expense as soon as the organisation is obliga ted to pay them. This includes the cost of any untaken leave that has been earned at the year end. This cost has been calculated based on the balance remaining in t he computerised leave system for all staff as at 31 March 2022. Untaken flexi le ave is estimated to be immaterial to the PHA and has not been included. Retirement benefit costs Past and present employees are covered by the provi sions of the HSC Pension Scheme. Under this multi-employer defined benefit s cheme both the PHA and employees pay specified percentages of pay into the scheme and the liability to pay benefit falls to the DoH. The PHA is unable to iden tify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consisten t and reliable basis. Further information regarding the HSC Pension Scheme can be found in the HSC Pension Scheme Statement in the Departmental Resource Accou nt for the Department of Health. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 144 The costs of early retirements, except those for il l-health retirements, are met by the PHA and charged to the Statement of Comprehensive N et Expenditure at the time the PHA commits itself to the retirement. As per the requirements of IAS 19, full actuarial v aluations by a professionally qualified actuary are required with sufficient regu larity that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially f rom those determined at the reporting period date. FReM provides an interpreta tion of the IAS 19 standard and this standard requires the present value of defined benefit obligations to be determined with sufficient regularity that the amou nts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those dete rmined at the reporting period date. The 2021-22 accounts are based on membership data a s at 31 March 2016 since it was not practicable to utilise data as 31 March 202 0 within the time parameters available. The value of the liabilities as at 31 Ma rch 2022 has been calculated by rolling forward the liability calculated as at 31 M arch 2016 to 31 March 2022. The 2016 valuation assumptions are retained for demogra phics whilst financial assumptions are updated to reflect current financia l conditions and a change in financial assumption methodology. The 2016 valuatio n is the most recently completed valuation, since the 2020 valuation is on going which is why the demographics assumptions are not updated. 1.21 Reserves Statement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure Reserve Accumulated surpluses are accounted for in the Stat ement of Comprehensive Net Expenditure Reserve. Revaluation Reserve The Revaluation Reserve reflects the unrealised bal ance of cumulative indexation and revaluation adjustments to assets. 1.22 Value Added Tax (VAT) Where output VAT is charged or input VAT is recover able, the amounts are stated net of VAT. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the rel evant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. 1.23 Third party assets The PHA had no third party assets in 2021/22 or 202 0/21. 1.24 Government Grants The PHA had no government grants in 2021/22 or 2020 /21. 1.25 Losses and Special Payments Losses and special payments are items that the Asse mbly would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health se rvice or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 145 special control procedures compared with the genera lity of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the rele vant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the PHA not been b earing its own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal re venue expenditure). However, the note on losses and special payments is compiled directly from the losses register which reports amounts on an accruals basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. 1.26 Accounting standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopted Under IAS 8 there is a requirement to disclose thos e standards issued but not yet adopted. The International Accounting Standards Board have i ssued the following new standards but which are either not yet effective or adopted. Under IAS 8 there is a requirement to disclose these standards together wi th an assessment of their initial impact on application. IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 J oint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in Other Entities: The IASB have issued new and amended standards (IFR S 10, IFRS 11 & IFRS 12) that affect the consolidation and reporting of subs idiaries, associates and joint ventures. These standards were effective with EU ad option from 1 January 2014. Accounting boundary IFRS' are currently adapted in the FReM so that the Westminster departmental accounting boundary is bas ed on Office of National Statistics (ONS) control criteria, as designated by Treasury. A similar review in NI, which will bring NI departm ents under the same adaptation, has been carried out and the resulting recommendati ons were agreed by the Executive in December 2016. With effect from 2022-2 3, the accounting boundary for departments will change and there will also be an i mpact on departments around the disclosure requirements under IFRS 12. ALBs apply I FRS in full and their consolidation boundary may change as a result of th e new Standards. IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 16 Leases replaces IAS 17 Leases and is effect ive with EU adoption from 1 January 2019. In line with the requirements of the FReM, IFRS 16 will be implemented, as interpreted and adapted for the pub lic sector, with effect from 1 April 2022. The PHA hold 3 Leases which will transfer onto the Statement of Financial Position (SoFP) in accordance with IFRS 16 on 1 April 2022. 2 leases with a combined Net Book Value (NBV) of \u00a33 6k will come onto the SoFP and will cease on 17 June 2022. Public Health Agency Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2 022 146 1 lease with a NBV of \u00a3499k will come onto the SoFP and cease on 30 September 2026. 1 lease with a NBV of \u00a33k will not go onto the SoFP as it is categorised for a recognition exemption for leases of low-value. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts will replace IFRS 4 Ins urance Contracts and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or af ter 1 January 2023. In line with the requirements of the FReM, IFRS 17 will be implement ed, as interpreted and adapted for the public sector, with effect from 1 April 202 3. Management currently assess that there will be mini mal impact on application to the PHA's financial statements. 1.27 Changes in accounting policies/Prior year rest atement There were no changes in accounting policies during the year ended 31 March 2022. 2022 2021 Summary Administration 2.3 36,855 29,592 Safeguarding Board NI 2.4 743 729 Total Commissioner Resources utilised 147,702 131,252 2.1 Commissioning 2022 2021 Expenditure NOTE Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 20,977 19,706 South Eastern Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 6,118 5 ,386 Southern Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 8,967 7,929 Northern Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 10,174 9,445 Western Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 8,740 7,981 NIAS Health & Social Care Trust SoCNE 117 87 NI Medical & Dental Training Agency SoCNE 169 167 PCC SoCNE 0 35 Other 3.1 55,177 50,682 110,439 101,418 Income Revenue from contracts with customers 3,471 Commissioning Net Expenditure 107,549 97,948 2.2 FHS 3.1 Administration 2022 2021 Expenditure NOTE \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Salaries and 27,050 Operating expenditure 3.2 2,887 2,808 Non-cash costs 3.3 24 22 Depreciation 3.3 399 201 37,742 30,081 Other Operating Income Staff secondment recoveries 4.2 887 489 Administration Net Expenditure 36,855 29,592 2.4 Safeguarding Board NI Expenditure Salaries and wages 3.2 522 407 Operating expenditure 3.2 221 322 Programme expenditure 3.1 0 0 743 729 Safeguarding Board NI Net Expenditure 743 729 Public Health Agency The PHA has identified 4 segments: Commissioning, Family He alth Services (FHS), Administration, and Safeguarding Board NI - an independent body hosted by the PHA.

The PHA did not hold any inventories as at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021. Public Health Agency As the cash requirements of PHA are met through Grant-in-Aid provided by the Department of Health, financial instruments play a more limited role in creating a nd managing risk than would apply to a non-public sector body. The majority of financial instruments relate t o contracts to buy non-financial items in line with the PHA's expected purchase and usage requirements and the P HA is therefore exposed to little credit, liquidity or market risk. The PHA had no impairments in 2021/22 or 2020/21. Non current assets held for sale comprise non current assets that are held for resale rather than for continuing use within the business.

The purpose of the Act is to ensure that public authorities have 'due regard' to the social and economic needs of people in rural areas and to provide a mechanism for ensuring greater transparency in relation to how public authorities consider rural needs when developing, adopting, implementing or revising policies, strategies and plans and when designing and delivering public services. The Act seeks to help deliver fairer and more equitable treatment for people i n rural areas which will deliver better outcomes and make rural communities more sustainable. The completion of the Rural Needs Impact Assessments has focused minds on the importance of the needs of rural dwellers at the outset of the project. In particul ar, ensuring consultation with rural dwellers when planning and procuring services and where alternative service delivery mechanisms are identified, taking these into account in the service specification and monitoring throughout the contract period. Awareness of the Act continues to be brought to the attention of PHA staff and further guidance is available on the PHA's intranet site. The Act sets out that Public Authorities must complete an annual report to be published in their own Annual Report and submitted to DAERA for inclusion in the Rural Needs Annual Monitoring Report. 3 Key Issues During 2021/ 22, a total of three Rural Needs Assessments were carried out, details of which are contained in the Report. 4 Next Steps Following approval by the Board, PHA will submit its Annual Monitoring Return to DAERA, in advance of the deadline of 30 June 202 2. The PHA will continue to ensure that the Rural Needs Act is taken into consideration as part of its work and a Report on progress in 20 22/23 will be brought to the Board in June 2023 . A Guide to the Rural Needs Act (NI) 2016 for Public Authorities (Revised) April 2018 Appendix 2 - Template for Information to be Compiled Information to be compiled by Public Authorities under Section 3(1)(a) of the Rural Needs Act (NI) 2016. (To be completed and included in public authorities' own annual reports and submitted to DAERA for inclusion in the Rural Needs Annual Monitoring Report). Name of Public Authority: Public Health Agency Reporting Period: April 20 21 to March 20 22 The following information should be compiled in respect of each policy, strategy and plan which has been developed, adopted, implemented or revised and each public service which has been designed or delivered by the public authority during the reporting period. Description of the activity undertaken by the public authority which is subject to section 1(1) of the Rural Needs Act (NI) 20161. The rural policy area(s) which the activity relates to2. Describe how the public authority has had due regard to rural needs when developing, adopting, implementing or revising the policy, strategy or plan or when designing or delivering the public service3. Bereaved by suicide project: Facilitation of support networks for people bereaved by suicide and their role in influencing policy and service delivery Broadband or Mobile Communications in Rural Areas Health of Social Care Services in Rural Areas The Bereaved by suicide co-ordination, development and facilitation project is not a service for individuals. It is a project that supports individuals bereaved by suicide to influence policy and service delivery. The project will encourage participation through bereavement groups and local protect life implementation groups which have representation from Rural Networks and Rural Support. There are no costs to participate in the project. Those that wish to participate can do so in person, by phone or by electronic means. When commissioning the project the PHA took into account the following strategies; Protect Life 2 (health-ni.gov.uk) Making Life Better - A Whole System Framework for Public Health 2013-2023 (health-ni.gov.uk) PfG draft Outcomes Framework consultation (northernireland.gov.uk) doh-mhs-draft-2021-2031.pdf (health-ni.gov.uk) Tackling rural poverty and social inclusion - 2016 - A new Framework (daera-ni.gov.uk) Key Rural Issues 2020 - Final.pdf (daera-ni.gov.uk) Stakeholder involvement has been undertaken as part of the review of the project. This was carried out via an online electronic survey in line with COVID regulations and included identification of gaps and barriers in relation to the current service model. Of the 26 responses, only one comment was made in relation to the need to strengthen links in some rural areas. The PHA has also carried out a wider involvement process to determine how the Protect Life 2 Strategy actions, for which the PHA is responsible, can be delivered. Through this process the following issues around rural service provision were identified; Barriers around digital access must be considered e.g. digital poverty, many do not have digital skills, smart phones or good internet connection in rural areas; conversely digital services were also highlighted as a means of helping people in rural communities to be reached with a blended approach and cross departmental working highlighted as a means of addressing barriers. Stakeholders outlined a number of user groups who require support accessing services which included rural dwellers. Additional requirements will be included within the project to ensure direct connection with Rural Networks to raise awareness of the project and to encourage participation from rural communities. Publication in relation to the project will be promoted to groups currently funded by the PHA which include rural networks and community and voluntary organisations located within rural communities. Early intervention Support Service - Regional Family Support Service across Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services in Rural Areas Deprivation in Rural Areas The aim of EISS is to deliver and coordinate personalised evidence based early intervention for children, young people and their families to support families when problems first emerge before the need for statutory involvement. When commissioning this service the PHA took into account a number of strategies and reports including; DoH (2021)Health Inequalities Annual Report DoH (2021) Health Survey Northern Ireland NISRA (2017) Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2017 As part of the development of EISS comprehensive stakeholder engagement was undertaken facilitated through the Children's and Young People's Strategic Partnership Outcomes Groups and Locality Planning Groups in collaboration with the Directors of Social Services within each health and social care trust locality. A lack of service provision and difficulty accessing services due to transport issues were identified in a number of rural areas. The locations and geographic spread for each EISS was agreed based on local need, emerging need and gaps in service provision. It is clear from the strategies, ongoing monitoring Information, evaluations and stakeholder involvement there is a need to continue to offer the EISS to children, young people and families in both rural and urban communities. Provider organisations will be required to deliver EISS within the geographic areas identified with the aim of ensuring that children, young people and families in both urban and rural areas are supported to access the service. Providers will be required to provide links with Family Support Hubs, other community and voluntary services and others working in related areas such as drugs and alcohol, mental health etc. to ensure families have the ongoing support when their engagement with EISS is completed. Travel to rural areas in winter months and during inclement weather can on occasions cause some difficulties. Throughout the Covid 19 pandemic EISS have adapted ways of delivering the service as face to face visits were not possible for a prolonged period of time. All EISS have the necessary technology to offer the EISS using a blended approach of face to face visits and virtual sessions on Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Virtual sessions will continue to be used to offer support to families on occasions when home visiting cannot be offered as an option. Maintaining the integrity and functionality of the National Breast Screening system in Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services in Rural Areas The following issues were considered in relation to the social and economic needs of people in rural areas: Accessibility of healthcare services - the project will have neither a positive or negative impact on the accessibility of healthcare services. No change to the current service configuration is planned. Employment, training and commuting - No change to current staffing of Breast Screening Units is planned. No change to the location of Breast Screening Units is planned. Opportunities for appropriate training in the new system will be offered to all staff at their normal place of work, so no additional travel needed. All Breast Screening Units are represented in the project management structure and will contribute to the project implementation plan. NOTES 1.

The purpose of the corporate register is to provide assurances to the Chief Executive, AMT, the Governance and Audit Committee and the PHA board that risks are being effectively managed in order to meet corporate objec tives and statutory obligations. 3 Key Issues One risk has been added to the risk register: CR 65 Increase in the number of Direct Award Contracts where existing tendered services are not able to be renewed before contract period expires. Two risks have been removed from the risk register: CR 54 Ability of 3rd Party Providers to Deliver Commissioned Services CR 58 Staff Resilience Two risks have had their risk rating reduced from medium to low: CR 26 Lack of market testing for roll forward contrac ts CR 46 Failure to meet Statutory & Legal requirements in relation to Emergency Planning (EPRR) CR 54 Ability of 3rd Party Providers to deliver commissioned services (from High to Medium) The Corporate Risk Register was approved by the Agency Managemen t Team at its meeting on 30 March 2022 and by the Governance and Audit Committee at its meeting on 11 April 2022. 4 Next Steps The next rev iew will be undertaken as at 30 June 2022 and brought to the Governance and Audit Committee at its meeting on 28 July 2022. PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 1 PHA Corporate Risk Register Date of Review: 31 March 2022 PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 2 Introduction Managing risk is a key component of the wider governance agenda for the PHA. It is therefore essential that systems and processes are in place to identify and manage risks as far as reasonably possible. The purpose of risk management is not to remove all risks but to ensure that risks are identified and their potential to cause loss fully understood. Based on this information, action can then be taken to direct appropriate levels of resource at controlling the risk or minimising the effect of potential loss. The PHA has recognised the need to adopt such an approach and has a systematic and unified process in place to ensure a fully functioning risk register at both corporate and directorate levels as set out in the PHA Risk Management Srategy and Policy. The Corporate Register that follows identifies corporate risks, all of which have been assessed using a 'five by five' risk grading matrix (see below) which is in line with DoH guidance. This ensures a consistent and uniform approach is taken in categorising risks in terms of their level of priority so that appropriate action can be taken at the appropriate level of the organisation .

DESCRIPTION OF RISK : The PHA has an extensive range of Health and Social Care contracts with non HSC providers (primarily health improvement contracts with voluntary and community sector). An approved PHA Procurement Plan is in place, and a range of large and smaller services have been procured. Some contracts are however rolled forward year on year, without the benefit of market testing. Full compliance with the PHA Procurement Plan has not been achieved due to limited capacity, skill constraints and the complexity of some contracts. Since Mar 2020 staff have been required to focus on addressing the Covid 19 Pandemic which has further impacted on our ability to deliver against the procurement plan. This means that the timescales in the current plan are not being met There is a risk that VFM is not being achieved in the current contracts and a potential reputational risk to the PHA.

PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 9 Corporate Risk 39 RISK AREA/CONTEXT: Cyber Security DESCRIPTION OF RISK : Information security across the HSC is of critical importance to delivery of care, protection of information assets and many related business processes. If a cyber incident should occur, without effective security and controls, HSC information, systems and infrastructure (including those used by the PHA, as well as Trusts providing services for the PHA) may become unreliable, not accessible when required (temporarily or permanently), or compromised by unauthorised 3rd parties including criminals. This could result in significant business disruption. It could also lead to unauthorized access to any of our systems or information, theft of information or finances, breach of statutory obligations, substantial fines and significant reputational damage.

(Review end Jan 2022) PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 13 Corporate Risk 46 RISK AREA/CONTEXT: Failure to meet statutory & legal requirements in relation to Emergency Planning (EPRR) DESCRIPTION OF RISK : Disruption, loss of reputation, inefficient response, failure to meet statutory and legal requirements for Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) The PHA Health Protection Team has a statutory responsibility for emergency response. Inadequate mechanisms to financially compensate staff (across all pay bands) that are not on a service rota, has meant that staff are reluctant to participate in training or emergency response. This directly contributes to the following areas of risk for organisational resilience and emergency response; Inability to fully operationalise the Joint Response Emergency Plan. Absence of identified group of staff for activation of the Emergency Operation Centre Plan and vulnerability to organisational resilience for a sustained emergency response, management of an outbreak and pandemic response. DATE RISK ADDED: April 2019 LINK TO ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK: Corporate Control Arrangements Dimension LINK TO ANNUAL BUSINESS PLAN 2021/22: Potentially all corporate objectives; particularly corporate objectives 4 (working together to ensure high quality services) and 5 (our organisation works effectively).

We now report annually to the DoH re EP core standards. We have \"tried and tested\" means of response that we have put into practice during COVID. We have successfully operationalised the JREP, the challenge is sustaining the response. We have an identified group of volunteer staff but as was described at AMT in November the requirement to support an emergency response should be reflected in all job descriptions and all staff should complete EP training commensurate with their roles and responsibilities in the emergency response AFC T&Cs for extended working hours. Failure to pay staff for out of hours work is not within the control of the EP service and is a service/policy issue. Our statutory and policy requirements for emergency response should not rely on a voluntary response from staff, operational response mechanisms should be clarified and agreed as part of the planning phase in order to inform planning and training. A meeting was arranged to discuss progressing this today but had to be rescheduled due to the absence of key staff on leave this week. redeployment and training of staff to support an emergency response and maintaining the function of the EOC (in hours and out of hours).

June 2022 PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 15 Corporate Risk 48 RISK AREA/CONTEXT: PHA Public Website DESCRIPTION OF RISK : The existing PHA public facing website has very restricted functional utility. This has proven to be a signifiacant liability in the response to COVID-19 and has restricted significantly what can be hosted. It is essential for the PHA's messaging to have excellent contemporary functionality, be able to host dynamic content, digital presentations and plug-in directly other content/functionality from other PHA websites including new COVID 19 platforms. As the current website is at the end of its life there is increased and material risk in respect of support arrangements. Risk that key messages are not communicated and reputational risk for the PHA.

PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 21 Corporate Risk 53 RISK AREA/CONTEXT: Corporate Priorities DESCRIPTION OF RISK : There is a risk, that due to COVID 19, the PHA may not be able to deliver on its key objectives. As a result of the need to refocus staff to prioritise work in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, including planning for and putting measures in place to help prevent/minimise the impact of subsequent waves it has not been possible to take forward all other areas of PHA business. There is therefore a risk that the PHA will not be able to deliver on its key objectives including delivery of strategic priorities including Making Life Better.

In the Health Improvement Division, 13% of posts are filled on a temporary basis. The vacancies, and the increasing demands, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19, work to rebuild services and the transformation agenda mean that the existing staff resources are stretched significantly in a number of areas. The number of temporary staff adds further instability. This is not a sustainable position, with constrained capacity in a number of key areas and functions, potential delays taking forward new initiatives, the potential for significant issues to be missed, reduced organisational resilience at times of pressure or emergency limited ability to respond adequately to and deliver on statutory responsibilities and the personal strain on individuals, with the potential for increased sickness absenteeism and further loss of staff.

A key deficit is data/analytics/epidemiol ogy, with both a need to enhance capacity, but also ensure wider data flows both within the PHA and also other HSC settings, is efficient (the recent Hussey 'Review' has included a specific recommendation regarding this).

Recurrent funding has now been confirmed for the Director and Communications /Engament Lead posts. The current staffing complement in HSCQI Directorate makes it challenging for corporate work to be undertaken, and for HSCQI to deliver on the design intent, which included additional staffing, to build a QI infrastructure for NI HSC services. Establishing HSCQI was a key action stated within Health and Well-Being 2026: Delivering Together. The risk is that the directorate will be unable to fulfil it's core function, service corporate administration needs plus undertake additional requests from the NI HSC system to support improvement work and training.

At the same time the PHA has had a significant number of changes in the membership of its senior management team, While there are many opportunities with a new senior team in place, the scale of change has also the potential to lead to instability, with a loss of corporate memory and resources required to gain organisational knowledge and build teams.

However, a range of issues and concerns, constitute potential risks to the sustained provision of these functions: Restoration of Population Screening Programmes (COVID-related) - It is estimated that it will take 12-18 months to restore all population screening programmes to pre-COVID capacity (and longer to bring the programmes back to the recommended screening interval) following the 'pause' in services (March - July 2020) and implementation of social distancing and infection control measures as a result of COVID 19. PHA Staffing - staffing within individual screening programmes is relatively small-scale (and therefore vulnerable during a pro-longed absence/illness). Taking a whole team perspective, there is limited resilience in terms of technical competencies, specifically, in terms of Information analysis and IT systems. Staff capacity has been further compounded by the ongoing challenge of COVID and re-deployment of key senior staff into Health Protection-related duties). Internal Audit - an internal audit of the call-recall functions, provided by BSO, for the bowel and cervical cancer screening programmes undertaken in Nov 2019 identified issues within the governance, risk management and control framework, which could lead to system objectives not being achieved (ie. call-recall). Additionally there are a number of issues relating to specific screening programmes: Cervical Screening Programme (introduction of testing based upon the HPV screening test is needed to be able to continue to quality assure the programme); Breast Screening (replacement of screening equipment, increase capacity in line with demographic growth and links to other IT systems) and Diabetic Eye Screening (implementation of fixed site locations) DATE RISK ADDED: November 2020 LINK TO ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK: Safety and Quality Dimension LINK TO ANNUAL BUSINESS PLAN 2021/22: Corporate Objectives 1 - 4 GRADING LIKELIHOOD IMPACT RISK GRADE Likely Major HIGH LEAD OFFICER: Dr S.

This may, in particular, change the partnership arrangement in place since 2009 in regard to planning, commissioning and monitoring of service developments, service pressures and incidents relating to service quality and safety of patient care. The closure of the HSCB will have an impact on many of the functions of the PHA, in particular, staff working across Nursing, Service Development and Screening team, as well as on provision of finance services. There is a risk that the public health influence into commissioning may be diluted, lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities of PHA staff and lack of clarity about delivery of finance function.

However, ongoing issues and concerns relating to IT systems, constitute potential risks to the sustained provision of these functions: The IT systems under-pinning individual screening programmes are becoming outdated, with some at risk of losing functionality over the medium term 3-5yrs. This will compromise the safe delivery of these programmes. There is no joined up, cross organisation strategic plan for maintenance and development of screening IT systems, with instead a piecemeal approach taken as and when needed. In particular: - Breast Screening Select requires to be implemented in NI as a matter of urgency to ensure the continued functioning of the breast screening programme - The cervical screening programme is operationalized across 3 different IT systems with limited integration. The cervical screening call recall functionality on NHAIS (a 30 year old system) is not included in the project for replacing NHAIS with the new Digital Identity Service. The current IT provision does not adequately support necessary changes to the programme or the flexibile ability to extract data for quality assurance and monitoring purposes (of process or outcomes).

There are a number of risks for the PHA associated with this: Sufficient allocation of funding may not be made available to cover the costs of the service; Potential for governance issues and lack of clarity in respect of accountability (in particular lack of clarity regarding roles, responsibilities and accountability for DoH, PHA, BSO, Trusts and GPs); This is a role outside the scope of the PHA function, (i.e. providing face to face clinical intervention, or running a staffing bank for other organisations to draw from), and while it is recognised that HSC organisations have had to move quickly and work differently to respond to COVID, working to support the DoH vaccination implementation programme, there is a risk that there is no exit strategy for the PHA.

The Lifeline service has become mainstreamed as part of the spectrum of HSC service managed by the Belfast HSC Trust, but subject to annual IPT/PMRs. The operation of an appropriate Information Management System (IMS) is of singular importance to the successful delivery of the Lifeline Crisis Response Service. The provision of a Crisis Response Service relies on the effective and rapid communication of information about the client in order to inform the care decision process at point of contact and to ensure that any follow on actions are clear and timely. Such a process necessitates the deployment of an electronic IMS linked to a modern communications infrastructure. Such a system must also provide access for the helpline operator to historical data about previous interactions with the client. In September 2018 the PHA in conjunction with Etain and BHSCT carried out a review of the current Lifeline IMS. This review concluded in October 2018 and revealed that the current IMS is no longer fit-for-purpose; a number of issues with the current IMS were identified and approval was given for the current system to be replaced by a new, innovative solution that better meets the needs of both the current Lifeline service and can facilitate future development. There has been a number of delays to the procurement of the new IMS system. The current system is running on an older operating system (MS Server 2008) which is no longer supported by Microsoft. Upgrades to this operating system is not an option as they are not compatible with the CIMS MS Dynamics Platform. The Lifeline infrastructure supporting CRM is now out of mainstream support.

PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 45 Corporate Risk 65 RISK AREA/CONTEXT: Finance - Risk of PHA financial breakeven 2021/22 DESCRIPTION OF RISK : The requirement for PHA to respond rapidly to the developing coronavirus epidemic, including the impact of Covid downturn in respect of PHA business as usual operations and the ability of organisations funded by PHA to fully spend their allocated resources, may result in PHA inability to ensure that expenditure relating to PHA funding streams is fully incurred. There is therefore a risk that PHA may not achieve its statutory obligation to breakeven within 0.25% of revenue funding.

DESCRIPTION OF RISK : The PHA has several tenders that have now expired beyond the contract end date and Direct Award Contracts (DAC) have had to be put in place to ensure existing services can continue to be provided. Many of these DAC contracts are delivering complex and high risk services to vulnerable individuals impacted by drug and alcohol and mental health issues. It is important that these contracts are re-tendered as soon as possible to ensure service specifications are updated to reflect changes in evidence base and professional practice and longer term contracts awarded to provide stability to the services for clients and providers.

As well as Trusts and local government, many services are provided by a large number of voluntary, community and private organisations. As a result of COVID 19, including the economic consequences, some of these organisations have still not returned to full capacity of delivery and in some cases non delivery), with the risk that PHA may not be able to deliver the necessary services to achieve its corporate objectives.

On-going dialogue with providers including Monthly Reports to AMT and PHA board Internal Audit of management of contracts (voluntary and community) during 20/21 with a focus on COVID 19, provided satisfactory assurance. Services may not be delivered,as initially contracted may result in greater inequalities; Organisations who are contracted by PHA may have external factors that may impact on ability to deliver services eg impact of other funding apart from PHA including fundraising. Lead officers are continuing to review all contracts via quarterly progress monitoring reports received from providers. The status of the contracts are reviewed by the Contract Management Group and a Risk Register Maintained and updated quarterly. 96% of contract providers are currently either delivering services fully as contracted or with reasonable adjustments Mar 2022 PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 52 calls PHA will continue to pay all core costs linked to its contracts to ensure services can continue to be delivered, where possible and the risk of organisations collapsing due to economic factors is reduced (in line with regional guidance) PHA Corporate Risk Register Page 53 Corporate Risk 58 RISK AREA/CONTEXT: Staff Resilience DESCRIPTION OF RISK : The PHA was required to move to a 7 day working pattern in the initial phase of the COVID 19 pandemic. The organization is again entering a period of 7 day working, which is likely to be required through to the end of the winter. PHA has limited staff capacity, and while additional staff have been brought in, there is concern that a significant number of staff will have to work more than 5 days a week over a long and sustained period. As staff are already tired from 2020/21, and with many unable to take their full leave allocation due to the continuing work pressures, there is a risk that staff may become ill and/or no longer able to continue.
