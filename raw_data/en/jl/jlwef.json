Mine is getting to the root cause of why you aren't well and help you truly heal. My other genius is to help you open to what's possible in your life and connect you to the essence of who you truly are. Utilizing my intuition and gifts of clairvoyance, as well as my many years of clinical experience as a naturopathic doctor and mind-body-spirit counselor, I get to the root of what is happening with you, whether it be on a physical, emotional, spiritual, mental or energetic level. Through my many skills, tools, and abilities I help you to meet yourself and your healing in a way that is loving, compassionate and transformative. Naturopathic Doctor Specializing in Mind-Body-Spirit Intuitive Counseling For two decades I've been a naturopathic doctor, mind, body, spirit specialist and energy medicine practitioner. I've received decades of training. Have had hundreds of hours of mentoring, Most significantly, I've sat with thousands of people. I've also been a teacher for over 20 years in the realm of consciousness, spirituality, holistic healthcare, and energy medicine. Lastly, I've also found my way through my own deep healing into spiritual awakening and embodiment. Because of these experiences, I know the terrain of healing well and can help you find your way to healing, peace, and alignment with your true nature. Professional Bio I am a graduate of Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and received a Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine in 2000. I am also a graduate of the Academy of Intuition Medicine and received a Master Certificate in Intuition Medicine\u00ae in 2003. [Read more about my teaching background.](#!/teaching-background) Founder of Somatic Awakening\u00ae Through my experience of healing others and myself, I created a powerful mind-body-spirit modality called Somatic Awakening\u00ae. This practice can lead to entire new vistas of healing and awareness on every level of ones being. With this modality, clients find peace, healing, freedom and reconnection to the divine within. Holistic Healing for Mind, Body and Spirit I bring a broad-spectrum toolbox of healing to my patients, which includes many mind-body healing modalities. Most of these modalities now influence the Somatic Awakening\u00ae work that I offer. I list them here to get an understanding of the extensive training I have undergone in mind-body-energy modalities. I am trained and certified in the following: - Voice Dialogue - Theta Healing\u00ae - Intuition Medicine\u00ae - Reichian Breathwork - Upledger Craniosacral Reiki: Master Level - Ananda Yoga: Instructor - Polarity Therapy - Massage Therapy - Holographic Memory Resolution - Ericksonian Hypnotherapy For full explanations of the techniques, see [Mind-Body-Spirit Practices I Use.](https://somatic-awakening.com/mind-body-spirit-counseling/) Spiritual Initiation and Teaching Spiritual Initiation I have been a spiritual seeker and meditator for almost 30 years. During this time, I was led through a profound multiple year spiritual initiation (which is still unraveling to this day). This time included an almost decades-long dark night of the soul experience, where I was asked to give up just about everything to find the deeper meaning of opening to spirit, humility, and surrender in a very profound way. As this experience ended, I was called into a spiritual initiation, in which I stepped into many levels of awakening, and now, embodiment. [For more, see My Calling As A Healer.](https://somatic-awakening.com/my-calling-as-a-healer/) I am being guided now to step more fully into the world as a Spiritual Teacher, Mystic, Priestess, and Oracle. Spiritual Teacher and Oracle I am a guardian, teacher and guide in the realms of soul and spirit. My intention is that my teaching comes from true Source. Therefore, it holds a high vibration and connection with the divine. The intention of sharing this is to connect you to your higher wisdom, as well as bring you into deep presence and peace. As a spiritual teacher, I offer deep insight into the nature of reality, healing, awakening and embodiment. My focus is to help you find your own answers, wisdom, and truth inside of you, ultimately helping you connect to the divine inside. From this place powerful healing energy arises. I have been a student of many spiritual traditions over the last 30 years. On the deepest level, I find that divinity is in all things, no matter the form. However, the lineage that I am most deeply connected to is that of Mystical Christianity. I am a priestess in the Sophia-Magdalene lineage. Through my spiritual awakening experiences, I have been called to reclaim this lineage and help others who are called, do the same. As part of this path I have been called to transmit a High Christ Council of Ascended Masters and Archangels, who call themselves The Council of One. The transmissions from these Ascended Masters and Archangels can help you evolve and heal your life on all levels, as well as bestow ease, grace, love, and support. [Read more about these transmission here.](https://somatic-awakening.com/mind-body-spirit-counseling/#!/spiritual-transmissions) I have witnessed these transmissions take many people to their next level of physical, emotional and energetic healing, as well as spiritual evolution and awakening. Indigenous Spirituality Throughout my 20s and 30s, I studied and practiced many forms of indigenously based wisdom. Through these experiences, I walked through many initiatory portals including participating and co-facilitating in numerous vision quests and participation in a six-month women's initiation process. I have studied with various medicine people from diverse tribal backgrounds, including - Lakota - Cherokee - Crow - Dagara (African) Studying indigenous wisdom has given me a profound respect for the Earth and how we are all connected to the web of life.
