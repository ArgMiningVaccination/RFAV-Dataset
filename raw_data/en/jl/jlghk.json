Trials Objectives To investigate the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic medicine Natrum muriaticum (LM2) for mild cases of COVID-19 in Primary Health Care. Trial design A randomized, two-armed (1:1), parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial is being performed to test the following hypotheses: H0: homeopathic medicines = placebo (null hypothesis) vs. H1: homeopathic medicines placebo (alternative hypothesis) for mild cases of COVID-19 in Primary Care. Participants Setting: Primary Care of S\u00e3o Carlos - S\u00e3o Paulo - Brazil. One hundred participants aged 18 years or older, with Influenza-like symptoms and a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Willingness to give informed consent and to comply with the study procedures is also required. Exclusion criterium: severe acute respiratory syndrome. Intervention and comparator Homeopathy: 1 globule of Natrum muriaticum LM2 diluted in 20 mL of alcohol 30% and dispensed in a 30 ml bottle. Placebo: 20 mL of alcohol 30% dispensed in a 3... Journal of Addiction Science Aims: Homeopathic complex Tepeex effect of Tepeex \u00ae in pre-clinical models of depression and anxiety. Methods: the following tests were performed: elevated plus maze test (EPM); forced swimming test (FST); open field test (OFT) and Rotarod test (RRT). Results: In EPM, animals treated with Tepeex \u00ae on days 20 and 30 stayed longer in the open arms of the maze than the control group (p < 0.05, Dunnett test). In FST, treatment with Tepeex \u00ae did not increase swimming time compared to the control group in any phase of treatment. In OFT, crossing increased significantly with treatment with amfepramone, and also with 30-day treatment with Tepeex \u00ae (p < 0.05, Dunnette test). In RRT, treatment with amfepramone significantly reduced latency time. 30-day treatment with Tepeex \u00ae did not affect motor coordination when compared to the control group. Conclusion: results suggest that homeopathic complex Tepeex \u00ae has anxiolytic properties without Revista De Psiquiatria Clinica 2007 Forschende Komplement\u00e4rmedizin / Research Medicine 2009 Revista De Psiquiatria Clinica 2008 BACKGROUND: Evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy for depression is limited due to lack of clinical trials of high quality. Case reports are the first steps of clinical evidence, towards controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To report preliminary results of homeopathic treatment of depression in Jundiai's public health system, Sao Paulo. METHODS: Review of the medical records of new patients, treated between March and December 2006. Their diagnosis was confirmed by a semi-structured interview. Patients received individualized homeopathy and their response was measured by the Montgomery & \u00c5sberg depression scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated and response (more than 50% decrease of MADRS scores) was observed in 14 patients (93%), after an average of seven weeks of treatment; one patient had clinical worsening and was refered to conventional antidepressant therapy. The MADRS mean scores (\u00b1 dp) decreased from 24.9 (\u00b1 5.8) to 9.7 (\u00b1 8.2, p < .0001) in the 2nd evaluation, and these results signifcance were sustained through the 3rd and 4th assessments. DISCUSSION: these results suggest that homeopathy may be an alternative therapeutics for depression, but randomized and controlled studies are needed to test the efficacy and safety of the homeopathic treatment of the depressive disorders.
