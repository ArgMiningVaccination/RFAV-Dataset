Department of Aromatherapy We offer Certificates, Diplomas, Associates, Bachelors and Master of Science degrees in Aromatherapy. You'll find professional aromatherapists working in a number of industries like perfumery & flavoring, natural products & cosmetics, hospital & clinical settings, private in-person and virtual wellness consulting as well as spa & hospitality. What doors could advanced training in aromatherapy open for you? Department of Holistic Nutrition Empower your clients to make optimal decisions for daily health with a degree in Holistic Nutrition. An emphasis on educating and empowering distinguishes the holistic approach. It's about inspiring clients to choose exotic fruits rather than chocolate bars (or choosing organic dark chocolate rather than a Hershey Bar). A holistic nutritionist may also include exercise, hobbies, social activities (dancing!), books, and DVDs, among other tools. The goal is for the client to learn what works for him or her and to develop healthy habits that he or she can carry forward long after the educational sessions. Department of Herbal Medicine How can you incorporate the healing power of plants into your wellness practice? Department of Integrative Health Integrative approaches to health and wellness are designed to enhance and optimize a patient's treatment plan. Learn to employ best practices in aromatherapy, homeopathy, herbalism and holistic nutrition to treat patients in a truly personalized way that enhances healing and vitality. Sustainable Business ACHS promotes the global mindset that is so critical for success in today's business world and provides a pathway for integrative health and wellness professionals to have an even greater impact on the unprecedented health care challenges, needs, and opportunities facing us today. Note: Graduation from an ACHS Certificate, Diploma, or Degree program does not confer a license to practice medicine. ACHS graduates serve as holistic health consultants and educators and do not claim to treat, diagnose, cure or prescribe. Please also note that not all graduates will achieve the career outcomes identified in the pages herein. Should I take an undergraduate or graduate program? We highly recommend our graduate programs for those already having completed a bachelor's degree. There are many benefits to taking a graduate level program: Compared to some of the undergraduate Certificate and Diplomas, earning a master's degree often makes sense in terms of time and financial commitment. - Preparing you for a new career, a raise in pay, a promotion, and/or allow you access to jobs you have wanted, but were not qualified for - Often masters degrees are required to advance in your current career or even teach in higher education - By attending graduate school, you are positioning yourself to achieve mastery of a subject or discipline - You are not attending graduate school because you are bored. You are attending graduate school because you are excited about studying and researching a topic you are passionate about, you are excited that it will provide new career opportunities, and you are excited about this new experience.
