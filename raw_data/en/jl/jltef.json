The herbs used in Ayurveda for various purposes which include balancing of tissues, overall rejuvenation, and healing of certain conditions, are so scientific and evidence-based. The next question that dawns in our minds is - how are these herbs actually helping in healing and rejuvenation? What is the science behind Ayurvedic herbology? To answer such questions, we need to update our understanding of \"water\". The latest research in this field has so many eye-opening revelations. Water makes up almost half our body weight, flowing through us to nourish, remove waste, lubricate joints and even regulate our body temperature. 70% of the human body consists of water. Water in the form of liquid is considered the one critical criterion necessary to sustain life on this planet. It's interaction with many of the elements in the periodic table produces the chemicals necessary for life. And as such may hold the key to understanding life itself. Rebel water What's most interesting about water is that it refuses to be like other substances and it often plays by its own rules. Scientists today are perplexed over its various anomalous properties. And one such property is its ability to float, like ice. A normal substance would get denser, and therefore heavier, as it changes from liquid to solid. The 'rebel' water refuses to be densest at its freezing point i.e. zero degrees centigrade, but rather it is densest at four degrees centigrade. This feature of water allows it to freeze from the top making life in oceans, lakes, and rivers possible, even in the coldest of winters. Responsibility for this seemingly inexplicable density maximum at 4\u00b0C lies in the presence of water's \"fourth phase\". Thanks to the efforts of a few recent researchers in this area, we now know the reason behind this strange behavior from water. According to Ruston Roy, unlike other substances, more than its chemical composition, it is the structural make-up of water that plays a major... "}
