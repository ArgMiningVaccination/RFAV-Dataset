Household food security is the application of this concept to the family level, with individuals within households as the focus of concern (FAO, 2003) \" Vaccine Security .....people, at all times have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and effective vaccines to meet their needs and of the livestock in their care...... OS18 Vaccine security UNICEF Vaccine security requires the guaranteed production of vaccines, secures multi -year allocations for vaccine financing, the development of long -term forecasting of vaccine requirements and helps reduce wastage . The context here is the secure delivery of international vaccine campaigns by national health services . In livestock production, who is our focus ? Who is in need of vaccine SECURITY ?OS18 FMD CONTEXT (2018) Non -free ( Endemic): Africa, Asia, Mid -East Free countries (70), countries with free zones (19 )Global large ruminants 1,782 MILLION: ~ One billion of these are in FMD endemic countries [Hundreds of millions of owners] X 1.7 billionOS18 Global burden of FMD estimated that around 2%of the world's cattle population has FMD in a year (90% uncertainty range: 2 -5%) Global estimate of 32 million livestock units (LSU) are affected by FMD in a year (but maybe >250 million *) Frequent and high risk disease for cattle producers in endemic regions Global demand for FMD vaccine (Session 2) based on serological surveys compared to reported casesOS18 Annual FMD loss per head : much higher in non -free countries FMD -country statusTotal Cattle and BuffaloesImpact (2012) per annumLoss per head/annum FREE 836 million US$ 1.5 billion USD 1.79 NOT -Free 946 million US$ 11 billion USD 11.6 Livestock data (2015) from FAOSTAT.

Vaccination: optimize by targeting to risks - introduced to national planning (PCP) Production systems need different vaccination programmes Chris Bartels & Melissa McLaws Iran -PCP Stage 1 project OS18 OS08 and vaccination Vaccination: optimize by targeting to risks -introduced to national planning (PCP) OIE/FAO Reference Centres Annual Guidance Report per pool (from 2010) OS18 PCP early day push backs on vaccination FMD eradication camp concept of \"\"control means total control\"\" (nothing is under control until everything is under control) Compared to \"\"control begins at the epi -unit\"\" (farm, village..) Thus: Its useless to do anything unless you achieve 80%+ vaccination cover Vs \"\"Good immunity protects against disease at animal and epi -unit scale ..and can give immediate benefits \"\"OS18 Erice 0S08 -new vaccines What capsids \"\"should be pursued\"\" (Session 7, Day 2) GFRA members -carrying the torch in the darkness Day 2 : improving conventional vaccines recombinant and attenuation (LL - Leaderless) vaccines Improving master seed viruses OS18 OS08 and Measuring progress Global Strategy needs ... Global Progress Measurement: Global Risk Report at least 2x per year (OIE/FAO) Monthly Global Reports (EuFMD), Quarterly (WRL) and Annual (OIE/FAO FMD network) Epidemiological evidence -to measure \"'real progress to reduce incidence \"\" Guidance was to focus on PCP process indicators NOT actual health (%NSP+..) However as PCP was rolled out, sero -survey data 2008 -12 allowed revised estimates of global FMD burdens and impacts (Knight -Jones & Rushton, 2013; Knight -Jones, McLaws & Rushton 2017) Global strategy to place emphasis on monitoring efficacy of vaccination programmes Post -Vaccination Monitoring (PVM) Guidelines, FAO/OIE Associated e -learning courses training (EuFMD, WRL, IZS) ( Session 8 ) Thus : currently NO Annual Global Report combining virological , epidemiological and programmatic (PCP) progress in every region Separate virological and programmatic reports No systematic epi -report or vaccination reports GAPOS18 What did we do after OS08? Strategy for Regional and Global Control Ecosystems approach : 7 pools Regional workshops to develop longer term regional strategies (Roadmaps) BUT... FAO and OIE to address how increased investment/financing can be achieved with high buy -in from stakeholders Until 2017 : OIE/BMGF Initiative on PPP but focus on services -not financing Socio -economic issues preventing stakeholder investment must be addressed Identified in Stage 1 -PCP but issues difficult to address in endemic regionsOS18 Imagine if the people Controlled their own PCP Standing on their own feet Sharing responsibility You may say I'm a dreamer [I hope am not the only one]OS18 Lets be honest...What did we NOT do? Address the fundamentals Who pays? Who takes responsibility? You cannot vaccinate, without vaccine Transform vaccine availability Change enough minds on investment Mainstream PCP into development agendas (World Bank projects etc)OS18 FMD control -who should pay for it? Public good? Vaccination to prevent a contagious disease Defending borders against entry Response and elimination of incursions Private good? FMD prevention as part of good production practice -the owner is the main economic beneficiary OS18 Issues for privatizing FMD vaccination -endemic countries Policy : Can disease be controlled at herd level even if neighbours do not vaccinate Supply issue: availability of quality vaccines LOW Market development needs information ! PPP -needs enabling environment for private uptake of vaccination Experience/Risk tolerance of livestock owners No product on market Disease uncontrolled Living with lossesLack of market demand for vaccine Vaccine not produced for AfricaOS18 Working better together? public, private and industry Public servicesNational FMD strategies Prevention programmes Enabling environment for health service delivery Surveillance, Regulate and enforce Register vaccines Private sector animal health Herd level prevention and treatment services Major option for service delivery (vaccination) Maybe impeded by state actors from delivering services Role of paravets Livestock industryAnimal wealth is in private hands Potential for co -management of FMD issues with Government Many players, may lack cohesive voice Potential to establish management based high -health compartments with Often weak, unsupportive (endemic regions) Private sector often impeded from providing services on FMD lack access to quality vaccines or risk information for preventive plans Potential to drive change - if enabled to work with Government actors OS18 VACCINE Security is not equal Why should the FMD FREE COUNTRIES have the good VACCINE ?

What would vaccine availability look like...And Google was to tell vaccine buyers whats available near you? If Amazon was to manage delivery? \"ALEXA, find vaccines for tomorrow\"\"OS18 Vaccine availability: why don't we talk about it? Its just too huge!!!! so no one is talking about it Why? The needy are not in charge.. PPP avoidance Reluctance of international bodies to engage with private sector/pharma? No equivalent of GAVI for animal health? Or?
