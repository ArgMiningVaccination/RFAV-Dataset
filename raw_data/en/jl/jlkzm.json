This read shows a  LIST OF ADAPTOGENS AND THEIR BENEFITS  and side effects that can help combat what you're feeling.", "sitename": "BetterMe Blog", "date": "2022-06-22", "cleaned_text": "Stress can be a good thing. It can motivate us and help us meet deadlines. But when it becomes constant, it takes a toll on our physical and mental health. Long-term excessive stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and other serious health problems ( [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137920/)). One way some people try to combat stress is by using adaptogens, herbs that are thought to help the body adapt to stressors by reducing the negative effects of stress. Adaptogens are claimed to help improve your mood, increase energy levels, and boost immunity. Let's look at how your brain and body react to stress, as well as how adaptogens are said to hack that response to help you better cope with stressors. What Happens In Your Body When You're Stressed? As described by one scientist in the 1930s, the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) is the body's way of responding to stressors. It consists of three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349158/)). The alarm stage is when you first [experience stress](https://betterme.world/articles/do-vitamins-break-a-fast/). This \"fight-or-flight\" response is designed to help you deal with the threat. It increases your heart rate and blood pressure, releases [energy-boosting hormones](https://betterme.world/articles/cico-diet/) like adrenaline and cortisol, and increases blood flow to your muscles. All these changes help you deal with a stressful or dangerous situation ( [25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009512000042)). The resistance stage is when your body adapts to the stressor and tries to return to normal. Think of it as the sweet spot; you're not alarmed, but you're not yet exhausted. You're coping with the stress and perhaps trying to find ways to avoid it in the future The exhaustion stage is when your body can no longer cope with the stressor. This is when you may experience burnout, anxiety, or depression. Your immune system also weakens, making you more susceptible to illness. This can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and anxiety. Fortunately, there might be ways to prevent stress from progressing to the exhaustion stage. One of them may be by using adaptogens. Adaptogens can't prevent stress but they are thought to lengthen the resistance stage, giving you more time to deal with the stressor, find a solution, or remove yourself from the situation.

Adaptogens are a unique class of healing herbs that may help the body resist [physical](https://betterme.world/articles/banting-diet/), chemical, and biological stressors ( [15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/med.21743)). They are thought to do this by modulating the release of stress hormones like cortisol and by helping repair the damage caused by chronic stress. These herbs have been used for centuries in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine to help people cope with stress, anxiety, and fatigue ( [15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/med.21743)). Today, adaptogens are gaining popularity in the west as more people are looking for natural ways to improve their health ( [11](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/3/1/188/htm)). Let's take a look at some of the [most popular](https://betterme.world/articles/grain-free-diet/) adaptogens and their potential benefits. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is an ancient herb that's derived from the nightshade family of plants. It's also known as \"Indian ginseng\" because of its rejuvenating properties. The herb has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to treat a variety of conditions, including anxiety, stress, and low energy levels. Recent studies have shown that ashwagandha may have the following benefits ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/)): - Reduces stress and anxiety. It is thought to influence the mediators of stress and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system in your body that regulates the stress response. - Improves athletic performance. This herb has been seen in rats to enhance swimming endurance. - May reduce symptoms of some mental health conditions. It may have some antidepressant effects, but should not be used as a substitute for antidepressant medication. - Reduces inflammation. It contains compounds, including withanolides, that have anti-inflammatory effects. - Improves brain function, including memory. The withaferin A, a compound in ashwagandha, has been shown to reverse induced cognitive defects in an Alzheimer's disease model.. - Improves sleep. Ashwagandha may promote restful sleep and help you feel more alert when you wake up ( [10](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257843)). - May boost testosterone and increase fertility in men. It may increase sperm count and motility ( [6](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/571420/)). Some side effects that have been reported from taking ashwagandha include ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/)): - gastrointestinal discomfort - drowsiness - diarrhea This herb may also affect the thyroid, so people with thyroid conditions should use it with caution and only after discussing with their doctor. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, it's best to avoid ashwagandha as well. Siberian Ginseng Despite its name, Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is not related to true ginseng (Panax ginseng). This herb is native to Russia and China and has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. Siberian ginseng has been traditionally used to treat fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Siberian ginseng is generally safe to take, but it can cause some side effects, such as anxiety, insomnia, and headaches.

These compounds may help to increase ATP production in the body, which leads to more energy ( [12](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1749-8546-2-3)). - Improving respiratory function. This herb has also been used traditionally for those with respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis. This is because it is believed to have the ability to open up the airways and improve oxygen utilization in the body ( [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.602364/full)). - Enhancing immune function. Some of the compounds in cordyceps have demonstrated immunomodulatory activity, which is the ability to control or stimulate the immune system ( [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.602364/full)). - Anti-aging effects. Cordyceps contain compounds which may act as antioxidants, helping to protect cells and DNA from damage, which can theoretically help to reduce the signs of aging ( [7](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/12/2735/htm)). Cordyceps are available in many forms, including capsules, powders, and tinctures. They can also be found in some energy drinks and supplements. While cordyceps are generally considered safe, there are a few potential side effects to be aware of. These include an upset stomach and dizziness ( [7](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/12/2735/htm)). Cordyceps can interact with some medications, such as blood thinners and immunosuppressants.

Licorice Root Licorice root is one of the most popular and well-known adaptogens. It's gotten a reputation for being a \"cure-all\" herb, and while it's not quite that powerful, it does offer a wide range of possible benefits, including ( [4](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf404939f)): - Improving digestion.

Each adaptogen has unique benefits and works in different ways. To get the most out of these herbs, it's important to choose the right one for your needs, as well as: Talk To Your Doctor First It's always a good idea to talk to your doctor before taking any new supplements, especially if you are pregnant, may become pregnant, breastfeeding, have a history of any medical conditions or are taking any medications. Every adaptogen comes with its own risks and potential interactions. Following Dosing Instructions Carefully Too much of anything, even the good stuff, can be bad for you. When it comes to adaptogens, more is not necessarily better. Start with the lowest possible dose and increase gradually as needed. Paying Attention To How You Feel Adaptogens are not miracle cure-alls, and they don't work the same for everyone. Pay attention to how you feel after taking an adaptogen, and if you don't notice any benefits, try a different one. Remembering That They Take Time To Work Adaptogens are not immediate fixes. They need to be taken regularly over a period before you will start to see and feel the benefits. Getting Creative Adaptogens can be taken in many different forms, from capsules and tablets to powders, teas, and tinctures. Find the form that works best for you and you enjoy taking. You can also add adaptogens to your diet by incorporating them into recipes. For example, maca powder can be added to smoothies, soups, and baked goods. Timing Everything Some adaptogens have a stimulating effect while others have a calming effect. To get the most out of these herbs, it's important to take them at the right time of day. For example, if you're looking for an energy boost, it's best to take a stimulating adaptogen like ashwagandha in the morning. If you're hoping to improve your sleep, a calming adaptogen like holy basil is best taken in the evening. The Bottom Line With all of that being said, adaptogens are a powerful tool that can be used to support the body in times of stress. When used correctly, they can have a profound impact on your overall health and well-being. It is important to note the relevance of learning about these awesome adaptogens before taking them. Although they majorly have minor side effects, it is better to consult your doctor if symptoms persist. Always talk to your doctor before taking any new supplements, especially if you are pregnant, may become pregnant, breastfeeding, have any medical conditions, or are taking any medications.
