We were founded in 2010 with the purpose of organizing members in stigmatized communities including neighborhoods of socially ill-repute. This mission led us to hire a spitfire, legendary organizer William Miller, Sr. Mr. Miller Sr. organized and created power among those who with a history or who actively use drugs. He believed that no person in recovery was 'clean' because that implies they were at one point dirty. He believed that with the realization of power, we could organize harm reduction efforts at the grassroots level to improve conditions for all drug users across our State. In October 2020, harm reductionists lost a powerful advocate with the death of William Miller, Sr. to a sudden overdose. Miller's passing sent a sharp jolt through both our organization and the harm reduction community in our city. OPS could have saved his life. They could also save any of the 205 persons who died from overdoses in Baltimore in the first quarter of 2020 or the 427 people who overdosed in the second quarter. Our organizing in Baltimore's Gilmor homes and McCulloh Homes (Baltimore's 40th Legislative District) provide essential education to drug users and the families and communities that know, love and depend upon them. This education has lead our people to say of OPS, \"Yes, In my neighborhood!\" They cannot refuse the opportunity to save lives, which far outweighs the stigma that causes people to act or vote counter to harm reduction efforts. We humbly, yet stridently ask that this committee takes a stand against death. Take a stand against further harm and against unsubstantiated stigma. Take a stand to make Maryland a leader in preventing overdoses. If the number of homicide deaths is a public health crisis - which we argue they are - then surely overdose deaths which are double to triple those deaths should be addressed with the same sense of urgency. We have a solution, and that is OPS. In the hundreds of safe use sites across the world, there have been no deaths due to overdoses. Overdose prevention sites save lives. As Mr. Will Miller Sr said to you last year: \"The question is simple, if you dare to answer it: Do you want to save lives, or don't you?!\" You do. Show it with your support of SB0279. Thank you. Communities United MATOD - SB 279 MATOD members include community and hospital based Opioid Treatment Programs, local Health Departments, local Addiction and Behavioral Health Authorities and Maryland organizations that support evidence -based Medication Assisted Treatment. MATOD members include thousands of highly trained and dedicated addiction counselors, clinical social workers, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, peer recovery specialists and dedicated staff who work every day to save and transform lives. Senate Finance Committee January 26, 2021 Senat e Bill 279 Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program Support The Maryland Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (MATOD) supports Senat e Bill 279, which will allow jurisdictions to develop Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention programs to reduce fatal and non- fatal overdo ses, and provide a pathway for people toward needed health care. Fatal Opioid -related overdoses climbed over 14% from January to September 2020 compared to the same 2019 time-frame . The current increase in fatal overdoses translates to the loss of over 2,400 Marylanders during 2020 from Opioid misuse . Despite Maryland's continued efforts of Prevention, Enforcement and Treatment & Recovery, Opioid addiction and misuse in 2020 will unfortunately claim the largest number of Maryland lives in any single year on record. Maryland's \"all hands on deck\" \"all tools available\" approach has effectively saved lives with harm reduction efforts of increased naloxone distribution and syringe exchange services ; increased access and availability to evidenced -based Medica tion Assisted Treatment (MAT) with Methadone and Buprenorphine ; greater implementation of Peer Recovery Specialists in medical and community settings and creative jurisdictional Opioid Intervention Teams (OIT) across the state. More is urgently needed , however, in order to save lives and change the trajectory of the continued Opioid crisis . Substance Use, Behavioral Health and medical care and treatment is only be effective when and if it's received. The U.S. Surgeon General's 2016 \"Facing Addiction\" repor t noted that \"only 1 in 10 people with a substance use disorder receive any type of substance use treatment\". SB 279 can provide life- saving services for those 90% of Marylanders with the manageable disease of addiction who are not yet engaged in treatment . The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program is based on similar programs operating in more than sixty (60) cities in ten (10) countries. The results and evidence from these successful harm - reduction facilities is unequivocal - they reduce overdose deaths, provide an entry into treatment, reduce public use and publicly discarded syringes, are cost- effective and they do not encourage or increase additional drug use or crime. Maryland needs to join the six (6) states considering legislative approval of such sites, and provide another tool in the great work being done to reduce overdose deaths and improve access to needed health care. MATOD urges a favorable report on SB 279. c/o IBR/REACH Health Services 2104 Maryland Avenue Baltimore, MD 21218 (410) 752-6080 www.matod.org Board of Directors 2019 - 2021 Vickie Walters, LCSW -C IBR/REACH Health Service s VWalters@IBRinc.org President Elect Josh Grollmes, MS Serenity Health JGrollmes@serenityllc.net Secretary Melissa Vail, LCPC Sinai Hospital Addiction s Recovery Program (SHARP) MAVail@lifebridgehealth.org Treasurer Babak Imanoel, D.O.

We work with youth, ages 14 to 25, by providing them services to sustainably grow in a dignified, supportive, and safe space. Our team provides, in a broad sense, drop -in services and case management, employment services and job readin ess training, housing connections, and leadership opportunities. YES is also an overdose response program (ORP); we became an ORP through the Maryland State Department of Health, which allows us to distribute naloxone to our youth and their networks, a cri tical tool and intervention in treating substance use as a public health issue. Overdose Prevention Sites (OPS) are an extension of this harm reduction movement, one rooted in social justice and dignity. We write to express our support for SB 279, which wi ll authorize the establishment of Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Programs by community - based organizations. We believe that OPS are another critical tool needed to allow for the safe consumption of substances, and can help connect peop le to much -needed, life -saving resources. At YES, we fundamentally believe in harm reduction and trauma -informed practices , as core principles, rooted in the SELF Sanctuary Model. We strive to carry this into our work, to make YES as safe, accessible, and dignified for the youth we work with \u2014an emphasis on with . Overdose Prevention Sites are physical and figurative testaments to how harm reduction and trauma - informed care can work; they allow for people to safely consume substances , in a safe and supportive environment where they can get connected to services if they need to. OPS can be integrated into some existing services, expanding the possibilities for how to best serve individuals. They are a proven, effective , safe , and cost -effective service, one rooted in treating the racist war on drugs as a systems -level, public health issue , rather than shifting the blame of substance use on the individual . They are a socially -just intervention. Notably, OPS are established safe spaces that are not centered on stripping the dignity away from people who use; on the contrary; OPS allow for people who use to lead dignified and healthy lives , and to get connected to much needed services. YES has had several youth from our community pass away from overdose. The loss of life to overdose was, and still is, traumatizing. Those loved ones lost to over dose are not forgotten. How different would our drop -in center be, how different would our city be, if there were established sites where people who use had access to life -saving tools? To dignified treatment? To respectful practitioners who could support them, before, during, and after their use? This isn't a conceptual dream, or theoretical afterthought; there are very real, dangerous, and traumatizing consequences around what happens when people use without supports. Without the presence of overdose prev ention tools like naloxone. Without the presence of people committed to acknowledging all human life as valuable. As an ORP, we have seen the direct benefits of distributing naloxone to youth in our community. OPS can vastly expand those benefits, and dire ctly save human lives; that should be enough to turn this idea into a tangible, and influential, reality. There are literal lives at stake. Please support SB 279 to authorize the establishment of Overdose and Infections Disease Prevention Services Program s in our communities.

Our Health Rights Project supports po licies and practices that promote the overall health of Marylanders struggling to make ends meet, with the explicit goal of promoting strategies that work to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes. PJC strongly supports SB 279 which wou ld establish an Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program administered by community -based organization s to provide overdose prevention sites. It would also require that the Maryland Department of Health develop these sites in urban, suburban and rural areas. Maryland is still facing an opioid epidemic , and the number of deaths has continued to rise over the last several years. According to the Maryland Behavioral Health Administration, the number of opio id-related deaths increased by 7% between 2017 and 2018.1 Fentanyl -related deaths have increased dramatically since 2013 among most age groups.2 Maryland also has high Hepatitis C infection rates, a disease that kills more Americans than any other infe ctious disease and disproportionately impacts African Americans .3 Further , injection drug use is currently the most common means of Hepatitis C transmission .4 Research supports that stigma against people living with substance use disorders can limit the willingness of individuals to seek treatment.5 It is critical that individuals with substance use disorder s not 1 Maryland Department of Health, Drug and Alcohol -Related Intoxication Death in Maryland (2018), https://bha.health.maryland.gov/Documents/Annual_2018_Drug_Intox_Report.pdf . 2 Id. 3 Francis Collin s, Hepatitis C Disparities among African Americans (2017), https://www.hhs.gov/hepatitis/blog/2017/02/27/hepatitis - c-disparities -among -africa n-americans.html . 4 Kathleen N.

SB 279 , if passed, would create access to Overdose Prevention Site s (OPS) which are revolutionary, holistic tools aimed at reducing overdose deaths, HIV and Hepatitis C infections and stigma against individuals with substance u se disorders. By providing access to sterile needles to individuals who use injectable drugs, Maryland could significantly reduce the rate of HIV and Hepatitis C infections. OPS would also offer testing for HIV, Hepatitis C and sexually transmitted infecti ons and referrals for treatment, allowing individuals who have contracted these infections to be prompt ly connected to care. It is time for Maryland to invest in OPS as a strategy to help end the opioid epidemic and connect individuals with substance use disorders to quality and compassionate care. For these reasons, the Public Justice Center urges the committee to issue a FAVOR ABLE report for SB 279 .

Feldman FROM: Pamela Metz Steven 22 , 2021 RE: SUPPORT - Senate Bill 279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program On behalf of the Maryland State Medical Society (MedChi) and the Maryland Chapter , we submit this letter in support of Senate Bill 279. As an organization of physicians, we treat many patients for drug use. I am here to share a few of those stories. In her intoxicated state, she managed to call her mom to ask her \"do you have any money?\" Completely unaware that she had been admitted hospital. The nameplate on the door said \"Seventy -Two.\" The patient had been brought in by EMS, nearly dead from an overdose that she was no more than a number to our system. As this female in her 40s passed out mid -conversation, I picked up the phone to expl ain to her mother that her daughter was in the hospital and that the orthopedics team would soon be contacting her to obtain consent for an emergent hand operation. A site where the patient had been injecting fentanyl had become severely infected and witho ut this procedure the patient could lose her hand. For 48 hours, the patient experienced severe alcohol and opiate withdrawal symptoms, diarrhea, nausea, and agitation. She required sedatives to prevent her from having seizures. She required a security off icer to prevent her from leaving the hospital in her intoxicated state. For 48 hours, the nursing staff was exhausted and verbally assaulted. In the end the patient's orthopedics procedure was cancelled twice, first from not being able to get appropriate c onsent and again because of the lack of hospital resources. By that time, the patient had sobered up and left against medical advice. Down the hall, patient Seventy -Three was an army veteran. After having suffered so many war injuries, the only thing he found to cure his physical and emotional trauma was heroin. His addiction made it difficult to care for his other medical problems and he would go days without taking his seizure medications. This was his sixth presentation to the hospital in less than a month for seizures. Safe injection sites would help patients Seventy -Two and Seventy -Three and countless other patients, and free up personnel and financial resources for other patients. Seventy -Two's hand site infection would have been prevented. And a n injection site could serve as the gateway for Seventy -Three to get continuous access to medical care for seizure prevention. A summary of research published by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health describes how safe injection facilities save lives, reduce infection, and serve as a gateway to treatment.1 Baltimore would save $6 million dollars by opening one site.2 Studies of previous injection sites have shown decreases in public drug user (by 56%) and high approval ratings (70%) amongst community members.3 MedChi recognize s the research and the potential that these facilities can reduce the costs associated with this public health crisis . For these reasons, MedChi asks for a favorable report on Senate Bill 279. For more information call: Pamela Metz Kasemeyer J.

HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SB 279 - PUBLIC HEALTH - OVERDOSE AND INFECTI OUS DISEASE PREVENTION SERVICES PROGRAM Senate Finance Committee January 26, 2021 Health Care for the Homeless support s SB 279 , which would allow jurisdictions to establish overdose prevention programs to reduce overdose deaths, which continue to rise at an alarming pace in Maryland. Health Care for the Homeless is a non -profit Federally Qualified Health Center that works to prevent and end homeles sness for vulnerable individuals and families by providing quality, integrated health care and promoting access to affordable housing and sustainable incomes through direct service, advocacy and community engagement. The General Assembly is well aware of the tremendous burden that heroin and other opioids are taking on Maryland residents. The numbers of fatalities related to drugs and alcohol continues to be staggering in Maryland. According to the latest report releas ed by the Opioid Operational Command Center, there were over 2,000 unintentional intoxication deaths involving drugs and alcohol in Maryland between January and September.1 Maryland legislators have taken important steps to address this crisis, but o verdos es and deaths continue to climb as we look for strategies to address this problem. Overdose prevention sites are an evidence -based harm reduction strategy proven to reduce overdose deaths and crime in neighboring areas . These sites provide a setting where people can use substances with sterile equipment and medical monitoring in place to prevent overdose and death. There has not been a single overdose fatality at any overdose prevention facility .2 Just as importantly, these facilit ies will provide a vulnerable population with connections to substance use disorder , mental health and medical services. Overdose prevention sites are designed to engage people who are hardest to reach , including patients with untreated medical conditions who may not access hospital or primary care services due to fear of stigma. Many of these individuals live in poverty, with limited access to housing and other basic needs. At Health Care for the Homeless, harm reduction strategies are a cornerstone of ou r work. We train our clients and the community to use naloxone to reverse an overdose and prevent death. Clients have told us with pride how they saved other s by using the naloxone we g ave them. In addition, we utilize medication -assisted 1 Maryland Opioid Operational Command Center (OOCC), 2020 Third Calendar Quarter Report (released Jan. 13, 2021), at r, O. Cottencin, and B.

We are dedicated to community partnerships with organizations that provide needle exchange services , which reduce the spread of HIV, Hepatitis C and other infectious diseases. All of these harm reduction strategies - naloxone, medication assisted treatment (MAT), and needle exchange - caused concern when they first started. Yet, we have seen time and time again that as communities ado pt these programs , overdose fatalities decrease , transmission of infectious diseases slows, and clients build more trusting relationships with medical providers to engage in long -term medical care . Overdose prevention facilities are a continuation of this work. Clients who are c urrent and former drug users have told our providers about the dangerous situations in which they are using heroin and other drugs - in abandoned row houses, in the boiler room of apartment buildings, and in restaurant bathrooms. It is our duty to meet them where they are and help keep them as safe as possible. Overdose prevention facilities would provide a valuable tool to prevent overdose and death in a vulnerable population while connecting them to needed substance abuse, mental h ealth and medical services. We urge the legislature to be a lead er on thi s critical public health issue and ask for a favorable report on SB 279 . Health Care for the Homeless is Maryland's leading provider of integrated health services and supportive housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. We work to prevent and end homelessness for vulnerable individuals and families by prov iding quality, integrated health care and promoting access to affordable housing and sustainable incomes through direct service, advocacy, and community engagement. We deliver integrated medical care, mental health services, state -certified addiction treat ment, dental care, social services, and housing support services for over 10,000 Marylanders annually at sites in Baltimore City, and in Harford, and Baltimore Counties. For more information, visit www.hchmd.org FAVOverdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program Written Testimony for 2021, submitted by Jessie Dunleavy My investment in this legislation, and my insight into the suffering and neglected needs of those with a substance use disorder, is the result of the path I walked with my son, who died of a mixed drug overdose in 2017. I loved and admired my son, and I know his death was preventable. I want to spare others his fate, and mine. Overdose prevention services are based on a deep commitment to public health and human rights. The priority is to keep people safe, eliminate needless suffering, and promote social justice. Champions of overdose prevention services understand that people with a substance use disorder did not forfeit their right to health care or to be treated with dignity. Data from around the world tells us that overdose prevention sites reduce overdose deaths and the spread of infectious disease, while minimizing the compounded misery of arrests and incarceration. Furthermore, they have proven to be a bridge to treatment and have no history of encouraging drug use. In fact, part of the genius of these services is that, in giving people what they need, they come to you for it, which then provides the opportunity to offer additional services, to work in tandem with community based organizations. The US has the highest number of overdose deaths per capita in the world, without a close second. While 2020 will be the most deadly year on record for overdose fatalities, 2019 saw significantly more deaths than 2018, which was before the pandemic. Yet misguided and outdated policies continue, highlighting the gap between research and legislation. It's surprising to me\u2014given the severity of this crisis\u2014that so many who could affect change are reluctant to do so. You may ask yourself WHY you would support this bill. But, I have to ask WHY you would not. I do understand initial skepticism, but I have come to know that what seems on the surface to be counterintuitive actually makes sense. In my years of speaking with a wide range of individuals and groups, I have yet to encounter anyone who doesn't understand the benefits of these services once given the facts. Our job then is to educate, to combat the stigma that thwarts needed progress. Because we live in a society that treats the afflicted as criminals, this is an uphill battle. On one hand, we say we know medical intervention is crucial, but on the other, we force the most vulnerable into back alleys, exacerbating their mental and physical health risks. The long term practice of disempowering those most at risk, of removing resources from them, and isolating them has failed. We are all social people; we all need a network of support and respect. Research also tells us that the vast majority of people recover from a substance use disorder, many on their own\u2014which has always been the case. But today, given the unregulated drug supply and its increased potency, people are dying before they get the chance to recover. As far as community resistance is concerned, the answer, again, lies in education. If we are comfortable with jails and prisons (where dehumanization is all too frequent), but uncomfortable with evidence-based health care that has proven, beyond question, to reduce deaths while bolstering the likelihood of recovery, we have to examine why. I will go back to my son for just a moment. He had disabilities, he struggled in school and was socially awkward. I am sure he found drugs eased his pain. But he was always sweet, and his being dehumanized and degraded only exacerbated his self-doubt. Even so, over time, he was getting better. He loved his job, and had a long stretch of drug-free living. When he relapsed in 2017, he was frightened. But his, and my, earnest attempts to get help failed. Street drugs, on the other hand, were easy to get. And without the benefit of a safe haven or any medical oversight, he died, and he died alone. An overdose prevention site would have saved his life, allowing his continued trajectory toward wellness, allowing him a life. I know too that its premise would have been reassuring, giving him much needed hope. At this juncture, for me, I am buoyed by simply understanding the humanistic principles of overdose prevention services and I am grateful for its tireless advocates. The choice for all of us is between compassion and indifference, and between turning the corner on the still-rising number of overdose deaths or not. It's really the Finance Committee Bill Number: Senate Bill 279 Title: Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program Hearing Date: January 26, 2021 Position: Support The Maryland Nurses Association (MNA) supports Senat e Bill 279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program . This bill would establish an \"Overdose and Infection Disease Program\" to offer program services in areas with a high incidence of drug use. As the number of opioid overdoses increase each year, MNA continues to be very supportive of efforts to address this crisis. This includes having a broad strategy as envisioned by this legislation. MNA supports this endeavor because safe consumption sites provide an array of services in addition to preventing overdoses and deaths due to opioids. This includes the provision of primary health care services including wound care; providing sterile syringes and testing for HIV an d Hepatitis C in order to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases; and connecting individuals to substance use treatment.

MAS represents over 1000 licensed practitioners throughout the State of Maryland and we are in strong support of this bill. Senate Bill 279 would help with the ongoing problem of drug addiction and overdoses in the State of Maryland. As a profession, acupuncturists are dedicated to the fight against drug addiction. Acupuncturists are trained detoxification specialists through the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association. Acupuncture is also an integral part of the National Capitol Region Pain Initiative, which is currently being implemented at Walter Reed. This bill would provide acupuncturists from across the state the opportunity to expand their client base to communities that need them most. These treatment centers would also direct patients to our beneficial services which they might not have found without these community centers. Our practices of tai chi, NADA protocol , and non-opioid pain management techniques would have a direct and positive impact on patients in these facilities. For the reasons stated above we SUPPORT SB 279 - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program. Thank you for your consideration of this important piece of legislation and please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions. Sincerely, Denise Tyson President Maryland Acupuncture Society OPS testimony 1-22-21.pdf Uploaded by: Evans, Katharine Position: FAV/My name is Katharine Evans, and I am a licensed social worker, coordina\u0000ng services for people who use drugs, in Bal\u0000more. I am wri\u0000ng this tes\u0000mony to plead with you to consider allowing us the opportunity to add authorized Overdose Preven\u0000on Sites to our city. I do not have the words to tell you how dicult it was to move from last year into this new year, knowing so many would only be coming with us as memories, because their lives were taken during fatal overdoses. I work for SPARC, which is a drop-in center and harm reduc\u0000on outreach program for women, in Southwest Bal\u0000more. In this se\u0000ng, I have seen how pressing the need is for people to have a low barrier space to relax or sleep- likely for the rst \u0000me in days. SPARC is also a place to get a shower, do laundry, a\u0000end a \"Twerk-shop\", connect with medical care, and build community with other folks. Prior to COVID, I met one of our newer guests at a methadone clinic, where she was expressing that she has lost so many friends to overdoses that she has no one le\u0000 to talk to. She now uses services at SPARC and was so excited to learn that she could also have a place to hang out and use a computer or phone. These social connec\u0000ons and ameni\u0000es are things that we take for granted, and the isola\u0000on of drug use is profound. At SPARC, we also provide people with tools to use drugs more safely, and in these interac\u0000ons we are able to have conversa\u0000ons with people about their drug use that few else are having. These conversa\u0000ons prevent so\u0000 \u0000ssue infec\u0000ons, blood infec\u0000ons and frequently also reduce the rate of injec\u0000on by alterna\u0000ng routes of administra\u0000on. Our present void of safe spaces contributes to the fact that Maryland's opioid using popula\u0000on is not engaged in treatment. SAMHSA es\u0000mated that of Maryland residents with illicit drug dependence, less than 12% receive treatment. Overdose Preven\u0000on Sites are an evidence- based, eec\u0000ve way to drama\u0000cally improve drug user health and save lives. OPS are proven to engage with people who are at heightened risk for infec\u0000ous disease and overdose, and proven to reduce HIV and Hepa\u0000\u0000s C risk behavior. If we were able to add a community-run Overdose Preven\u0000on Site, we could prevent a signicant number of overdose deaths. No one has ever died at an overdose preven\u0000on site, but we have lost so many, just in the last year. A\u0000er a Canadian facility opened, they found that overdose mortality dropped 35% in the area surrounding the facility. We could provide that longevity for residents of Pigtown, Cur\u0000s Bay and Brooklyn, and across the city. Preserva\u0000on of s\u0000gma is the only cause le\u0000 standing in the way of implemen\u0000ng Overdose Preven\u0000on Site care. Please take a moment to imagine how many futures would be preserved, if you make the choice for safety over s\u0000gma. 2021 100, Baltimore, MD 21228 (410) 788 -1066 \u00b7 Fax (410) 747 -0635 \u00b7 nasw.md @verizon.net \u00b7 www.nasw -md.org Senate Finance Committee Testimony in SUPPORT of Senate Bill 279 Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program January 26, 2021 Maryland's Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW - MD), which represents professional social workers across the state, supports Senate Bill 279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program. The State o f Maryland just released new data showing a 12% increase in overdose deaths in Maryland1. This crisis which has been with us for years has been overshadowed by the COVID -19 pandemic. In the isolation, unemployment, and depression that have boomed with the pandemic, addiction has thrived to a deadly degree. Maryland must embrace harm reduction strategies in response. The creation of Overdose Prevention Sites is a proven effective way to reduce deaths. Social workers play a significant role in the substanc e use disorder treatment community. They see clients begin and maintain recovery through finding treatment, sometimes with the use of medication, sometimes including peer support with the aid of 12 -step programs. They also see people who cannot , or choose not, to stop using substances all at once. In those cases, without intervention, clients and their families suffer, fall through the cracks, and die prematurely. Just because a person is using substances does not mean their life is not of value. Social wor kers help meet the needs of - and empower - all people, with particular attention to those who are vulnerable, oppressed, and in poverty2. Unfortunately, with income inequality greater than any time since before the great depression, many people are dying from what are referred to as \"diseases of despair,\" including from substances3. Those people are worthy of help. Overdose Prevention Sites (OPSs) are efficacious , with numerous studies having found they reduce the number of overdose deaths and transmission rates of infectious diseases without increasing drug trafficking or crime in the relevant areas4. In addition, these sites are in demand. A Johns Hopkins 2019 study found that 77% of those surveyed, including those in Baltimore, said they would use such sites if they were available . OPSs have been shown to save lives and tax (over) 1 https://beforeitstoolate.maryland.gov/wp for people who use substances who want to seek help, our tr aditional health care system does not always present an effective and welcoming place. OPSs accept people where they are, provide a safe place where people use substances that they would use somewhere else at higher risk of death, get some immediate health assistance for things such as wound care , and get referrals to various support services and treatment . It is with all this in mind that NASW -MD support s SB 279 and urge s a favorable report . Respectfully, BOARD OF DIRECTORS Deputy Chief Wayne Harris, Ret.

The Law Enforcement Action Partnership's mission is to unite and mobilize the voice of law enforcement in support of drug policy and criminal justice reforms that will make communities safer by focusing law enforcement resources on the greatest threats to public safety, promoting alternatives to arrest and incarceration, addressing the root causes of crime, and working toward healing police-community relations. \"One of the most frustrating things about being in law enforcement is seeing the same people cycle in and out of the system day after day. Many are struggling with drug addiction, yet the police officers called to handle them do not have tools to deal with their root issues. They need support with mental and physical health problems, homelessness, and unemployment to break their addiction, but the criminal justice system's only tools are arrest and incarceration, which often make these problems worse. Though most people relapse repeatedly on their way to quitting for good, failing one drug test can cost them the help they need to quit. As a result, many people cannot stabilize their lives because they lose support right when they need it the most. The Law Enforcement Action Partnership supports harm reduction programs, which help drug users survive their addictions and stabilize their lives rather than demanding that they quit before receiving any support.\" \"In more than 100 locations across Europe, Canada, and Australia, injection-drug users bring their own drugs into Overdose Prevention Sites (OPS) and inject in the presence of medical staff. In more than two decades of OPS operation, no OPS user has ever died of overdose or contracted HIV or Hepatitis C due to needle-sharing in these facilities. \" 121 Mystic Avenue, Suite 9 Medford, Massachusetts 02155 T: (781) 393.6985 LawEnforcementActionPartnership.org Formerly known as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition 2 These are two quotes directly from our website and as you can see, they speak specifically about how policing and incarceration are not the solutions to drug addiction; therefore, extremely problematic for police officers who recognize the medical needs for those addicted. The second quote makes reference to the successes of more than 100 locations across Europe, Canada and Australia. These facilities are one of the many reasons for such low overdose death rates throughout European countries when compared to the United States. I have served in three Maryland police agencies as a commander; the Maryland State Police as the northeast regional commander for the Bureau of Drug and Criminal Enforcement, the Baltimore Police Department as the Chief of human resources and head of training, and the Maryland Transit Administration as the head of Investigation Services, which included drug enforcement. Over my thirty-four-year career, I was responsible for the arrest and jailing of hundreds, if not thousands, of Maryland citizens for low-level drug possession charges. Undoubtedly, most of these arrests were of people suffering from addiction. For five decades we have been attempting to solve a public health condition with criminal justice tactics and it should be no surprise that we have failed dramatically. While other countries have turned the corner toward health-centered policies, we continue persecuting drug users, driving them deeper and deeper into the shadows of despair and solitude. It is well beyond time for us to begin removing the stigma of criminalization from those addicted to drugs. About seven years ago I had the pleasure of visiting Vancouver's Overdose Prevention Site, \"Insite.\" During my day-long visit I toured the facility and the surrounding community, and I was extremely surprised at what I saw and who I met. I saw clean alleys with \"Sharps\" containers on poles. I saw literature next those containers advising people of dangerous heroin laced with problematic \"cut.\" And I saw police officers interacting with obvious drug users in a cordial helpful manner. While touring Insite I met Ms. Pearl. Ms. Pearl was a gentle soul who had been addicted to heroin for many years. Prior to her having access to Insite, she was in and out of the hospital for many health concerns other than addiction overdose, a victim of violent crime many times over, and extremely depressed due to isolation. I spent a good portion of the day with Ms. Pearl, even watching her administer to herself a heroin injection. Ms. Pearl had hope, hope of one day being admitted to the bed treatment facility overtop of Insite, Onsite. She knew it would be a very difficult task, but she believed that with the support of Insite, she would succeed. It is the love and support from Insite that gives Ms. Pearl and others connection, and connection is what's needed most in beating addiction, not incarceration and the isolation of stigma. As a retired career police officer, I am also deeply concerned about the five decades of distracted policing. With a well-financed drug enforcement agenda, at the courtesy of our federal government, local law enforcement has been pulled away from fighting violent crime and tending to the business of keeping people safe. We have migrated away from community policing principles and relationships, to a place of fostering enormous rifts between police and community. The recent Department of Justice investigation concluded that the Baltimore Police Department engaged in hundreds of thousands of unconstitutional stops within the measured timeframe of the investigation. These unconstitutional stops were undoubtedly about our misguided thirst for arresting people possessing drugs, no matter how small the amount. The time has come for change. It is for these reasons that we, members of the Law Enforcement Action Partnership, support SB279 and ask that you, the members of this committee, give SB279 a favorable report.

Program sites would be established by hospitals, clinics, substance abuse treatment centers, medical offices, federally qualified health centers, mental health facilities, local health departments, or faith -based organizations. To the extent possible, the program sites would include two sites in urban areas, two sites in suburban areas, and two sites in rural areas of the State. The bill would take effect July 1, 202 1 and sunset four years later, on June 30, 202 5.

Using personal experience as parents, caregivers and other loved ones, o ur staff provide one -to-one support to parents and caregivers of young people with mental health issues and to any loved one who cares for s omeone with a s ubstance use or gambling issue. ________________________________________ ________________________________ SB 279 would allow the establishment of up to six programs that provide a place for individuals to consume pre -obtained drugs. Program s would provide sterile needles, administer first aid as needed, and connect individuals to services. MCF supports this bill. The COVID -19 Pandemic has severely negatively impacted Maryland's opioid crisis. Data shows that fatal overdoses by opioids inc reased during the second and third quarters of 2020 by 21% over the same period in 2019. People who have a substance use disorder have been especially hard hit by the pandemic - isolation, the disruption of support systems, and the restrictions in access to treatment have all contributed to increases in substance use and relapse. MCF has twelve family peer support staff who provide peer support and navigation services to families who have a child or other loved one with a substance use disorder . All of t hese staff have lived experience caring for someone with a substance use disorder. Some staff members have lost a child to an opioid overdose, others have a child in recovery from opioid use disorder , and others have a child who is still out there using op ioids . While our staff provide support to fa milies of any loved one suffering from any substance use disorder, about one -half of the families that we work with have a child addicted to opi oids. MCF is in favor SB 279 . We know the desperation of parents and caregivers who have a child actively using opioids . The fear of getting a call that their child has overdosed is ever present among these families. Supervised Consumption Facilities exist across the world and have for decades. They have been the subject of many rigorous studies, which have shown that there is very little downside to such programs - on the contrary, there is great benefit, including: a reduction in blood -borne diseases a reduction in bacterial infections a reduction in fatalities owin g to an overdose an increase in treatment engagement In addition, Supervised Consumption Facilities produce significant cost savings - a 2017 study estimated that there would be $4.35 saved for every dollar spent. We are aware that there are logistical b arriers to implementing such a program. They must be overcome in order to save lives. We ur ge a favorable report on SB 279 .

Weir5, Sean T. Allen5, Andrew Lindsay5and Susan G. Sherman6 Abstract Background: In Baltimore, MD, as in many cities throughout the USA, overdose rates are on the rise due to both the increase of prescription opioid abuse and that of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in the drug market. Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are a widely implemented public health intervention throughout the world, with 97 existing in 11 countries worldwide. Research has documented the public health, social, and economic benefits of SIFs, yet none exist in the USA. The purpose of this study is to model the health and financial costs and benefits of a hypothetical SIF in Baltimore. Methods: We estimate the benefits by utilizing local health data and data on the impact of existing SIFs in models for six outcomes: prevented human immunodeficiency virus transmission, Hepatitis C virus transmission, skin and soft- tissue infection, overdose mortality, and overdose-related medical care and increased medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence. Results: We predict that for an annual cost of $1.8 million, a single SIF would generate $7.8 million in savings, preventing 3.7 HIV infections, 21 Hepatitis C infections, 374 days in the ho spital for skin and soft-tissue i nfection, 5.9 overdose deaths, 108 overdose-related ambulance calls, 78 emergency room visits, and 27 hospitalizations, while bringing 121 additional people into treatment. Conclusions: We conclude that a SIF would be both extremely cost-effective and a significant public health and economic benefit to Baltimore City. Keywords: Supervised injection facility, Supervised consumption rooms, Cost-benefit, Cost-effectiveness, People who inject drugs, Harm reduction, Opiate overdose, Heroin, Baltimore, Maryland Background Baltimore City has one of the highest overdose death rates in the country, and overdoses have been increasing in recent years. From 2014 to 2015, heroin-related over- dose deaths in Baltimore increased from 192 to 260 [1]. These increases are in part attributed to the prevalence of fentanyl in the heroin supply, with fentanyl causing 31 and 51% of 2015 and 2016 overdose deaths, respect- ively. Fentanyl is 50 -100 times more potent than heroin or morphine. Illicit fentanyl and derivatives are appeal- ing to illicit drug networks as these chemicals arecheaper than prescription opioids, heroin, and cocaine, and are extremely potent [2 -5]. There are numerous additional medical costs associ- ated with injection drug use, largely related to infectious diseases and soft-tissue infections. Roughly 18% of the people who inject drugs (PWID) in Baltimore are HIV positive, twice the 9% national average for PWID and 50 times the prevalence in the general population [6 -8]. One in five Baltimore PWID suffers chronic skin and soft-tissue infection, the leading cause of PWID hospitalization [9 -11]. Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) have been estab- lished worldwide to reduce the harms associated with in- jection drug use. In SIFs, PWID inject previously obtained drugs in the presence of medical staff.

Harm Reduction Journal (2017) 14:29 DOI 10.1186/s12954-017-0153-2number of public health, social, and economic benefits of SIFs have been evaluated by studies of the Insite SIF in Vancouver, Canada and the Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) in Sydney, Australia, both of which were established in 2003 [12 -15]. Among these benefits, studies have demonstrated four in particular that can be quantified. First, SIFs re- duce blood-borne disease transmission by providing clean needles and safer injecting education [12, 16, 17]. Second, SIF staff reduce bacterial infection by providing clean injection equipment, c leaning wounds, and iden- tifying serious infections early [18 -2 0 ] .T h i r d ,S I Fs t a f f i n t e r v e n ei nc a s eo fo v e r d o s e ,m e a n i n gt h a tw h i l e PWID may overdose at a SIF, none die and few suffer complications [13]. Fourth, the SIF and its staff become a trusted, stabilizing force in many hard-to-reach PWID 's lives, persuading many to enter addiction treat- ment [12, 14, 21]. As in other US cities, a multisector discussion about the merits and utility of SIFs has begun in Baltimore due to rising overdose deaths as well as the inadequacy of the current criminal justice-focused response [22]. The purpose of this article is to analyze the potential cost-effectiveness of establishing a SIF in Baltimore. We estimate the annual cost of the facility and the savings resulting from six separate health outcomes: prevention of HIV infection, HCV infection, skin and soft-tissue in- fection (SSTI), overdose death, and nonfatal overdose and increased medication-assisted treatment (MAT) up- take. Each estimate includes the health outcome, finan- cial value, and a sensitivity analysis. First, we present the existing literature on SIF cost-benefit analyses, then our study 's method, its results, its implications, and its limitations. SIF cost-benefit analysis literature review Prior cost-benefit analyses of Insite in Vancouver and MSIC in Sydney have assessed a more limited range of outcomes than the present study. The Insite studies were limited to the outcomes of HIV prevention, HCV prevention, and overdose death prevention. They have agreed that Insite generates net savings when all three outcomes are considered [23, 24]. The cost-benefit ana- lysis of Sydney 's MSIC only included savings from over- dose deaths, ambulance calls, and police services averted by the SIF. A number of other studies have estimated HIV and HCV prevention benefits for hypothetical SIFs in Canadian cities from Montreal to Saskatoon [25 -30]. Irwin et al. [31] are the only other cost-benefit analysis of a hypothetical SIF in the USA \u2014in San Francisco, California \u2014and the only other study to consider more than three outcomes. We discuss the differences inmethodologies between this paper and past analyses for each individual outcome in the \"Methods \"section. Methods This study calculates the financial and health costs and benefits of a hypothetical Baltimore SIF modeled on Insite. Insite occupies roughly 1,000 ft2, provides 13 booths for clients, and operates 18 h per day. Insite serves about 2100 unique individuals per month, who perform roughly 180,000 injections per year [32, 33]. This study measures the cost of the facility against sav- ings from six outcomes: prevention of HIV, HCV, SSTI, and overdose deaths, reduced overdose-related medical costs, and referrals to MAT. We assess each model 's de- pendence on important variables with a sensitivity ana- lysis. For the sensitivity analysis, we increase and decrease the chosen variable by 50% and report the im- pact on the outcome. Cost of the facility Cost calculations are based on a facility equal in size and scope to Insite. We estimate that the annual cost of es- tablishing a new SIF combines both upfront and operat- ing costs. Since we assume the same staffing levels, equipment needs, and other operating cost inputs as Insite, we calculate the operating costs by multiplying the Insite SIF 's $1.5 million operating costs by a 4% cost of living adjustment between Vancouver and Baltimore [34, 35]. Since the upfront costs would depend on the exact location and extent of renovations required, we make a conservative estimate of $1.5 million based on actual budgets for similar facilities and standard per- square-foot renovation costs [12, 36]. We convert this upfront cost into a levelized annual payment by assum- ing that it was financed with a loan lasting the lifetime of the facility. We determine the levelized annual pay- ment according to the standard financial equation: C\u00bciP\u00f0\u00de 11\u00fei \u00f0\u00deN where Cis the levelized annual upfront cost, iis a stand- ard 10% interest rate, Pis the $1.5 million total upfront cost, and Nis the estimated 25-year lifetime of the facility. HIV and HCV prevention benefits The HIV infection prevention benefits of Insite, Vancouver 's SIF, have been modeled in several cost- benefit analyses [23, 24, 37, 38]. Pinkerton [24] and estimate 5 -6 and 22 infec- tions averted per year, respectively. These estimates dif- fer primarily because Pinkerton [24] assumes that the SIF only impacts injections occurring within the SIF,Irwin et al. Harm Reduction Journal (2017) 14:29 Page 2 of 14while Andresen and Jozaghi [23] incorporate the fact that the SIF reduces needle sharing outside the SIF as well, since Insite staff educate clients on safer injecting practices [38]. To estimate the impact of reduced needle sharing on HIV and HCV infection rates, we use an epidemiological \"circulation theory \"model developed to calculate how needle exchange programs impact HIV infection among PWID and subsequently used to study SIF HIV and HCV infection [23, 39]. We use the model to estimate new HIV infection cases ( IHIV): IHIV\u00bciNsd \u00bd1\u00f01qt\u00deM/C138 where iis the percentage of HIV-negative PWIDs, Nis the total number of needles in circulation, sis the per- centage of injections with a shared needle, dis the per- centage of injections with an unbleached needle, qis the percentage of HIV-positive PWIDs, tis the chance of transmitting HIV through a single injection with a shared needle, and Mis the average number of people injecting with a single previously used needle. Table 1 shows the values and sources for each variable. We estimate SIF-averted HIV infections by finding the difference between IHIVat the current rate of needle sharing ( spre) Tis the total number of PWID in Baltimore City, Nis the number of SIF users, and nis the 70% reduction in needle sharing by SIF users [40].We perform the same calculations for HCV, and the values and sources for the HCV variables are contained in Table 2. We check the model 's validity by comparing its base- line prediction of HIV and HCV incidence in Baltimore (IHIVand IHCV atspre) with the city 's actual incidence data. The model predicts 53 new PWID-related HIV cases in Baltimore each year in the absence of a SIF, only slightly lower than the 55 diagnoses reported by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene [41]. Since many new HIV cases go undiagnosed, espe- cially in the hard-to-reach PWID population, this base- line figure suggests that we are underestimating potential HIV infections averted [42]. For HCV, the model predicts 302 cases in the absence of a SIF. The Maryland Department of Health and Men- tal Hygiene (DHMH) does not report annual injection- related HCV infections for Baltimore City. However, based on Mehta et al. 's [43] finding that 7.8% of a sample of Baltimore 's HCV-negative PWID contract HCV every year, we estimate PWID HCV incidence at 398 new cases per year. Since our model predicts a significantly lower incidence, we are most likely underestimating the potential number of HCV infections averted. Skin and soft-tissue infection benefits Since PWID frequently contract skin and soft-tissue in- fection from unsanitary injection practices and often avoid seeking medical treatment until these infections become life threatening, SSTI is the number one reason for PWID hospital admission. Insite studies have dem- onstrated that SIFs significantly reduce SSTI medical costs by providing clean injection materials and referring PWID for medical treatment when necessary [18, 20].

[18] documented for Insite clients, and Cis the average daily cost of a hospital stay. See Table 3 for values and sources. Overdose mortality benefits While Andresen and Boyd [44] estimate that Insite pre- vents one overdose death per year, out of roughly 20 total overdose deaths in the neighborhood, they are sim- ply extrapolating that if Insite hosts 5% of the city 'sinjections, it should prevent 5% of the city 's overdose deaths. However, Milloy et al. [45] demonstrate that Insite prevents more than 5% of the city 'so v e r d o s e deaths. Milloy et al. attribute this effect to drug use education, which 32% of all Insite clients report receiv- ing. For example, PWID learn to pre-inject a small dose of their drug to \"test\"the potency, which can pre- vent accidental overdose in case of an unusually pure or contaminated dose. In Sydney 'sS I F ,k n o w na s MSIC, 80% of clients report changing their injection behavior to reduce the risk of overdose as a result of in-SIF education [15]. This finding is supported by Marshall et al. [46], who compare the change in overdose deaths within 500 m of Insite to the change in other Vancouver neighbor- hoods both before and after the facility 's opening. They find that before Insite opened, roughly 20 overdoses occurred within 500 m of the facility. After Insite opened, overdose mortality within 500 m of the facility fell by 35%, compared to a 9.3% reduction further away, suggesting that Insite reduced neighborhood overdose deaths by at least 26% [46].Table 2 Values, notes, and sources for variables used to predict HCV infection reduction savings Variable Value Note Source Proportion of PWID HCV (I) 25% Average of values reported (10 -40%) Falade-Nwulia et al.

Harm Reduction Journal (2017) 14:29 Page 4 of 14Therefore, to predict the impact of a SIF on fatal over- dose, we estimate the number of overdose deaths within a 500-m radius of an optimally placed SIF in Baltimore. Based on the fact that there were 260 heroin-related fatal overdoses in 2015 and 342 in the first three quarters of 2016, we estimate that there were 463 heroin-related fatal overdoses in all of 2016 [1, 47]. Since data on the geospatial distribution of fatal overdoses in Baltimore City are not available, we approximate this distribution by mapping data from the Baltimore City Fire Department Emergency Med- ical Services on the locations where medics adminis- tered naloxone in response to suspected opioid overdoses [48]. We identify t he location with the high- est concentration of naloxon e administrations within 500 m by plotting the locations of all naloxone admin- istrations in the first three quarters of 2016 in ArcGIS. The chosen location accounts for 6.2% of all naloxone administrations, suggesti ng that 28 deaths occurred wi thin that 500-m radius cir- cle in 2016. As the percent of overdose deaths within this area varies over time, we assume that in an average year, it would encompass a more conservative 23 heroin-related overdose deaths. This is 5% of the city- wide total and slightly higher than the 20 deaths per year within 500 m of Insite. We calculate the total value of overdose deaths averted by the SIF ( SOD) according to the equation: SOD\u00bcrnDV where ris the rate of overdose death reduction expected within 500 m, nis the 5% share of naloxone administra- tions concentrated within a single circle of radius 500 m in Baltimore, Dis the total number of overdose deaths in Baltimore, and Vis the value of a single life saved. In order to assign value to the loss of life due to over- dose, we follow Andresen and Boyd [44] in considering only the tangible value to society rather than including the suffering and lost quality of life for loved ones. Weestimate the tangible value by calculating the present value of the remaining lifetime wages of an average person from the community. Since the average age of PWID in Baltimore is 35, we convert 30 years of future wages to present value using a standard discount rate [44, 49]. So the value of a single prevented overdose death ( V) is calculated as V\u00bcXN i\u00bc1W \u00f01\u00fer\u00dei where nrepresents the remaining years of income, W represents the median wage for Baltimore City, and r represents the discount rate. We thus use a value per life saved of $503,869 in the overdose death savings calcula- tion above. The values and sources for each variable in this section are given in Table 4. Most likely, this method underestimates the facility 's impact, since this method only estimates averted over- dose deaths within 500 m of the SIF, though the facility would also reduce overdose outside a 500-m radius. Overdose morbidity benefits Overdoses require emergency medical assistance, even when they are not life threatening. Evaluations of Sydney 's MSIC show that by managing overdose events on-site, the SIF reduces ambulance calls, emergency room visits, and hospital stays for overdose-related mor- bidity [12]. No previous SIF cost-benefit evaluations have included overdose morbidity in their analyses, but MSIC provides sufficient data to estimate the magnitude of a SIF's impact. In Baltimore, ambulances are called to the scene of roughly half of all nonfatal overdoses [50]. By contrast, almost all overdoses 's SIF, were han- dled by on-site medical staff and did not result in ambu- lance calls [14]. We estimate cost savings of averted ambulance calls for a SIF in Baltimore according to the following model: Table 4 Values, notes and sources for variables used to predict savings from averted overdose deaths Variable Value Note Source Percent overdose death reduction within 500 m attributed to Insite ( r)25.7% 36% reduction within 500 m of Insite vs. 9.3% further awayMarshall et al.

The values and sources for these variables are given in Table 5. Emergency response personnel often transport over- dose victims to the emergency room for treatment. One Baltimore study found that 33% of PWID reported being taken to the ER for their latest overdose [50]. By con- trast, overdoses in SIFs lead to emergency room treat- ment in less than 1% of cases [14]. With a single Baltimore ER visit averaging over $1,300, SIFs reduce medical costs significantly by keeping PWID out of emergency rooms for overdose. We calculate the savings according to the following: Ser\u00bcIo t oti \u00f0\u00de F where Seris the annual savings due to the SIF reducing emergency room visits for overdose, Iis the annual number of injections in the SIF, ois the rate of nonfatal overdose, toandtiare the rates of ER visit for overdose when the overdose occurs outside and inside the SIF, re- spectively, and Fis the average cost of an overdose emergency room visit. The values and sources for these variables are given in Table 6. Overdose victims are occasionally hospitalized for treatment. In Baltimore, 12% of PWID who overdosed reported being hospitalized , while less than 1% of SIF overdoses lead to hospitalization [14, 50]. With one day in a Baltimore hospital averaging $2,500, SIFs re- duce medical costs signifi cantly by keeping PWID out of the hospital for overdose. We calculate the savings according to the following:Sh\u00bcIo a oai \u00f0\u00de E where Shis the annual savings due to the SIF reducing hospitalization for overdose, Iis the annual number of injections in the SIF, ois the rate of nonfatal overdose, aoandaiare the rates of hospitalization for overdose when the overdose occurs outside and inside the SIF, re- spectively, and Eis the average expense of an overdose hospital stay. The values and sources for these variables are given in Table 7. Medication-assisted treatment benefits Many PWID who are unable to quit using illicit opioids through traditional abstinence-based treatment pro- grams are successful using methadone or buprenorphine maintenance as part of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) [51]. MAT not only reduces the crime and health care costs of PWID by helping a significant portion quit injecting drugs but also decreases drug use, crime, and health costs among the patients who do relapse [52, 53]. Wood et al. [15, 22] and show that both Insite and Sydney 's MSIC refer many SIF clients to treat- ment, increasing treatment uptake. Irwin et al. [31] find a single SIF 's impact on treatment uptake to be signifi- cant, estimating that a SIF in San Francisco would bring 110 patients into MAT every year. We estimate that by referring clients to MAT, a SIF would produce annual health care and crime savings equal to SMAT: SMAT \u00bcNrf b 1\u00f0\u00de T where Nis the number of PWID who use the SIF, ris the percent of SIF clients who have been shown to ac- cess treatment as a result of SIF referrals, fis a conserva- tive 50% estimate for retention in MAT, bis the average cost-benefit ratio studies have found for MAT, and Tis the annual cost of treatment.

As a result, we acknowledge that the 5.8% increase found for Sydney 's MSIC may dif- fer significantly from the actual referral rate for a SIF in Baltimore. Results Overall cost-benefit ratio Our analysis finds a total benefit of $7.77 million and a total cost of $1.79 million, yielding a cost-benefit ratio of $4.35 saved for every dollar spent. Net savings are $5.98 million. We present the sensitivity analysis re- sults for each outcome in Table 9, showing both finan- cial and health results fo r the base, low, and high cases. Table 10 shows the impact of the sensitivity ana- lysis for each key variable on the overall cost-benefit ratio and net savings. Cost of the facility Our estimate of the total annual cost is $1.79 million, which includes $1.62 million in operating costs and $170,000 in annualized upfront costs. In our sensitivity analysis, raising the operating cost by 50% increased the total cost to $2.6 million, lowering the cost-benefit ratio from 4.35 to 2.99 and net annual savings from $5.98 million to $5.17 million. Lowering the operatingcost by 50% resulted in a total cost of $980,000, raising the cost-benefit ratio to 7.96 and net savings to $6.79 million. HIV and HCV benefits We estimate that a SIF would prevent an average of 3.7 HIV and 21 HCV cases per year, translating to annual savings of $1.50 million and $1.44 million, respectively. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the syringe sharing rate. Increasing the rate by 50%, from 2.8 to 4.2%, raises averted infections to 5.5 for HIV and 32 for HCV and savings to $2.25 million for HIV and $2.17 million for HCV. As a result, the overall cost-benefit ra- tio for the SIF increases from 4.35 to 5.17 and net sav- ings increase from $5.98 million to $6.45 million. Decreasing the sharing rate by 50%, from 2.8 to 1.4%, lowers averted infections to 1.8 for HIV and 11 for HCV, reducing HIV savings to $750,000 and HCV savings to $720,000. In this scenario, the overall cost-benefit ratio declines to 3.52 and net savings fall to $4.51 million. Skin and soft-tissue infection benefits We estimate that SIF SSTI care will reduce total PWID hospital stays for SSTI by 374 days per year, which trans- lates to annual savings of roughly $930,000.Table 6 Values, notes, and sources for variables used to predict savings from overdose-related emergency room visits Variable Value Note Source Total annual injections in the SIF ( I)180,000 Based on Insite capacity and use Milloy et al.

Harm Reduction Journal (2017) 14:29 Page 7 of 14We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the SSTI hospitalization rate. Increasing the rate by 50% raises averted hospital days to 561 and savings to $1.40 million. As a result, the overall cost-benefit ratio for the SIF in- creases from 4.35 to 4.61 and net annual savings rise from $5.98 million to $6.45 million. Decreasing the rate by 50% lowers averted hospital days to 187 and reduces savings to $470,000. In this scenario, the overall cost- benefit ratio declines to 4.09 and net savings fall to $5.52 million. Overdose mortality benefits We estimate that SIF overdose prevention will save an average of 5.9 lives per year, which translates to $3.00 million in savings for society. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of drug overdose deaths in the neighborhood around the facility, since deaths fluctuate from year to year. Increasing the total by 50% raises estimated lives saved to 8.9 and financial savings to $4.50 million. This raises the overall cost- benefit ratio for the SIF from 4.35 to 5.19 and net sav- ings from $5.98 million to $7.48 million. Lowering the neighborhood deaths by 50% would reduce estimated lives saved to 3.0 and financial savings to $1.50 million, for an overall cost-benefit ratio of 3.51 and net savings of $4.48 million.Overdose morbidity benefits We estimate that the SIF will also prevent 108 ambu- lance calls, 78 emergency room visits, and 27 hospitali- zations for nonfatal overdose, which translates to $81,000, $110,000, and $67,000 in medical savings, respectively. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the nonfatal overdose rate, since it is not well documented for Baltimore. Increasing the rate 50% raises the benefits to 162 ambulance calls, 117 ER visits, and 40 hospitaliza- tions, for savings of $120,000, $160,000, and $100,000, respectively. This higher rate would raise the overall cost-benefit ratio for the SIF from 4.35 to 4.42 and net savings from $5.98 to $6.11 million. Lowering the rate by 50% would reduce the benefits to 54 ambulance calls, 39 ER visits, and 13 hospitalizations, lowering the sav- ings to $40,000, $50,000, and $30,000, respectively. This lower rate would reduce the SIF 's overall cost-benefit ra- tio to 4.28 and net savings to $5.86 million. Medication-assisted treatment benefits We estimate that 121 PWID will enter MAT as a result of the SIF, translating into $640,000 in benefits for society. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the referral rate for MAT.

This would increase the overall cost-benefit ratio from 4.35 to 4.53 and net annual savings from $5.98 to $6.30 million. Lowering the rate by 50%, to 2.89%, would reduce new people in treatment to 61 and financial savings to $320,000, for an overall cost- benefit ratio of 4.17 and net savings of $5.66 million. Discussion Our analysis finds a significantly favorable cost-benefit ratio and net benefits in all scenarios for a SIF in Baltimore, MD. Our base case scenario predicts that every dollar spent would return $4.35 in savings. We estimate that a single, 13-booth facility would generate annual net savings of $5.98 million, which is equivalent to 28% of the city health department 's entire budget for harm reduction and disease prevention [54]. The study predicts that a SIF would prevent 5.9 overdose deaths per year. Compared to Irwin et al. 's [31] cost-benefit analysis of a SIF in San Francisco, our study estimates the cost- benefit ratio for a Baltimore SIF to be 87% higher (4.35 versus 2.33) and net savings to be 71% higher ($6.0 million versus $3.5 million). A Baltimore SIF would have lower costs, lower benefits from SSTI prevention, similar benefits related to HIV, HCV, and MAT, and much higher benefits related to overdose deaths. Our study also incorporates additional outcomes, demon- strating that a SIF could generate sizeable benefits by preventing ambulance calls, emergency room visits, and hospital stays related to nonfatal overdose. The most significant difference between the San Francisco and Baltimore studies relates to the SIF 'si m - pact on overdose deaths. We predict 5.9 lives saved per year in Baltimore, compared to 0.24 lives in San Francisco [31]. This difference stems primarily from t h em u c hh i g h e ro v e r d o s ed e a t hr a t ei nB a l t i m o r e . While both cities have roughly 20,000 PWID, Baltimore has more than 20 times more heroin-related o v e r d o s ed e a t h s .W ea l s ou s eam o r ea d v a n c e dm e t h o - dology \u2014mapping the concentration of overdose deaths \u2014to estimate this outcome.The SIF 's impact on overdose prevention would com- plement the Baltimore City Health Department 's exten- sive efforts to prevent overdose through trainings and naloxone distribution in community, treatment, and cor- rections settings. The city has trained over 17,500 Baltimore residents in overdose prevention, including use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone [55]. A SIF would ensure that when PWID overdose, they do so in the presence of staff trained to administer naloxone. In addition, a SIF would prevent overdose deaths outside the facility because SIF staff provide PWID with safer injecting education, stressing the importance of injecting where naloxone is available. Our results also suggest that a SIF would become a key component of Baltimore 's continued efforts to re- duce viral infections among PWID. Preventing four HIV and 21 HCV infections every year would reduce total in- cidence of both HIV and HCV by roughly 5%. The SIF would allow service providers to locate PWID, test them for viral infection, refer them for HIV and HCV treat- ment, and retain them in treatment. It thus addresses all four aspects of the 2017 HIV prevention strategy of the National Institute on Drug Abuse: \"seeking, testing, treating, and retaining \"PWID and other populations in need of HIV care [56]. Our estimate that a SIF would save close to a million dollars per year in SSTI hospital costs shows the benefits of removing a small population of \"frequent fliers \"from emergency rooms and hospitals. Still, since San Francisco has both a more serious SSTI problem due to the prevalence of black tar heroin and higher hospital costs, this area of benefits is smaller for Baltimore. Our estimate of 121 PWID entering MAT in Baltimore is similar to Irwin et al. 's [31] estimate of 110 PWID in San Francisco. However, in both cities, the ac- tual number will depend on the existing ease of MAT ac- cess, as well as the efforts by SIF staff to refer PWID to treatment. Baltimore can maximize these benefits by in- creasing funding to MAT programs, making treatment referrals a priority for SIF staff, and establishing the SIF near existing treatment providers for easy referral and follow-up.Table 10 Summary of sensitivity analysis impact on overall results Variable tested Cost-benefit ratio Net savings ($ million) Base case Low case High case Base case Low case High case Operating cost 4.35 2.99 7.96 5.98 5.17 6.79 6.30Irwin et al. Harm Reduction Journal (2017) 14:29 Page 9 of 14Our sensitivity analysis illustrates that the SIF 's operat- ing cost has a significant impact on the overall cost- benefit ratio, though less of an impact on net savings. While we used a conservatively high cost estimate, stra- tegic staffing, location, and procedural decisions by both SIF executives and local government officials could re- duce costs and further increase the net benefits. Cost- effectiveness in Baltimore would be significantly higher largely because Baltimore has lower real estate values, salaries, cost of living, and cost of doing business [31]. There are a number of lessons from the initial opera- tions of Insite which could inform the overall costs asso- ciated with a SIF in Baltimore. For example, Health Canada 's protocols required Insite to call an ambulance for every overdose incident, resulting in unnecessary costs given the ability to reverse overdose at Insite [57]. We recommend that the Baltimore City Health Depart- ment work with a local SIF, with extensive peer involve- ment, to consider the health, social, and economic impact of any such protocols. The continuum of care provided at the SIF has im- portant implications for its impact. An integrated SIF model would co-locate detoxification, treatment, medical care, mental health care, housing, employment, govern- ment benefits, and legal services. Such a model would facilitate service uptake for a population that faces a number of barriers in accessing services. We should note that it is difficult to ascertain who exactly would ultimately receive the savings documented in this study. Savings from the HIV, HCV, SSTI, and nonfatal overdose outcomes all accrue to the health care system, but the real beneficiaries are difficult to pin down. Holtgrave [58] and Mehta [6] estimate that the public sector bears the greatest share of HIV treatment costs, in particular Medicaid. Whether PWID have pri- vate insurance, Medicare/Medicaid, or no insurance, the savings ultimately reach federal, state, and local tax- payers, as well as everyone who pays health care pre- miums and hospital bills. MAT savings are split between medical care and reduced crime committed to get money to buy drugs. Overdose death savings represent value to the overall local economy from that person 's fu- ture contributions. Limitations This cost-benefit analysis faces a number of limitations. First, this study does not tackle the political, legal, and social barriers confronting the efforts to establish a SIF in Baltimore. In spring 2017, a second attempt to authorize safe consumption spaces in Maryland failed in the Maryland State Assembly. This effort faces oppos- ition concerns similar to SIF campaigns in other cities, including fears of \"enabling \"drug use, \"Not In My Back Yard, \"and potential legal vulnerability to prosecutionunder federal drug statutes [59 -61]. It also faces more unique challenges \u2014while the opiate epidemic 's recent damage to white, middle-class communities has grabbed media attention, Baltimore 's heroin crisis is decades old and fails to generate the same political capital for action because it primarily impacts lower-income African- American communities [62]. To address these issues, advocates have formed a co- alition of public health practitioners, current and former drug users, community organizers, and academics. Over the past year, the coalition has been meeting with the local health department, social service providers, drug users, politicians, and community leaders. In addition to garnering local and state political support, a Baltimore SIF campaign will only be successful if it involves the af- fected communities and elevates their voices. Our study 's estimates of health and economic out- comes also face limitations. Without specific plans for a facility, some variables are difficult to estimate. Since there are no actual regulations, guidelines, or actual physical plans for a SIF in Baltimore, we can only make a conservative guess at facility cost. Once regulations are established and plans for construction and operation have been created, an updated cost analysis should be performed. Similarly, the SIF 's success at referring PWID to treatment would depend on staffing decisions, the protocol for treatment referrals, and the convenience and availability of effective treatment options. In addition, our models are difficult to verify because a number of important health indicators are not well doc- umented for Baltimore 's PWID population. For example, researchers have noted that resources have not been de- voted to accurately measuring the Baltimore PWID pop- ulation 's HCV prevalence, much less the HCV incidence or the impact of needle sharing [63]. Also, available data conflicts on the prevalence of SSTI and rates of SSTI hospitalization among PWID. Other variables, from the average number of needle-sharing partners to the rate of ambulance calls to nonfatal overdose, are based on a sin- gle study and should be corroborated. The study 's accuracy would also benefit from specific cost information. The costs of HIV and HCV care, SSTI hospitalization, medication-assisted treatment, and overdose-related ambulance calls, emergency room visits, and hospital stays have all been approximated using fig- ures for the general population. We consider all of these to be underestimates of the actual costs, since PWID tend to require more services and supervision [64]. There are also some potential interaction effects that are beyond the scope of this study. For example, our HIV and HCV models do not account for PWID becom- ing infected or transmitting the viruses to others through sexual contact. Our models also do not account for interaction effects between HIV and HCV infectionIrwin et al. Harm Reduction Journal (2017) 14:29 Page 10 of 14or between viral infection and SSTI. While these effects would likely have a minor impact on our overall find- ings, if relevant data becomes available, our analysis should be updated accordingly. Finally, the impact of the SIF will depend on how well the SIF and co-located service providers align with the unique features of Baltimore 's population of PWID. Studies have shown that the effectiveness of harm reduc- tion programs depends on their consideration of ethni- city, gender, age, homelessness, inequality, social networks, drug markets, and other demographic and so- cial factors [65 -70]. We have used the best local health data available to tailor our analysis to Baltimore 's unique risk factors and social environment. However, the ultim- ate impact of a SIF in Baltimore will depend on how well the facility adapts to this environment by studying, con- sulting, and collaborating with the local PWID popula- tion [71 -73]. Conclusions Despite the present study 's limitations, it demonstrates that a SIF in Baltimore would bring significant cost sav- ings and public health benefits to the city. A single 13- booth SIF facility in Baltimore City modeled on Insite in Vancouver would generate medical and economic sav- ings of roughly $7.77 million per year. At a total cost of $1.79 million per year, every dollar spent would generate an estimated $4.35 in savings. To put the $5.98 net an- nual savings for a single SIF in perspective, they equal 28% of the Baltimore City Health Department 's budget for harm reduction and disease prevention. In terms of health outcomes, we estimate that every year, a SIF would prevent 3.7 HIV infections, 21 HCV infections, 374 days in the hospital for skin and soft- tissue infection, 5.9 overdose deaths, 108 overdose am- bulance calls, 78 overdose emergency room visits, and 27 overdose-related hospitalizations, while bringing an additional 121 PWID into treatment. We recommend that the city avoid excessive regula- tion of a SIF and maximize the linkages to services for the PWID population. We also recommend that re- searchers carefully track health indicators and medical costs associated with the PWID population before and after establishing a SIF in order to evaluate the facility 's benefits. SIFs provide other important benefits in addition to those quantified in this study. They decrease public in- jection, prevent physical and sexual violence against PWID, and reduce syringe littering [38, 74 -76]. They facilitate research to better understand the PWID popu- lation [77]. Lastly, they allow social service providers to harness the power of PWID peer networks and bring important programs to the hard-to-reach PWID popula- tion [78 -80].Establishing a number of well-established medical, financial, and societal bene- fits. We do not believe that health initiatives like SIFs should be judged purely on financial terms. However, we hope that this cost-benefit analysis provides a helpful starting point to assess the potential impact on Baltimore of a supervised injection facility.

Nevertheless, SISs have also been accused of fostering drug use and drug trafcking. Aims: To systematically collect and synthesize the currently available evidence regarding SIS-induced benets and harm. Methods: A systematic review was performed via the PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases using the OR \"SITE\")]. Results: Seventy-ve relevant articles were found. All studies converged to nd that SISs were efcacious in attracting the most marginalized PWID, promoting safer injection conditions, enhancing access to primary health care, and reducing the overdose frequency. SISs were not found to increase drug injecting, drug trafcking or crime in the surrounding environments. SISs were found to be associated with reduced levels of public drug injections and dropped syringes. Of the articles, 85% originated from Vancouver or Sydney.Conclusion: SISs have largely fullled their initial objectives without enhancing drug use or drug traf- cking. Almost all of the studies found in this review were performed in Canada or Australia, whereas the majority of SISs are located in Europe. The implementation of new SISs in places with high rates of injection drug use and associated harms appears to be supported by evidence. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The impact of SISs on access to impact of SISs on the nuisance induced by drug use in impact of SISs on the opinions of local residents Introduction Injection drug use represents a source of numerous harmful effects on both the health conditions of people who inject drugs (PWID) and their social environment. Drug injection is one of the main factors in the dissemination of blood-transmissible viral infections such as human immunodeciency virus or the hepatitis B and C viruses (EMCDDA, 2008; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2002; WHO, 1997 ). In addition, numerous other physical problems can result from drug injection, including other viral and bacterial infections, cutaneous lesions, locomotive disor- et al., 2001 ). Psychiatric disorders are also more frequent in PWID (EMCDDA, 2008 ), who are sub- ject to reduced access to medical services (Kerr et al., 2005b ). Moreover, PWID exhibit enhanced marginalization from society, which increases their exposure to social precariousness, unem- ployment, homelessness, crime, and prostitution (DeBeck et al., 2007; EMCDDA, 2008 ). Thus, injection drug use induces consider- ably higher mortality. Partly because of its illegal nature, injection drug use is also responsible for numerous societal consequences, e.g., violence, trafc, crime, and public space degradation (Kerr et al., 2005a; Renn and Lange, 1996; Singer et al., 2001 ). For these reasons, injection drug use places a heavy burden on society. During the early 1980s, PWID had to face the HIV epidemic. Preventing viral infection became crucial, and, therefore, care pro- fessionals had to consider the damage caused by drug use rather than focusing on drug use itself. Moreover, in face of the failure of public policies that aimed to eradicate drug use and drug trafcking (Drucker, 1999 ) and in consideration of the number of PWID who were not ready to enter into classical abstinence care, new preven- tion and care paradigms emerged, constituting the 'harm reduction' approach (MacPherson, 2001; Wodak and Owens, 1996 ). The rst aim of these new care systems was to reduce the social and medical consequences of injection drug use and to stop the marginalization spiral to which PWID were exposed (Berridge, 1999; MacPherson, 2001 ). In this context, the rst syringe exchange programs and the development of opiate maintenance therapies were implemented (WHO, 1998 ). Similarly, new facilities emerged at the end of the 1980s, and the rst objective was to allow PWID to inject self-provided drugs within a supervised framework in enhanced aseptic conditions with medical monitoring and no risk of police control (EMCDDA, 2008; Jozaghi, 2012; Semaan et al., 2011 ). including et Throughout the present article, we will indis- tinctly use the term 'SISs' to designate these facilities. The concept of SISs rapidly spread in Western countries, and in 2010, there were more than 90 identied SISs in Canada, Australia, Norway,Germany, Switzerland, Spain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (Semaan et al., 2011 ). SISs were implemented complementarily to other harm reduc- the following purposes (EMCDDA, 2009; INSERM, 2010; No\u00ebl et al., 2009 ): (1) to reach the most marginalized popu- lations of PWID, who are least likely to obtain access to medical and social support, and connect them with health and social ser- vices; (2) to reduce overdose-induced morbidity and mortality; (3) to educate PWID to enhance their health behaviors; (4) to reduce injection-related risks by promoting the prevention and education of safe self-injecting practices; (5) to improve the global health conditions of PWID by promoting the prevention, screening and medical orientation of viral infections; (6) to foster the initiation of dependence care programs among PWID; and (7) to reduce the nui- sances triggered by injection drug use in public spaces, e.g., urban violence and crime, drug trafcking and drug-use waste. SIS access is usually restricted and regulated (Hedrich, 2004; INSERM, 2010 ). Most SISs are forbidden to subjects under 18 years of age, pregnant women, irregular or unidentied PWID, and indi- viduals who wish to experience their rst drug injection. Internal rules also forbid violence and drug selling. Moreover, many SISs prohibit drug sharing or helping other users with drug injection. However, SISs have endured criticism. Some ofcial organizations have argued that \"any national, state or local authority that per- mits the establishment and operation of drug injection rooms or any outlet to facilitate the abuse of drugs (by injection or any other route of administration) also facilitates illicit drug trafcking \" (INCB, 1999 ). The detractors of SISs often argue that SIS implementation is equivalent to the tacit acceptance of injection drug use by public authorities, which will foster drug use, attract drug trafckers and increase drug-related consequences in the surrounding area (Boyd, 2013; Elliott et al., 2002; Gandey, 2003; Parliament of New South Wales, 1998 ). This perception has often been shared by groups of local residents and politicians in cities where new SISs were imple- mented (Elliott et al., 2002 ) and has sometimes led to long court procedures (Health Canada, 2006; Small, 2010; Wodak et al., 2003; Wood et al., 2007 ). Twenty-eight years after the rst legal opening of an SIS (Zobel and Dubois-Arber, 2004 ), we have performed a systematic review of the literature to collect the published data currently available on SISs and to synthesize these data to determine whether SISs have achieved their objectives and whether the fears raised against them are justied. 2. Materials and methods A systematic search for relevant articles was conducted and is presented herein according to the PRISMA statement (Liberati et al., 2009 ). The research was per- formed using the PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. To avoid selection bias, an inventory of the different English appellations for SIS was con- ducted, which led to our use of the following keyword algorithm: (\"SUPERVISED\" OR \"SAFER\") OR \"CONSUMPTION\")50 C.

Systematic selection process of relevant articles used for performing the review. AND (\"FACILITY\" OR \"FACILITIES\" OR \"ROOM\" OR \"GALLERY\" OR \"CENTRE\" OR \"SITE\"). All results up to January 26, 2014 were examined in the article selection process. The article selection algorithm is described in Fig. 1. After eliminating duplicates, relevant publications were chosen through the individual and independent selection of titles by three authors (C.P., B.R., V.L.). The articles selected had to be written in English and be related to SISs. In cases of disagreement between the authors during the selection process, the three authors discussed the article until a consensus to include it or exclude it was reached. A second selection round was performed upon full-text reading. The selection criteria were as follows: (1) peer-reviewed articles that (2) contained original data on SIS assessment. The full texts of all selected articles were independently read by two authors (C.P. and B.R.). If one of the readers believed that the full-text article did not t the eligibility and inclusion criteria, a nal round of selection was performed through a consensual decision that included the same three authors identied above. The quality of all of the nally selected articles was evaluated using specic tools. Observational studies were evaluated using the \"Strengthening the Repor- ting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement\" (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007 ), and medical economic studies were evaluated using the \"Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS)\" (Husereau et al., 2013 ). Because there is currently no consensual assessment method for either qualitative studies or surveys (Bennett et al., 2011 ), we did not score these types of articles in our review. 3. Results 3.1. Overall results We initially found 618 articles using the aforementioned key- word algorithm, among which 75 articles were nally included in the review (cf. Fig. 1).Table 1 lists the nal selection of articles, which were clustered according to the specic subject they addressed: (1) the description of SIS users; (2) the impact of SISs on overdose-induced mortality and morbidity; (3) the impact of SISs on injection behaviors and their consequences; (4) the impact of SISs on the adherence to care of PWID; (5) the impact of SISs on the nuisances induced by drug use in public spaces; (6) the impact of SISs on local drug-related crime, violence, and trafcking; (7) the impact of SISs on the number of local PWID; (8) the medico-economic assessment of SISs; (9) the opinion of PWID on SISs; and (10) the impact of SISs on the opinions of local residents and local police. Approximately 68% of the articles came from SISs in Vancouver (n = 51), 17% from SISs in Sydney (n = 13) and 3% from SISs in Europe (n = 2). Approximately 12% of the studies do not come from a SIS (n = 9). Different study designs were found. Of the 75 nally selected articles, 32 articles were about cohort studies, among which 3 were descriptive studies (Kerr et al., 2006b; Marshall et al., 2009; Stoltz et al., 2007a ), 13 were analytical stud- ies (Bravo et al., 2009; Hadland et al., 2014; Kerr et al., 2005c; Lloyd-Smith al., 2010, 2009, 2008; McKnight et al., 2007; Milloy et al., 2010, 2009; Wood et al., 2005d, 2003, 2008, 2005a ), 12 were evaluative studies (DeBeck et al., et al., et 2007; Reddon et al., 2011; Richardson et al., 2008; Stoltz et al., 2007b; Wood et al., 2006d, 2005c, 2007, 2006c ), 1 was both a descriptive and an analytical study (DeBeck et al., 2011 ), and 3 were cross-sectionalC.

Description of SIS users We identied 14 articles that aimed to depict the prole of the most frequent SIS users. Eight of these studies were performed in a SIS in Vancouver (Hadland et al., 2014; Reddon et al., 2011; Richardson et al., 2008; et al., 2006c, 2005c ), while the others were performed in SISs in Sydney (Kimber et al., 2008a, 2003; Salmon et al., 2009b; Stoltz et al., 2007a ), Geneva (Dubois-Arber et al., 2008 ), Madrid and Barcelona (Bravo et al., 2009 ). In these studies, it was found that the majority of SIS users were male, ranging from 30 to 35 years of age (Dubois-Arber et al., 2008; Kimber et al., 2003; Tyndall et al., 2006a; Wood et al., 2006c ), with frequent housing insecurity and unemployment (Kimber et al., 2003; Richardson et al., 2008 ) and with a previous history of incar- ceration. Resorting to prostitution was identied in 10-39% of users (Kimber et al., 2003; Wood et al., 2006c ). The most frequent drugs used were, in descending order, heroin, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and their derivatives (Kimber et al., 2003; Tyndall et al., 2006a ). In Vancouver, compared with other PWID, SIS users exhibited more episodes of overdose (OR = 2.7, 95%CI = [1.2-6.1]) and a higher frequency of daily drug injection (heroin: OR = 2.1, 95%CI = [1.3-3.2]), cocaine: OR = 1.6, 95%CI = [1.1-2.5]) and of pub- lic injecting (OR = 2.6, 95%CI = [1.7-3.9]) before the opening of the SIS (Wood et al., 2005c ). Eighty-eight percent of SIS users were seropositive for HCV (Wood et al., 2005a ), and between 2% (Salmon et al., 2009b ) and 30% (Wood et al., 2005c ) of them were positive for HIV. For these PWID, syringe sharing was more regular before SIS use (OR = 2.13, 95%CI = [1.49-3.06])( Tyndall et al., 2006b ) and was a factor associated with these blood-transmissible viral infections (aOR = 1.8, 95%CI = [1.1-2.9]) (Wood et al., 2005a ).3.3. The impact of SISs on overdose-induced mortality and morbidity Seven studies evaluated whether SISs successfully reduced harm among SIS users (Kerr et al., 2006b, 2007b; Marshall et al., 2011; Milloy et al., 2008a, 2008b; Salmon et al., 2010; Van Beek et al., 2004 ). In the different studies, no death by overdose was ever reported within the SISs in which this parameter was evaluated (Kerr et al., 2006b; Milloy et al., 2008b; Van Beek et al., 2004 ). In Vancouver, SIS implementation led to a 35% decrease in the num- ber of lethal overdoses in the vicinity of the SIS (Marshall et al., 2011 ); thus, it was evaluated that between 2 and 12 cases of lethal overdose might have been avoided each year (Milloy et al., 2008b ). In Sydney, the number of calls for ambulances related to overdose was 68% lower during the operational hours of the SIS (Salmon et al., 2010; Van Beek et al., 2004 ). 3.4. The impact of SISs on injection behaviors and their consequences Eight studies addressed the reduction in other harms, especially syringe sharing during injection (Fast et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2005c; Milloy and Wood, 2009; Salmon et al., 2009a; Stoltz et al., 2007b; Wood et al., 2005b, 2005d, 2008 ). Studies conducted in Vancou- ver and Sydney showed that the regular use of SISs was associated with decreased syringe sharing (aOR = [1.93-3.87]) (Stoltz et al., 2007b ). In a meta-analysis, Wood and Milloy estimated that frequent use of SISs was associated with a 69% reduced likelihood of syringe sharing (Milloy and Wood, 2009 ). The main injection- related issues reported by PWID were difculty nding a vein, the infectious aftermath of injections, and lack of education on safer injection practices (Fast et al., 2008; Salmon et al., 2009a ). Concomi- tantly, regular SIS use fostered the use of sterile injection materials and the elimination of soiled materials (Fast et al., 2008; Stoltz et al., 2007b ) and was associated with more frequent requests for edu- cation on safer injection practices (aOR = 1.47, 95%CI = [1.22-1.77]) (Wood et al., 2008 ). 3.5. The impact of SISs on reducing drug-related harms We found 6 studies that addressed this issue (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2010, 2009, 2008; Marshall et al., 2009; Small et al., 2009, 2008 ). All of the studies were sourced from the Vancouver cohort of SIS users. There was no direct nding that SIS use induced a decrease in viral transmission. However, SIS use was associated with increased condom use during intercourse (8% in 2 years) (Marshall et al., 2009 ). Moreover, approximately 25% of the SIS users received care for injection-related cutaneous lesions (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009 ). PWID reported that the SISs assessed, cared for and oriented them quickly, efcaciously, and without any judgment (Small et al., 2009, 2008 ). 3.6. The impact of SISs on access to addiction treatment programs This issue was assessed in 5 studies, among which 4 were cohort studies from the Vancouver team and 1 was an exhaus- tive population study in Sydney. These publications stated that SIS attendance was associated with a global increase in diverse types of dependence care, i.e., referral to an addiction treatment center, ini- tiation of a detoxication program (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = [1.11-1.58]; p = 0.002 (Wood et al., 2007 )), and initiation of methadone ther- apy (aHR = 1.57, 95%CI = 2011; Kimber et al., Approx- imately 20% PWID were interested in joining a dependence careC. Potier et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 145 (2014) 48-68 63 program (Milloy et al., 2010; Wood et al., 2006d ), and in Syd- ney's SIS, 25% of the interested subjects started such a program (Kimber et al., 2008b ). Among the PWID who used the Vancouver SIS, 18% secondarily engaged in a detoxication program (Wood et al., 2006d ), 57% started an addiction treatment, and 23% stopped injecting drugs (DeBeck et al., 2011 ). 3.7. The impact of SISs on the nuisance induced by drug use in public spaces Six studies addressed these questions, of which 4 were per- formed in the Vancouver SIS (McKnight et al., 2007; Petrar et al., 2007; Stoltz et al., 2007b; Wood et al., 2004 ) and 2 in the Sydney SIS (Salmon et al., 2007; Thein et al., 2005 ). In Wood et al. (2004) , the number of syringes dropped in the hereabouts of the Vancou- ver SIS was counted and compared before and after the SIS opened. After the SIS was opened, the authors found a reduction in the daily mean number of PWID injecting in public (4.3, IQR = [4.0-4.3] vs. 2.4 IQR = [1.5-3.0]; p = syringes (11.5, IQR [7.3-14.3] [246.3-387.0]; p = 0.014). The other studies were surveys carried out among PWID in Vancouver (McKnight et al., 2007; Petrar et al., 2007; Stoltz et al., 2007b ) or among non-drug users who lived or worked in the vicin- ity of the SIS in Sydney (Salmon et al., 2007; Thein et al., 2005 ). Between the periods before and after the opening of the Syd- ney SIS, this population noted less public injection (residents: 33% vs. 19%, p < 0.01; business operators: vs. 40%; business operators: 72% vs. p < 0.01) and less complaints about PWID nuisances, but no change in the number of drug deals (residents: 28% vs. 26%, p < 0.80; business operators: 33% vs. 28%, p < 0.26) (Salmon et al., 2007 ). In Vancouver, SIS attendance was associated with a reduction in self-declared public drug injecting (aOR = 2.79, 95%CI = 2007; et al., 2007b ). 3.8. The impact of SISs on local drug-related crime, violence, and trafcking Four studies evaluated this issue in Vancouver (Milloy et al., 2009; Wood et al., 2006a ) and Sydney (Fitzgerald et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2005 ), among which 3 included local police data (Fitzgerald et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2006a ). In Vancouver, no increase in crime, violence or drug trafcking around the SIS was found after the opening of the SIS (Wood et al., 2006a ). In Sydney, compared to the other cities, data collected over a period of 10 years also revealed no increase in offenses related to the trafcking or consumption of drugs in the areas that surrounded the SIS (Fitzgerald et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2005 ). 3.9. Impact of SISs on the amount of local PWID Two studies performed in the Vancouver SIS addressed whether the SIS induced an increase in the number of local PWID (Kerr et al., 2007c, 2006a ). These studies reported that 25 months after the SIS opened, there was no increase in the local number of PWID (Kerr et al., 2007c ), no decrease in the number of PWID who started methadone therapy (11% vs. 7%), and no increase in relapse rates (17% vs. 20%; Kerr et al., 2006a ). Nevertheless, the opening of the SIS did not reduce the number of PWID who injected drugs (17% vs. 15%; Kerr et al., 2006a ).3.10. Medico-economic assessment of SISs Four studies were performed to assess whether the SIS was a cost-saving system. All of them were carried out on the Vancouver SIS (Andresen and Boyd, 2010; Bayoumi and Zaric, 2008; Pinkerton, 2011, 2010 ). The authors calculated that the SIS could prevent 5-35 new HIV infections (Andresen and Boyd, 2010; Pinkerton, 2011 ) and 3 deaths by overdose per year (Andresen and Boyd, 2010 ). Over 10 years, this prevention would represent a cost savings of $14 million, a gain of 920 years of life, and an avoidance of 1191 new HIV infections and 54 new HCV infections (Bayoumi and Zaric, 2008 ). Similarly, a study that used mathematical modeling found that opening a SIS in Montreal may be viable in terms of the cost- benet and cost-effectiveness (Jozaghi et al., 2013 ). 3.11. The opinion of PWID on SISs Fifteen surveys aimed to evaluate the opinion of PWID on the pros and cons of SISs in numerous cities: Vancouver (DeBeck et al., 2013; al., 2007; Small et al., 2012, 2011a, 2011b; Wood et al., 2003 ), Sydney (Kimber and 2007; Van Beek and (Navarro and 2004 ), Mon- treal (Green et al., 2004 ), Melbourne (Fry, 2002 ) and San Francisco (Kral et al., 2010 ). Before the opening of the rst SISs in Canada and Australia, between 54% and 89% of the local PWID declared that they were willing to use such services (Fry, 2002; Van Beek and Gilmour, 2000 ). One survey found that 72% of the same PWID interviewed actually visited the SIS (DeBeck et al., 2012 ). The main factors asso- ciated with visiting the SIS were the desire to inject safely and quietly, the desire to avoid public spaces, previous episodes of over- dose, and the need for help to inject (Fry, 2002; Green et al., 2004; Van Beek and Gilmour, 2000 ). The main reasons reported for not visiting the SIS were the prohibitions against sharing drugs and helping other PWID inject drugs within the SIS (Fry, 2002; Van Beek and Gilmour, 2000 ). Seven surveys were published regarding the opinions of PWID on SISs (DeBeck et al., 2012; Fairbairn et McNeil et al., 2013; Petrar Approx- imately 75% of the PWID in Vancouver reported that using the SIS induced positive changes in their behaviors, notably in terms of public nuisance and safe injection practices (Petrar et al., 2007 ). Qualitative studies in Vancouver revealed that their motivation for using the SIS were similar before and after visiting the SIS, i.e., to inject in safe and quiet conditions without suffering violence or having to share drugs with others and to avoid the police (Fairbairn et al., 2008; McNeil et al., 2013; Small et al., 2012, 2011a ). The main concerns of PWID concerning the SIS were the length of the waiting time to access the SIS, the prohibition of sharing drugs and helping others inject, the suspensions of access in cases of non-compliance with the rules, their distance from the SIS, and the presence of police in the surrounding area (Kimber and Dolan, 2007; Petrar et al., 2007; Small et al., 2011a ). 3.12. The impact of SISs on the opinions of local residents and police Seven surveys sought the opinions of local residents, police and professionals in the drug eld (Cruz et al., 2007; DeBeck et al., 2008; O'Shea, 2007; Philbin et Salmon et al., 2007; Thein et al., 2005; Watson et al., 2012 ). Although there was no SIS in Ontario, 60% of the local population favored the existence of an SIS (Cruz et al., 2007 ), whereas the police forces in Toronto and Ottawa pre- dominantly opposed SISs (Watson et al., 2012 ). In Sydney, two random sample studies found that more than 70% of the local resi- dents and 58% of the companies located around the SIS were in64 C. Potier et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 145 (2014) 48-68 favor of the SIS (Thein et al., 2005 ) and deemed that there was less drug use and syringe waste in public places (Salmon et al., 2007 ). However, a majority of the companies and residents nonetheless thought that the SIS contributed to a negative image of the district, fostered drug use, attracted drug users and dealers, and increased crime and insecurity (Salmon et al., 2007 ). 4. Discussion The aim of this review was to depict the currently available evi- dence regarding the positive and negative consequences of SISs. Several literature reviews have evaluated the multiple impacts of SISs on PWID or on their local environment (Hyshka et al., 2013; Kelly and Conigrave, 2002; 2007a; 2003; Wood et al., 2006b ). However, the present review is the rst to systematically embrace the full scope of SIS-related issues using a reproducible keyword algorithm research. The studies that depict the prole of SIS users were performed internationally, and their results were quite homogeneous among the different countries. PWID using SISs globally exhibited a similar prole of social precariousness and poor life conditions, which sug- gests that SISs were successful in attracting the most marginalized fringes of PWID. Nonetheless, some experts (No\u00ebl et al., 2009 ) and one study (McNeil et al., 2013 ) have noted that because there was no assistance for drug injection in SISs, PWID who are unable to self-inject, especially those whose conditions are too deteriorated, would be unable to frequent SISs. Moreover, because most SISs do not accept individuals under 18 or pregnant women, it remains difcult to conclude anything regarding these specic subpopula- tions, which are particularly vulnerable and require specic care and support. These conditions of accessibility have been discussed among the staff of a Swiss SIS (Solai et al., 2006 ). Similarly ubiquitous and homogeneous were the ndings that SISs allowed safer injection conditions and promoted enhanced health education among PWID regarding injection techniques and asepsis rules. Given the high rates of HIV and HCV infections in PWID, the reduction of syringe sharing in PWID using SISs indicates that SISs are effective tools against the spread of these epidemics. With the aim of promoting safer injection behaviors, SISs proposed or directed PWID to specic health and social services (Hedrich, 2004 ). Because these services varied signicantly between SISs, it was difcult to globally compare and evaluate this subject. From analyzing different studies, it appeared that most PWID had used such services. However, the benets of social services remained insufciently assessed within the different SISs. Most SISs were linked to addiction care services, which were found to facilitate the start of addiction care among PWID. However, a proportion of PWID who attended SISs were already undergoing treatment with methadone, although they continued to self-inject drugs. This nding suggests that SISs and opiate replacement therapies are dif- ferent, albeit complementary, measures for harm reduction among PWID. Moreover, it was feared that SISs might foster the initiation of new users into intravenous drug use, but no study found any increase in the total number of local PWID, irrespective of the SIS studied. Equally univocal was the global satisfaction with the use of SISs among PWID in the different surveys (Jozaghi and Kimber and Dolan, 2007; 2007; Small et al., 2012, 2011a ). However, most of the surveys were performed among SIS users, which may not reflect the overall population of PWID. No survey investigated the subjective assessment of SISs among PWID who no longer attended SISs; this population may exhibit different opinions on these facilities. On a medico-economic level, stud- ies have demonstrated that SISs are Pinkerton, 2011, 2010 ). Although Des Jarlais discussed the importance of achievable gains, he agreed that the SIS of Vancouver would continue to be cost-effective (Des Jarlais et al., 2008 ). Some critics have argued that SISs, by promoting safer and thus more comfortable injection conditions, might foster risk-taking in PWID and thus expose them to increased risks of overdose (Selby et al., 2007 ). However, the global rate of overdoses in SISs was found to be very low (Kerr et al., 2006b; Van Beek et al., 2004 ), and the outcomes of overdose cases were improved due to the presence of healthcare workers (Kerr et al., 2006b, 2007b ). In addition, different surveys that evaluated the number of overdoses have shown that the rates of overdoses did not increase after the implementation of SISs (Marshall et al., 2011; Milloy et al., 2008a; Salmon et al., 2010 ). However, no similar observation was found in our results con- cerning the European SISs. A German departmental report found the same results, but it has not been referenced in any database (Poschadel et al., 2003 ). SISs were also implemented to reduce the problems induced by drug injection in public spaces. The Canadian studies (McKnight et al., 2007; Wood et al., 2004 ) found that SISs contributed to a sig- nicant reduction of drug injection in public spaces. This reduction was congruent with the results of surveys of local residents in Syd- ney (Cruz et al., 2007; Salmon et al., 2007 ) and with measures of the amount of waste resulting from drug injection in public spaces (Wood et al., 2004 ). In our results, we found no European studies on this issue; however, European studies have actually been per- formed and have found similar results (Hedrich, 2004; Kemmesies, 1999 ). In some European SISs, e.g., in Switzerland and Germany, however, the reduction in the amount of injection-related waste in the areas surrounding the SIS also resulted from active collec- tion by both SIS users and SIS personnel (Benninghoff et al., 2003; Schu et al., 2005 ). Moreover, it has been noted that external fac- tors without any link to SISs could also reduce drug use in public spaces, e.g., factors related to local homeless housing programs (No\u00ebl et al., 2009 ), local police surveillance, or local policy changes (Government of Canada, 2008 ). Therefore, the direct impact that SISs may have on reducing drug injection in public spaces was sometimes difcult to assess because the use of drugs in pub- lic spaces results from numerous factors that remain difcult to control within scientic studies. Furthermore, local or contextual features related to the function of the SIS may also influence out- door drug injection practices. For example, the rates of outdoor drug injection increase with the average wait to access the SIS (Benninghoff et al., 2003; Small et al., 2011b ). Consequently, if SISs can reduce injection practices in public spaces, this impact might largely depend on their accessibility (EMCDDA, 2009; Hedrich, 2004 ). Another fear that emerged with the opening of SISs was the increase of drug trafcking and drug-related crime in the direct vicinity of the SIS. This effect was not highlighted in the studies found in our review, which were performed in Canadian and Aus- tralian SISs (Fitzgerald et al., 2010; Freeman et al., Milloy et al., 2009; Wood et al., 2006a ). Furthermore, no European data were found in our review, whereas the European report on drug consumption rooms cited unreferenced studies that found no increase in acquisitive crime in Swiss or Dutch SISs (Hedrich et al., 2010 ). A few European studies reported small-scale drug trafc- king in the immediate vicinity of the SISs (Hedrich, 2004 ). However, as noted by the European report, \"As many rooms are deliber- ately located near places where illicit drugs are sold, it is difcult to claim that the existence of such rooms leads per se to drug dealing \" (Hedrich, 2004 ). Moreover, there are numerous external factors that may influence drug trafcking and criminality. In Vancouver, for instance, the SIS and police services work in close collaboration, which may explain why there was no increase in drug trafc- king in the related study (DeBeck et al., 2008; Hedrich, 2004 ). ThisC. Potier et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 145 (2014) 48-68 65 collaboration seems important for the effect on the level of the criminality around the SIS (Hedrich et al., 2010 ). The surveys among local residents have all noted that numerous prejudices against drug users accompanied the implementation of a SIS within the neighborhood and that these beliefs might last even after the imple- mentation of the SIS. Consequently, it has been recommended that any implementation of a new SIS be preceded by a campaign that aims to inform and educate people living in the vicinity of the SIS (Hedrich, 2004; INSERM, 2010 ). It should be demonstrated that such preparation for the implementation of a SIS in a specic district is highly effective in facilitating its acceptance by local residents and police services. In addition, the implementation of a SIS is depend- ent on the political prejudgment of a country or city, which may be a hindrance to the development of SISs. The example of the SIS in Vancouver, where the accumulation of scientic evidence has had little influence on the elected political party (Hyshka et al., 2013; Small, 2010 ), reflects the controversy of SISs (Keller, 2008; Picard, 2008 ) and the need for local and national political support. This systematic literature review on SISs has several limitations. First, encompassing the entire scope of the relevant articles con- cerning SISs was complex because there are many synonymous terms referring to SISs in the international literature. To date, no consensual appellation has been dened, which explains why we used such a complex keyword algorithm to include the most com- mon appellations in the results. Despite this, a few articles that refer to SISs using more unusual terms might have been missed in this systematic review. Another limitation of the present work is the presence of important differences in the functioning of SISs around the world and gaps in the cultural and political contexts between countries. This fact could introduce important variations in what was synthesized with respect to the different studies selected herein. Moreover, the types and designs of the studies themselves were highly variable, depending on the question addressed. Notably, there were signicant disproportions in the quantity and fea- tures of the data published on the different active SISs around the world. Although most SISs are currently located in Europe (Hedrich et al., 2010 ), the majority of the systematically identied publica- tions were related to the Canadian or Australian SISs, which have received signicant means to evaluate their structures. Some sub- jects were addressed ubiquitously, i.e., the depiction of proles of PWID, the effect of safety and hygienic conditions for injection, sat- isfaction surveys among PWID and residents, and the effects of the SIS on overdoses, injection in public areas and crime. Conversely, the imbalance in studies was particularly notable regarding other subjects, i.e., the morbidity secondary to injection-related prob- lems and the economic efciency of the SISs. However, there are European data on these subjects because they were mentioned in previous comprehensive reviews issued by different ofcial No\u00ebl et al., 2009 ). The conclusions of these reports were globally similar to those we found in our review regarding each of the different questions. Regard- less, if many investigations were performed in European SISs, the results of these investigations were not found in the databases used for the present review, although these databases are among the most commonly used for literature research. For example, 40 Euro- pean studies that were identied in two main European reports (EMCDDA, 2009; Hedrich, 2004 ) were not found in the databases used for our review. This lack of inclusion in databases results in a lack of visibility of European data on SISs, although SISs are most numerous in Europe. Consequently, there is a noticeable geographic imbalance between the actual representation of the active SISs in the world and the places where the majority of data were collected. More studies on European SISs should be more easily accessible in the peer-reviewed literature, and more research should be fundedin Europe to counterbalance the disproportion of the currently available data among centers and countries; thereby, if SISs con- tinue to develop in Europe, their scientic legacy will be based on local evidence. Lastly, the well-known bias of \"socially desirable answers\" in surveys of PWID may limit the scope of the survey results on several subjects, e.g., overdose (Milloy et al., 2008a ) and syringe sharing (Stoltz et al., 2007b ). However, studies with data sources other than self-reports found approximately the same con- clusions as the surveys. Consequently, this bias most likely had a weak impact on the overall ndings of this review. In conclusion, despite signicant operating differences, SISs ubiquitously and effectively succeeded in attracting the most marginalized PWID, i.e., those who generally have not joined any already existing care system. However, some parts of this popu- lation still do not have access to the majority of SISs, especially people under the age of 18, pregnant women, and people who can- not self-inject. Their interest in SISs remains to be demonstrated, and further SIS developments are expected to address these sub- populations. SISs were found to provide numerous benets to PWID: safer injection conditions and safe injection equipment, efcacious overdose management, injection technique education, of blood- transmissible infection prevention, and enhanced connections with addiction and social services. Their interventions are deemed ef- cacious because they induce positive changes in risk behaviors of PWID. Moreover, SISs generate public benets such as a decrease in the number of PWID injecting in public and a reduction of dropped syringes in public places. Contrary to what was feared, SISs do not promote drug use and do not increase crime or drug trafcking or the number of PWID. In addition, they seem to be economi- cally cost-effective. Thus, SISs can be considered effective measures complementary to other harm reduction interventions. Role of the funding source Nothing declared. Contributors B. Rolland and C.

The meeting brought together a group of 50 harm reductionists, epidemiologists, lawyers, policy experts and people who use drugs to share experi- ences and discuss strategies for moving forward to bring safer consumption spaces (SCS) to the U.S. At the time the think tank was conceived, there was significant movement towards opening SCS/ SIFs in several U.S. cities and towns. Ithaca, NY included SCS in their report, \"The Ithaca Plan: A Public Health and Safety Approach to Drugs and Drug Policy\" as an important component of their response to the opioid crisis. Similarly, the Seattle and King County formed the \"Yes to SCS\" coalition, a group of people who use drugs, lawyers, medical providers, businesses, and other stakeholders to push the SCS agenda in their city. From there, a task force was formed and they published the \"Heroin and Prescription Opiate Addiction Task Force: Final Report and Recommendations\" which called for the opening of at least two SCS (called \"Community Health Engagement Locations\" or \"CHELS\") in their community. The Harm Reduction Coalition released a report entitled \"Alternatives to Public Injecting. \" New York City embarked on a campaign\u2014SIF NYC\u2014to build a coalition of public health service providers and criminal justice reform advocates to call on the city to implement SCS to address prob - lems related to substance use. In addition to these formal approaches, a number of other cities were at various stages of development in their respective SCS advocacy. The first day of the meeting consisted of discussions and presentations by people who use drugs (PWUD), advocates, researchers and other stakeholders to ground the think tank in some central themes: Beginning with a panel discussion 2 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformPICTUREExEcutivE Summary cRedIt : Alex GarlandPeople who use drugs must be at the head of this movement in all aspects of planning, operating, evaluating and organizing. scs must include safer smoking spaces to address the needs of people who do not inject drugs. scs are intimately related to crimi- nal justice and drug policy reform as they offer alternatives to the polic - ing of drug use. scs advocacy and organizing must include people of color in places of leadership. Racial justice and equity must be prioritized. to be successful in our scs advoca- cy, we need to expand our outreach to communities beyond the harm reduction, HIV and Hc V advocacy movements, including but not lim- ited to lgbt Q organizations, racial justice organizations, sex worker organizations, faith communities, business communities and families impacted by the opioid crisis. the scs movement must stay true to harm reduction values and pursue scs as a moral imperative. safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform3from people who use (or used) drugs, a review of a currently operating underground SCS, the impor - tance of including racial justice, and closing with a review of current efforts on the part of 7 cities to bring SCS to their respective communities. On the second day of the meeting, the group began with a discussion of bringing in new and di- verse allies beyond the traditional harm reduction, medical and social service providers. Small groups were divided into breakout groups to discuss the following: 1) Keeping SCS Led by People Who Use Drugs 2) Program Strategies 3) Funding Strategies 4) Tools for Organizing 5) State/Local Advocacy 6) Federal Advocacy Strategies The meeting closed where we began: Discussing our values in the SCS movement to ensure that we make them happen on our own terms.meetIng tHemes PICTURE What arE Safe ConS umption S p aCeS? 4 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformIn An eFFoRt to AddRess PRoblems associated with injection drug use, the first legal supervised consumption space (SCS) was established in Berne, Switzerland in 1986. Soon there - after, SCS were opened in cities throughout Western Europe, with one in Sydney, Australia and another in Vancouver, Canada. Today there are approximately 100 SCS operating worldwide. There are currently no legal SCS operating in the United States. There are several different terms in use for safer consump - tion spaces, with corresponding ... protected places used for the consumption of pre-obtained drugs in a non-judgmental environ-ment and under the su-pervision of trained staff. they constitute a highly specialized drugs service within a wider network of services for people who use drugs, embedded in comprehensive local strat - egies to reach and fulfil a diverse range of individu-al and community needs that arise from drug use the aim of dCrs is to reach out to, and address the problems of, specific high- risk populations of people who use drugs, especially injectors and those who consume in public. these groups have important health care needs that are often not met by other services and pose problems for local communities that have not been solved through other responses by drug services, social services or law enforce - ment\" (idPC 2012).definitions to match. Through- out the literature on the subject, there are a number of names for these spaces, including, but limited to: safe injection facili-ties, drug consumption rooms, safe injection sites, medically supervised injection centers, supervised drug consumption facilities, etc. Regardless of the name, there are several unifying themes and services that they all share. The International Drug Policy Consortium, refers to them as drug consumption rooms (DCRs) and defines them as follows: uu '' '' cRedIt : Mehdi Chebilsafer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform5there have been hundreds of scientific articles and reports about safer consumption spaces from around the world. these evidence-based, peer-reviewed studies have demon-strated the positive impacts for both individual's and the public's health. the benefits are listed to the right: Drug Policy Alliance; \"Safer Drug Consumption Spaces: A Strategy for Baltimore City, \" The Abell Foundation; \"Alternatives to Public Injecting, \" Harm Reduction CoalitionThey are cost-effective; Increased uptake into drug treatment programs and lead to drug use cessation; They reduce public drug use and other social order problems, including discarded syringes and other associated injection litter; They prevent infectious diseases like HIV and HCV due to reduced sharing of injection equipment; They eliminate drug overdose death in these fa- cilities due to immediate access to medical care and naloxone, and also reduce overdose deaths in the communities they are located; They do not lead to increased injection drug use; They do not lead to increased crime; They engage a typically hard to reach popula- tion in medical, mental health and other social services.Benefits of safer consumption spaces6 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformcomIng UP wItH A nAme is more than just an intellectual exercise, as the name indicates the services that can be provided. SIFs/SCS (or drug consumption rooms, medically supervised injec - tion centers or any other name that has been used) are more than just \"injection sites. \" They are also places for healthcare, mental health and counseling services, and referral and linkage to drug treatment services. There's also branding and marketing con- siderations with a name as we work to promote SIF/SCS in our communities. There were some key questions to help guide the discussion: While we are not looking to come up with a standard definition of what to call these places, a standard working definition will help frame future discussions as we argue for establishing SIFs/SCS, especially if we are looking for a unified message to build critical mass in our advocacy. What do people think about the following names: ... Supervised injection facilities... Safe consumption spaces... Supervised consumption spaces... Drug Consumption Rooms ... Medically Supervised Injection Centres (the name of Sydney's SIF) ... Others? What about not naming them at all? What are the merits of arguing for supervised injection services as part of an array of services built into homeless shelters, navigation centers, and syringe access sites and so on? Seattle provides a model here: \"CHELs\" or \"community health engagement locations. \" The term \"safer drug use spaces\" was ultimately decided upon. The group agreed that this was an all-encompassing term: \"Safer\" acknowledges that drug use can be risky, but there are things we can do to keep people healthier and safer, and mini- mize the risk of drug-related problems. \"Drug use\" allows for all manner of ways in which people use drugs, including injecting, smoking, sniffing and taking pills. Finally, \"spaces\" allow for all manner of places to provide safer drug use services from specialized sites to mobile vans to pop-up tents in homeless encampments. Although we do not claim to make this the standard definition that everyone must use, and we recognize the various needs of respective commu-nities to name them as they see fit, the group did agree that coming to a consensus around what to call these has several benefits: A unified term that everyone uses is a means of connecting the movement together across the country. Similarly, a single term that is commonly used is easier for the general public to recall and understand. It facilitates a unified message in the media, too. As with the media, a commonly used term that stays consistent is better for research, presenta-tions and publications within public health and the social sciences. For the purposes of this report, Project Inform will use as safer consumption spaces to reflect the more commonly used terminology for these sites. Moving forward, with continued PWUD and com- munity involvement, we will discuss the utility of a common name and decide which, if any, to use. For more discussion on the importance of a name, see \"The Name Matters\" section on page 11.What's in a namE? a diSCuSS ion Safe injection facility vs. safer consumption spacesafer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform7HARm RedUctIon PR ogRAms are most suc - cessful when they include PWUD in all aspects of their programming. Indeed, in its definition of harm reduction, the Harm Reduction Coalition lists the following as core principles of its philosophy: Ensures that drug users and those with a history of drug use routinely have a real voice in the creation of programs and policies designed to serve them. Affirms drug users themselves as the primary agents of reducing harms of their drug use, and seeks to empower users to share information and support each other in strategies which meet. It is with this in mind that we began the think tank with a panel discussion of people who use drugs, facilitated by Terrell Jones of New York Harm Reduction Educators (NYHRE). In this session, the panel addressed a number of questions and issues related to the needs of PWUD/PWID and SCS, and made suggestions and recommendations for en- suring that these programs are most effective and culturally competent. The themes over the next four pages emerged, and should be considered by all when planning and, when the time comes, operating a SCS.

KEEP PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS INVOLVED01 Inclusion of people who use drugs is the single, most essential ele - ment of any successful harm reduction intervention, and it is no different for SCS. PWUD need to be included in all aspects of SCS, from planning and design to operation and staffing to evaluation. PWUD are often experts in drug use, and many have the experi- ence to work effectively with its participants. We have community examples of peer-to-peer health education and prevention counsel- ing and their effectiveness, and we should extend that to work in SCS. There is a role for professionals like social workers and nurses, but peers must be involved and work the front-lines. Employing peers has many benefits, not the least of which is that it will create a space that PWUD will trust and feel welcome to attend. Employing PWID has the added benefit of creating jobs for a popula-tion that if often viewed as unemployable. In this respect, SCS become sites not only for health and relieving of suffering, but also as places to change perceptions of PWUD and reduce stigma. \"We need everybody's involvement on every level of the program. A peer should always be involved. I've been on boards around the city where people create programs off of drug users' experiences, but when it comes to the implementation of the programs, we don't get invited to participate. \" cRedIt : Delphine Vaissetsafer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform9What do people who use drugs want in a SCS? INCLUDE SMOKING SPACES People who smoke drugs have similar issues and needs to people who inject them. We gotta give smokers a safe place, too.02Any safer drug use space should include rooms for people who smoke their drugs. Recognizing that this may be a challenge given space constraints or problems with ventilation, harm reduction program- ming, including access to health and social services and access to safer smoking kits and new pipes should be available for people who smoke their drugs. Research has shown that people who smoke crack or crystal meth- amphetamine have a host of medical problems including higher rates of HIV, HCV, tuberculosis and other medical conditions. Additionally, people who smoke their drugs face many, if not all of the public prob - lems that PWID have: Public drug use and lack of privacy, risk of arrest and harassment, and problems associated with using drugs alone. The goal of safe consumption spaces must be inclusion of all people who use drugs regardless of mode of administration. In fact, to have spaces for injection while leaving out spaces for smoking creates an unequal public health setting, and may exacerbate health disparities between the two groups. There are also people who use different sub - stances in different ways, so smoking spaces are a means of including people regardless of their preferred method of administration. There are challenges to creating smoking spaces: There are ques- tions about legality and how to address smoking rooms in the context of smoking bans. These rooms should have proper ventilation and safety measures in place to keep staff and other PWUD safe from sec - ondhand smoke, thus potentially increasing costs and resources. In the meantime, the need for safer smoking spaces demands creative actions. Outdoor smoking areas, or rooftop spaces are pos-sible solutions. The question of how to do this is challenging, but the conversation must be had. Isaac Jackson, President and Lead Community Organizer of the Urban Survivors Union (USU) in San Francisco has been a strong advo - cate for the health and safety of people who smoke drugs. Beginning in the spring of 2014, Jackson and a group of volunteers began an un- derground crack pipe distribution and outreach program, distributing new pipes and health education to reduce risk of infectious disease and other problems. '' ''10 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformWhat do people who use drugs want in a SCS? why is it important to reach out to people who smoke drugs? \"People who smoke drugs often don't have ac - cess to the same services as those who inject them. I know that access to clean syringes and injection equipment varies across the coun- try, but even in cities that have great needle exchange programs, there's little offered to smokers. Even if there are safer smoking kits, they are often distributed at needle exchange sites and many non-injectors don't go to those so they miss out. People who smoke still have potential risks from anything to burned lips to HIV or HCV and even bacterial infections. Can- ada has shown that if you offer harm reduc - tion supplies to crack smokers, you lower the risk of on getting any of these, and increased contact with service providers opens the door to other health and social services. So, in a nutshell: It's important because people who smoke need and are deserving of care. To put simply: It's just the right thing to do. \" why do we need smoking rooms in scs? Again, there are disease prevention needs that smoking rooms can address. Giving peo - ple their own pipe in a safe space means less sharing. The room will be better ventilated. If something goes wrong while smoking and someone needs immediate medical attention, an SCS would provide that. There's also the social needs. It gets people off the streets and avoids all the problems with using in public. People have a safe space to smoke, so they're not out in public at risk of arrest or as targets of robbery. It reduces public smoking, which is good for the community overall. There will be less drug-related litter because people have a place to use and dispose of things safely. How is including smoking rooms an act racial justice and inclusion? Well, in my experience in San Francisco dis-tributing pipes and providing health educa- tion, smoking crack cuts across racial and ethnic lines. The stereotype of crack smoking is that its black men and women who use it. They do, but so do many other groups. But the war on drugs, and this stereotype and the fear and stigma that's been raised around crack starting in the 80s, has led to a dispro - portionate number of African Americans get - ting arrested and thrown in jail. If you include smoking spaces where black men and wom- en can use safely, you're keeping them out of jail and prison. Plus, if you don't reach out to black people, then we continue to be placed at risk for disease, overdose and other medical problems, while white people reap the ben- efits of SCS. This will only widen the already too wide gap in health disparities. And again: It's just the right thing to do. \"wHen Asked AboUt tHe ImPoRt Ance oF Incl UdIng smokIng R ooms In scs , JA ckson sAId tHe FollowIng:safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform11What do people who use drugs want in a SCS? THE NAME MATTERS03When planning a space for people to use drugs safely, making sure it's a place of inclusion for all who use drugs is important: If you call it a \"safe injection facility, \" then you leave out people who take drugs by other means. Using a term that is not injection specific such as \"super - vised consumption spaces\" or \"drug consumption room\" or \"safer drug use spaces\" is inclusive for both people who may smoke or sniff drugs. As the opioid crisis rages in the U.S., it is also important to include space for people who use pills. They may not be at risk of HIV or HCV, but there is significant overdose risk, and this population would benefit from many of the services provided at these sites. A safer \"consumption\" room (or any variation of a name that doesn't limit it to injection) is the most open to all types of people who use drugs. This is not to say we can't have facilities that focus specifically on the needs of PWID\u2014there are specific needs that people who inject have, and tailoring sites and services to them is important. Each city or town that is planning on bringing SCS to their communities should consider the needs of their local community of PWUD, and design a site and implement services that will accommodate all of them. There is also an option to not to name these sites with any drug- related language at all. This option has the benefits of removing potential stigma associated with words like \"injection\" or \"drug con-sumption, \" making it more acceptable to the general public. Seattle provides us with an example in their proposed name for SCS: Com-munity Health Engagement Locations, or \"CHELs. \" This also highlights that these are sites where more than just drug use occurs: They offer an array of medical and social services for people. Choosing the name can also help shape the debate around SCS. Opponents of SCS/SIF will likely choose to stoke fears and stereotypes by exaggerating the \"drug use\" and \"injecting, \" but highlighting that these are spaces are where a variety of health and social services are delivered can blunt this negative message.12 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformWhat do people who use drugs want in a SCS? In addition to offering a safe and healthy space to use drugs, these are spaces where PWUD can relax, escape the outside world and receive a wide array of services. In fact, SCS are quite successful in creating low threshold opportunities for PWUD to access medical care, mental health care, and referral to drug treatment. These spaces have also been highlighted as being particularly effective in reaching typically \"hard to reach\" clients, including PWUD who do not trust traditional medical and social services. All SCS in the U.S. should offer \"chill-out rooms, \" that is, spaces where people can just hang out (whether they've used drugs or not) until they are ready to leave. This model reflects drop-in homeless drop-in centers where people can come, get a reprieve from the streets and have access to care and services. It also gives people time to sit and get medical attention should something go wrong over time. There are also opportunities to create new services to keep people healthy and minimize risk of overdose. With the current spate of fentanyl laced opioids (and other drugs, for that matter), testing the drugs that people bring in would be a valuable addition to alleviate the crisis, allowing people to know what they are using to take the necessary precautions to stay safe. Further, rather than establishing a new location for an SCS, it may be prudent and cost effective to consider integrating SCS services within existing programs that serve PWUD. There are existing brick-and-mortar places like drop-in clinics, homeless shelters, and syringe access programs where placing rooms for safer drug use can be a highly effective and relatively easy thing to do.seRVIces oFFeRed In eUR oPeAn sAFe c onsUmPtIon sPA ces A survey of European drug consumption rooms lists a wide-range of services pro - vided, which serves as examples of what U.S.-based ones can offer, including: Snacks and coffee or tea Warm meals Needle exchange Access to injection equipment Personal care opportunities such as laundry and shower facilities Storage lockers Mailing address/post office box Free phone access Support for financial and administra- tive needs Health education Medical care: Nursing and primary care Referral services for drug treatment, mental health and other social ser - vices Work/reintegration opportunities Employment referrals Recreational activities SoUrCe: \"drug Consumption r ooms in e urope: an eview\" (2014)INTEGRATE OTHER SERVICES INTO SCS04safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform13What do people who use drugs want in a SCS? LOCATE SCS IN DRUG SCENES05Following on the integration discussion above, the facility should be convenient for people who use drugs. Often, PWUD have limited options for commuting and transit, so keeping SCS in the neighbor - hoods and communities where they live is important. It is also essential that these sites remain accessible to people with disabilities and are wheelchair accessible. Finally, mobile injecting vans can reach people in other neighbor - hoods where it may not be feasible to place an SCS. Employing \"pop-up\" SCS in homeless encampments would also be highly effective. The needs will differ from urban to rural areas, and even city to city. The location and types of sites used will depend upon the local drug scene, too. A community and strategic planning process, led by and with significant input from PWUD and their allies will maximize the chances for successful location, implementation and services provided. cRedIt : Courtney Large 14 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformIn tHIs sessIon, gReg scott of DePaul Univer - sity in Chicago and Sawbuck Productions showed a selection of his documentary video on a currently operating, underground SIF/SCS in \"Somewhere, USA. \" Following the film and a question and answer period, Alex Kral of RTI International and Peter Davidson of UC San Diego presented data on their evaluation of this site. The SCS in \"Somewhere, USA\" has been in operation for over 2 years. Prior to opening, the undisclosed organization was operating a safer bathroom. This set-up created a safer place to inject, but it was not ideal: Long lines and waiting\u2014for both people who were there to use drugs and for those who wanted to go to the bathroom\u2014were the norm, and it created a stressful situation for both staff and clients. Most significantly, it was an unpleasant and undignified place to inject. The staff built out a space to create 2 rooms: One to inject and the other to relax and \"chill out. \" The injecting room (there is no smoking allowed in this site as it is not set-up for it) has 5 stainless steel tables, allowing for up to 5 people to inject at a time. The room is stocked with safe injection supplies, and there is always a staff-person on-site to provide health education, safer injecting tips and administer naloxone should someone overdose. The documentary film provided the meeting participants with a visual of a space that no one other than the participants and staff of the program get to see. As an underground site in an undisclosed location, there is little financial support and certainly no department of public health support, so the SCS has a relatively simple, basic look. The film demon-strates that these places can operate in many differ - ent ways, and can be relatively \"low-tech:\" A clean, well-lit room with safe injection equipment and cleaning supplies can operate very well. Kral and Davidson provided quantitative and qualitative data to provide more context to the film. In over two years, this site had over 2500 observed injections. For nearly all of these participants, public injecting would be the only option available to them: 92% reported that they would have to use in a public restroom, in a park, on the street, or in notEs from an underground S if cRedIt : Santiago Perezsafer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform15a parking lot. The presence of this SCS gave them space to inject slowly and safely in a controlled manner, and to safely dispose of their syringes and injecting equipment. The site has been very well received by PWID, and there have been no negative consequences\u2014no violence, no sharing of injec - tion equipment and no acute health problems-- for either the individuals who use it or the community where it is located. A selection of quotes from participants further illustrates the important role an SCS can play in the health of PWUD: \"It affects me in a positive way because I have less of chance of catching something, I have less of chance of not knowing what I'm doing and hurt - ing myself. I have less of a chance of OD'ing and it's like I said, it builds a community and it builds trust and it builds a foundation within all of us to take the tension and the animosity, to be able to be amongst one another and be comfortable and peaceful. I feel when I come in here now, I feel peace, I feel comfortable, I feel peaceful, like the people around me are not all out to get me or they don't just want to be in my face or something. \" \"So it's the difference between sitting on a curb next to feces and you got people walking by you, and cops driving by constantly, and anytime kids come by, the majority of us we keep an eye out for them. We'll put it away and not expose the kids to that, but then you're rushing your shot in, you don't even really get to enjoy your high that much be - cause there's always people out there bumming off you and stuff. It's really crazy and dirty out there. \"the presentation closed with a discussion that davidson had with a participant: Davidson: I guess my final, final question is, if you were trying to explain this thing (provid- ing safer spaces for people to use drugs) to people completely outside the drug world, what would you say about it? Participant: Please have faith.Davidson: Trust us we're doing something sensible? Participant: Please trust us. It might not be tomorrow, it might not be next week, but you'll see a change in a lot of things. For those outside the harm reduction community, SCS may be so utterly foreign to them that they will immediately oppose them. Trust the research. Trust the evidence. Trust the people who provide the services. And trust the people who use the services. The research of Kral and Davidson is important as it demonstrates that a SCS can operate safely in the U.S. It is well-received by PWID, but it also has been able to operate anonymously without any social problems or trouble. The general community may or may not know it exists, but the fact that it has been able to operate for over 2 years without any negative consequences serves as a sort of \"proof of concept\" that SCS can work here. The pioneering work of the staff of this organization, and careful documentation by Kral and Davidson to support their work, serves as inspiration for us all.16 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Informthe idea that we need to frame SCS in racial justice is problematic because the idea that harm reduction is separate from racial justice is problematic. harm reduction is about radical resistance. i t is about people who are considered undeserving being different and demanding what they want. When we think about how to increase racial equity and reduce harm in people of color within this work, they're connected and cannot be separated. the idea here is that racial justice iS harm reduction because it is about reducing the harm that is included with drug policy and mass incarceration and police interactions. if we are talking about harm reduction reducing the harms of drug use then we should also be talk - ing about how racial justice reduces harm.\"\u2014 Kassandra Frederique, September 27, 2016 on JUne 21, 2016, Kristen Maye and Kassandra Frederique, both of the Drug Policy Alliance, wrote a blog for the Huffington Post entitled \"Supervised Injection Facilities are Safe Houses, Not Crack Houses\" (CITE). This essay marked a seminal mo - ment in the SCS movement: Traditionally SCS have been thought of as public health and drug treat - ment interventions, but here Maye and Frederique highlight the role these sites can play in racial justice and resistance to the racist war on drugs: A safer injection facility is a public health interven- tion. But it doesn't stop there. SIFs not only reduce the potential harms associated with drug use; they also reduce the harms associated with failed drug policies\u2014namely, the over policing and crimi-nalization of Black and Latino people. SIFs aren't just an answer to issues surrounding drug related health issues; they're also a step toward the reduc-tion of criminalization for those communities most targeted by the war on drugs, which may be kinder and gentler for white people, but which continues to rage unabated for Black and Latino people.Kassandra Frederique and Monique Tula presented on the racial justice components of SCS and the im-portance of including race within any SCS--indeed, within any harm reduction and drug policy--discus- sion that we have. This session is a small start for what needs to be a larger on-going conversation. The following are some key points and recommen- dations and strategies for meaningful inclusion of people of color in the SCS movement. There is a long history of health advocacy with the black and brown community: Both the Black Panthers in Oakland and the Young Lords of Chi- cago and New York City made access to health care a central tenet of their respective platforms. They were practicing harm reduction before the term was ever coined. Imani Woods, a central figure in the founding of the harm reduction movement in the U.S., spoke clearly and directly to ways in which harm reduction served white drug users, but black and brown people, particularly as targets for arrest and incarceration, were often left out of important discussions about how to effectively practice harm reduction in their communities.racial justicE is harm reduCtion SIFs/SCS, Policing and the War on Drugs '' ''safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform17whose voices are we listening to? who do we allow at the table? a SeleC tion of QUeStionS for organizationS to aSk themSelveS What aspects of our organization actively work to create inequalities? What power dynamics are at play? Whose voices are at the table? Whose are not? What do we need to support a diverse range of views? Who benefits from the way things are done? As we are in the early stages of SCS advocacy and organizing, we can correct past mistakes and in - clude people of color in all aspects of the work. Sustained, intentional effort to ensure racial justice and equity remain front and center of the harm reduction movement: It is not achieved from a one-time diversity or cultural compe - tency training. Our organizations must have an on-going assessment of policies and practices that marginalize people of color. A brief review of the history of using drug use as a means of vilifying and criminalizing a group of people to stifle political organizing. The war on drugs as we know it was started in the late 1960s by the Nixon Administration. John Erlichman, President Nixon's Chief of Domestic Policy, related the goals of this policy: \"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the pub - lic to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. \" The Black Panthers and Young Lords were systematically dismantled given the percep - tion that they were a significant threat to governments entrenched in white supremacist tactics. Harm reduction, on the other hand, has survived and has expanded as the opioid crisis moved into suburban and rural areas, and the faces of drug addiction and suffering have become increasingly whiter. This 'kinder, gentler' approach is a welcome shift. However, if this shift does not include people of color, we perpetuate a racist system designed to keep economically disadvantaged black and brown people who use drugs at the lowest rung of society and cycling in and out of the prison industrial complex. We must include SCS within efforts of criminal justice reform: SCS can be spaces where people of color\u2014who are the targets of the war on drugs\u2014 will have less risk of interacting with police. The harm reduction community must reach out to other racial and social justice groups, educate them about the benefits of SCS as one way of mitigating the harms caused by the war on drugs. This session could be a think tank on its own. As the harm reduction field advances, it is essential that our commitment to racial justice stands side-by-side with our commitment to the health of people who use drugs.18 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform\"The Task Force will apply an Equity and Social Justice (ESJ) lens to all of its work. We acknowledge that the \"War on Drugs\" has dispro - portionately adversely impacted some communities of color, and it is important that supportive interventions now not inadvertently replicate that pattern. Interventions to address the King County heroin and opiate problem will or could affect the health and safety of diverse communities, directly and indirectly (through re-allocation of resources). Measures recommended by the Task Force to enhance the health and well-being of heroin and opiate users or to prevent heroin and opiate addiction must be intentionally planned to ensure that they serve marginalized individuals and communities. At the same time, the response to heroin and opiate use must not exacerbate inequities in the care and response provided among users of various drugs. All recommendations by the Taskforce will be reviewed using a racial impact statement framework. The Task Force will not seek to advance recommendations that can be expected to widen racial or ethnic disparities in health, healthcare, other services and support, income, or justice system involvement. Whenever possible, these concerns should lead to broadening the recommendations of the Task Force, rather than leaving behind interventions that are predicted to enhance the health and well-being of heroin and opiate users. \"the Seattle heroin and opiate a ddiction task f orce made a concerted effort to include racial equity at the center of their organizing and safe consumption space work from the beginning. there was a recognition that the war on drugs dispropor - tionately impacts people of color and any effort to enact SCS must include them from the beginning and serve their needs. to that end, the task force developed a state - ment and strategy for includ- ing racial equity and social justice in their work. i t serves as an excellent example for us all to follow:INCORPORATING RACIAL JUSTICE INTO SAFE CONSUMPTION SPACE ADVOCACYlessons FR om seA ttleSeattle Patricia Sully, Kris Nyrop, Michael Ninburg don't just preach to the choir.

It is equally, if not more, im- portant to reach out to public safety and community groups. Go to community meetings and talk with people about the issues related to public drug use and take the opportunity provide some basic information about SCS and harm reduction as an approach to addressing the problems.organize across sectors. There are many groups that are impacted by substance use and its related health and social problems, and including them in your education and outreach events is essential. Build wide-ranging coalitions from impacted groups, includ-ing, but not limited to someone who uses drugs, someone in recovery, a business owner, a parent who lost a child to overdose, a defense attorney, a housing advocate, a policeman/ woman, a doctor, a park and rec worker and so on. You can and should also organize special- ized coalitions (for example \"Doctors for Safe Consumption Spaces\"), too. Work with them on this issue and bring them to community meetings and other public events as the diversity of experiences, community roles and expertise will speak to a wider range of people.don't be afraid of engaging the public. The best and most effective awareness events that Seattle has done are the ones that have placed them in the middle of the public. For example, bringing the SCS discussion to the general public in parks has been remarkably success-ful. It's an easy and relatively low-threshold activity. Using Safe Shape (see appendix) in parks was a very effective way to engage hundreds of people who otherwise would not have an idea or opinion on SCS, and certainly would not come to a panel discussion or film show - ing. Additionally, doing fun, non-adversarial public events are a direct way to reach people in a friendly manner before they've hardened their opinions based on misinformation, and introduce the topic on your own terms. Finally, holding it in neutral, public setting makes it easier to talk to people when they weren't in a fear-based mode of 'is one of these going to be in my neighborhood to - morrow?' It creates a space for a compassionate response to drug use in your community. safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform19In this session, representatives from 7 cities across the U.S. provided the group with an overview of SCS advocacy.scs organizing and advocacy leSSonS from S even CitieSlEssons from s EvEn citiEs: portland Haven Wheelock, Sam Junge keep the impacted community front and center. The local street newspaper, \"Street Roots, \" has been keeping this issue alive in Portland. This paper has stories driven and written by and for homeless persons, advocates, and those most directly impacted drug use and the resultant health and social problems. They are leading a policy push and conversations about SCS are happening in arenas other than syringe exchange programs and other harm reduction services. This brings in new allies from different organizations and other like-minded individuals who might not otherwise now about the subject. In Portland's last mayoral debate, it was Street Roots that specifically asked each of the candidates if they would support an SCS. Some said yes and some said maybe, but no one said no. In recent months, a report was issued recommend-ing that Portland look at the feasibility of an SCS. We can't say for sure that the two are related, but it was Street Routes and their constituencies that brought this to the attention of Portland policy-makers.Incorporate scs into as many community discussions as you can. It's important to attend com- munity meetings and any time drug use, crime and public order, homelessness, etc. is discussed you should stand up and state of SCS can address these social problems. Portland has brought the SCS discus-sion into community meetings about obvious issues like HIV and HCV prevention or over - dose prevention, but also for other homeless services like creating a drop-in space where homeless people can access clean showers. Normalizing the SCS discussion across different public sectors and highlighting their utility to people who want to address homelessness had been very valuable.build (or deepen) your harm reduction culture. Admittedly, it would be hard to open up a SCS in a community where harm reduction services like syringe access or naloxone distribution are not already established. It's such a new and radical idea that people need to be primed to accept it. So, if you have existing harm reduction programs in your community, bring SCS into the discussion as the next logical step in providing services. Even in the absence of harm reduc - tion programs in your com- munity, raising SCS as potential interactions to deal with the problems of HIV, HCV and/or drug overdose in conjunction with other services will bring it to the table. It may take longer to convince someone to open a SCS as opposed to a needle exchange site, but the conver - sation has to begin somewhere. In my opinion, the best way to get the public to warm up to the idea of a SIF is to proactively initiate other practices that assert the ethical legitimacy of harm reduction.\"\u2014 Sam Junge, People's Harm Reduction Alliance 20 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformlEssons from s EvEn citiEs: itha Ca Lilian Fan, John Barry don't rule out a scs. Injection drug is not just an urban problem: Rural and sub - urban areas have problems re - lated to it, too. The opioid crisis has exacerbated this. The issues of rural New York State mir - ror those of West Virginia and Kentucky: Overdose deaths, HCV and HIV transmissions, and other medical and social problems. PWID in these areas need better access to syringe access programs and opioid substitution therapy, but SCS is an important intervention, too. They may be difficult to pull off politically and economi- cally, but it is still worth explor - ing and including SCS in any conversation about how to deal with drug use in rural areas. don't wait for an scs. Certainly establishing an SCS and all of its related services is the ultimate goal, but in the meantime, don't wait to provide harm reduction and safe injec - tion services. The Southern Tier AIDS Project initiated a safer bathroom program as a prag-matic response to the fact that PWID were already using it as a place to inject. Rather than deny that the problem exists, or worse, enact measures to prevent injection drug use from happening in their bathroom, STAP choose to create a safer space for people to use. Safer bathrooms where people have access to clean injection sup - plies and can be monitored and revived in the case of an overdose are by no means the gold standard for safer injection facilities, but they are better than leaving people on their own in public settings where there at risk for any number of things, including arrest or over - dose death.work with your allies in local government. It's certainly true that many ar - eas of the country may not have an ally in local (or state) govern- ment, but if you do, work with them on SCS (and other harm reduction measures). The mayor of Ithaca, Svante Myrick wanted to put together a municipal drug strategy that would best meet the needs of PWID (and other PWUD), so he reached out across sectors for input. Local harm reduction advocates, and the Drug Policy Alliance played a key role in educating local policy-makers and the com- munity at-large, but having a high-ranking government of-ficial certainly helped push the agenda forward. safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform21 cRedIt : GPDCRlEssons from s EvEn citiEs: new y ork City Matt Curtis, Taeko Frost, Shantae Owens Include people who use drugs and would benefit from scs early and often. Provide real participation, com- pensation for time, and sup - port for speaking/advocating/etc. Create space for authentic leadership AND put in the time to make sure that people are informed, supported, and skilled up as needed. The ideal way to approach this is through structured community orga- nizing. While that can take an unlimited amount of time and energy (especially in bigger communities), you can scale down to meet your capacity. But there's no substitute for doing something along these lines, and all time and effort you put into this will be well worth it: Your movement will be the better for it.build relationships with your immediate local community. If you're a service provider that has plans to bring on SCS sooner or later, build relation- ships with everyone who may have anything to say about SCS implementation down the road - start those conversations early, informally, be patient, and create space for opposition or indifference. It doesn't click for everyone right away.educate politicians, jour- nalists before you start a campaign, never stop. Get at least a couple key thought leaders on your side before you create opportuni- ties for them to misunderstand or feel threatened by the issue. You can turn people around later, but if you can avoid put - ting people on the spot (e.g. a key politician you've never met with getting a negatively framed question from a journal-ist and feeling backed into a corner) it's always better. While the approach to educating poli- ticians and journalists is a little different, they are two classes of people that work in symbiosis around political issues, and you can often use one to steer the other (as well as other con- stituencies that pay attention to them). lead with values. Campaigns of all stripes are won because decision makers under - stand the whole context of the problem you raise and solution you're proposing, and they internalize the solution as a good and viable. The issue and solution must ultimately be widely and deeply felt. And while having a clear public health / epidemiological case is essential for winning SCS campaigns, it's far from the whole picture. Asking decision makers to support SCS is asking them to overturn decades of American drug war ideology in which they and their constituents are deeply schooled. They need to understand SCS (and harm reduction) as a moral imperative as well as a pragmatic or science-based solu- tion. 22 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformlEssons from s EvEn citiEs: d enver Preston Murray, Vernon Lewis work with your local media to raise awareness. The first step of addressing the social and medical problems that come with illicit drug use is often to educate the general public about it. Community events and town halls are cer - tainly a part of this, but working with local press\u2014print, televi-sion and radio\u2014has the capac - ity to reach even more people. And if you bring the story to media, you have a greater con-trol of the narrative and shape the story towards harm reduc - tion and compassion, rather than towards a punitive crimi- nal justice-only one.get creative with tech- nology and social media. HRAC has created videos to address awareness and fight stigma, as well as employed a social media strategy called \"Our Stories\" to fight stigma and highlight the problem of overdose in a humanizing way. These stories build compassion and open the mind for alterna- tive ways of addressing prob - lems. They don't mention SCS specifically, but they serve as a foundation for later SCS advo - cacy and awareness campaigns.engage with local businesses. Local business located in and around drug scenes have in interest in reducing the social problems related to public drug use. Even if they may not share the same harm reduction ethic as we might, they are likely to have similar goals: Less inject - ing in public, loitering and other social problems that may keep customers away. Addition-ally, using drugs in the bath-rooms of restaurants and other businesses is both problematic for the businesses and is not safe for the person injecting. To that end, the Harm Reduc - tion Action Center (HRAC) has formed an \"SCS Business Coali-tion, \" to educate restaurant and retail store owners on the value of SCS and gather support for them and recommend that Denver open an SCS as a public health intervention that is also good for business. safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform23 cRedIt : Kirkens Korsh\u00e6rlEssons from s EvEn citiEs: Baltimore Susan Sherman, Natanya Robinovitch, William Miller, Sr., William Miller, Jr. work with existing social justice coalitions. SCS are sites for harm reduc - tion and health. They are also sites for racial and social justice. Making connections with other racial/social justice coalitions is an excellent way of broaden- ing your base. Collaborating with anti-racism organizations, coalitions that mobilize against gentrification and displace - ment, and other social justice organizations that may not have SCS central to their mis- sion but likely to agree with the need for SCS for the communi-ties they work in will expand your influence.Incorporate scs as a response to the failed war on drugs. A recognition that the crimi- nalization of drug use and incarceration of people who use drugs has been a failure to stem the tide of drug use, and has exacerbated the harms and damage done to communities, especially African American and Latino ones is essential to positioning SCS as an accept - able alternative . Baltimore advocates have been spending a lot of time working in and building community support in areas of the city that are highly impacted by policing, mass incarceration and other social and medical harms, and offer - ing the idea of SCS as a different means of dealing with drug use. These are the populations most heavily impacted by the failed policies of the drug war, and have the greatest to gain from a more compassionate approach. engage in real listening. Including people who use drugs at all levels of SCS plan- ning is essential, and included in this is a deep and serious listening to affected communi-ties, both those who use drugs and those who don't. Engage with residents of poor, divested neighborhoods, and meet them where they're at in terms of solutions to the war on drugs. Work with these diverse com-munities and stay committed to them for the long run. These relationships are not only the moral thing to do, they will im- prove the chances for success- fully establishing SCS in these communities. 24 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform cRedIt : GPDCRlEssons from s EvEn citiEs: San fran CiSC o Laura Thomas, Michael Siever Prepare and build com- munity and political support. In 2007, a group of advocates called the \"Alliance for Saving Lives\" organized a day-long summit on safe injection facilities. The event as very well-received locally: The SF Depart - ment of Public Health co-sponsored it, there was positive coverage in the local press\u2014in- cluding from a columnist who wasn't always on-board with harm reduction, and communi-ty members were emboldened and inspired to move forward on SCS. For all of the success locally, news of the event made it into the national press, including the right wing press and talk radio news cycles. The backlash was strong, and made its way to the Senate, where a conservative Senator threat - ened to block all federal dollars from coming to SF should they open an SCS. This threat was effective, as the lack of prior groundwork to build political cover from local representatives did not allow for room to resist, and it left local policy makers and advocates uncomfortable. The work to make SCS a reality in SF continued, but the pace slowed down and the proper groundwork has been laid. cRedIt : GPDCRwork with other task forces and civic groups. Introduce SCS into as many pol- icy discussions as possible. San Francisco has had a series of task forces and planning groups whose work crossed into drug user health, and enlisting them as allies and incorporating SCS into their recommendations and plans has been an effec - tive tool in broadening sup - port, raising awareness and maintaining a high profile. The inclusion of SCS can be found in reports from 'The Mayor's Hepatitis C Task Force\" (2011), the Human Rights Commis- sion's community report on the war on drugs (2014) and the HIV Prevention Planning Coun-cil and HIV Services Planning Council (2015).work with local merchants and other potential allies. You must continually reach out to people and get them on-board with the idea of SCS. Work with your local depart - ment of public health and educate them on the issue. Attend neighborhood meetings and offer SCS as solutions to problems that concern them, such as public injecting and discarded syringes. Work with merchants and business own-ers to discuss the role that SCS can play in reducing the use of their bathrooms for injecting. Give opponents an opportu- nity to state their concerns and engage in respectful dialogue with them. Stay true to your val-ues, support and promote the needs of people who use drugs, and shape the way people talk about drug use. safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform25 26 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformsAFeR consUmPtIon sPA ces are clearly sites for people who use drugs, so engaging PWUD and their harm reduction allies, as well as other service providers is a relatively easy thing to do: The evidence and effectiveness of harm reduction interventions overall, and SCS in particular, is strong enough that we're already convinced these are effective interventions for dealing with the personal and public health problems of drug use. Addition-ally, there are natural intersections with a number of groups that may not directly work in issues related to injection drug use, but are more likely to come on-board with SCS after some discussion and education. Data and evidence alone, however, have not been enough to bring the general public on-board to harm reduction interventions into the main-stream in the U.S. As Johan Hari writes, abstinence-only drug treatment and criminalization of drug use as the only response to drugs is \"etched into our subconscious. \" How do we overcome this and bring new allies under the SCS tent?A number of groups were highlighted as potential allies, found in the chart below: HIV/AIDS advocates and organizations HCV advocates and organizations LGBTQ advocates and organizations Racial justice advocates and organizations Homeless advocates and organizations Legal organizations Criminal justice reform groups Harm reduction organizations Faith-based groups Business groups Drug treatment programs Merchants associations Sex worker rights advocates and organizations Medical associations (Nurses, Physicians, medi- cal students Family service organizations Mental health organizations Youth organizations Neighborhood groups Local political parties/clubs Anti-violence advocates and organizationsBEyond thE Echo chamBEr: engaging new allieS safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform27Several additional points were made to help shape the conversations about SCS and engage new allies: the needs of people currently using, and would likely be more readily listened to by individuals who have pre-existing biases against drug use. Similarly, the parents of children lost to overdose have been effective change-makers in the nalox - one and opioid substitution therapy access advo - cacy movements. They, too, can be employed in SCS community education and advocacy. While there is a diverse array of stakeholders to employ in SCS advocacy, active PWUD are still the primary group to lead this movement. In maintaining our values, we cannot fall into the trap of erasing their voices from the public dis- course because people who don't use would be more acceptable to the general public. PWUD as leaders and spokespeople is essential and in and of itself a de-stigmatizing action. A central tenat of harm reduction service provi- sion is \"meet them where they're at. \" This applies to the general public, too: It will likely take time and effort to convince people that SCS are safe and effective for the community as well as the individual PWUD. Don't limit ourselves to thinking about natural allies, but also reach out to businesses and other community groups. There may be different mo - tives to support SCS, but there are lots of people who want to work and help alleviate suffering. Highlight the effectiveness of SCS in engaging PWUD who do not always use other services: People come to use safely, and they stay for the variety of other services offered. While it is true that there are many benefits to SCS, we shouldn't oversell these additional benefits over the direct, drug-related harms of overdose, HIV and HCV transmission. This re - mains the primary mission of SCS and the most effective means of achieving it. We have facts on our side: SCS are cost effective, reduce public injecting and related social prob - lems, and reduce medical harms related to drug use. All of this is true, but in our conversations with people, discussing values and compassion are often more effective than data.

This discussion focused on the importance of employing PWUD to staff SCS. There is significant concern that as PWUD often have criminal records, they are excluded from many employment opportunities. Organizations that open an SCS must make a concerted effort to hire PWUD to staff them, and then support and develop said staff accordingly. Placing PWUD in positions of management and leadership is impor - tant, too.Other considerations/recommendations include: Protecting PWUD with criminal records from further charges and arrest (particularly for any underground SCS). Pay a living wage. Too often, PWUD are used as peer volunteers where their labor is used but they are not compensated. Similarly, even when paid positions are available, they are often low-level positions where salaries are low. Place PWUD on the board of directors of orga-nizations operating SCS. Forming community advisory boards (CABs) of PWUD to inform the operation of SCS, and to serve as a voice for the people who use SCS.addrEssing cEntral issuEs in SCS advo CaCy A series of breakout groups met to discuss a range of issues that are important to the scs advocacy movement. cRedIt : GPDCR30 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformAddressing central issues in SCS advocacy. PRogRAm stRA tegIes This group was charged with discussing how we can start SCS. There was an agreement that there is a sense of urgency in moving forward with these spaces: SCS are well-established in other parts of the world, are proven evidence-based interventions, and yet, they are still not operating in the U.S. despite being talked about for years. As we move to start SCS in our community, several considerations were discussed: No matter what we end up with, the core prin- ciples of involving PWUD and peers in the work and creating an open, welcoming space must be prioritized; Don't let perfection be the enemy of good: We can't get stuck in an ideal program type as there is room for a variety of models and service delivery; Even if you start small, it's still a start. Once a program is established, there will be opportuni- ties to expand to an array of other services to provide; Plan and prepare for media coverage: Engage with the media early and often and do every - thing you can to frame the message around SCS. This group developed 3 recommendations: The movement wants progress in establishing SCS, ideally legal ones, but underground pro - grams if necessary; Programs must be low-threshold, peer-driven; Flexibility in program design allowing for local communities to establish SCS that meet their needs.FUndIng stRA tegIes The group identified 3 potential areas for funding opportunities/needs: (1) Advocacy, (2) Research and Evaluation, and (3) Programmatic (running a SCS). Each of these areas have different funding oppor - tunities, and some are easier to fund than others: Funding for SCS advocacy, for example, is more readily available than is funding for an underground SCS. Prioritizing funding for advocacy is important as that could both free up funding opportunities from other funders, but it is also a necessary first step to make these programs legal, which will open up funding from others, including departments of public health. Potential strategies include: A funder leveraging drive: A major funder can reach out to communities interested in opening and operating an SCS, and bring other funders to the table to combine grants/funding for funding SCS. A funder convening: We can hold a meeting of foundations and other grant-makers\u2014both those that have traditionally funded harm reduction but also new ones\u2014to educate them on SCS and the need to fund advocacy and operations. The need for funding advocacy and programs is high: Most of the non-profits that would be willing to open and operate an SCS are already on limited budgets, stretched thin with both staff and volun-teers and may not have the ability to take on an entirely new program.safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform31tools FoR oR gAnIzIng This breakout group identified 7 tools that would assist advocates in both local, state and national advocacy and awareness activities.

A Facebook page is a simple tool to create a forum for ongoing campaigns, news, and events. ReseAR cH. There is a rich history of using evidence-based research to support harm reduction interventions, and we have a wealth of research on SCS/SIF in Canada and Australia, with less in the English-language press from Western Europe. This research is important for U.S.-based advocacy, but we also need feasibil-ity, cost-effectiveness and other related research here. Alex Kral and Peter Davidson demonstrated the value of their research at this meeting (and both are engaged in on-going research), and several other scholars have work in progress or in press as well. Community groups should reach out to medical, public health, and social science researchers to conduct research related to SCS in their respective community. In addition to conducting the research, the work needs to be disseminated in traditional manner of scientific conferences and journals, but also in community forums and other settings where the research will reach the impacted communities and those who would most benefit from the information. Finally, reflecting comments from earlier in the meeting, it's important to bring people who use drugs into the research process with a community- based participatory research agenda. The website, Facebook page and listserv listed above will also serve as tools for dissemination of research.Addressing central issues in SCS advocacy.32 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformstAte Ad VocAcy stRA tegIes Working on a state-by-state advocacy agenda is a viable option for legalizing and opening SCS.

It still must pass the state Senate and then get signed into law by the governor, but this marks the first time a bill relating to SCS has been passed by a legislative body in the U.S.The group discussed several strategies for pursuing an SCS agenda at a state level: Avoid siloing within various government agen- cies. There are different people working across different programs, and it is as important to connect allies within government as it is in the community. Link SCS to other related policies such as state HIV/AIDS or HCV elimination strategies, or over - dose response plans. Keep lines of communication between local advocates and those working at a state level: State legislatures want to know that there is a local health department that wants to authorize an SCS, while local health departments want to know that the state would support the opening of one. Putting the two together and formulat - ing a unified plan will help move things forward. There are 4 recommendations for state advocates to undertake: Frontload information and education to policy- makers early; Spend a lot of time building coalitions of com-munity groups, professional societies, advocates and so on to support SCS; Set benchmarks to serve as a roadmap to vic - tory: What do you need to do to make SCS a re - ality in your state, and how do you know you're getting there? Find a state legislator who will serve as a cham-pion for SCS, work with her/him to draft legisla-tion and educate their colleagues to pass it.Addressing central issues in SCS advocacy. cRedIt : Delphine VaissetAny clear, organized federal strategy is in its infancy. In fact, for now there is no need to ask Congress to anything in terms of legislation or the like, but rather, focus on preventative advocacy so as to avoid a scenario where an opponent to SCS might threaten to withhold federal dollars from jurisdictions looking to start one. A more produc - tive goal would be to educate Congress now, and seek action later. There are 3 potential goals for advocates working at the federal level: Building support for SCS; Mitigating potential harms from federal policymaking; Provide support for local and state organizing. There are a number of potential activities for fed- eral advocates to undertake: Educate Congress on the issue through a policy brief or congressional briefing; Set-up Congressional staffer visits to InSite in Vancouver, or other Canadian SCS once they open; Strategize around effective ways to integrate SCS into other federal efforts related to overdose deaths and syringe access funding, including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA); Explores ways in which we can work with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on clarifying the legality of SCS within federal law. safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform33FedeRAl Ad VocAcy stRA tegIes Develop relationships with relevant administra-tive offices: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Develop - ment (HUD), Veterans Administration (VA), Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Office of National AIDS Policy and DOJ. Author's Note: Much of what could be done on a federal level was dependent upon the outcomes of the election. At the time of the meeting, President Barack Obama was in office and there was evidence to suggest that his administration would be recep - tive to harm reduction and alternative approaches to drug policy. With the election of President Donald Trump, we do not yet have a sense of where the cur - rent administration will stand on SCS. Admittedly, the rhetoric of ramping up the war on drugs, and the appointment of an Attorney General with a racist past who has a poor record of ignoring evidence-based interventions for drug treatment or harm reduction while supporting incarcerating people who use drugs, does not leave one room for much optimism. There may be opportunities for partner - ship, or at minimum opportunities to educate our federal partners on alternative strategies to address the opioid crisis and other drug useAddressing central issues in SCS advocacy.34 safer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project InformAs we mo Ve FoR wARd with our SIF/SCS advocacy there will likely be competing voices calling for compromises or enact - ing certain conditions in order to allow them happen, particularly from people who may not be deeply invested in harm reduction values. As we fight for SIF/SCS, it's important for us to identify our values as we engage new allies and try to convince potential allies to join us. The meeting closed with a large group dis- cussion reviewing many of the themes we talked about throughout the two days, and further articulating what we want to see in SCS, and how we can keep our values while advocating for and operating them. A summary of recommendations that the group collectively endorsed for how to proceed in the SCS movement and what services we want to see deliv - ered once these SCS are implemented can be found to the right. this list is not end of this discussion. Some of these ideas are controversial and may face resistance from the general public. SCS advocates will need to take the time to educate people about SCS and provide rationale for goals and services. this list will likely expand as this movement goes forward. as long as we keep the needs of the people who use drugs at the forefront of this movement and it remains true to the above values, we know we will be doing it right.making scs our o Wn: keeping v alueS within the m ovement scs PRIncIPles And V AlUes keep it a drug user led movement; keep these spaces to all PWUd , regardless of how they use their drugs; must be centered in racial and social justice; Build positive relationships across local/state campaigns; any program model must be based on respect and inclusion; they should be spaces for radicalization: SCS are political projects, fighting against a war on drugs and seeking a society that is demilita- rized and without stigma. open 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days per year; keep it low threshold; no mandated discussion of drug treatment or other services: \" meet them where they're at;\" allow for assisted injecting (\"doctoring\"); no age limits: i f you use drugs, you're welcome to attend and receive services; no pregnancy limits: We want to engage all people and be open and inclusive; Childcare should be available; they should be pet friendly; SCS should be staffed by PWUd who are paid a living wage.scs oPeRA tIng goAls And seRVIcessafer c onsumption spaces in the Us: Uniting for a national m ovement, Project Inform35GRAPHICwItH IncReAsed A wAReness of injection related HIV and HCV outbreaks across the U.S., attention to the opioid crisis and the suffering that results from overdose deaths, as well as a renewed commitment to social justice and racial equity among advocates and the communities most impacted by the failed, racist war on drugs, there is now much public dis- cussion about the ways to reduce the harm associated with injection drug use and alternatives to criminalization. Along those lines, there has been increased discussion\u2014indeed, in the cases of Ithaca, Seattle and California, there has been action\u2014about safer consumption spaces and the role they can play in alleviating these harms. It will not be easy to overcome the barriers and meet the challenges related to establishing safer consumption spaces in the United States. There are significant barriers to establishing most, if not all, harm reduction interventions in the U.S., and SCS will be no exception. Socially and politically, insistence on abstinence and criminalization of drug use have been the primary means of dealing with this issue. A significant challenge to establish-ing SCS is overcoming public perception among both policy-makers and community members that these programs will create a host of negative con-sequences to the areas in which they exist, and that the programs condone and will increase drug use. The participants of this think tank made an important contribution to the critical and ongoing process of achieving social justice, equity and im-proved health of PWUD. This think tank is built on the foundations laid by drug user unions and their advocates. There is much work to be done, and this meeting is but a step towards a more humane and just society. How will we know we are doing it right? When we are led by people who use drugs. When we have a commitment to racial justice and social equity. We'll know when we have opened SCS throughout the U.S. Project Inform will continue this work. In addition to municipal, state and federal advocacy, Project Inform will produce a \"Safer Consumption Spaces Toolkit\" to help people organize and advo - cate for SCS in their communities. We are forming a national SCS community advisory board comprised and led by PWUD. Finally we will produce a monthly webinar series devoted to SCS and related topics. There are many others across the U.S. working to establish SCS in their communities. We are excited to be a part of this movement to push this lifesaving agenda forward.

A range of new-to-Canada models have been imple- mented over the past two years. In some cities, including Toronto and Ottawa, health authorities initially focused on embedding the services within community health agencies to provide a continuum of health care and treatment for substance use disorders, but there are no data on the effectiveness of this model. With an increasing diversity of models of supervised-consumption services in operation, there exists a window of opportunity for a second generation of research in this area that moves from asking whether such services are effective in reduc-ing drug-related harms \u2014 which we know them to be 1 \u2014 to ask- ing whether, how and under what conditions their benefits can be maximized. Models of supervised-consumption services operating in Can- ada include \"overdose-prevention sites,\" stand-alone storefronts, mobile vans, co-location with harm-reduction pro- grams or social housing, in-hospital services, women-only sites and the aforementioned integrated model. Some of these oper- ate within community health centres that also offer services for populations that do not use drugs. The plurality of models raises questions as to their relative effectiveness. These questions are not answered by the existing scientific literature, which is domi- nated by reports from two stand-alone sites in Vancouver and Sydney, Australia, employing comparable models. 1 The evidence base on alternative models is insufficient to guide policy in this area, and it would be premature to consider service models interchangeable. Nevertheless, officials in Seattle recently announced they will operate a mobile supervised-consumption service because no fixed location could be secured. Insite, Canada's first formal supervised-consumption service, opened in Vancouver in 2003 and remained the only sanctioned site in Canada for 12 years. 2 Insite is a stand-alone, storefront model that offers basic nursing care (including initial prescrip - tions for opioid agonist therapy) and a small co-located med- ically supervised detoxification facility. Extensive evaluation has established Insite's public health benefits. 1 However, it is also evident that stand-alone models have limited reach.3 They serve a small geographic area (the distance clients will walk), and even among regular service users, only a proportion of injections are covered (43% of Insite users accessed the site for fewer than one-quarter of injections 4). Moreover, stand-alone models attract a highly socially vulnerable population,5 and clients continue to face disparities in health status, homelessness and access to opi- oid agonist therapy.6 This suggests a need for greater scale-up of existing models as well as for new models that offer a larger suite of on-site health services. Integrated and co-located health service models have been developed to address HIV and hepatitis C epidemics among peo-ple who inject drugs, 7 and have been successful in improving the quality of client care.8 Integrated services offer clients \"one-stop shopping\" in settings where they have established trusting rela-tionships, in contrast to the stigma and mistrust that often char- acterize other health care encounters. 7,8 Although stand-alone supervised-consumption services have demonstrated some suc- cess in making referrals to external health services,1 referrals to co-located services are likely to be more successful given the dif-ficulties their client populations typically face in accessing med- ical care. 9 As perhaps the lowest-barrier health services available to people who use drugs, supervised-consumption services rep- resent an ideal fulcrum for service integration. Such integration is occurring within community health cen- tres in Toronto and Ottawa, where supervised-consumption ser-vices aim to prevent immediate drug-related harms while con- necting clients to existing on-site primary care, mental health care and social service programs. These integrated models also COMMENTARY Integrating supervised consumption into a continuum of care for people who use drugs Ayden Scheim PhD, Dan Werb PhD n Cite August 7;190:E921-2. doi: 10.1503/cmaj.180824 KEY POINTS Supervised-consumption services are known to be effective in reducing drug-related harms, and several dedicated services now exist in Canada. It is now time to move from asking whether such services are effective to asking whether, how and under what conditions their benefits can be maximized. Integrated and co-located health service models \u2014 effectively \"one-stop shops\" \u2014 could improve health outcomes for people who inject drugs by combining the prevention of immediate drug-related harms with access to primary care, mental health care and social service programs.VULNERABLE POPULATIONSCOMMENTARYE922 CMAJ | AUGUST 7, 2018 | VOLUME 190 | ISSUE 31 offer opportunities for innovative service delivery to fill gaps in the current system of care. In Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver, drug-checking programs using spectrometry are being put in place within supervised-consumption services so that detailed information on the composition of street drugs can be dissemi- nated in an effort to reduce overdose risk. One Toronto site, The Works, already includes an on-site methadone and suboxone treatment clinic. Further, there is increasing interest across Can- ada in managed opioid programs to divert patients from adulter- ated street drugs and to offer managed care for opioid use disor-der. Integrated supervised-consumption services are being considered as natural hubs for such programs. Despite the theoretical advantages of integrated models of supervised-consumption services, there are also potential chal-lenges requiring community-engaged investigation. For example, there is tension between integration with clinical care and provi-sion of low-barrier supervised-consumption services. For some individuals who use drugs, the regulations imposed by government-sanctioned models (e.g., time limits and inability to share drugs) are unacceptable, 3,10 and others may prefer to access supervised-consumption services separately from other health services to maintain their anonymity. Such individuals can choose to access lower-threshold overdose prevention sites in some cities, but these are ultimately intended to be temporary solutions. The impacts of integrated models may also be con- strained by operational restrictions of health care facilities, such as limited hours of operation. Therefore, we propose that a con- sideration of the relative benefits of stand-alone, integrated and low-threshold models should be prioritized in second-generation research on supervised-consumption services, particularly with respect to their appropriateness for urban, suburban, rural and remote communities, and for specific subpopulations, such as women and Indigenous people. Numerous challenges limit implementation of supervised- consumption services, even during this period of heightened mortality from opioid overdose. Municipalities need not choose from a single model, and all options should be on the table, from peer-run through clinically embedded supervised-consumption services. Indeed, the operation of diverse service models across multiple sites within a given city is likely optimal. The social con- texts, needs and preferences of people who use drugs across set-tings are diverse, and so too must be the public health response. At the same time, precisely because supervised-consumption services can be challenging to establish, efforts should be made to understand when, why and for whom various models are most beneficial, rather than treating them as interchangeable. Specif- ically, implementing and evaluating programs that integrate supervised consumption within a broader spectrum of care may reduce substantial barriers to progression along the continuum of treatment for substance use disorder for marginalized individ- uals who use drugs, filling an ongoing gap in care that contrib- utes to the worsening of Canada's opioid overdose crisis.

Epidemiological studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have found that overall life expectancy of Americans has declined, and this decline was largely attributed to drug -related overdose deaths.1-3 Today in the US, overd oses are classified as the leading cause of injury -related death. The public health approach to addressing the overdose epidemic is multi -faceted, involving a combination of policy, education, and community interventions. A framework developed by the Association of State and Territorial Health Organizations (ASTHO) describes a cross -sectoral response with four key strategy areas: (1) training and education; (2) monitoring and surveillance; (3) primary and overdose prevention; and (4) treatment, and harm reduction. Harm reduction strategies seek to mitigate the harms of behaviors.4 Harm reduction strategies include improved access to the antidote naloxone, syringe service programs (SSPs) that allow people who inject drugs (PWID) to obtain or exchange equipment for inject ions, and drug checking services that screen for risky drugs such as fentanyl . These implement an alternative to the criminaliza tion and disease treatment models of drug use and addiction. Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are an additional method o f harm reduction. While proponents of harm reduction theory recognize abstinence may be the ideal goal for some people, they acc ept alternatives which reduce the risk for death and disability even if they do not promote abstinence.5 Opponents of such strategies often focus on their potential to enable activities that are criminal or perceived as immoral.6 Supervised Injection Facilities (or Supervised Consumption Sites) A SIF is a permanent or mobile place where people can inject drugs they have obtained elsewhere.7 If it permits use of drugs by routes other than injection (such as smoking or snorting), \"supervised consump tion site\" (SCS) is a more appropriate term. SIFs typically provide equipment to allow users to perform safe and sterile injections while being monitored by trained medical staff who can treat overdoses with oxyge n, naloxone, and/or other first -responder care.7 While SIF mo del implementation seems to vary based on community needs, resources, and funding, interviews with stakeholders suggest that there are three core features: sterile equipment, trained personnel for supervision, and naloxone administration (along with other first-responder medical care). Additional services may be added to the core features, such as health screening, treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) , referral coordination for social support (e.g., housing), health care and mental health services .7-10 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES2 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents In 2003, Insite, the first legally -sanctioned SIF in North America, opened in Vancouver, British Columbia's Downtown Eastside, a neighborhood with high rates of drug use, homelessnes s, and poverty.11 Vancouver has become an exemplar se tting for researchers and policy advocates to understand the impact of the SIF model on a va riety of outcomes, including the ones addressed in this ICER report. The clients of SIFs are impacted by many social determinants of health . They are homeless, li ve alone, or have significant housing insecurity. Mental illness and unemployment are commo n. We spoke with a SIF client who described the people served by SIFs as \"poor, homeless, marginalized...a beat -down people\". Although SIFs are considered a type o f public health intervention, their population -level reach is measured in city blocks - not miles.12,13 The location is an important attribute that determines whom a SIF serves as well as its potential public health impact. There are no legally sanctioned SIFs operating in the United States. Per a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, one unsanctione d site has been operating in the US for six years.14 There are news reports of elected officials or groups in New York City, Ithaca, Seattle, Denver, Washington DC, Chicago, Baltimore, Burlington, Oakland and San Francisco exploring feasibility, organizing coalitions, or preparing legislation for SIFs.15-23 Objectives The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the health and economic outcomes of a SIF. This review seeks to answer the question: What is the net health benefit of implementi ng a SIF (which includes an SSP) versus an SSP alone? The CDC recommends SSPs as an evidence -based program noting they are \"safe, effective, and cost saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmissio n of viral hepatitis, HIV, and other infections.\"24 The ICER value framework includes both quantitative and qualitative comp arisons to ensure that the full range of benefits and harms are considered in t he judgments about the clinical and economic value. The assessment of effectiveness and value is made in comparison to an SSP as we believe it unlikely that communities without SSPs would be willing to consider a SIF . A SIF implemented in a community wit hout good SSP coverage may experience more than the incremental benefit. Perspective of the Client and Impact on Persons Who Use Drugs Section 2 of this report has an extensiv e description of what we heard from 48 stakeholders including those who are cli ents of SIFs /SSPs, staff members of SIFs/SSPs, researchers, clinical experts, legislative experts, and a law enforcement officer , and includes direct quotes from many stakeholde rs. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES3 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents In brief, some of the major themes we heard include the following : Social Isolation and Community : SIFs serve the most vulnerable and marginalized people in a community, with many PWUD live in social isolation due to housing insecurity, mental illness, and poverty. SIFs can provide a place where PWUD will be welcomed and can build relationships with other clients and with staff. In contrast to client interactions with SSPs that were described as \"transactional and hurried\", SIFs have the potential to be more effec tive at introducing counseling interventions through a community built on camaraderie. Integrated Services : Providing on -site access to social workers, frontline workers, or counselors was widely considered essential. Their experience suggest ed that most clients could not be easily referred to external counseling as they often would not accept another counselling center for reasons such as distance, fears, and stigma. Learning from Lived Experience : Most people commented on how the best SIFs respect the expertise of PWUD and include them in setting policies and operating the facility. Inhal ation of Drugs and Safely Testing Drugs : We heard from multiple stakeholders that changes in the drug supply and client preferences mean that SIFs must adap t and provide for the use of inhaled substances (not limited to opioids), becoming more comprehensive SCSs. Several PWUD described how they use the SIF to check the potency of a new batch under the protection of supervision and resuscitation, if needed. Health Care Sy stem Bias : PWUD noted \"shaming and blaming\" and \"accusations of drug - seeking\" from health care system (e.g., hospitals, doctors, and EMTs ). SIFs offered a more compassionate way to access education, resources , and medical care. Honeypot Effe ct: Most PWUD and many stakeholders dismissed the possibility of a honeypot effect in which a SIF attracted PWUD or crime to a neighborhood, noting the long - established poor conditions of neighborhoods where SIFs are generally located. However, PWUD and stakeholders acknowledged that opposition to SIFs, SSPs , and other forms of harm reduction can exist in a community. We heard from PWUD and stakeholders that drug use still happens just outside of SIFs and SSPs, and at least some community members do comp lain about syringe/needle debris . Public Drug Use : There is a community -level trauma caused by public use as well as overdose. SIFs provide the possibility of reducing this trauma to the public. Clinical Effectiveness Overview of Studies Our literature se arch identified a total of 1188 potentially relevant references for SIFs (see Appendix D2), and we included 48 studies that evaluated individual or community level outcomes for SIFs. The majority of studies evaluated SIFs from Canada (n=33), and the remai ning studies evaluated \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES4 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents SIFs in Australia (n=8) and European countries (n=7, including, two from Germany, three from Denmark, and two from Spain). Eighteen studies used a cohort study design, while others employed a pre -post ecological or time series (n=11 ), and cross -sectional study design (n=10). Nine studies used a qualitative, exploratory, or descriptive study design. We also included government sanctioned evaluation reports from MSIC in Sydney, Australia, the MSIR in North Richmond Australia, an d the SCSs in Alberta, Canada. To summarize the effectiveness of SSPs, we included one review of reviews25 that summarized results from 13 prior systematic reviews as well as three additional systematic reviews.26-28 These selections were drawn from a search of systematic reviews of SSPs which identified a total of 72 pote ntially relevant references. We are assuming that PWID had access to SSPs during the study period, and the outcomes associated with SIFs are informing the added benefits of SIFs over baseline SSP access. Much of the evidence regarding SIFs arises from ongoing prospective cohort s tudies in Vancouver, Canada , including studies of Insite. Mortality Published evidence and unpublished reports from stakeholders suggest that no client of a SIF has ever experienced death from over dose within a facility .14,29,30 However, PWUD are at high risk of death from overdose, and reduction of mortality inside SIFs does not necessarily demonstrate reduction in mortality in SIF clients. A Canadian prospective cohort study found that frequent use of SIFs was associated with a lower risk of all -cause mortality (adjusted HR[aHR]: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26 -0.80).31 However, it is hard to assess causality from such studies as PWUD who are frequent clients of SIFs are likely different from those who are not. Higher quality evidence on the effect of SIF on mortality probably comes from a population -based study in Vancouver, Canada that evaluated the effec ts of Insite on overdose mortality by measuring overdose m ortality pre -and post -SIF with in and beyond the 500 m area around the facility.12 The SIF opening was associated with a significant reduction of 35% in overdose mortality within 500 m of the facility, compared to a 9.3% decli ne in the rest of the city.

Post -SIF period= September 21, 2003 to December 31, 2005 *Expressed in units of per 100,000 person -years Non -Fatal Overdose and Health Care Utilization for Overdose We identified three studies that evaluated the effect of SIF use o n non -fatal overdose and overdose requiring EMS, ambulance, or hospital care.32,33 A study from Insite from March 2004 to August 2005 found 285 unique users who experienced 336 non -fatal overdose events. Of these overdose events, 28% resulted in a transf er to hospital.32 A recent time -series analysis of SIF users at Insite reported that the ove rdose rate per 1000 visits increased from 2010 to 2017 (1.5 vs 9.5, p<0.001) with an increase in overdose events requiring naloxone administration (48.4% to 57.1%, p<0.001) but no overdose deaths were reported within the facility.33 In a 2007 study by the New South Wales (NSW) Heal th Department in Sydney, Australia, opioid overdose -related ambulance calls were analyzed in Sydney over 36 months pre -SIF and 60 months post -SIF. The SIF opening was associated with a greater reduction in ambulance calls for opioid - related overdose event s in the vicinity of the SIF compared to the rest of NSW (68% vs 61% decline, p=0.002).34 This effect was even higher during operating hours of the SIF (80% vs 60% decline, p<0.001). Injection Risk Behaviors Reducing injection risk behaviors (IRBs) is important in reducing the risk of infectious disease transmission.35 1101 We identified sev en studies that evaluated the effect of SIFs o n reducing IRBs, including four studies from Vancouver and three studies from European countries (Denmark, Germany, and Spain). Most studies reported SIF use was associated with a reduction in IRBs. For examp le, a cross -sectional analysis of 431 PWID in Vancouver found that SIF use was associated with reduced syringe sharing of 1082 PWID explored reasons for changes in changes in IRBs, noting 80% reported reductions in rushed injections, 71% reported less outdoor injections, 56% reported less \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES6 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents unsafe syringe disposal, and 37% reported using used syringes less often.13 A meta -analysis combined results from three European studies (Wood 2005, Kerr 2005, and Bravo 2009) and found SIF use was associated with a 69% reduction in the likelihood of syringe sharing (pooled effect: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.55).37 Infection Prevalence/Incidence and Health Care Utilization We identified studies that provided evidence on the effe ct of SIFs on infection incidence and prevalence, most of which were not designed to detect differences, specifically in rates of HIV or HCV. A cross -sectional study of 510 PWID who attended a SIF in Catalonia, Spain found tha t there were no significant d ifferences in the prevalence of HIV or HCV among those who had frequent SIF attendance (i.e., daily), medium SIF attendance (i.e., > half of days), and low SIF attendance (i.e., half of the days).38 More extensive evidence exists for the effects of SSPs on viral infections and the results are mixed. A meta -analysis pooled results from 10 studies and found a trend towards a reduced ris k of HIV transmission with SSPs (effect size: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.01).39 When the analysis looked only at six higher -quality studies, a significant reducti on was obse rved to 0.81). One meta -analysis pooled results from seven studies and found an increased risk of acquiring HCV with SSPs (RR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.52)40, but the authors noted that studies included in their analysis may have been affected by volu nteer bias as SSPs may attract higher -risk PWID. Other meta -analyses suggested SSPs may reduce the risk of acquiring HCV .28,41 A prospective cohort of 1065 PWID attending Insite (SEOSI cohort) found the use of SIF for all injections versus some injections was associated with a statistically non -significant decreased likelihood of developing a cutaneous injection -related prospective cohort study of 129 PWID attending a DCF in Essen, Germany found no statistically significant reduction in injection -related abscesses.43 Health -Related Quality of Life No quantitative evidence directly measuring improvemen ts in the health -related quality of life was identified. One qualitative study on people living with HIV who use drugs at Dr. Peter Center in Vancouver, Canada described the positive impacts on quality of life, noting the contributions of increased access to social, health, and broader environmental support services that led to improvement in their overall health.44 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES7 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents Other Outcomes Use and/or more frequent use of S IFs is generally associated with a higher uptake or more rapid entry into treatment and recovery services.45,38,46-49 Frequent SIF use is also associated with facilitat ing access to health and other social services . A multi -country study in Europe reported an association between frequent supervised drug consumption facility use and a greater likelihood of accessing counseling services, medic al services , syringe exchange servic es, and education on safer use.50 A cross -sectional analysis in Denmark aligned with these results.51 One study that assessed cha nges in drug consumption associated with the use of SIFs reported no substantial differences in relapse rates for injection drug use or stopping drug use pre - and post -SIF opening.52 Community and Environmental Outcome s Among the fi ve studies that assessed the role of SIFs in addressing public drug use and syringe and paraphernalia disposal was an ecological study post -SIF opening in Vancouver Canada where statistically significant reductions in public injection drug us e were observe d. At the same facility, publicly discarded syringes and injection -related litter also reduced after SIF opening.53 A retrospective cohort study among 714 PWID attending a SIF reported that increased waiting time at the SIF resulted in an incr eased likeliho od of public injecting.54 In Sydney, Australia, a time -series study reported that after a SIF opened there was a perceived decline in the proportion of resident s and business owners witnessing public injections (19% vs 33%, p<0.001) and discarded syringes (40% vs of a SIF opening in Copenhagen ( Denmark) reported a 56% reduction in public injections as well as a significant improvement in safe syringe disposal.56 In contrast, over a three -month period a prospective cohort study from Essen (G ermany) reported no significant effect of a SIF on public drug use.43 In a study of DCRs in Denmark, 71% of users also noted that they chose the SIF for drug -use as they were conscious of public drug use bothering people in the neighborhood.51 We also identified six studies that assessed the association of the SIF opening on drug -related crime and/or neighborhood safety . Three studies conducted in Sydney, Australia con cluded that the opening of the SIF did not result in a significant increase or decrease in crime (i.e., theft, drug - related loitering, or robbery)57-59, but a slight increase in loitering around the SIF was observed.57 Similar observations were reported from Vancouver, Canada in an ecological (pre -post) study with no significant change s in robbery or drug trafficking60 and a decline in vehicle break -ins post -SIF opening. Two studies reported that among SIF users, frequent use of SIFs was not associated with crime or recent incarceration.61,62 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES8 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents Uncertainty and Controversies The available evidence about SI Fs comes from studies with cohort and cross -sectional design. It is difficult to establish temporality in some cases and make inferences about the causal association without a reference population or control group. Many community factors vary considera bly across cities in the world (e.g., background risk of bloodborne infection, community support, policing practices, access to primary medical care, treatment capacity and effectiveness), and the variance could impact the generalizability of findings. So me of the risks to generalizability are may be lessened by a real -world experience in Canada and Australia where SIFs have expanded to other cities. For example, a new SIF in North Richmond (Melbourne, Australia) replicated overdose mortality protection o bserved in Sydney. The recently published review report by the Victorian Government also notes reductions in public injecting and ambulance calls due to overdoses, but no improvement in perceived safety and drug - related nuisances. Our assessment of SIF effectiveness relies on many studies that are at least 10 years old. It is known that important community factors have changed since then, including global drug supply chains and user preferences. In some parts of the world, drugs typically injected are now being smoked; methamphetamines, for example, are replacing opioids. The increase in fentanyl additive s to heroin and/or cocaine has changed the mortality risk of an overdose during the past decade. The estimated mortality reduction of the SIF model s tudied a decade ago is based on the types and forms of drugs consumed at that time . Naloxone is more wide spread today, with police officers, paramedics, community members, and PWID and their allies all having it on hand in a variety of settings. It is un known how much of a community's overdose mortality can be reduced by a SIF versus expanded naloxone distri bution to high -risk people and their social networks. Experts described the importance of local community support, including law enforcement, to open and maintain a SIF, noting that support for a SIF can erode when proposals and implementation plans with s pecific locations are presented to community stakeholde rs. Summary and Comment The review and synthesis of included evidence have been organized to demonstrate the contribution of a SIF to individual and population -level outcomes. We did not identify an y RCTs and as such, have based comparisons of SIF vs SS P on evidence from the cohort, time -series, pre -post, and other observational studies. Given the available study designs from only a few communities, we recognize that differences between communities could impact generalizability. Moreover, our rating of the effectiveness of a SIF considers its operations in the context of other harm reduction strategies, such as SSPs, which were available to clients in the included studies. We believe that our \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES9 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return toTable of Contents focus on the incremental value of a SIF is appropriate since many communities today are exploring if a SIF fits within a broader portfolio of harm reduction and overdose prevention framework. We recognize that comparisons of SIF use versus no SIF, for which w e have relevant data, have shown incremental benefits. Evidence from both Vancouver and Sydney found a significant reduction in occurrences of nonfatal overdose and mortality from overdose in the SIF neighborhood and beyond. Furthermore, our research tea m has not uncovered any report of an overdose death at a SIF, bolstering our confidence in this outcome. SIFs have demonstrated an ability to assist clients with accessing medical, mental health, and social support services, including the use of addiction treatment services. The contribution of a SIF to bloo dborne infection control is less certain in terms of direct measurement of disease incidence, both due to variation in the baseline infection rates and the lack of incremental data compared with SSPs. We believe that unsafe injecting behaviors are an impo rtant and reasonable proxy for infection control since syringe sharing is implicated as primary infection source of new cases of HCV in the US. In at least some locations, SIFs appear to reduce public injection and, sometimes, syringe and injection litter. Finally, SIFs do not appear to be associated with changes in crime. Unlike a medication that can be manufactured reliably and administered consistently to deliver benefits to similar patients acro ss the world, how a SIF is implemented can impact indiv idual and community outcomes. The intervention development, including stakeholder engagement, contributes to results. Our overall assessment of the evidence does not consider the ease or difficulty a nother organization may have in setting up and running a SIF. We assume that planning, stakeholder engagement, and daily management can be executed similarly to that of organizations in Vancouver and Sydney to produce the reported results. On balance, we believe we have high certainty that, compared with SSPs , SIFs prevent overdose deaths. The degree to which overdose prevention translates to substantially lengthening the life of the individual is uncertain. The evidence on community overdose mortality f rom Marshall et al. 201112, provides moderate -quality evidence given the drop -off in effect over distance from the SIF, which is akin to a dose -response effect. This, too, provides moderate certa inty of a substantial benefit. We do not believe that possible harms which have been reported - some communities report increases in needle litter near a SIF - could reduce the net benefit below incremental. There is good reason to believe the net benefi t is substantial. Thus, we have concluded that there is high certainty that SIFs, compared with SSPs provide a sma ll, or substantial net health benefit , and moderate certainty that SIFs provide a substantial net health benefit, leading to a rating of \"inc remental or better\" ( B+). \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES10 Evidenc e Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Cost Effectiveness Overview The primary aim of this analysis was to estimate the cost effectiveness of SIFs for IDU among PWID using a cost -effectiveness analysis. The model compared SIFs SSPs, i.e., SIF+SSP, vs. SSP -only . Because SIFs are not funded by the health care system or payers of health care, the base -case analysis was a modified societal perspective and a one -year time horizon. Methods and Model Structure We developed a decision analytic model for this evaluation, with outcome calculations adapted from prior relevant economic models of harm reduction for PWID63-69 and informe d by interviews among key staff and researchers of SIFs. The model focused on communities of PWID, specified by parameters for individual US cities, who could potentially utilize SIFs in locations where SSPs already exist. We modeled costs and outcomes for Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Seattle, based on the prior existence of an SSP,70 US geographic location, and the availability of bro ad city -level estimates.

Key Model Assumptions Assumption Rationale Hypothetical legally -sanctioned SIFs in US cities are comparable to Insite (Vancouver, BC, Canada) in terms of effectiveness, services offered, and cost of living -adjusted operating costs. Insite is the first and most well -documented SIF in North America. The US cities modeled have a 0.25 -mile radius area within the city that could have 2100 PWID clients for a SIF. The Insite client -service rate is the basis for the healthcare resource use e ffectiveness estimates for SIFs in all modeled cities. Rates of HIV/hepatitis C/other in fections are equivalent between SIF+SSP and SSP -only. We recognize there is some evidence that SIFs may reduce needle sharing, leading to a reduction in infections. However, due to the short time horizon of our model (1 year) and the complexity of estimat ing the timing of infections and attributing costs to these conditions, we chose to take a conservative approach and not include these additional cost off -sets. We exp lored a difference in infection rates driven by a reduction in needle sharing conferred b y the SIF setting in a scenario analysis. We assumed that the rates of initiation and continuation of MAT are equivalent between clients using SIFs and SSPs. There is a lack of comparative data between these two services; however, stakeholders have indica ted that increased face -to-face time spent with PWID may lead to increased uptake of MAT. Therefore, we explored the impacts of marginal increases in MAT initiation d ue to SIFs in a scenario analysis.

We also performed four scenario analyses to evaluate the base case as sumptions around infection reduction, overdose rates, MAT uptake, and the perspective of the analysis . The results of these analyses are featured on pa ges 52-56 of the full report. Summary and Comment The costs of operating a SIF were estimated to be higher than operating an SSP across all six cities. However, those costs were offset by cost savings attributed to SIFs through the avoidance of ED visits and subsequent hospitalizations. Furthermore, in all six cities, SIFs were estimated to reduce mortality by avoiding overdose deaths. The model results were sensitive to several input parameters, which varied slightly across the six cities. The underlyin g community -level risk parameters of overdose and overdose mortality, along with the mortality risk reduction attributed to SIFs, were the most influential model parameters. Additionally, parameters that determined the number of injections occurring in SI Fs within each city also influenced the model esti mates. Potential Other Benefits and Contextual Considerations For some communities, the opening of a SIF reflects a philosophical shift in addressing substance use disorders as a health issue, rather than a criminal issue. SIFs serve marginalized, vulnera ble \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page ES17 Evidenc e Report - Supervised Injection Facilities populations that are disadvantaged or underserved . There are some potential other benefits offered by a SIF to the individual PWID , caregivers, the delivery system, other PWUD , or the public beyond wha t is described by the evidence on comparative clinical effectiveness . A summary of these potential other benefits is shown in the table below. Table ES11. Potential Other Benefits or Contextual Considerations Potential Other Benefit or Contex tual Consi deration Relevant Information Assumptions made in the base -case cost -effectiveness estimates rendering results overly optimistic or pessimistic. Most quantitative data that informed the economic model are derived from SIFs operating in only two c ommunitie s.

Introduction 1.1 Background National and Regional Epidemic The opioid overdose epidemic is d evastating families and communities across the United States (US) . Epidemiologic al studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have found that overall life expectancy of Americans has declined , and this decline was largely attribu ted to drug -related overdose deaths .1-3 Today in the US, overdoses are classified as the leading cause of injury -related death. Overall , drug overdose fataliti es decreased 4.1% 67,367 deaths 2017 and 2018 , and 69.5% involved an opioid 81 and the rest from cocaine or psychostimulants with abuse potential.2 However, o pioid -involved death rates during this period increased in a number of groups (those ages 65 and older , Hispanics, non-Hispanic Black s) and regions (West, Northeast). In the Northeast region, synthetic opioids other than methadone drove the annual increase, at 17.9% .81 The CDC viewed the epidemic of opioid fatalities as having happened in three distinct epi sodes.82 The first, which began in the 1990s, involved prescription opioids. Beginning in 2010, the second was marked by heroin -involved deaths. The current drivers of the epidemic are synthetic opioids such as fentan yl and fentanyl analogues , which are pushing mortality even higher. Opioid deaths attributable to synthetic opioids increased by 45.2% from 2016 to 2017.83 Other source s of drug overdose deaths may be emerging : from 2012 t o 2018, the age -adjusted death rate involving cocaine more than tripled , and overdose deaths involving psychostimulants (e.g., methamphetamine, amphetamine, and methylphenidate) increased nearly 5 -fold over the same period.2 A Public Health Approach The public health approach to addr essing the overdose epidemic is multi -faceted, involving a combination of policy, education, and commun ity interventions. A framework developed by the Association of State and Territorial Health Organizations (ASTHO) describes a cross -sector al response wi th four key strategy areas: (1) training and education; (2) monitoring and surveillance; (3) primary and overdose prevention; and (4) treatment, and harm reduction. For example, training and education of physicians and pharmacists can improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines for pain management and reduce the number of patients at risk for addiction and dependence .84 Expanding distribution channels of naloxone, an antidote for opioid overdose, can reduce rates of fatal overdose.81,85,86 For people who seek treatme nt or want to reduce frequency of opioid use , a variety of medication -assisted treatments (MAT s) are effective , a topic addressed by ICER assessments in 2014 and 2018 . The ASTHO framework recommends funding and implem enting \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 2 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents supervised injection facilities \u2014 also known as safer injection facilities, supervised consumption sites, or overdose prevention centers \u2014as a harm reduction strategy, noting the program is evidence -based for reducing fatal opioid overdose and enhanc ing access to primary health care.84 Harm Reduction Theory Harm reduction strategies seek to mitigate the harms of behaviors.4 Injury prevention policies (e.g., mandating seat belts, bicycle helmets, and child safety seats) are form s of harm reduction that are typically wid ely accepted .87 When harm reduction has been applied to substance use disorders, controversy has sometimes arisen because such strategies do not focus on preventi ng the use of drug s but rather on reducing the risk of such use.88 Harm reduction strategies (including improved access to naloxone , syringe service programs, drug checking services and supervised injection facilities) implement an alternative to the criminal ization and disease treatment models of drug use and addiction. While proponents of harm reduction theory recognize abstinence may be the ideal goal for some people , they accept alternatives which reduce the risk fo r death and disability even if they do not promote abstinence .5 Opponents of such strategies often focus on their potential to enable activities that are criminal or perceived as immoral .6 Naloxone Access Naloxone is an essential tool in responding to t he overdose crisis as it reverses an opioid overdose when or intramuscularly . Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is used a s an antidote to opioids when an overdose occurs. To be effective, it must be available at the time of overdos e.89 When naloxone is distributed widely in a community, it safely reduces overdose deaths in a cost -effective manner. We have not discovered objection to its adminis tration in response to an overdose , although there have been concerns about costs90 and encouragement of riskier behavio rs.91,92 Syringe service programs ( SSPs ) reduce harm by providing access to safer materials for drug injection (sterile syringes and needles ; clean water and other equipment ), and also safer disposal of contaminated equipment , and referrals to addictio n treatment services ; some also offer screening for bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis C , distribution of naloxone, safer sex products, and access to medical, mental health , and social support services .24 As with expanded naloxone distribution, a n SSP acknowledges injected drug use is occurring in a community and seeks to reduce harms associated with injecting beha viors. Using sterile equipment for every injection reduces risk for acquiring and transmitting bloodborne vir al infections such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.24 Because SSPs provide for disposal of contaminated equipment, the y have the potential to enhance the safety of the public and also first responders. Historically , SSPs have raised concerns among those who feel t hat harm reduction strategies expend resources that encourage \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 3 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents immoral or illegal behaviors.93 Thirty -eight states plus the District of Columbia have laws t hat enable and/or regulate SSPs , as of August 20 19.94 According to National Association of Syringe Exchange Network 's provider database , there are 444 SSPs operating in the United States today employing a variety of models, such as mobile, mail -order, and needle exchange .95 There are also unsanctioned SSP s that have been informally started by people who use drugs (PWUD) outside the restrictions imposed by some go vernments.93 The CDC recommends SSPs as an evidence -based program, summarizing the effectiveness in this way: \"Nearly 30 years of research has shown that co mprehensive SSPs are safe, effective, and cost saving , do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV, and other infections. Research shows that new users of SSPs are five times m ore likely to enter drug treatment and about three times more likely to stop using drugs than those who don't use the programs . SSPs that provide naloxone . SSPs prote ct the public and first responders by facilita ting the safe disposal of used needles and syringes.\"24 Drug Checking Services Drug checking services are another tool used to combat the overdose crisis . As the rate of illicit drugs containing highly potent opioids such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogues has increased , informing people about chemical composition can modify use behaviors, such as dose consumed, and reduce ove rdose risk .96 A variety of technologies exists for analyzing chemical composition, but little is known about optimal process and setting to impact outcomes .97 The public health impact of a drug checking service depends on the willingness of PWIDs to use it, and a wide range of willingness has been reported .98,99 Supervised Injection Facilities Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are permanent or mobil e facilities whe re people can inject drugs they have obtained elsewhere .7 If they permit use of drugs by routes other than injection (such as smoking or snorting), the more comprehensive term is \"supervised consumption sites\" (SCS). These facilities typically provide equipment to allow users to perform safe and sterile injection s while being monitored by trained medical staff who can treat overdoses with oxygen , naloxone , and/or other first -responder care.7 The sites may also have resources and information available fo r individuals seeking addiction treatment, primary health care, or social services. While SIF model implementation seems to v ary based on community needs, resources, and funding, interviews with stakeholders suggest that there are three core features: ste rile equipment, trained personnel for supervision, and naloxone administration (along with other first -responder medical care) . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 4 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents The following services may augment the core features: (1) self -management education for safer injecting practices, (2) screeni ng for soft tissue infections, (3) hepatitis C screening/treatment , (4) drug toxicity screening (e.g., fentanyl), ( 5) on-site detoxification, ( 6) access to MAT, ( 7) referral coordination for social support (e.g., housing), health care and mental health ser vices, ( 8) psychological/behavioral health counseling, ( 9) space for client relaxation and socialization, ( 10) personal hygien e supports (e.g., shower, laundry), ( 11) syringe service program (SSP) (e.g., needle exchange), ( 12) naloxone distribution, ( 13) space for consuming drugs by smoking, and ( 14) mobile unit to reach neighborhoods with high need.7-10 In the 1970s, The Netherlands established the first SIF model in Europe as part of a response to psychosocial needs of youth and their use of illegal drugs.100 The model adapted to the needs of people using drugs problematically by combining a drop -in meeting space for drug consumption with basic health (e.g., counseling, medical care) hygiene, (e.g., shower, laundry) and food resources. In the 1980s, SIFs were promoted across Europe with a goal of reducing both the harms of injecting drugs and the community effects of public injecting. Around the same time, the model was adopted in Switzerland for similar reasons and SIFs were implemented in Germany in the 199 0s and in Sydney, Australia in 2001.101 In 2003, Insite, the first legally -sanctioned SIF in North Americ a, opened in Vancouver, British Columbia's D owntown Eastside, a neighborhood w ith high rates of drug use, homelessness, and poverty.11 After 17 years of continuous operation, Vancouver has become an exemplar setting for researchers and policy advocates to understand the impact of the SIF model on a variety of outcomes, including the ones addressed in this ICER report. Currently , SIFs are available in 19 c ities across Canada.102 Currently in the US, t here are no legally sanctioned SIFs. Plans to open a SIF or initiate a multi - stakeholder planning process for a SIF have been announced by some cities . For example, the non - profit agency Safehouse has been engaged with the development of a SIF since January 2018 in Philadelphia, navigating th rough legal, policy and community supp ort issues.103 In 2019, the mayor of Somerville, a city in the Boston metropolitan area, stated plans to open a SIF in response to overdose deaths.104 There are news reports of elected officials or groups in New York City, Ithaca, Seattle, Denver, Washington DC, Chicago, Baltimore, Burlington, Oakland and San Francisco exploring feasibility, organizing coalitions, or prep aring legislation for SIFs.15-23 A recent letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine described the experiences of an unsanctioned SIF that has been operating in the US for six years .14 The clients of SIFs are usually homeless, l ive alone, or have significa nt housing insecurity. Unemployment is common. SIF clients are impacted by many social determinants of health . We spoke with a SIF client who described the people served by SIFs as \"poor, homeless, marginalized...a beat -down pe ople\" noting that he \"had given up on himself \" when he found harm reduction services. The prevalence of mental and behavioral health conditions is high among people who \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 5 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents inject drugs (PWID). Although SIFs are considered a type of public health interventio n, their population -level reach is measured in city blocks - not miles.12,13 It seems that a standalone SIF is generally able to address the needs of one ne ighborhood, as experts explained that PWID s are unable or unwilling to travel far for SIF services . Thus, location is an important attribute that determines whom a SIF serves as well as its potential public health impact . Even more than SSPs, the potenti al implementation of SIFs has raised objections from those who do not feel that facilitat ion (or direct observation) of drug consumption is appropriate for a health care or public health worker . Even among t hose who support harm reduction strategies, concerns may be raised about the effects on a neighborhood if PWID s are attracted and congregate. In 2000, a survey of 515 residents and 209 businesses near a planned SIF location in Sydney showed that 26% and 3 7% of respondents, respectively, disagreed with the establishment of the SIF. Disagreement waned two years after the SIF opened.105 Objectives The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the health and economic outcomes of a SIF. Th is review seeks to answer the question: What is the net health benefit of implementing a SIF (which includes a n SSP) versus an SSP alone ? The ICER value framework includes both quantit ative and qualitative comparisons across treatments to ensure that the full range of benefits and harms are considered in the judgments about the clinical and economic value. The assessment of effectiveness an d value is made in comparison to an SSP as we believe it unlikely that communities that have not been willing to implement SSPs would be willing to consider a SIF . A SIF implemented in a community without good SSP coverage may experience more than the inc remental benefit. 1.2 Scope of the Assessment Populations The population of focus for the review included all PWID living in an area with a ccess to an SSP and where a SIF could potentially be placed within a few blocks of where they reside. We also sought evidence on subpopulations suggested by the st akeholders, looking for evidence on the following subgroup effects: Housing status, comparing effects in people living with homelessness or unstable housing and those with stable housing Injected drug class, comparing effects in people who inject opioids w ith effects in people who inject stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 6 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Interventions The intervention of interest is the implementation of SIFs including sites that permit other forms of drug c onsumption. We assume that SIFs will include, at a minimum, three core features: sterile equipment, trained personnel for supervision, and naloxone administration (along with other first - responder medical care). We recognize that published data come from SIFs that offer additional resources and services to clients which may impact some of the individual and community outcomes of interest. Comparators We compare d SIFs to SSPs. Outcomes The outcomes of interest are described in the list below. Individual outcomes o Overdose Requiring EMS/ambulance or hospital care Mortality (occurring in or out of the facility) o All-cause mortality o Infection Chronic viral infection ( hepatitis C and HIV) Bacterial infection requiring hospitalization (e.g., antibiot ics, surgery , endocarditis ) Skin and soft tissue infection not req uiring hospitalization o Health -related quality of life o Intermediate outcomes Use of treatment and recovery support services Receipt of social (e.g., housing), primary medical care, dental and mental health services Injection behaviors (e.g., needle and syringe sharing) o Drug consumption (e.g., frequency, amount) Community and environmental outcomes o Syringe and paraphernalia disposal o Public drug use o Drug -related crime o Drug use prevalence Health system utilization o Hospitalizations \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 7 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents o Emergency department visits o EMT/paramedic calls/responses Timing Evidence on intervention effectiveness and safety has been collected from studies of any duration. Settings The setting of interest is community SIFs, whether they are affiliated with health centers and hospitals, and m obile SIFs, or not. Inpatient SIFs (i.e., located within hospital settings) are not part of the scope of this review. 1.3 Definitions Supervised Injection Facility (SIF) - The Drug Policy Alliance defines SIFs a s \"Legally sanctioned facilities that allow people to consume pre -obtained drugs under the supervision of trained staff and are designed to reduce the health and public order issues often associated with public drug consumption. They are also called overdose prevention sites (OPS) , safe or supervise d consumption services (SCS), and drug consumption rooms (DCR) .\"8 Syringe Service Programs (SSPs) - The CDC defines SSPs as \"Community -based prevention programs that provide access to or disposal of sterile syring es and injection equipment , access to substance use or addiction treatment s/services , health care and social services, vaccination, and testing service s.\"24 Medication Assisted Treatments (MAT) - The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration defines MAT as \"Use of medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a \"whole -patient \" appr oach to the treatment of substance use disorder .\"106 1.4 Potential Cost -Saving Measures in Opioid Use Disorder ICER now includes in its reports information on wasteful or lower -value services in the same clinical area that could be reduced or eliminated to create h eadroom in health care budgets for higher - value innovative services (for more information, see https://icer -review.org/final -vaf-2017 -2019/ ). These services are ones that would not be directl y affected by therapies for opioid use disorder (OUD ) (e.g., reduction in disability), as these services will be captured in the economic model. Rather, we are seeking services used in the current management of OUD beyond the potential offsets that arise from a new intervention. During stakeholder engagement and public comment periods, ICER encouraged all stakeholders to suggest services (including treatments and mechanisms of care) currently used for patients with OUD that could be reduced, eliminated, o r \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 8 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents made more efficient. We received a suggestion that advertis ing (e.g., billboards ) which promote s OUD treatment and other services for PWID may be a low value use of resources. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 9 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 2. Perspective of People Who Use Drugs 2.1 Methods During ICER's scoping and open input periods, we received public comment submissions from 4 stakeholders ( 1 SIF, 2 advocacy group s, and 1 clinical researcher ) and participated in conversations with 37 key informants and/or organizations (4 advocacy organizations, 6 SIF/SSP staff members , 23 researchers , 5 clinical experts , 1 law enforcement officer, 8 legislative/policy experts ). These comments and conversations helped us to discuss the impact on PWUD as described belo w. The ICER team also interviewed 11 clients /staff members of SIFs or SSPs that operate in Canada as government -approved safe consumption sites (SCS) or overdose prevention s ites (OPS) ; they were also affiliated with the Canadian Association of People Who Use Drugs (CAPUD) , the non-profit organization that assist ed ICER with interviews . The quotations that are integrated into the text below came directly from these interviews . 2.2 Impact on P eople Who Use Drugs Social Isolation The PWUD we interviewed affirmed that SIFs serve the most vulnerable and ma rginaliz ed people in a community , noting that m any PWUD live in social isolation due to housing insecurity , mental illness , and poverty . Through supervisory services , SIFs mitigate overdose risks associated with injecting alone , a common behavior among PWUD who d o not have access to a SIF . One stakeholder described the main task of a SIF as \"provid [ing] a place where people will be attracted to come and feel welcomed \" so they are not alone. In addition to time - critical first -responder care , SIFs serve as an acce ss point for people who are socially isolated to learn about community resource s and be linked to health and social services. \"Lots of people are dead because they overdosed in public alone with no help around them...I can think of 13 people who are still ali ve today because I was there to call 911 or seek help .\" - SCS Client \"To me, a lot of drug use is very rational...very rationale response to a society where mental health care is difficult to access.\" - OPS Staff Member and Client \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 10 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Camaraderie and Community Many PWUD and stakeholders described how the SIF had enabled build ing of relationships with staff and other regular clients . The SIF provides a comfortable, safe space for people to be their true selves and forge trust with others. The SIF was one of the only judgement -free zones available to PWUD who se lives are filled with discrimination , criminalizat ion, and trauma . They felt that SIFs contribute to positive changes in the community that stem from relationship -building among clients, harm reduction workers (e.g., nurses, technicians) , police , and even drug dealers . SIFs provide an \"opportunity to me et people in a positive way. ..and that is an i mmeasurable kind of benefit , in my opinion ,\" noted one former SIF client . One SIF administrator described the purpose of a SIF as \"being community space first, that happens to have clinical supports.\" Anoth er one described the \"living room effect\" of a SIF - providing a comfortable environment that can help reduce stress and reduce the need to self-soothe with drugs. One stakeholder pointed out that experience and research has demonstrated that PWIDs use SI Fs when they are available. Health Care System Bias We heard from some stakeholders that SIFs provide a way for PWUD to reduce interactions with hosp itals, doctors , and EMTs , during which they often felt there was frequent \"shaming and blaming\" and \"acc usations of drug -seeking\". Many PWUD relayed stories of stigmatization that compromised their physical and mental health , such as refusal of primary medical care for hepatitis treatment follow -up. Multiple people noted a la ck of respect by the health car e system for those who work in harm reduction (and their client s). A participant - who was a SIF client and worked for an SSP - found the health care system to be \"scary\" and distrusted doctors because of poor treatment in a hospital setting . Nurses and doctors at SCSs , however, were stated to be much more compassionate to the problems faced by clients . Another client noted that electronic health records assured PWUD are labeled \"junkie\" across the health care system , even before meeting a health care pr ovider . He and others felt that SIFs can offer a counterbalance to the bias of the health care system while provid ing health -related services valued by PWUD . \"PWUD don't have a lot of places they can go without being stigmatized, so it's so important to have a place you can go and be welcomed and use safely .\" - OPS Staff Member and Client \"Needle exchange programs, yeah, it's great, but it's a momentary interaction; they're not going to be there to save your life.\" - SCS Client \"Most interactions with pharmacists, doctors, lawyers...are all so stigmatizing. They make you feel kind of like a moral failure.\" - OPS Staff Member and Client \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 11 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Inhalation We heard from multiple stakeholders that changes in the drug supply and client preferences mean that SIFs must adapt and provide for the use of inhaled substances (not limited to opioids) , becoming more comprehensive SCSs . One person noted that smoking is on the rise now since people have learned how to get the same high with less need for the complexities of injecting . We heard that provision of supplies for smoking by one harm reduction program had quadrupled over the prior 18 months. One interviewee believed that technology (e.g., rapid negative pressure decontamination) could prote ct the staff if government leaders allowed the spending. Nearly every person we interviewed recommended that a space for smoking be included in a SIF because the strategy should focus on the person, not the drug. One stakeholder highlighted the racial di sparities in incarceration related to crack coc aine , which is primarily smoked, and recommended the provision of smoking facilities not only as a harm reduction practice, but also as a component of addressing structural racism in the United States. Testing New Batches or New Suppliers SIFs are used by some PWUD to test out new batches or drugs obtained from new suppliers. Several PWUD described how they use the SIF to check the potency of a new batch under the protection of supervision and resuscitation, i f needed. Depending on the degree of this p ractice in a community, there may be unmeasured value of a SIF related to particularly volatile periods of changes in the toxicity and potency of the drug supply chain. Pain Management We heard that PWUD are frequently dismissed as \"drug seeking addicts\" . Classism, racism , sexism, and homophobia can add to oppression and discrimination that PWUD already experience . However, one person noted that most people who inject or smoke drugs are managing significant physical and emotional pain caused by injury, occupation, sexual assault, or trauma . As opioid prescribing patterns of physicians have changed in recent years, many people have turned to heroin or crack for pain management . One woman noted that \" [her] doctor was more concerned about getting [her] off opiates than worrying about [her] pain .\" We even heard suggestions that SIFs are a safer option for people with \"legitimate pain, legitimate anxiety\" to self -manage , especially for the poor and marginalized \"who cannot even ask a hospital for the medications they actually need .\" \"Lot of this community with lived experience have been through some hard stuff that have gone unaddressed.\" - OPS/SCS Staff Member \"We heard loud and clear from PWUD; they did not w ant the SIF to be just for injection.\" - Public health agency professional \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 12 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Access to Treatment Multiple stakeholders described differences in the time and frequency of interactions with SIFs versus SSPs. In contrast to client interactions with SSPs that wer e described as \"transactional and hurried\" , SIFs have the potential to be more effective at introducing counseling intervention s through a community built on camaraderie . Frequency of engagement was noted as a good predictor for the degree to which people can transition into an engagement process for referral to treatment. A setting like a SIF where people may expect to use it more frequently will allow for more points of contact to accelerate tr ust-building with the program. We also heard, though, that there are many users of SSPs who have no interest in making use of SIF services. Relationships and counseling enable access to a variety of services, including MAT, when clients are ready. One SIF manager noted the staff are not curing people nor pretend ing to ; rather, they work to motivate people to find their way into wellness , which may or may not be abstinence -based treatment . A recovery specialist noted that SIFs are merely another interco nnecte d pathway to recovery (among many in a community ), and far \"better than a shooting gallery in an abandoned building where there is no opportunity for recovery .\" Several stakeholders noted that SIFs do not address the health care system capacity cons traints for treatment (e.g., new patients for MAT) , adding that referral s must be picked up in timely manner by compassionate, culturally -competent professionals who respect the client's goals . One person called out a paradox in the evidence, observing th at harm reduction programs must demonstrate an ability to get people into treatment, but treatment programs do not have to demonstrate ability to accept referrals from harm reduction programs. \"First of all, reach people...and look at what the ir individual goals are. You cannot treat everyone the same.\" - SIF Manager \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 13 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 2.3 Other Considerations Learning from Lived Experience Most people comment ed on how the best SIFs respect the exper tise of PWUD and include them in setting policies and operating the facility. One example involved how client input has adjusted the use of naloxone . Rapid, full -dose administration of naloxone eliminates the pain relief benefit and sends a client who is opioid -tolerant into withdrawal. While one SIF was \"too trigger happy with naloxone a few years back\", it now favors oxygen and micro -dosing of naloxone because it respected the expertise of PWU D. Honeypot Effect PWUD dismissed the possibility of a hon eypot effect in which a SIF attracted PWUD or crime to a neighborhood, noting the long -established poor conditions of neighborhoods where SIFs are generally located, and that SIFs serve people who live nearby. Many s takeholders agreed. One person from Va ncouver who had feared Insite would become a drug destination for people from other Canadian cities noted this has not happened and that \" people won't travel more than a few blocks\" to visit the SIF. However, PWUD and stakeholders acknowledged that oppos ition to SIFs, SSPs , and other forms of harm reduction can exist in a community due to fear, classism, moral objection to drug use, and societal failures to view addiction as a health care issue . We h eard from PWUD and stakeholders that drug use still happens just outside of SIF s and SSPs, and at least some community member s do complain about syringe/ needle debris . Medical versus Community Model For a long time , the \"nurse -centric Insite model \" was the only SIF model in practice, but a variety of models are now available across Canada. A few participants described how a simple first-aid model can be effective in preventing overdose mortality and suggest that the more expensive nurse - centric mod el may not always be needed. However, there was appreciation for the Insite model; one participant recommended that a city opening a SIF start with the Insite model and \" then work your way from there \", moving toward a less medical model over time . Integra ted Services Providing on -site access to social workers , frontline workers , or counselors was widely considered essential . Their e xperience suggest ed that most clients could not be easily referred to external \"I can attest that bedside care is really lacking from health care professionals, especially in emergency situations. People with lived experience are the experts.\" - OPS Staff M ember, Former Paramedic \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 14 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents counseling as they often would not accept another counselling cen ter for reasons such as distance , fears, and stigma . \"A simple consumption room is better than nothing but having a little bit of social support on -site is fantastic,\" explained a manager. The medical director of a new SIF that opened in 2019 explained how it was co -designed with PWUD as a mixe d service model and included a consulting area space (three private rooms) to offer low threshold, non -appointment - based support for health and social services. Experience there s uggests integration boosts service uptake in a PWUD population where referra ls to external services are less effective. Housing Security SIF clients are impacted by many social determinants of health, including housing security. A few stakeholders note d the clear limitations of a SIF to impact outcomes when the basic need for housing remained unaddressed. One stakeholder who worked in San Francisco described how the housing crisis there was linked to substance use. Any harm reduction strategy, includi ng a SIF, is affected by the housing policy and resources in the surrounding community . As one stakeholder said, \"m ortality is important , but mortality is connected to lack of housing and other issues \u2014 and SIFs cannot solve for that ...until housing is solved , a SIF can keep people alive and connect them to treatment, which has a d ramatic impact on mortality. \" Another stakeholder stated that stable housing is required for a PWID to ever improve quality of life. Traumatized by Public Drug Use There is a community -level trauma caused by public use as well as overdose. In many commu nities, PWUD inject in public spaces (e.g., parks, alleys ) but in a location that is discreet and hidden. They prefer to choose bathro oms of businesses because they have privacy (i.e., doors that close), soap, running water, and low chance of being caught by the police. Both locations can lead to trauma among people who witness the drug use or discover an overdose. SIFs offer a means t o prevent this form of community -level trauma if the SIF can operate at scale . An advocate for people with substance use disorder noted that harm reduction strategies are making drug use invisible in communities where there are enough services available by normalizing substance use and allowing people to access health and social services. Quality of life increased for the community due to decreased public drug use. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 15 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 3. Operational Guidelines 3.1 About Insite Insite : Supervised Consumption Site - Vancouver Coastal Health107 Insite wa s opened in 2003 in Vancouver, Canada as the first legal SIF in North America . The facility was founded in response to a large number of drug -related deaths occurring in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighborhood . Insite is co -managed by Vancouver Coasta l Health, a regional health authority providing health services, and the Portlan d Hotel Society (PHS) Community Services Society, a social services non -profit. Operating on a harm -reduction model, Insite works to mitigate the health and socioeconomic cons equences of drug use ; abstinence from drugs is not required to be connect ed to care. The model also provides care for those who use substance s and have medical or psycho logical needs including Hepatitis C , HIV/AID s, and psychiatric disorders . As a SIF, the site is accessible to anyone 16 years or older who injects drugs and wants a sterile and safe facility to do so ; it is open 7 days a week, 9AM to 3AM. Insite has a 12 -booth injection room where PWUD can inject drugs they bring with them and where th ey can be supervised by nurses and other health care staff. They have access to injection equipment including sterile syringes and clean cookers, filters, and water . In the event of an overdose, teams are available to intervene immediately providing medical support including naloxone when indicated . After injecting, clients move to a post -injection room where they are provided with drinks such as juice or coffee and space to spend time with staff in a comfortable environment. Wound care and immunizations are available from the medical staff which also coordinates referrals for medical, mental health , and social support services . Insite also has onsite services for withdrawal management (i.e., detoxification) on the second floor of the bu ilding, known as O nsite. Onsite has twelve detoxification rooms with private bathrooms and has h ealth care teams , doctors, nurses, counselors, and mental health workers . After clients are stabilized , they can move to transitional recovery housing located on the third floo r of the same building . There they can be connected to additional resources for housing, treatment programs, and community support . According to Insite's website, the facility sees an average of 415 visits a day and over 175,464 visits annually - as of 20 17. By March 2010, 7 years after their opening, there had been over 1.5 million visits. Many clients visit Insite multiple times ; clients average 11 visits per month. There have been no fatal overdoses at Insite and, compared wi th non -Insite -users, Insite users are more likely to engage in addiction treatment.107 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 16 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 3.2 About Unit ing Medically Supervised Injecting Centre Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Centre108-112 Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) opened in Kings Cross, Sydney, Australia in May of 20 01 and was the only SIF in Australia for 17 years before a second SIF opened in North Richmond, Melbourne in June 2018 . The facility was founded following suit of the opening of the Switzerland SIF in 1986 and was placed in Kings Cross due to the area having the highest concentration of people dying from drug overdose in Australia . Uniting MSIC remains the only SIF in the Southern hemispher e. Like the Insite SIF, Uniting MSIC work to minimize the harm associated with injecting drugs through their team of nurses, counselors, and health education professi ons. In their mission, they emphasize that they act to prevent injury and death by being present while someone injects rather than supporting and/or promoting drug use to provide immediate medical assistance if and when needed. Uniting MSIC is open Monday s and Wednesdays -Fridays from 9:30 AM-9:30 PM and Tuesdays from 9:30 AM-3:45 PM and 6:00 PM-9:30 PM. On weekends and public holidays, they are open from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. When visiting the SIF, clients first have access to the waiting room and assessme nt area . Once staff have a clear idea of their current situations and medical histories, they are invited into the injecting room that houses eight open booths fitting two people each . Those who visit must be 18 years or older, not intoxicated in the mom ent, and they cannot be pregnant or accompanied by a child . A registered nurse is always on duty and present . Uniting MSIC also functions as an SSP, provides advice on safer injecting practices, and also provides first aid and other health services . The facility does have a resuscitation room in the event of a drug overdose or ano ther health care emergency . After injecting, clients move into an after -care area until they are ready to leave . In this space, they can connect and talk with the health care team in an informal environment . Coffee and tea are availab le as well as healt h promoting activities and the ability to connect with medical, ps ychosocial, housing, rehabilitation, and legal services . Since opening in 2001, Uniting MSIC has supported over 16,500 clients, managed over 8,500 overdoses, and referred over 14,500 to further care and support - with 0 fatalities . Studies have shown that 70% of local businesses and 78% of local residents support the center . Uniting MSIC does not have an integrat ed detoxification program but rather refers clients who desire treatment for addiction, medical and mental health care, or social services support . Around 80% of Uniting MSIC's frequent clients ultimately accept referrals for these forms of treatment. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 17 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 4. Comparative Clinical Effectiveness 4.1 Overview In this review of the comparative clinical effectiveness of SIFs and other SCS, we systematically reviewed and synthesized existing evidence from available studies. Full PICOTS criteria are described in Chapter 1.2. Our review focused on the effectivene ss of the implementation of SIFs and other SCS in comparison to SSPs. We reviewed the benefits of SIFs important to PWID and sought evidence on all outcomes listed in Chapter 1. The methods and finding s of our review of the evidence are described in the sections that follow. 4.2 Methods Data Sources and Searches Procedures for the systematic literature review assessing the evidence on SIFs for PWID followed established best research methods.113,114 The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRI SMA) guidelines.115 These guidelines include a check list of 27 items, which are described further in Appendix Table A1. We searched MEDLINE, PsycIN FO, Web of Science , and EMBASE for relevant studies of SIFs through July 2020. Each search was limited to English -language studies of human subjects and exclud ed articles indexed as guidelines, letters, editorials, narrative reviews, case reports, or news items. We also searched for systematic reviews of SSPs in MEDLINE and PsycINFO through July 2020. All search strategies were generated utilizing the Populati on, Intervention, Comparator, and Study Design elements described previously. The proposed sear ch strategies included a combination of indexing terms (MeSH terms in MEDLINE and EMTREE terms in EMBASE) as well as free -text terms. To supplement the databas e searches, we performed manual checks of the reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews and invited key stakeholders to share references germane to the scope of this project. We also supplemented our review with information submitted by stakeholders, SIF/SCS evaluations or reports , and other grey literature when the evidence met ICER standards (for more information, see for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 18 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Study Selection After the removal of duplicate citations, references went through two levels of screening at both the abstract and full -text levels. Four reviewers independently scree ned the titles and abstracts of all publications identified using DistillerSR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada) and disagreements were resolved through consensus. Studies that did not meet PICOTS criteria were excluded. No evidence from randomized contr olled trial s (RCTs ) was identified . Relevant published high - quality cohort and other observational studies of any sample size or duration were included (see below for details on quality assessment) . Only studies that evaluated SIF use in association with the relevant outcomes of interest were included in this review . Further, w e recognize that a variety of SIF intervention models exist . We looked for studies of different forms of consumption (e.g., smoking) that expand on the SIF model . However, we did not identify any studies that c ompar ed different SIF models and forms of consumption (e.g., injecting vs smoking) in terms of outcomes of interest . A detailed protocol of the methods was registered on Prospero (CRD42020199977) . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Four reviewers extracted data into evidence tables. Extracted data were verified by another researc her. Elements included study name, study year, study design, location of the SIF, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, description of study populations, sample size, duration of follow -up, exposure, outcome assessments, findings, and quality assessment for each study. The report utilized the 12 -item and 14 -item study quality assessment criteria published by NHBLI for cohort, cross -sectional , and before -and-after (pre -post) studies, using the categories \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor.\"116 For more information on data extra ction and quality assessment, refer to Appendix D. Assessment of Level of Certainty in Evidence We u sed the ICER Evidence Rating Matrix to evaluate the level of certainty in the available evidence of a net health benefit among each of the intervention s of focus (see Appendix D 1).117,118 Assessment of Bi as It is customary at ICER to assess for publication bias as part of a review. We have no systemati c way to conduct such an assessment on this topic. Many published reports about SIF s are linked to those who provide the services . As such , apart from the greater perceived difficulty in publishing reports showing negative results, there may be a n additi onal preference to report favorable results . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 19 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Data Synthesis and Statistical Analyses Data for the available evidence on outcomes of interest are summarized in evidence tables (see Appendix D2) and are synthesized in the text on the following pages. Releva nt data include those listed in the data extraction section . Studies that were deemed sufficiently similar in terms of population, intervention type, and outcome definitions were included in the synthesis. Due to the unavailability of RCTs among PWID to assess the implementation of SIFs, we have summarized the best available evidence from a comparative cohort, experimental or pre -post , and other observational studies . Due to differences between the studies in terms of the study design, population charact eristics, and outcomes (including definitions and methods of a ssessments), we were unable to conduct a quantitative assessment . Hence, our review provides a narrative description of the outcomes of interest. 4.3 Results Study Selection Our literature sear ch identified a total of 1188 potentially relevant references for SIFs (see Appendix D2), and we included 48 studies that evaluated individual or community level outcomes for SIFs . The m ajority of studies evaluated SIFs from Canada (n=33), and the remaini ng studies evaluated SIFs in Australia (n=8) and European countries (n=7, including, two from Germany, three from Denmark, and two from Spain ). Eighteen studies used a cohort study design, while others employed a pre-post ecological or time series (n= 11), and cross -sectional study design (n= 10). Nine studies used a qualitative , exploratory, or descriptive study design . We also included government sanctioned evaluation reports from MSIC in Sydney , Australia, the MSIR in North Richmond Australia , and the SC Ss in Alberta, Canada . The primary reasons for study exclusion included outcomes that were outside the scope of this review, different study population s of interest, feasibility or mathematical simulation studies, or conference abstracts that reported dup licative data to the full publications. In the results that follow, we focus on the effectiveness and implementation of SIFs on individual -level outcomes, community and environmental outcomes, and health system utilization outcomes. We also searched for systematic reviews of SSPs and identified a total of 72 potentially relevant references . We included one review of reviews25 that summarized results from 13 p rior systematic reviews as well as three recent systematic reviews not included in the review of reviews.26-28 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 20 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Overview of Studies As mentioned previously , eviden ce for SIFs arises primarily from ongoing prospective cohort studies in Vancouver, Canada . The Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study ( VIDUS ), AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Access to Survival Services ( ACCESS ), and Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecti ng (SEOSI ) are among the longest -running community recruited prospective cohorts of PWUD (recruitment since May 1996) . In addition , data from cohorts enrolled from MSIC in Sydney and MSIR in North Richmond in Australia (SUPERMix cohort) have also been inc luded in this assessment . Overall, the included studies for SIFs were comparable with respect to age ( median: 30 years, range: 25-60) and gender (males >50%) . However, there was some variation in the exposure assessment based of the frequency of SIF use ranging from PWID who use a SIF v ersus do not use a SIF, frequent v ersu s rare/occasional use, PWI D administering 75% v ersus <75% of their injections in the SIF, or used the SIF at least once versus never during the study period. PWID experiencing unstable housing or homelessness also varied from country to country . Further, unstable housing or homele ssness was not reported consistently and ranged between 1 7%-82% across the studies . Additional details of included references, their key characteristics, and main findings are summarized in Appendix D2. To determine the incremental benefit of implement ing a SIF versus an SSP alone, we included systematic review s of SSPs as noted above to understand the effects of SSPs . The included systematic reviews evaluated the effect of SSPs on injection risk behaviors (IRBs), HIV, or HCV . We did not find evidence fr om systematic reviews on the effects of SSPs for other outcomes included in our scope (e.g., access to MAT, overdose mortality); therefore, we have limited our review of the evidence of SSPs to infection prevention. We acknowledge, however, SSPs have bene fits beyond infection prevention, as noted in the CDC summary in the background section , such as increasing the likelihood of entering treatment.119 However, the primary basis of our assessment of the incremental benefit of SIFs over pre -existing SSPs is derived from the stu dies evaluating the effects of SIFs as described above . We are assuming that PWI D had access to SSPs during the study period , and the outcome s associated with SIFs are informing the added benefits of SIFs over baseline SSP access . We acknowledge, however, that the proportion who utilized services from SSPs is unclear , although the literature has suggested a considerable proportion of PWID acce ss SSP s.120 Quality of Individual Studies We used the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute (NHBLI) criteria to rate the quality of the included evidence (see A ppendix D).116 For the cohort, and cross -sectional study designs, we used a 14-item NHBLI quality assessment invent ory. For the pre-post and time series studies, we used the 12-item NHBLI quality assessment inventory . The studies , \"fair\" , or \"poor .\" \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 21 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents These tools included items for evaluating potential flaws in study methods or implementation, includi ng sources of bias (e.g., population selection, performance, attrition, and detection), confounding, study power, the strength of causality in the association between interventions and outcomes, and other factors. We only rated the studies that were publi shed in peer -reviewed journals . We did not assign a quality rating to qualitative, exploratory, or descriptive studies . In addition, we did not assign quality ratings to references obtained from the grey literature (e.g. , evaluation reports ). Overall , the cohort and pre -post studies included in this review were rated good to fair; these studies had the least or some risk of bias but deemed not sufficient to invalidate its results . These studies considered some, but not all-important outcomes and used ac ceptable measures that were generally applied equally . On the other hand, all the cross -sectional studies were rated to be of fair to poor quality . Health -Related Quality of Life SIFs contribute towards a reduction in overdose -related events, infections, and other individual - level outcomes as discussed before. While we did not identify any quantitative evidence directly assessing these improvements in the health -related quality of life of PWID, these potentials for a SIF have been regarded to improve the quality of life of PWID. We identified one qualitative study on people living with HIV who use drugs at Dr. Peter Center in Vancouver, Canada. The study participants described the positive impacts of this harm reduction policy on their quality of life. The participants also mentioned increased access to social, health, and broader environmental support services that led to an improvement in their overall health .44 Clinical Benefits All-Cause Mortality There is an increased risk of premature mortality leading to a decrease in the life expectancy of PWID in the US.1,121 Beyond age 15, life expectancy in the US (1999 -2016) due to drug use was estimated to cost men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average.122 In Canada, premature mortality was 13 and 54 times higher among young men and women who inject drugs as compared to the general population.123 However, there is very limited evidence on the effect of SIFs on all - caus e mortality. One study conducted using data from two Canadian prospect ive cohorts reported that frequent use of SIFs was significantly associated with a lower risk of all -cause mortality (adjusted HR[aHR]: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26 -0.80, of the 811 SIF cli ents in the study was 22.7 deaths per 1000 person -years, which translates to 34 years (median, IQR 27 - 42) of potential life -years lost for the 13.8% who died during the study period.31 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 22 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Overdose Mortality within SIFs The published evidence on overdose mortality within the SIFs suggests that no client has ever experienced overdose death within the facility.29,30 In a qualitative study from Vancouver, clients reported that staff was available to rapidly respond to an overdose event, and injecting at a SIF in the presence of a nurse saved many lives that would have otherwise been lost.124 We also heard from multiple people who work at SIFs that they know of no episodes of a client dying at a SIF from an overdose . One stakeholder cited data from an unsanctioned SIF that operates at an undisclosed location in the United States.14 Many interviewees pointed to the increased risk of mortality associated with clients who live in isolation and therefore inject alone. Without a partner or observer, over doses that occur when injecting alone can have fatal consequences. Experts highl ighted how SIFs address a specific and large group of PWUD whose risk for overdose mortality is elevated due to social isolation. Overdose Mortality within Communities A po pulation -based study in Vancouver, Canada evaluated the effects of Insite on over dose mortality.12 Researchers assessed overdose mortality stratified by pre -and post -SIF within and beyond the 500 m area around the facility. The data were obtained from the British Columbia Coro ners Service's registry for deaths caused by overdose, before the opening of the SIF (January 2001 to September 2003) and after the opening of the SIF (September 21, 2003, to December 2005). The SIF opening was associated with a significant reduction of 3 5% in overdose mortality within 500 m of the facility ( absolute reduction in overdose mortality rates from 254 to 165 per 100,000 -PYs, rate difference (RD): 89 per 100,000 -PYs; 95% C I: 1.6 to 175.8, p=0.048), compared to a 9.3% decline in the rest of the c ity (Table 4.1; RD: 0.7, 95% CI: -1.3 to 2.7, p=0.49). The authors noted that most SIF users (70%) lived within four blocks of the facility.12 Table 4.1 Overdose Rates in the Vicinity of a SIF and Beyond (table adapted from Marshall et al. 2011)12 Overdoses within 500 m of SIF Overdoses farther than 500 m o f -SIF Pre-SIF Post -SIF 33 113 88 Overdose rate (95% CI) * 254 (187 to 320) 165 (108 to 221) 7.6 (6.2 to 9.0) 6.9 (5.5 to 8.4) Rate difference (95% CI)*; p value - 88.7 (1.6-176); p=0.048 p=0.490 Percentage reduction (95% 35.0% (0 .0 to 57.7) - 9.3% ( -19.8 to 31 .4) SIF: supervised injection facility, CI: confidence interval; Pre -SIF period= January 1, 2001 to September 20, 2003. Post -SIF period= September 21, 2003 to December 31, 2005 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 23 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents *Exp ressed in units of per 100,000 person -years Non -Fatal Overdose and Health Care Utilization for Overdose Non -fatal overdose events within a SIF have been captured by looking at events where SIF staff intervened by administering naloxone and/or oxygen or by calling EMS .32,33 We identified three studies that evaluated the effect of SIF use on non -fatal overdose a nd overdose requiring EMS, ambulance, or hospital care. A study from Insite from March 2004 to August 2005 found 285 unique users who experienced 3 36 non-fatal overdose events . Of these overdose events, 28% resulted in a transfer to hospital, and 27% resulted in the administration of naloxone.32 A recent time -series analysis of SIF user s at Insite reported that the overdose rate per 100 0 visits increased from 2010 to 2017 (1.5 vs 9.5, p<0.001) with an increase in overdose events requiring naloxone administration (48.4% to 57.1%, p<0.001) but no overdose deaths were reported within the fa cility.33 In a 2007 study by the New South Wales (NSW) Health D epartment in Sydney, Australia, opioid overdose -related ambulance calls were analyzed in Sydney over 36 months pre -SIF and 60 months post -SIF. The SIF opening was associated with a greater reduction in ambulance calls for opioid - related overdose events in the vicinity of the SIF compared to the rest of NSW (68% vs 61% decline , p=0.002).34 This effect was even higher during operating hours of the SIF (80% vs 60 % decline , p<0.001) . Changes in the Drug Supply and Injected Drug Class Changes in drug class and composition over time, especially a recent in crease in the presence of fentanyl or its analogs , have caused a huge public health burden by adding to the toll of overdose mortality.125 The latest reports from Insite suggest that atypical overdose pres entations (muscle rigidity, dyskinesia, or confusion) increased 23% of overdoses in 2015 to 41% in 2017 ; 15% of atypical overdoses required transportation to a hospital via ambulance.126 The authors felt that this increase might be caused by fentanyl contamination in the illicit drug supply. As noted previously , a recent time series analysis from Insite reported that overdose rates increased significantly for all drug categories. Also, the overdose rate associated with heroin increased fr om 2.7 per 1000 visits to 13 per 1000 visits over the study period. Compared to the baseline period, SIF users in the most recent period had 10.4 times the risk of overdose following cocaine consumption, 4.8 times the risk of overdose following heroin con sumption, and 2.5 times the risk of overdose following consumption of other opioids.33 Likewise, in Sydney, Australia, a retro spective clinical audit of MSIC (2012 -2015) reported that about 44 of 1000 injections contained fentanyl and with 4.4% of injections containing fentanyl resulted in an overdose . Further, f entanyl users were 2.2 to 8.0 times more likely to experience an \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 24 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents overdose than heroin and other prescrip tion opioid users (p<0.001).127 In Denmark during 2007 - 2014 a prospective analysis reported that there were 12.7 heroin overdoses per 1000 injections compared to 4.1 oxycodone over doses per 1000 injections .128 A stakeholder pointed to a 5 -year study of an unsanctioned SIF in the United States that documented a shift in types of d rugs injec ted -- from about 85% of injections being opioid only in 2014 to just 30% in 2019 when using a combination of o pioid and stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine ) became common.14 Other experts described substantial variation and changes in the drug supply chain by region (e.g., black tar, white powder, fentanyl), polydrug use, and smoked products as major issues when studying harm reduction strategies. In pursuit of identifying changes in drug supply tha t increase risk for overdose, SIFs have responded to changes in the drug supply chain by analyzing drug composition (e.g., fentan yl), using fentanyl testing strips and other devices such as mass spectrometers. Injection Risk Behaviors As noted earlier, injection drug use increases the risk of transmission of viral and bacterial infections. Reducing injection risk behaviors (IRB s) is important in reduc ing the risk of infectious disease transmission.35 1101 The evidence on the effect of SIFs on the incidence of infections over time is limited given the methodological challenges described previously.129,130 However, the effect of SIFs on reducing IRBs as well as increasing uptake of safer injection educ ation is well -established and serves as the primary basis of our evaluation of the effect of SIFs on infections. We identified seven studies that evaluated the effect of SIFs on reducing IRBs, including four studies from Vancouver and three studies from European countries (Denmark, Germany, and Spain ). Most studies reported SIF use was associated with a reduction in IRBs. A cross -sectional analysis of 431 PWID in Vancouver (data derived from VIDUS cohort) found that use of a SIF for all, most, or some injections compared to SIF use for no or few inje ctions was independently associated with reduced syringe 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11 to p=0.02).36 The authors found that the rates of syringe sha ring were similar in the two groups before the SI F opened, and differences only emerged after the SIF opened; this finding suggests that the observed association was not confounded by an inherently lower risk of syringe sharing among those who use d the SIF . Two cross -sectional studies among PWID attend ing Insite (SEOSI cohort) reported that more frequent SIF use was associated with reductions in IRBs. A study of 760 PWID found consistent SIF use (25% of injections) compared to inconsistent SIF use (<25 %) was positively associated with reductions in m any IRBs, including less reuse of syringes (aOR: 2.04; 95% to injection \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 25 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents (aOR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.83 to 3.86), and others.131 Another study of 582 PWID found exclusive SIF use (i.e., use of SIF for 100% of injections) compared to some SIF use was associated with reduced syringe sharing among HIV-negative individuals (OR: 0.14; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.78) but was not significantly associated with reduced syringe lending among HIV -positive individuals (OR: 0.94; 95% CI study of 1082 PWID found 75% of participants had perceived reductions in IRBs since the opening of the SIF. Amo ng those who reported perceived changes in IRBs, 80% reported reductions in rushed injections, 71% reported less outdoor injections, 56% reported less unsafe syringe disposal, and 37% reported u sing syringes less often.13 Of note, these three cross -sectional studies among PWID in the SEOSI cohort had overlapping study periods (Stolz: March '04 to October '04; Wood: July '04 December '03 to Sept ember '05) . We also identified three studies from European countries including Denmark, Germany, and Spain. A cross -sectional study of 41 PWID in Denmark found 7 6% of participants reported perceived reductions in IRBs since the opening of the SIF, includ ing less r ushed injections (63%), (56%), ceasing to share syringes (54%) , and cleaning injection site more often (44%).56 A prospective cohort study of 129 PWID in Germany fo und no cha nges in IRBs after three months of SIF use.43 A cross -sectional study of 249 young heroin users in Spain found SIF use was significantly associated with not borrowing used syringes (OR: 3.3 , 95% CI: 1.4 to 7.7); of note, 96% of participants report ed using a n SSP during the reference period.133 A meta -analysis combined results from three of the studies described above (Wood 2005, Kerr 2005, and Bravo 2009) and found SIF use was associa ted with a 69% reduction in the likelihood of syringe sharing (pooled effect: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17 to noted SIFs are eff ective in reducing IRBs by providing a clean, safe space to inject in a less rushed manner. They described an advantage SIFs have in education and supporting safer IRBs, attributable to the SIF's ability to build t rust and relationships with clients over time. In our review of SSPs, s ix of the thirteen systematic reviews included in the review of reviews examined IRBs, two of which performed meta -analyses. An earlier meta -analysis pooled results from 10 studies an d found SSPs reduced HIV risk behaviors ( weighted group mean effect size : 0.28; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.35).134 The other meta the effect of high SSP coverage plus opioid substitution treatment (OST) and found a reduced likelihood of syringe sharing (aOR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.83)41; of note, this review only included studies conducted in the UK and reported the effect of full harm reduction (i.e., high SSP coverage and OST) on IRBs as oppose d to the effect of just SSPs. The other reviews provided a qualitative synthesis that generally supported SSPs' reduction in IRBs. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 26 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Safer Injection Education We identified three studies that reported the uptake of safer injection educ ation (S IE) at SIF s. All studies were among PWID attending Insite (SEOSI cohort). One prospective study of 1087 PWID found frequent SIF use (75% of injections) compared to less frequent use (<75% of injections) was associated with an increased likelihoo d of receiving S IE in multivariate analyses (aOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.77),135 and -sectional study of 874 PWID found daily SIF use was marginally associated with receivin g SIE in univariate analyses (p=0.085) .136 Lastly, in one qualitative study, narratives from 50 participants showed the SIF allows participants to identify gaps in safer injection knowledge by providing targeted ed ucati onal messages and demonstrations of safer techniques as well as by promoting meaningful relationships with health care professionals. In addition, participants said the environment of the SIF incites safer injecting practices over time, including within a nd outside of the SIF.137 Infectio n Prevalence/Incidence We identified four studies that provided evidence on the effect of SIFs on infection incidence and prevalence, most of which were not designed to detect differences, specifically in rates of HIV or HCV. Viral Infections A cross -sectional study of 510 PWID who attended a SIF in Catalonia, Spain found that there were no significant differences in the prevalence of HIV or HCV among those who had frequent SIF attendance (i.e., daily), medium SIF attendance (i.e., > half of days), an d low SIF attendance (i.e., half of the days).38 In a qualitative study among 22 PWID and seven staff members at the Harm Reduction Room in the Dr. Peter Centre in V ancouver, staff members perceived that there was a reduction in infections that could be potentially attributed to having a safer place to inject and safer injection education.138 Much more extensive evidence exists for the effects of SSPs on viral infections. Nine of the thirteen systematic reviews included in reviews of reviews examined t he incidence of HIV, including one meta -analysis. The meta -analysis pooled results from 10 studies and found a trend towards a reduced risk of HIV transmission with SSPs, although the results were not significant (effect size: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.01).39 However, when pooling results from six higher -quality studies, a significant reduction was observed (effect size: 0.42; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.81). Other reviews provided a qualitative synthesis, and their conclusions generally supported the findings of th e meta -analysis. However, a more recent meta -analysis not included in the review of reviews found SSP use was associated with an increased risk of HIV seroconversion when pooling results from two studies (HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1).27 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 27 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Eight of the thirteen systematic reviews included in reviews of reviews examined the incidence of HCV, including two meta -analyses. One meta -analy sis pooled results from seven studies and found an increased risk of acquiring HCV with SSPs (RR: 1.62; was substantial heterogeneity (I2=81%), and the authors did not conduct any sensitivity or subgroup analyses. The authors noted that studies included in thei r analysis may have been affected by volunteer bias as SSPs may attract higher -risk PWID. The other meta -analysis included three studies conducted in the UK and found high SSP coverage was associated with a reduced risk of HCV transmission (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0. 93).41 The other systematic reviews provided a qualitative synthesis and results were mixed; these reviews also included many earlier studies th at were not included in the meta - analyses. We identified two meta -analyses published after the reviews of reviews that provide additional, recent context. A meta -analysis by Cochrane found a trend towards reduced risk of HCV with high SSP coverage, altho ugh the results significant (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.61); this analysis combined studies from North America and Europe , and there was high heterogeneity (I2=77%).28 When stratified by region, high SSP coverage in Europe was associated with a significant reduction in risk of HCV acquisition (RR: 0.24; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.62). Another meta -analysis analyzed results from studies reporting ORs and HRs separately and found no ass ociation when analyzing ORs (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.15) but an increased risk when analyzing HRs (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.03).26 There is continued uncertaint y from published research around SSPs' effects on viral infections although results are likely affected by selection biases, and we urge caution when interpreting these results. Expert stakeholders we interviewed felt that the infection control benefits o f SSPs are obvious and HIV and HCV incidence rates would rise quic kly if the service were removed from a community given the high -risk profiles of clients of SSPs . Experts pointed out that SIFs serve clients at even higher risk than SSPs. Stakeholders believed that SIFs play an important role in reducing the transmissi on of infections, but it is difficult to measure the impact due to variable baseline rates of HCV and HIV among PWID in different communities . Additionally, stakeholders noted that SIFs have been effective in referring clients to HCV treatment. Bacteria l Infections A prospective cohort of 1065 PWID attending Insite (SEOSI cohort) found the use of SIF for all injections versus some injections was associated with a decreased likelihood of de veloping a cutaneous injection -related infection ; in multivariate analyses, the aOR was 0.58 and was no longer statistically significant (95% CI: 0.29 to 1.19).42 A prospective cohort study of 129 PWID attending a DCF in Essen, Germany found no stati stically significant reduction in injection -related abscesses.43 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 28 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Stakeholders noted that SIFs can be effective in preventing bacterial infections such as endocarditis and can provide or encourage wound care. One expert noted that SIFs have an advantage ov er other harm reduction strategies in detecting and intervening early on common soft tissue disease. This advantage was attributed to the frequency that clients visit SIFs and how staff build relationships w ith clients that permit discussion and intervent ion to prevent serious wound infections. Health Care Utilization for Infections We identified two studies that provided evidence on the effect of SIFs on health care utilization for infections among PWID attending Insite (SEOSI). A prospective cohort stud y of 1083 PWID found that over a median follow -up of 21.4 months, 9% of participants were admitted to the hospital of whom 49% were admitted for CIRI or complications.139 In multivariate analysis, referral to the hospital by a SIF nurse was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization for CIRI (aOR: 5.38; 95% CI: 3.39, 8.55). Participants referred to the hospital by a SIF nurse had shorter hospi tal stays compared to those who were not referred by a SIF nurse (4 days [IQR: 2 -7] vs 12 days [IQR: 5 -33], p=0.001 after adjustment). A similar analysis of 1083 PWID found that over a median follow -up of 18.6 months, 27% of participants visi ted the ED for a CIRI. Referral by a SIF nurse was significantly associated with ED use for CIRI among females (aHR: 4.48; 95% CI: 2.76 males (aHR: 2.97; 95%CI: 1.93 to 4.57).140 Hospitalization for bacterial infections including endocarditis have not been reported directl y in studies that assessed the effect of SIF use on health care utilization for infections . However, a comment received du ring the public review period noted the large scale of infections and the burden placed on the healthcare system. I t is estimated th at anywhere between 5% and 20% of people who inject drugs (PWID) have had infective endocarditis and related hospitalizatio ns increased between 2000 and 2013, especially for young adults.141 Intermediate Outcomes Uptake of Services SIFs may facilitate access to various services programs for PWID and in turn enable them to access and utilize services like treatment and recovery, health, and social services. Treatment and Recovery Support Services We identified six studies that assessed the i mpact of SIF s on treatment and recovery support services. Across studies, the use of SIF s was associated with a higher uptake of treatment and recovery services. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 29 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents A recent two -year prospective assessment of Insite reported that 11.2% of clients were enroll ed in the co -located detoxification services at lea st once and frequent SIF users were more likely to enroll and use this service compared to non -frequent (less than once per week ) users (aOR:8.15, 95% CI: 5.38 -12.34, p<0.001).45 SEOSI cohort reported asso ciations between SIF use and rate of rapid entry into the detoxification treat ment or service . In these overlapping analyses, SIF use and contact with an addiction counselor led to a significant increase in detoxification uptake , resulting in rapid entry into meth adone maintenance treatment .46-48 A prospective study found that weekly SIF use was positively associated with enrollment in addiction treatment and increased likelihood of injection cessation.47 In Sydney Australia, a prospective study from 2001 -2002 reported that frequent use of an SCS was positively associated with receiving a referral to a detoxification program ( aOR:1.6, 95% CI: 1.2 - 2.2).49 Similar findings were reported from Catalonia (Spain), with PWID who utilized a SIF having a significantly higher likelihood of accessing drug dependence services ( aOR: 2.12, 95% C I: 1.18 - 3.81).38 Health and Social Services We identified seven studies that assessed the impact of SIF s on health and social services. Broadly, across studies, t he use of SIF was associated with increased access to health and social services . As de scribed previously, PWID in Vancouver with cutaneous injection -related infection s when referred by SIF nurse to the hospital w as associated with an increased likelihood of admission resulting in a decrease in the average length of stay by 8 days .139 Across studies, higher use of ancillary services has also been reported f or PWID who utilized SIF frequently compared to those who used them occasionally or rarely. A multi -country study in Europe reported an association betw een frequent supervised drug consumption facility use (compared with occasional or rare use) and a grea ter likelihood of accessing counseling services (46% vs 35% and 25%; use vs 3% and 3%, p<0.05) .50 A cross -sectional analysis in Denmark also reported that clients who used the facility frequently were more than twice as likely to receive treatment for an acute health condition compared to non -users.51 These observations are in line with the qualitative and explorat ory evidence where SIF users have reported greater access to care and treatment with fewer structural and soc ial barriers as a result o f services being provided at one accessible location.50,51,142 In a study from Dr. Peters Centre, Vancouver , PWID who were HIV positive highlighted that they felt comfortable discuss ing their drug use and health needs with the staff. They also noted that the harm reduction approach used at DPC \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 30 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents led to an increase in access to health care services including palliative and supportive care .44 Likewise, qualitative e vidence collected from 50 in -depth interviews indicated that SIF use facilitates access to care, although a minority of participants expressed otherwise. The PWID described that having on-site nurses at a SIF helped in providing assessment and care for injection -related infections as well as facilitating access to off-site health care services .143,144 Expert stakeholders felt that access to treatment , social services, recovery services, and referrals is important to SIF users . They also felt that allowing people an opportunity to enroll in treatment services reduces mortality . However, agreeing to enroll in MAT or other addiction treatment service s can take time and m ay depend on the client's comfort and trust in the facility . In cases where people visit SIFs frequently, the relationship can be fostered by providing more points of contact and a stress -free and safe environment for clients. Drug Consumption (e.g., fre quency and amount) We only identified one study that assessed changes in drug consumption associated with the use of SIFs. A pre-post study from Vancouver reported no substantial differences in relapse rates for injection drug use or stopping drug use pre - and post -SIF opening . The authors acknowledge d that there was an increase in smoking crack after SIF opening but it is unlikely that the facility which does not allow smoking could have prompted this change.52 Community and Environmental Outcomes Some of the key concerns regarding the impl ementation of SIFs relate to community and environmental issues including public drug use, syringe and paraphernalia disposal, and drug - related crime. Public Drug Use and Syringe or Paraphernali a Disposal Five studies assessed the role of SIF s in addressing public drug use and syringe and paraphernalia disposal associated with injection drug use. An ecological study post -SIF opening in Vancouver Canada reported statistically significant reducti ons in public injection drug use ( measured by researcher counts ), compared to pre -SIF opening (daily mean: 4.3 vs 2.4, p<0.001) . At the same facility, publicly discarded syringes ( daily mean: 11.5 vs 5.4, p<0.05) ed after SIF opening . These declines were independent of police presence and weather conditions .53 A retrospective cohort study among 714 PWID attending a SIF reported that increased waiting time at the SIF resulted in an increased likelihood of public injecting (aOR: 3.26, 95% CI: 2.11 -5.6, p<0.001) .54 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 31 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents In Sydney, Australia, a time -series study reported that after a SIF opened the re was a perceived decline in the proportion of residents and business owners witnessing public injections ( 19% vs A study of a SIF opening in Copenhag en (Denmark) reported a 56% reduction in public injections as well as a significant improvement in safe syringe disposal ( 59%, p <0.001).56 In contr ast, over a three -month period a prospective cohort study from Essen (Germany) reported no significant effect of a SIF on public drug use.43 In a study of DCR s in Denmark, 71% of users also noted that they chose the SIF for drug -use as they were conscious of public drug use bothering people in the neighborhood .51 Drug -Related Crime An important aspect of harm reduction with SIFs is promoting (or at least not worsening) neighborhood safety . We identified six studies that assessed th e association of the SIF opening on drug -related crime and/ or neighborhood safety. Three studies conducted in Sydney, Australia reported that opening of the SIF did not result in a significant increase or decrease in crime (i.e., theft, drug -related loitering, or robbery) .57-59 After the opening of the SIF, a slight increase w as reported for overall loitering at the front and back of the SIF.57 Additionally, a prospective study conducted from 1999 to 2010 reported a significant decline in robber y and property offenses both in the vicinity of the SIF and across the city. Of note, the rates of drug -related crimes declined between 1999 to 2003 a nd then remained constant until the end of the study period . However, the authors found no association of the SIF ( Sydney MSIC) with robbery, property crime , or drug offenses .58 In contrast , a separate pre-post study in 2013 reported a decline in robbery or thefts in the neighborhood after the SIF was opened.59 This study also found that b etween 2001 -2008, possession of illicit substances remained stable while increases were reported both in the SIF neighborhood and citywide from 20 09 onwards. Similar observations were r eported from Vancouver, Canada in an ecological (pre -post) study with no significant changes in robbery or drug trafficking.60 However, compared to the pre-SIF opening, a decline in vehicle break -ins (302 vs 227, p<0.001) was observed post -SIF opening . Two studies \u2014 one prospective cohort and another a time -series analys is\u2014also reported that among SIF users, frequent use of SIF s was not associated with crime or recent incarceration .61,62 The presence of and interactions with law enforcement may have affected the estimates but were not accounted for in these studies . However, studies do not appear to show an incre ase in crime when a SIF is opened . Furthermore, t he evidence on drug -related crime is in line with observations shared by the expert s during interviews. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 32 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Government Sanctioned Evaluation Reports for SIFs Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) Sydney, Australia In May 2001, Uniting MSIC was established in Kings Cross, Sydney under a license issued by the government of New South Wales (NSW) . A first evaluation report was published in 2003 to cover the first 18 months of operation.145 In response to the evaluation results, the operation license was then extended . A second set of evaluation reports was then commissioned by the NSW government146-149 that assess ed the impact of Uniting MSIC on a range of individual outcomes (e.g., overdose) and community outcomes (e.g., syringe and needle disposal ). A total of 9778 PWID used this SIF from May 2001 to April 2007, a majority of whom were male (70%) with a mean age of 33 years . About 40% of SIF users injected daily , and 24% were living in unstable housing . The most injected drugs on -site were heroin (62%), other opioids (12%), cocaine (14%), and meth/amphetamines (6%). the SIF managed 2,106 overdose -related events on -site, without a single death within the facility . Between May 1998 (pre-SIF) and April 2006 (post -SIF), a significant decline in overdose mortality was reported both in proximity to the SIF (mean: 4 vs 1 death per month, p<0.001) as well as in the rest of the city (mean: 27 vs 8 deaths per month, p<0.001) . A decline in mean monthly ambulance attendances was reported near the SIF , compared to the rest of the city vs 68% mon thly ambulance attendances , p=0.002); the percentage decline was reported to be higher during operational hours of the SIF . After the SIF opening, a 35% reduction was reported for average monthly opioid poisoning presentation at the ED compared to before the SIF opening ( 11 vs 7, p<0.01). In addition, there was a downward trend in reporting public injecting among SIF users between 2001 -2004 as well as in witnessing public injecting among residents and business operators between 2000 -2005 . In addition, resident s and business operators also reported seeing less discarded syringe in the past month between 200 0-2005. The monthly totals of discarded needles and syringes collected locally signaled about a 50% decrease in syringe litter following the establishment of the SIF; this was sustained between May 2001- April 2007 . Medically Supervised Injection Room in North Richmon d, Australia In October 2017, the Victoria n government announced a two -year trial (June 2018 to June 2020) of a Medically Supervised Injection Room (MSIR ) in North Richmond , Australia , with the possibility of a trial extension . An independent review panel evaluate d the impact of the SIF during the first 18 months of the tria l, and a report was published in June 2020 .150 During the first 18 months, almost 4,000 people visited the SIF; the average age of the clients was 41 ye ars and 35% were living with homelessness or insecure accommodation . There were 116,802 supervised injections (96.6% involving heroin) , 2,657 overdoses, and no deaths within the facility . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 33 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Ambulance calls involving naloxone reduced by 25% within 1 kilomete r after the SIF opened ; the decline was even greater during hours of SIF operation , with a reduction of 36%.150 There was a decrease in the proportion of residents and business respondents report ing they had seen public injections since the SIF opened (p<0.05 for both groups ). There was no change in the proportions of residents repor ting they had seen discarded syringes or needles , but there was an increase among business respondents) . There was an increase in the number of syringes and needles collected after the SIF opened, but there were also increased collection efforts during th e last eight months of the trial.150 The number and types of offenses within 1 ki lometer of the SIF generally remained stable between 2014 to 2019, except for drug use and drug possession offenses . Victoria police members reported seeing more buying and selling of drugs and people who appeared to be under the influence . Victoria poli ce also reported that crime near the facility was largely attributable to local crime trends that were not connected to the MSIR trial.150 Supervised Consumptions Services in Alberta, Canada In 2019, the Alberta government froze the funding for new SCSs and reviewed the socioeconomic impacts of existing and proposed SCSs . A review c ommittee conducted public consultations and a review of qualitative and quantitative data and a report was published in March 2020 .151 There were seven established SCSs in Alberta at the time of the review - four in Edmonton, one in Calgary, one in Lethbridge, and one in Grande Prairie . Most sites had been operating for more than 12 months . The imp act of the SCSs was generally assessed within 250 to 500 meters of the SCSs in this review . The report found there was a 64% increase in all drug and alcohol poisoning deaths within 500 meters of the SCSs compared to a 30% increase in the 501 to 2000 meter zone outside the SCSs ; the committee noted these d eaths were predominantly related to opioid s. However, the review committee acknowledge d the role of SIFs and other SCSs in saving lives . In addition, there was a 74% increase in total opioid -related EMS respon ses within 500 m eters of the SCSs . In the com parison zone beyond 500 m eters , an average 11% decline was reported . Additionally, police calls for service (a proxy for crime in their review ) had generally increased in the immediate vicinities around the Ca lgary, Lethbridge, and Grande Prairie sites bu t not around the four Edmonton sites .151 More than 16,000 Alberta residents completed an online survey about their perceptions of the SCSs in their communities . The primary complaint by residents was around needle debris . Residents noted an increase in seeing need les and other dr ug-related paraphernalia discarded in the vicinity of the SCSs . In addition, residents noted concerns around public safe ty, seeing people who \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 34 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents appeared under the influence , and general social disorder.151 Of note, the report did not specifically include feedback from clients of these SCSs or the personnel who worked there. At least some experts and researchers have expressed serious concerns with the methods used in this report , including but not limited to the lack of statistical significance testing and adjustment for potential confo unders , and have called for it to be retracted .152 Heterogeneity and Subgro ups Unstable Housing The ra tes of people living with homelessness or unstable housing in the included studies varies by region with ranges from 17% to 82% , that causes an increased public health burden .53,55 People living with homelessness or in unstable housing experience multiple barriers in accessing health and social services especially a safe place to inject .153 Although a considerable proportion of SIF users in studies were experiencing homelessness or living in an unstable housing , we identif ied few studies that reported results for outcomes of interest stratified by this sub -group. In a prospective study from Insite , SIF users experiencing homelessness had a higher likelihood of entry into detoxification program (aHR: 1.42 , 95% CI: 1.06 -1.90, p =0.019) , to th ose who were not.48 However, a nother prospective study from Insite Vancouver, Canada reported that SIF users experiencing homelessness had a higher likelihood of not being able to access addiction treatment (aOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09 -1.98, p =0.011) .154 SIF users living in unstable housing were more likely to receive CIRI care (aHR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.02 -1.88 , compared to those with stable housing.155 A study from Insite suggests that homelessness increase s the likelihood of injecting in public even among SIF users (aOR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.46 -6.58, p<0.001) .54 Uncertainty and Controversies Resear ch Methods The available evidence about SIFs comes from studies with cohort and cross -sectional design. It is difficult to establish temporality in some cases and make inferences about the causal association without a reference popu lation or control group . Generalizability Many community factors vary considerably across cities in the world (e.g., backg round risk of bloodborne infection, community support , policing practices, access to primary medical care , treatment capacity and effectiveness ), and the variance could impact the generalizability of \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 35 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents findings . Some of the risk s to generalizability are may be lessened by a real-world experience in Canada and Australia where SIFs have expanded to other cities. For example, a new SIF i n North Richmond (Melbourne , Australia) replicated overdose mortality protection observed in Sydney . The recently published review report by the Victorian Government also notes reductions in public injecting and ambulance calls due to overdoses, but no im provement in perceived safety and drug - related nuisances. Changes in Drug Supply Our assessment of SIF effectiveness relies on many studies that are at least 10 years old. It is known that important community factors have changed since then, including global drug supply chains and user preferences. In some parts of the world, drugs typically injected are now being smoked; methamphetamines , for example, are replacing opioids. The increase in fentanyl additives to heroin and/or cocaine has changed the mortality risk of an overdose during the past decade. The estimated mortality reduct ion of the SIF model studied a decade ago is based on the type s and form s of drugs consumed at that time. Frequency of SIF Use Although published studies report a range of utilization statistics (e.g., percentage of injections per month occurring at a SIF), uncertainty remains about the relationship between SIF visit frequency and effectiveness. It is reasonable to assume that a dose -response curve exists, especially for overdose mortality reduction. It is unknown what level of SIF utilization is required to achieve results for infection control, all -cause mortality, and overdose mortality . Widespread Access to Naloxone Naloxone is more widespread today, with police offic ers, paramedics, community members, and PWID and their allies all having it on hand in a variety of settings. It is unknown how much of a community's overdose mortality can be reduced by a SIF versus expanded naloxone distribution to high -risk people and their social networks. Community Support Experts described the importance of local c ommunity support , including law enforcement, to open and maintain a SIF , noting that support for a SIF can erode whe n proposals and implementation plans with specific loca tions are presented to community stakeholders . While there is no apparent evidence that SIFs attract more PWI D or drug -related activity to a neighborhood, uncertainty remains , and concerns over local health and safety might diminish support which could, i n turn, decrease the effectiveness of a given SIF . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 36 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Law Enforcement The contribution of law enforcement to a S IF's effectiveness is unknown . Interviews with experts pointed to the importance of collaboration with local law enforcement to assure clients c ould enter and exit the SIF without being intimidated or arrested by police officers . The data from Vancouver originated from a pilot study that was supported by the police department as well as city government officials .156 One ethnogr aphic study described the how the increased police presence in the neighborhood of a SIF intimidate d clients - forcing some to continuously navigate the risks of arrest or overdosing alone, especially clients who have outstanding warrant s.157 The ability of a SIF to reach PWID, cultivate support from the broader community, and deliver results (individual and community -level outcomes) may depend on its level of colla boration with the police. Notwithstanding state and federal legal issues, the controversy with and for law enforcement involves a concern that SIFs give people the green light to use drugs illegally. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 37 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 4.4 Summary and Comment Figure 4.1.

We did not identify any RCTs and as such, have based comparisons of SIF v s SSP on evidence from the cohort, time -series, pre -post , and other observational studies. Our research process also included interviews with 37 experts , including 11 PWID, who provided anecdotes and helped build the frame work of outcomes to investigate . Given the available study designs from only a few communities , we recognize that differen ces between communities could impact generalizability. Moreover, our rating of the effectiveness of a SIF considers its operations in the context of other harm reduc tion strategies, such as SSPs , which were available to clients in the included studies . We believe that our focus on the incremental value of a SIF is appropriate since many communities today are exploring if a SIF fits within a broader portfolio of harm reduction and overdose prevention framework. We produced a single evidence rating using the ICER Evidence Rating Matrix (Figure 4.1) , considering the effectiveness of a SIF in addressing the public health challenges of injection drug use. We recognize t hat comparisons of SIF use versus no SIF, for whi ch we have relevant data, have shown incremental benefits. Evidence from both Vancouver and Sydney found a significant reduction in occurrences of nonfatal overdose and mortality from overdose in the SIF ne ighborhood and beyond . Furthermore, o ur research team has not uncovered any report of an overdose death at a SIF , bolstering our confidence in this outcome . SIFs have demonstrated an ability to assist clients with accessing medical , mental health , and social support services , including the use of addiction treatment services. The contribution of a SIF to bloodborne infection control is less certain in terms of direct measurement of disease incidence , both due to variation in the baseline infection rates and the lack of incremental data comp ared with SSPs . SIFs do reach a population that is known to be at high risk for transmission of serious infectious diseases such as HIV and HCV , and the available evidence demonstrates improvements in injection behavio rs; these improvements would be expected to reduce disease transmission . We believe that unsafe injecting behaviors are an important and reasonable proxy for infection control since syringe sharing is implicated as primary infection source of new cases of HCV in the US. In at least some locations, SIFs appear to reduce public injection and, sometimes, syringe and injection litter. Finally, SIFs do not appear to be associated with changes in crime. Unlike a medication that can be manufactured reliably and administered consistently to deliver benefits to similar patients across the world , how a SIF is implemented can impact individual and community outcomes. The intervention development , including stakeholder engagement, contributes to results. Our overall assessment of the evidence does not consider the ease or difficulty another organization may have in setting up and running a SIF. We assume that planning, stakeholder engagement , and daily management can be executed similarly to that of organization s in Vancouver and Sydney to produce the reported results . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 39 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents On balance, we believe we have high certainty that, compared with SSPs, SIFs prevent overdose deaths. The degree to which overdose prevention translates to substantial ly lengthen ing the life of the individual is uncertain . The evidence on community overdose mortality from Marshall et al. 201112, provides moderate -quality evidence given the drop -off in effect over distance from the SIF, which is akin to a dose -response effect. This, too, provide s moderate certainty of a substantial bene fit. We do not believe that possible harms which have been reported - some communities report increases in needle litter near a SIF - could reduce the net benefit below incremental . There is good reason to believe the net benefit is substantial. Thus , we have concluded that there is high certainty that SIFs , compared with SSPs provide a small, or substantial net health benefit , and moderate certainty that SIFs provide a substantial net health benefit , leading to a rating of \"incremen tal or better\" ( B+). \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 40 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 5. Cost Effectiveness 5.1 Overview The primary aim of this analysis was to estimate the cost effectiveness of SIFs for IDU among PWID using a cost -effec tiveness analysis. The model compare d SIFs to SSPs, which may provide a multi - day or multi -week supply of clean needles and syringes to PWID or provide one -to-one exchanges for contaminated products.158 Because SIFs are not funded by the health care system or payers of health care, the base -case an alysis was a modified societal perspective and a one -year time horizon. We also consider ed a health care payer perspective as a scenario analysis. The model was developed in Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae for Offi ce 365 (Version 2005). 5.2 Methods We developed a dec ision analytic model for this evaluation, with outcome calculations adapted from prior relevant economic models of harm reduction for PWID63-69 and informed by i nterviews among key staff and researchers of SIFs. The model focus ed on communit ies of PWID, specified by parameters for individual US cities, who could potentially utilize SIFs in locations where SSPs already exist, i.e., SSP -only. We calcu lated each setting's outcomes over one year, based on published data and observations in prior published economic models. The model did not track a single PWID cohort over time; rather, a population of PWID within a given community was estimated based on available data for each location and then outcomes for each community were calculated per year. The costs and outcomes were then summe d over the one -year time horizon. We model ed six different US cities, based on local parameters, in order to develop a t ool that may be customized to provide cost -effectiveness estimates for any US city given the appropriate data. Model Structure PWID within a given community entered the model in either the SIF+SSP (i.e., post-SIF) or SSP -only (i.e., pre-SIF) arm (Figure 5. 1). Among the total population of PWID, the number of post -SIF injections/month was calculated (A); all pre -SIF injections wer e assumed to occur without availability of a SIF (B). For PWID who overdose (A1), we calculated the proportions that require amb ulance utilization and emergency department (ED) visits . We also calculated PWID who are on (A2) or not on (A3) medication -assisted treatment (MAT) ; among PWID who are already on MAT, we calculate d the proportion per year who successfully stay on treatmen t. Among PWID who are not on MAT, we calculate d the proportion per year who start it. MAT uptake and success ra tes were assumed to be equivalent between comparators in the base case, but increased MAT uptake and \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 41 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents success rates due to a SIF were explored i n a scenario analysis. These same outcomes were calculated for B 1-3 and totals for a given community were estima ted and compared . Community overdose mortality (C) was estimated based on the proportion of injections in the SIF, applying a risk reduction e stimate described below. Figure 5.1. Model Framework ED: emergency department, MAT: medication -assisted treatment, PWID: people who drugs , SIF: supervised injection facilities , SSP: syringe service program Locations The populations of focus for th e economic evaluation included PWID at various locations in the US . We modeled cost s and outco mes for Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Seattle , based on the prior existence of a n SSP,70 US geographic location , and the availability of broad city -level estimates (Table 5.1). \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 42 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Table 5.1.

Key Model Assumptions Assumption Rationale Hypothetical legally -sanctioned SIFs in US cities are comparable to Insite (Vancouver, BC, Canada) in terms of effectiveness, services offered, and cost of living -adjusted operating costs . Insite is the first and most well -documented SIF in North America. The US cities modeled have a 0.25-mile radius area with in the city that could have 2100 PWID clients for a SIF. The Insite client -service rate is the basis for the healthcare resource use effectiveness estimates for SIFs in all modeled cities. Rates of HIV/hepatitis C/other infectio ns are equivalent between SIF+SSP and SSP -only. We recognize there is some evidence that SIFs may reduce needle sharing, leading to a reduction in infections . However, due to the short time horizon of our model (1 year) and t he complexity of estimating th e timing of infections and attributing costs to these conditions , we chose to take a conservative approach and not include these additional cost off -sets. We explored a difference in infection rates driven by a reduction in ne edle sharing conferred by the SIF setting in a scenario analysis . We assume d that the rates of initiation and continuation of MAT are equivalent between clients using SIFs and SSPs. There is a lack of comparative data between these two services; however, stakeholders have indicated that increased face -to-face time spent with PWID may lead to increased uptake of MAT. Therefore, we explore d the impacts of marginal increases in MAT initiation due to SIFs in a scenario analysis. BC: British Columbia, HIV: human immunode ficiency virus, MAT: medication treatment, PWID : people drugs , SIF: supervised injection facility , SSP: syringe service program Model Inputs Overdose Mortality We utilized estimates from Marshall et al.12 to calcul ate the overdose mortality risk reduction associated with SIFs (Table 5. 3). We calculated the mortality reduction attributable to the SIF as the absolute difference between : (a) fatal o verdose reduction within a 0.25 mile radius around the SIF and (b) fatal overdose reduction beyond a 0.25 mile radius around the SIF ; this was then applied to pre-SIF overdose fatalities per city to derive expected fatalities within and outside the effective range of the SIF. Of note, the Marshall et al. estimate for overdose reduction near the SIF is a weighted average of two Vancouver, BC census tracts within a 500-meter radius of the SIF . As these two census tract distance s were within 0.25 mile, we employ ed this distanc e instead of 500 meters in this US-based analysis . As in Irwin et al. ,66,67 we assumed that 5% of overall overdos e deaths in each city occurred with in the 0.25 mi radius of the SIF . Thus, the equation for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 44 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Table 5.3.

We utilize d estimates from Irwin et al. to parameterize these services, with 0.79% of overdoses at a SIF versus 46% of overdoses outside a SIF resulting in an ambulance call, and 0.79% of overdoses at a SIF versus 33% of overdoses outside a SIF resulting in an ED visit.67 We no te that the estimates for emergency services utilization for overdoses at a SIF are lower than some published estimates,32-33 but are in line with current protocols based on stakeholder feedback. Based on an an alysis of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Emergency Department Sample, we assumed that 48% of ED visits for overdoses resulted in an inpatient admission.74 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 45 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Table 5.4.

Therefore, we used the same estimate of 5.78% of PWID accessing MAT due to a referral from the SIF and/or SSP (Table 5.5) .75 We explored differences in uptake in MAT in a scenario a nalysis. We assumed 50% of PWID who begin MAT stay on treatment each year. Table 5.5 . Medication -Assisted Treatment Inputs Parameter Estimate (sensitivity analysis range) Proportion of PWID who access MAT75 5.78% (\u00b120%) MAT: : people inject drugs SIF and SSP Operati ons and Facilit ies Costs SIF facility and operation costs were estimated based on the Irwin et al. approach, adapting each comm unity's estimate according to their individual characteristics.66,67 We applied start -up costs as well as margina l operating costs , adjusting prior 2013 estimates to 2020 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index (Table 5.6, below).77 Start -up costs were calculated by multip lying the size of \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 46 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents the Insite SIF (10 00 ft2) by the commercial real estate cost per ft2 per city (Table 5.1, above) ; this cost was then amortized over the length of the loa n period to calculate an annual loan payment. The Insite annual operating cost was multiplied by the cost-of-living ratio per city compared to Vancouver, BC (Table 5.1, above) . Each city's annual SIF cost thus equaled the annual loan payment plus the ann ual operating cost . We assume d that the SIF's service offerings match those of Insite , as that site is also the source for the effectiveness parameters. SSP facility and operation costs were estimated from Teshale et al., who reported on the costs of oper ating these facilities in a variety of settings in the US .78 We adopted the large (serving 2500 clients ), urban SSP setting from Teshale , and then adjusted the budget items based on the SSP offer ings that were available at the time of the launch of Insite , in order to align the differences in costs with the services that were added with Insite and the measured mortality impact. This inclu ded removing naloxone distribution and medical/testing serv ices, and their associated personnel costs (including benefits) . We then adjusted the costs to 2020 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index from 2016 to 2020 dollars .77 In order to estimate SSP operation and facility costs in each modeled city, we applied US cost -of-living city-level weights, with Teshale's estimate assumed to b e the overall mean.

The model outcomes will also include total emergency services avoided, and total increase in MAT initiation . Due to the one -year time horizon, all results are reported as undiscounte d values. Base -Case Analysis Costs and cost effectiveness were estimated using the incremental cost -effectiveness ratios, with incremental analyses comparing SIF+SSP to SSP -only. Because the health care system does not hold financial responsibility for funding SIFs, the base -case analysis used a modified societal pe rspective. Sensitivity Analyses We performed one-way sensitivity analyses to identify the key drivers of model outco mes, using available measures of parameter uncertainty (i.e. , confidence intervals ) or reasonable ranges for each input described in the m odel inputs section above. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 48 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Scenario Analyses In addition, we also performed the following scenario analyses to test the impacts of our model assumptions: SIF-associated reduction in HIV and HCV infections . We employed the approach used by Irwin et al. to estimate the reduction in infections among PWID . This approach was driven by a 70% reduction in needle sharing amon g SIF clients compared to the non -SIF PWID (Table 5.8) . Given the 1 -year time horizon and the decision to exclude health benefits in terms of utility weights, we did not include costs associated with HIV/HCV treatment in this scenario. Table 5 .8.

We lowered the overdose rate per city until the overall cost s of a SIF+SSP and an SSP-only were equivalent. SIF-associated increase in MAT uptake and MAT retention . Assuming that MAT uptake at an SSP-only would be lower than the proportion of SIF+SSP clients who access MAT (5.78%), w e estimated the incremental number of MAT clients at a SIF+SSP by decreasing (over a range of 0% -100%) the relative proportion of SSP-only clients who access it . In addition, we did a two-way sensitivity analysis of the differences in (a) MAT uptake and (b) MAT retention rates between SIF+SSP and SSP -only . Given the 1 -year time hor izon and the decision to exclude health benefits in terms of utility weights, we did not include costs associated with MAT in this scenario. Health care payer perspective analysis . In this scenario we focused on direct health care costs by excluding SIF and SSP costs and utilizing health care reimbursements instead of \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 49 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents total cost for hospitalizations . Reimbursements represent what the health care payer paid to the hospital for the provision of care rather than the net cost of care to the hos pital. Table 5. 9. Hospitalization Costs for Health Care Payer Scenario Analysis City Health Care Payer Reimbursement80 Boston $5,290 Philadelphia $6,318 San Francisco $7,224 Atlanta $4,309 Baltimore $6,318 Seattle $7,224 Model Validation We used several approaches to validate the model. First, we provided preliminary methods and results to multiple SIF stakeholders, including researchers and SIF s taff from various locatio ns. Based on feedback from these groups, we refined data inputs use d in the model. Second, we varied model input parameters to evaluate face validity of changes in results. We performed model verification for model calculations using internal reviewers. Finally, we compared results to other cost-effectiveness models in this therapy area. 5.3 Results Base -Case Results The annual cost of operating a SIF +SSP ranged from $1. 6 million to $2. 5 million , while the cost of operating an SSP -only ranged from $1.4 million to $1. 7 million , depending on the location . A hypothetical SIF +SSP was found to result in the prevention of three (Boston) to 15 (Philadelphia) overdose deaths per year , as well as 773 fewer overdose -related ambulance rides , 551 fewer overdose -related ED visits , and 264 fewer hospitalizations (all based on 180,000 injections/year /comparator ). This resulted in cost -savings for : (a) ambulance rides avoided , from - $437,800 (San Francisco) to -$356,900 (Atlanta) ; (b) ED visits avoided ( -$1.9 million ); and (c) hospitalizations avoided , from -$2.3 million (San Francisco and Seattle ) to -$1.6 million (Atlanta) . For each of the six cities, a SIF+SSP saved money compared to an SSP -only , driven primarily by reductions in ED visit and hospitalization costs (of note, OD deaths avoided is not included in the costs per comparator). The overall cost-savings for a SIF+SSP versus SSP-only ranged from -$4.2 million (Seattle) to -$3.6 million (Atlanta). \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 50 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Table 5. 10.

The parameter with the largest impact on the cost per OD death avoided was the overdose mortality reduction within 0. 25 mi2 of the SIF.12 Other parameters with notable impact included the number of injections /year /clientele , the proportion of injections that result in overdoses , the proportion of overall overdo se deaths/year/city that occur within 0.25 mi2 of a SIF , and overdose deaths per city . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 53 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Figure 5.2.

Threshold Analysis of Overdose Rate Needed for Cost Parity Between SIF+SSP and SSP -Only We performed a threshold analysis that e stimated how low the OD rate would need to be in each city to reach parity between the costs of a SIF+SSP and SSP -only . These ranged between 0.05% (Atlanta and Baltimore) and 0.16% (San Francisco), all representing sig nificantly lower OD rates than the ba se case (Table 5.13) . Table 5 .13. Threshold Analysis of Overdose Rate Base Case OD Rate Incremental Cost Threshold OD Rate Incremental Cost Boston 0.95 % -$4,009 SIF-Associated Increase in MAT Uptake and MAT Retention In the base -case analysis, the proportion of clients who accessed MAT was 5.78% in both comparator arms. This estimate was based on data collected from a SIF in Australia . If MAT uptake at an SSP-only is instead assumed to be 0% of the SIF+SSP, the SIF+SSP would result in 121 additional clients who access treatment . We model ed this increase in MAT uptake in increments of 10% in order to demonstrate the impact of these assumptions (Table 5.1 4). The two-way sensitivity analysis of MAT uptake and MAT retentio n is available in Appendix Table E 2. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 56 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Table 5. 14.

Scenario Analysis of Health Care Payer Perspective Boston Philadelphia SIF+SSP SSP-Only Incremental SIF+SSP SSP-Only ,000 ,000 ,000 injection , SSP: syringe service program Model Validation Model validation followed standard practices in the field. We tested all mathematical functions in the model to ensure they were consistent with the report (and supplemental Appendix mat erials). We also conducted sensitiv ity analyses with null input values to ensure the model was producing findings consistent with expectations. Further, independent modelers tested the mathematical functions in the model as well as the specific inputs an d corresponding outputs. Model validation was also conducted in terms of comparisons to other model findings. We searched the literature to identify models that were similar to our analysis, with comparable populations, settings, perspective, and treatmen ts. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 58 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Prior Economic Models We identified four prior published economic evaluations of SIFs in the US, along with published analyses of the Insite facility in Vancouver, BC. Our model was informed in large part by these models, though with some different as sumptions. Unlike prior models, our approach focused on explicitly comparing SIF+SSP to an SSP operating alone in a city. Because of this decision, many of the outcomes highlighted by prior models, such as infection rates and MAT initiation , were assumed to be equ ivalent in our base case. Our model also utilized the distance -based OD death risk reduction from Marshall et al . in a slightly different way than most previous models, by attributing the 25.7% incremental mortality risk reduction associated with the SIF t o one quarter mile radius around the SIF.12 Behrends et al . attributed this risk reduction more broadly to a half -mile radius, while other prior models have used a variety of other meth ods to attribute lives saved to SIFs.63 Therefore, it is difficult to exactly reconcile the estimated mortality impact from our model with others, though they a re all consistent in estimating that SIFs reduce mortali ty. In terms of SIF operating costs, our model estimates aligned fairly closely with those taking the same costing approach but diver ged slightly from those that used city - or county -specific wage estimates or different financing approaches. For example, our estimated cost of running the SIF in Seattle for one year was $ 2,036,000 , compared to the Hood et al . estimate of $1,222,332 using wage rates for actual staff employed by the county to run their h ypothetical SIF.64 In that regard, our results for Seattle ma y be conservative, assuming their SIF operating model was to be executed. Limitations There are a numbe r of important limitations to consider when evaluating our model estimates . First, the costs of operating a SIF in cities around the US are extrapolatio ns from a single North American SIF in Vancouver, BC . The actual costs of operating a SIF in any of th e cities we modeled will depend on many local factors and the actual funding mechanisms used . Furthermore, the operations of both SIFs and SSPs may vary widely from city to city . Second, the mortality risk reduction estimates we used also come from the e stimated impact of that same single North American SIF at a single point in time . The long -term OD mortality risk reduction associated with SIFs is unknown . Lastly, we cannot account for rapidly evolving pandemic -associated factors . 5.4 Summary and Comme nt We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with operating a SIF compared to an SSP only in six cities in the US over a one-year time horizon . The costs of operating a SIF were estimated to be higher than operat ing an SSP across all six cities . However, those costs were offset by cost savings attributed to SIFs through the avoidance of ED \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 59 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents visits and subsequent hospitalizations. Furthermore, in all six cities, SIFs were estimated to reduce mortality by avoiding overdose deaths. The model results were sensitive to several input par ameters, which varied slightly across the six cities . The underlying community -level risk parameters of overdose and overdose mortality, along with the mortality risk reduction attribut ed to SIFs , were the most influential model parameters . Additionally, parameters that determined the number of injections occurring in SIFs within each city also influenced the model estimates. Conclusions Operating a SIF was estimated to save lives and a dditionally to reduce medical care associated with overdoses in all six US cities modeled . We estimated that operating a SIF result s in fewer lives lost to overdoses and lower costs overall after accounting for the incremental costs associated with operat ing a SIF compared to an SSP alone . \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 60 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 6. Potential Other Benefits an d Contextual Considerations Our reviews seek to provide information on potential other benefits offered by the intervention to the individual PWID , caregivers, the delivery system, other PWUD , or the public that would not have been considered as part of t he evidence on comparative clinical effectiveness. We also recognize that there may be broader contextual issues related to the severity of the condition, whether other treatments are ava ilable, and ethical, legal, or other societal priorities that influe nce the relative value of illnesses and interventions. These general elements are listed in the table below, and the subsequent text provides detail about the elements that are applicable . We sought input from stakeholders, including individual clients, advocacy organizations, policy makers, clinicians, law enforcement agencies, researchers, and SIF managers, to inform the contents of this section. Each ICER review culminates in a public meeting of an independent voting Council of clinicians, patients, a nd health services researchers. As part of their deliberations, Council members will judge whether a treatment may substantially impact the considerations listed in Table 6.1. The presen ce of substantial other benefits or contextual considerations may sh ift a council member's vote on an intervention's long -term value for money to a different category than would be indicated by the clinical evidence and economic modeling alone. A Council member may also determine that there are no other benefits or contex tual considerations substantial enough to shift their vote. All factors that are considered in the voting process are outlined in ICER's value assessment fra mework . The content of these deliberations is described in the last chapter of ICER's Final Evidence Report, which is released after the public meeting. This section, as well as the Coun cil's deliberation, provides stakeholders with information to inform analysis on a range of issues related to SIFs, including public policy development. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 61 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents Table 6.1.

Other Other 6.1 Potential Other Benefits and Contextual Considerations Impact on PWID Care The opening of a SIF represents a community's commitment to treat substance use disorders as a health issue, rather than a criminal issue. Its availability allows law enforcement and medical professionals to guide PWID to a SIF for immediate and long -term support of a substance use disorder, including screening and prevention of related health issues (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, soft tissue infections) . It provides another access point for health and social support services , and referral coordination, especiall y for people with housing insecurity and mental illness. It is possible that a SIF makes a significant impact on the entire infrastructure of c are for substance use disorders in the neighborhoods where it operates and/or for the clients it serves. Serving the Marginalized Persons served by SIFs are among the most vulnerable and marginalized in a community . Well - established social norms and publi c opinions regarding substance use disorders place PWID at a disadvantage for health and social support resource s in many communities. Addressing Health Disparities Given the disparities in SUD by socio -economic class, SIFs differentially benefit groups wi th lower life expectancy and high er disability. For example, the average annual rate of heroin use was 5.5% for people in the lowest household income group (<$20,000) , which was 3.4 times higher than the >$50,000 household income group .179 The relationship between race -ethnicity and SUD is confounded by income with larger percentages of minority populations living in poverty. A SIF that \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 62 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents is able to engage clients and successfully refer them to treatment can contribute to improving health equity for recovery as well as overdose -related deaths. Relationship -Building with Clients Due to the personal histories of mental illness and substance abuse, some SIF clients have difficulty building and m aintaining trust with others, especially health care professionals. In comparison to SSPs which have been described in interviews as \"transactional\", SIFs are more likely to engage clients in longer and more frequent interactions with staff and other clie nts. A trust -based relationship can be instrume ntal in helping clients improve injection behavior and link to medical, mental/behavioral health and social services. Screening of Street Drug Toxicity It was reported that some SIF clients use the facility when obtaining drugs from a new or different source. The SIF can provide direct protection for PWID in this case. Toxicity screening of drugs before injection and/or analysis of remnants allows for a SIF to be part of a community's surveillance system o f the drug supply and contribute to timely publi c warnings about lethal substances in circulation. Attribution of Benefits to the SIF versus Other Factors Most quantitative data that informed the economic model are derived from SIFs operating in only two communities . Uncertainty exists about local fac tors (unmeasured or unmeasurable attributes unique to the people and place) that contributed to favorable outcomes at the time of the study . It is not possible to separate features of the intervention from local community factors, such as infection rates, resources for persons with housing insecurity, access to primary medical care, etc . that vary across communities that may be considering implementing a SIF. In communities where SIFs are introduced, they r epresent a new form of harm reduction that augmen ts other strategies already in place, notably medication -assisted treatment, naloxone distribution, and syringe service programs. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 63 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Contents 7.

Previous Systematic Reviews and Technology Assessments Potier, C., Lapr \u00e9vote, V. et al. (2014) \"S upervised Injection Services: What Has Been Demonstrated? A Systematic Literature Review\".30 A systematic review was identified on the data available on supervised injection services (SISs) to determine whether they have achieved their desired objectives. The review included 75 articles in the final analysis including descriptive, cross -sectional , and analytical assessments. Of these, 68% (n= 51) were related to a SIS in Vancouver, 17% (n= 13) from Sydney, and 3% (N=2) from Europe. Fourteen studies described the characteristics of the most frequent SIS users . Most SIS users were described as m ale, aged 30 -35 years, experiencing housing and employment insecurity and with a previous history of incarceration. The most frequently used drugs were heroin, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines . Seven studies concluded that no death by overdose had been reported at a SIS; in Vancouver, the SIS led to a 35% decrease in fatal overdoses. In Vancouver and Sydney, regular SIS use was associated with reduced syringe sharing (aOR = [1.93 -3.87]) ; a meta -analysis determined that the SIS was associated with a 69% reduction in syringe sharing. According to six studies, SIS users received care for injection -related problems and five studies re ported that SIS use resulted in an increase referral to addiction treatment (OR= 1.32, 95%CI = [1.11 -1.58]: P=0.002). Seven surveys evaluated perceptions of local residents, police, and professionals . In Sydney, 70% of residents and 58% of business owner s favored the SIS and saw a decrease in drug use and syringe waste. However, most business owners and residents still related SIS use to a negative image of the district and the \"honey -pot\" effect. McNeil, R., Small, W. (2014) \"Safer Environment Interven tions: A Qualitative Synthesis of the Experiences and Perceptions of People Who inject Drugs\".180 McNeil and Small conducted a systema tic review to evaluate the influence of social, structural, and environmental factors on access and engagement with Safe Environment Interventions (SEIs) among people who inject drugs (PWID). The rev iew included 29 references referring to 21 studies in th e final evaluation. The included articles were published in Canada (n=16), the USA (n=6), Russia (n=4), and other settings (n=4). The four themes described in the analysis were - SEIs as a refuge, increased use of social services, SEIs impact on survival, and the social -structural impact on the SEIs. Multiple studies emphasized on the importance of the SEIs as a refuge from violence on the streets. SEIs promoted safer injecting by redefining the soc ial and environmental contexts of injection drug use. I n addition to being a refuge from violence, SEIs also enabled safer drug use practices by \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Revi ew, 2020 Page 81 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Return to Table of Contents enabling harm reduction. The use of these facilities allowed clients to access safer injection equipment whic h in turn allowed them to practice safer habits and acce ss to a safer space to contributing to reductions in risky injection behavior. Rushed injections and syringe sharing was reduced and enabled more autonomy for the clients. These facilities mediated access to social and healthcare services. Trust was ide ntified as a critical component; trust between clients and staff was associated with increased acceptance of drug treatment referrals and other services. Kennedy, M C., Karamouzian, M., Kerr, Thomas . (2017) \"Public Health and Public Order Outcomes Associ ated with Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities: A Systematic Literature Review\"181 Kennedy et al, conducted a systematic review to assess health and community outcomes related to use of supervised drug cons umption facility (SCF) use. A total of 47 studies were included in the final analysis including cohort, pre -post, cross -sectional, or time -series analyses. 28 studies were conducted in Vancouver, Canada, 10 in Sydney and the remaining in Europe (n=9). Overall, the review found that the use of SCFs was associ ated with a decrease in overdose deaths, an increase in PWID receiving addiction and medical treatment, and a decrease in substance use in public. Eight studies examined overdose -related outcomes, of which six studies found an association between the esta blishment of a SIF and reduction in overdose -related deaths. For example, the establishment of Insite, Vancouver was correlated with a 35% decline in overdose related deaths near the vicinity of the SIF, compared to a 9% decline outside of this vicinity. In Sydney, Australia opening of SIF was associated with a reduction in ambulance calls as well as opioid related poisoning presentations near the SIF. Four studies reported that frequent SIF use was associated with a decrease in injection risk behaviors including syringe sharing. A cross - sectional study based in Vancouver reported that SIF users are 70% less likely to borrow or lend a used syringe and two additional studies from Denmark and Vancouve r found an association between SIF use and a reduction i n other unsafe injection behaviors including injecting outdoors, rushed injections, and reusing syringes. SIF use was also reported to be positively associated with an increase in safer injection prac tices. Further, four studies reported that frequent SIF use was associated with an increased likelihood of entry into and uptake of addiction treatment . At Insite, Vancouver, use of detox services increased by more than 30% in the year after the SIF was opened, compared to the year before; rapid entry into de tox services was also associated with contact with an addiction counselor at a SIF. Three other studies report similar data. Five studies reported that implementation a SIF in Vancouver and Sydney wa s associated with a reduction in the number of people in jecting publicly, publicly discarded syringes, and injection -related litter. Besides, four studies conducted in Sydney found no changes in drug -related crime, and similar results were reported in two studies from Vancouver. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Revi ew, 2020 Page 82 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Return to Table of Contents Lange, B. Bach -Mortensen, A M . (2019) \"A Systematic Review of Stakeholder Perceptions of Supervised Injection Facilities\".182 Stakehold er perceptions of supervised injection facilities (SIFs) were evaluated in this systematic review. Of the 47 included articles, the majority were conducted in Canada (n=26) and Australia (n= 8). The mean sample size of the included studies was 55.8 (SD: 64). Patients who use drugs (PWUD), including women, reported that the largest benefit to SIFs (sanctioned or unsanctioned) was their ability to provide a safe space from violence, theft, and police harass ment. The increased safety of PWUD at a SIF was a ttributed to several factors such as education on drug use, a hygienic environment, availability of necessary supplies, and supervision especially in the case of an overdose. Business sector, community wor kers, and health professionals also reported a red uction in publicly discarded syringes. On the other hand, the most highlighted concerns with sanctioned SIFs were associated with current restrictions, age, and pregnancy. Across four studies, PWUD expres sed concerns that SIFs did not allow assisted inje ctions, whereas staff described disruptive client behavior and personnel safety as their main concern. For sanctioned SIFs, stakeholders suggested revising restrictions and regulations, to allow drug shari ng and injecting drugs other than heroin. These s takeholders also suggested to increase the operating hours of a SIF. Rand Report . (2018) \"Assessing the Evidence on Supervised Drug Consumption Sites\". 183 Researchers conducted a systematic review to assess the existing evidence on supervised consumption sites (SCSs) using Pu bMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and WorldCat . Seventeen reviews were identified as quasi -experiments and simulation studies, while five systematic reviews were identified, and one piece of grey literature. Overall, the authors concluded that the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of SCSs is limited. The authors note that not many scientific studies exist and of those that do, they were limited to only a few locations such as Vancouver and Sydney; in a ddition, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating individual or populatio n-level outcomes. According to the research evaluated, clients who attend an SCS and overdose in the presence of staff are much more likely to live thanks to the st aff being equipped with naloxone. According to a study conducted in Vancouver, there is a s ignificant reduction in fatal drug overdoses in the area surrounding the SCS compared to outside of the area, and studies conducted in Vancouver and Sydney identifi ed a significant decrease in opioid -related emergency service calls. Several cross -sectiona l studies concluded that frequent SCS uses adopt better safer injection practices than those who use the SCS less frequently. \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 83 Evidence Report - Super vised Injection Facil ities Return to Table of Contents Appendix C.

Comparative Clinical Effectiveness Supplemental Information We performed screening at both the abstract and full -text level. Four investigators screened all abstracts identified through electronic searches according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria described earlier. We did not exclude any study at abstract -level screening due to insufficient information. For ex ample, an abstract that did not report an outcome of interest would be accepted for further review in full text. We retrieved the citations that were accepted during abstract -level screening for full text appraisal. One investigator reviewed full p apers and provided justification for exclusion of each excluded study. Further, we will use 12-item National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tool to assess the quality of the pre-post studies with no control group and 14- item NHB LI Qua lity Assessment Tool for observational cohort and cross -sectional studies, using the categories as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\" quality. 116 Good : A study has the least risk of bias, and results are valid . Fair: A study susceptible to some bias deemed not sufficient to invalidate its results. The fair -quality category is likely to be broad, so studies with this rating will vary in their strengths and weaknesses . Poor: A study that has a significant risk of bias. Studies rated poor are excluded from the body of evidence. ICER Evidence Rating We used the ICER Evidence Rating Matrix (see Figure D1) to evaluate th e evidence for a variety of outcomes. The evidence rating reflects a joint judgment of two critical components: 1. The magnitude of the difference between a therapeutic agent and its comparator in \"net health benefit\" - the balance between clinical benefits and risks and/or adverse effects; and 2. The level of certainty in the best point estimate of net health benefit.117,118 \u00a9Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 2020 Page 85 Evidence Report - Supervised Injection Facilities Return to Table of Con tents Figure D1.

By handling numerous medical emergencies, they also promise to conserve health care system resources during a time when these resources are acutely scarce. As coronavirus is fundamentally redefining the status quo, the imperative for overdose prevention sites has never been more urgent. The American public agrees: In new polling, we found substantial bipartisan support for overdose prevention sites and other harm reduction solutions as part of the response to coronavirus. Indeed, voters not only support supervised consumption, they want local officials to take the lead even in the face of state opposition. OUR POLLING SHOWS THAT: 60% of voters, including 53% of Republicans, support overdose prevention sites as a tool that state and local governments may use to reduce overdoses in their cities and states. 58% of voters believe that mayors and other local officials should open overdose prevention sites if they feel they will address an overdose crisis, even if the state government opposes. 54% percent of voters support supervised consumption via mobile units to immediately target neighborhoods with high overdose death rates. 58% of voters overall, and 60% of Republicans, prefer setting up overdose prevention sites as part of already existing health care systems and hospital networks. The coronavirus pandemic has compounded North America's overdose crisis. Just in the United States, drug overdoses have already claimed nearly a half million lives since 1999. Now authorities across the country are reporting a surge in overdose deaths as part of the pandemic fallout, with fatality rates rising by 100% in some counties. By disrupting treatment and harm reduction services, triggering economic shocks and trauma, and severing social support networks, the pandemic is undermining any progress being made in overdose prevention. At the same time, people who use opioids and other drugs are especially vulnerable to coronavirus infections and severe disease because of health and structural stressors. In responding to these overlapping public health emergencies, we must draw on the full spectrum of science-driven prevention measures. Such measures include rapid scale-up in access to critical overdose prevention medications, including methadone, buprenorphine, and the opioid antidote naloxone. But we must also expand the limited toolkit of overdose prevention efforts in the United States to include overdose prevention sites. Also known as \"supervised consumption facilities\" or \"safe injection sites,\" these are safe, supervised spaces to use previously- obtained drugs and access essential care and support services. With nearly 300 such facilities operating worldwide, overdose prevention sites have shown overwhelming evidence of their public health benefit and cost-effectiveness. Despite these well-documented successes, advocates have been unsuccessful at opening a legally-sanctioned overdose prevention site in the United States. THE ROLE OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE3 Voters also believe that overdose prevention sites should be accessible: 54% overall and 54% of Republicans prefer setting up overdose prevention sites in commercial areas with heavy traffic over remote locations. Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to rapidly adapt by reforming staid and ineffective systems and policies to safeguard public health. Creating overdose prevention sites should be part of this adaptation. These facilities can act as essential points of access to care for people who use drugs and provide extensive collateral public health benefits to the community as a whole. This is the time to eliminate unnecessary barriers to these lifesaving services. If not now, when? Introduction: Harm Reduction Strategies are Essential to Fighting the Opioid Overdose Crisis The United States has been in the grips of an overdose crisis since the early 2000s. This crisis has evolved from being driven primarily by prescription drugs to heroin to fentanyl. Instead of focusing on treatment, harm reduction, and root causes , policy responses have primarily targeted drug supply through criminal justice interventions. In many jurisdictions, these punitive approaches continued to fuel the overdose fatalities they were purported to abate. What makes this slow pace of progress in overdose crisis response especially tragic is that effective interventions are available. Research has long shown that harm reduction strategies, such as community distribution of naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote, have effectively decreased overdose deaths , as have \"911 Good Samaritan \" laws that promote help-seeking by shielding overdose witnesses and victims from prosecution for minor drug offenses. Providing access to scientifically-based drug treatment with methadone and buprenorphine has been shown to slash overdose risk by 50-80%, including among people reentering society from incarceration. Measures to reduce the collateral harms of problematic substance use include the expansion of syringe service programs , which provide sterile syringes and create a link to broader healthcare services and treatment. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, harm reduction strategies are rightly being deemed life-sustaining and essential; there is an emerging consensus among policymakers that we must expand their deployment in responding to this pandemic. But the existing spectrum of harm reduction measures is artificially limited. Even with their successes, many communities continue to face crisis levels of overdose fatalities, along with the collateral consequences of substance use, including infectious disease transmission, heart problems, and suicide. COVID-19 threatens to compound this ongoing crisis, making the imperative for extraordinary measures that much more urgent. THE ROLE OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE4 Despite Overwhelming Evidence of Effectiveness, Supervised Consumption Has Not Been Used In The United States Advocates have long urged the United States to adopt overdose prevention sites, a harm reduction measure designed for supervised consumption of pre-obtained drugs in a safe environment. In over 30 years of international experience, overdose prevention sites have saved lives and improved other public health outcomes, without increasing crime or drug use. In the most robust analysis to date, a Vancouver study demonstrated a 35% reduction in fatal overdoses in the area surrounding the site. Supervised consumption can also decrease the use of emergency medical services, reduce public drug use and syringe debris, reduce HIV transmission, and increase linkages to treatment, housing, and other health and social support services . Despite concerns that overdose prevention facilities could increase crime, the research base squarely refutes this theory . Studies have also found that people who are unstably housed and homeless actively utilize overdose prevention sites to prevent involvement in the criminal legal system. Correctional settings fail to provide meaningful rehabilitation or treatment and, in many cases trigger a cycle of homelessness, unemployment, and risk of fatal overdose. Yet despite their proven benefits, there are zero legally-sanctioned overdose prevention sites operating in the United States. This is primarily because of local, state, and federal laws that some\u2014including federal prosecutors\u2014have interpreted to prohibit supervised consumption. Even as jurisdictions have taken sensible policy measures to allow overdose prevention sites in response to the overdose crisis, law enforcement and other government actors have made concerted efforts to block them. Do you support or oppose overdose prevention sites as a tool that state and local governments may use to reduce overdoses in their cities/states?THE ROLE OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE5 In 2018, New York City announced a plan to create four overdose prevention sites, but inaction by the state health department and concerns about federal law enforcement prevented the City from moving forward. In late 2018, the California legislature passed a bill authorizing the City of San Francisco to operate a pilot overdose prevention site, but Governor Jerry Brown vetoed the measure . That same year, Seattle's City Council allocated funding for supervised consumption, but so far organized opposition and threats from federal prosecutors have successfully blocked attempts to create it. Local officials in Denver , Boston and Burlington, Vermont , have also shown varying degrees of public support for supervised consumption without actual execution. In early 2018, the City of Philadelphia' s plan to support supervised consumption sparked federal litigation and led to a landmark court ruling. After the city and the nonprofit organization Safehouse announced an authorized overdose prevention site, the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia sued to block it, arguing that supervised consumption violates the Controlled Substances Act, in particular the provision that prohibits \"opening or maintaining any space for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing or using controlled substances, with a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\" In October 2019, a federal district judge rejected the prosecutor's arguments and ruled in favor of Safehouse, explaining that \"the ultimate goal of Safehouse's proposed operation is to reduce drug use, not facilitate it.\" The case is now on appeal, but its rationale may have far- reaching consequences for other jurisdictions and for U.S. drug policy more broadly , as well as for the social stigma surrounding use. Codified in law, stigma continues to be a formidable barrier; safehouse planned to open its site after the ruling, but the site's property owner revoked the lease in response to community backlash.Why Now: The Role of Overdose Prevention Sites in COVID-19 Response While supervised consumption has been stalled or outright rejected in the United States, fatal drug overdose rates remain high--and rising in many jurisdictions. The coronavirus pandemic will only compound desperation in an already dire situation. Considering these overlapping public health emergencies, overdose prevention sites should be a core element of the coronavirus response. Overdose prevention sites have always been designed with the dual purpose of reducing fatal overdose risk, while also preventing the spread of infectious disease. People who use drugs face a grave heath risk if they become infected with the coronavirus. Higher prevalence of HIV , hepatitis C , and other infections are more prevalent among people who inject drugs, as are autoimmune and respiratory challenges. People who use drugs also face elevated stress and trauma caused by a history of incarceration, racism, and homelessness. Many remain subject to policies that require them to interact closely with disciplinary systems, including conditions of probation and parole, as well as punitive treatment systems\u2014as with methadone treatment, which in many settings still requires daily office visits . These requirements make it difficult to practice social distancing and take other COVID-19 prevention measures. Drug use is often a communal activity and people who use drugs rely on their peers for support on a number of levels. In addition to being psychologically taxing, isolation confers a direct risk of overdose death. To prevent overdoses from turning fatal, harm reduction advocates use the mantra \"don't use alone.\" In the era of social distancing, people who use drugs must THE ROLE OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE6 navigate difficult trade-offs between relying on social networks that provide lifesaving help and access to resources on the one hand, maintaining physical distance to prevent infection on the other. Early signs suggest that the coronavirus crisis and its preventive strategies may cause an increase in fatal overdoses . With the coronavirus crisis, hospital resources are stretched thin to the point where they are making triage decisions on access to life-sustaining equipment. Ambulances may lag in response time to overdoses and people who use drugs may experience even higher rates of and more blatant discrimination in hospital settings. Overdose prevention sites can directly mitigate these challenges, figuring as an integral part of coronavirus prevention because they can: 1. Prevent fatal overdoses at a time when overdose rates are likely to increase because of economic and social conditions 2. Preserve first responder capacity by limiting emergency overdose calls 3. Preserve hospital capacity by reducing hospitalizations related to overdoses 4. Prevent the spread of coronavirus through injection equipment 5. Prevent the spread of coronavirus through unsafe spaces where people may be forced to inject in close quarters 6. Provide early detection of coronavirus through testing of vulnerable high-risk individuals 7. Provide vulnerable individuals with resources, education, and referrals to housing and other services that can help improve prevention and facilitate social distancing Our polling found that voters of both parties prefer sites that have these capabilities to provide comprehensive care: 58% of voters overall, and 60% of Republicans, prefer setting up overdose prevention sites as part of already existing health care systems and hospital networks. In many ways, supervised consumption, when combined with medical services, overlaps with and furthers many of the policies to slow the spread of coronavirus that public officials across the country have already embraced, including reducing arrests, reducing jail populations, protecting homeless populations to reduce infections, and preserving scarce medical resources. Overdose prevention sites accomplish all this. Moving Forward During this pandemic, we have seen unprecedented changes to long-held drug policies, including the regulation of opioid substitution therapies. In the United States, methadone has historically been highly regulated by the federal government. Upon entering a program, methadone patients must receive a dose at a physical site each day and undergo regular drug tests. Only after becoming established may a person receive take- home doses, and each program has the discretion to grant such privileges. In January 2020, in response to the coronavirus crisis, the federal government loosened regulations on methadone programs to allow for 28-day take-home doses. Furthermore, the Drug Enforcement Agency has allowed for prescribing buprenorphine without an initial in-person evaluation. THE ROLE OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE7 Our polling shows that voters of both parties strongly support these policy changes: Do you support or oppose naloxone training, a drug that is used in emergency situations to reverse overdoses? Do you support or oppose allowing states to provide recently released people with a 28-day supply of medication used in an opioid treatment program?THE ROLE OF OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE8 The coronavirus crisis also provides a critical opportunity to deploy proven interventions like overdose prevention sites to address the spread of infectious disease and reduce overdose deaths. Especially during this pandemic, such sites constitute an essential point of access to care for people who use drugs, with extensive collateral public health benefits to the community as a whole. This is the time to eliminate unnecessary barriers to these lifesaving services, both in the U.S. and around the world.

METHODOLOGY From April 25, 2020 to April 26th 2020, Data for Progress conducted a survey of 1741 likely voters nationally using web panel respondents. The sample was weighted to be representative of likely voters by age, gender, education, urbanicity, race, and voting history. The survey was conducted in English. The margin of error is \u00b1 SB 279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program I, like many of you, know far too many people who have lost loved ones to an overdose. We use the word \"crisis,\" to describe what is happening in our communities today. While overdose deaths were already increasing nationwide in the months preceding the COVID -19 pandemic, the CDC recently reported the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12 -month period. In Maryland, drug -and alcohol related deaths have increased 12.1 % acros s the state from January to September compared to the same months last year. 1At least 1,829 fatalities were linked to opioids, a 14.5% jump from the same time a year earlier, according to data released by the state's Opioid Operations Command Center and the Department of Health. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more pot ent than heroin, factored into 93.1% of opioid -related deaths . 2 Last year, our budget directed more than $700 million to this crisis. This year, those who battl e subst ance abuse are also faced with social isolation, disruptions of support, impeded access to care, and economic distress . Experts fear the continued climb in overdose deaths as this crisis rages on. What we have done and what we are doing is not enough. We n eed to use ALL available tools - and ones that are evidence -based and have been known to work -- employing a multi -faceted, multi -pronged approach that will save lives. This committee and the Maryland General Assembly are doing important work -- we are broadening access to treatment, reining in the provision of prescription opioids, launching educational programs in our schools, expanding naloxone access as well as 1 Oxenden, M. (2020, September 22). Drug and alcohol related deaths across Maryland Jump more than 9% due to the Coronavirus officials say 13 ). Overdose deaths jump in Maryland, likely due to coronavirus pandemic, health officials say . The assisted treatment. But we could be doing more and that's what this bill would en able us to do. This bill is not a mandate. It's not a directive. It enables local communities to decide what is best for them. Under this bill, if a community organization - a hospital, a local health department, a federal qualified health care center, or a substance use treatment center, for example - wanted to offer an overdose prevention site (OPS), they would work with their local health department, apply for approval to the Department of Health, and get permission to operate: two urban, two suburban, and two rural sites. Substance users would be permitted to come to the sites with their own pre -obtained substances and use, under the supervision of health care professionals. A variety of services would be offered at these sites - wound care, substance use disorder education, reproductive care, HIV testing, etc. There are 12 countries that host over 150 overdose prevention sites around the world. In the 17 -year history of one of these sites (Insite in Vancouver), there have been zero overdose deaths and crime in a 5 -mile radius around the OPS has been reduced at a substantially higher rate than in other parts of the city. They have overseen 3.6 million injections without a death and overdoses in the surrounding neighborhoods have also declined. Similar p rograms worldwide have experienced similar results. What saves lives should be driving our policy decisions. What is evidence -based and has been proven to be effective in decreasing substance abuse should be driving our policy decisions. What we were doing wasn' t enough. What we must consider, in light of the devastating and added impacts of the pandemic is a new, but data driven approach. I ask that you keep your mind open and that you listen carefully to the professionals, the experts in the field o f substance use and harm reduction. Overdose prevention sites are not a panacea, but they are another very important tool that will help us address this crisis that continues to take so many lives. Respectfully, I ask for your support of SB279 . Thank you. Law Enforcement Against Prohibition From: Amos Irwin, Law Enforcement Action Partnership co-authors: Susan Sherman and Brian Weir, Johns Hopkins University Ehsan Jozaghi, University of British Columbia Re: SB 0279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program Position: SUPPORT Date: January 22, 2021 To: Maryland Senate Finance Committee Distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to present the results of my research on the impact of an overdose and infectious disease prevention site in Baltimore in support of Senate Bill 0279. I worked with researchers at Johns Hopkins University who have studied Baltimore's population of people who inject drugs and an expert on Vancouver's Insite facility from the University of British Columbia to estimate the impact of an overdose prevention site (OPS) in Baltimore. We assumed that the facility would be modeled on Vancouver's Insite facility, which has thirteen booths. We used research on the costs and benefits of Insite and data on Baltimore's population of people who inject drugs to model the expected costs and benefits of an OPS in Baltimore. Our study, which was published in the Harm Reduction Journal in May 2017, found that a single OPS would save roughly $7.8 million per year at an annual cost of $1.8 million. This means $6.0 million in annual net savings, equivalent to about 30% of the city health department's entire budget for harm reduction and disease prevention. Study Results Savings related to... HIV $1,501,928 3.7 new infections prevented Hepatitis C $1,443,827 21.2 new infections prevented Skin and Soft Tissue Infections $934,952 374.0 hospital days prevented Overdose Deaths $2,997,791 5.9 deaths prevented Ambulance Calls $80,995 108.0 calls prevented Overdose Related ER Costs $106,159 77.8 ER visits prevented LawEnforcementActionPartnership.org Formerly known as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition Appendix: Study Methodology Cost of Operating the Facility Cost calculations are based on a facility equal in size and scope to Insite. We estimate the annual cost of establishing a new OPS combines both upfront and operating costs. Since we assume the same staffing levels, equipment needs, and other operating cost inputs as Insite, we calculate the operating costs by multiplying the Insite OPS's $1.5 million operating costs by a 4 percent cost of living adjustment between Vancouver and Baltimore (Jozaghi et al., 2015; Expatistan, 2016). Since the upfront costs would depend on the exact location and extent of renovations required, we make a conservative estimate of $1.5 million based on actual budgets for similar facilities and standard per-square-foot renovation costs (Primeau, 2013; MSIC, 2013). We convert this upfront cost into a levelized annual payment by assuming that it was financed with a loan lasting the lifetime of the facility. We determine the levelized annual payment according to the standard financial equation: where C is the calculated levelized annual cost, i is a standard 10 percent interest rate, P is the $2 million estimated upfront cost, and N is the estimated 25-year lifetime of the facility. Benefits of Operating the Facility HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) savings Kerr et al. (2005) find that OPS use reduces clients' needle-sharing by 70%. To estimate the impact of reduced needle-sharing on HIV and HCV infection rates, we use an epidemiological \"circulation theory\" model developed to calculate how needle exchange programs impact HIV infection among PWID. We use the Jacobs et al (1999) model to estimate new HIV infection cases (IHIV): Overdose Related Hospitalization Costs $67,092 26.8 hospitalizations prevented Medication-Assisted Treatment $637,245 121.4 additional people entering treatment Total Savings $7,769,988 Costs $1,932,252 Annual Operating Cost $1,767,000 Annualized Upfront Cost $165,252 Summary Cost-Benefit Ratio: $1 spent generates $4.02 savings Net savings $5,837,736 LawEnforcementActionPartnership.org Formerly known as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition where i is the percentage of HIV-negative PWIDs, N is the total number of needles in circulation; s is the percentage of injections with a shared needle; d is the percentage of injections with an unbleached needle; q is the percentage of HIV-positive PWIDs; t is the chance of transmitting HIV through a single injection with a shared needle; and M is the average number of people injecting with a single shared needle. We use the same model for HCV: Skin and soft-tissue infection savings Skin and soft tissue infections are the number one reason for PWID hospital admissions. While uninsured PWID normally wait until their infection becomes serious enough to be admitted to the ER, OPS medical staff provide wound care and medical referrals to treat these infections before they become serious. Lloyd-Smith et al (2010) found that the hospital stays of Insite users were on average 67% shorter. We predict infection care savings according to where S SSTI is the annual sa vings from OPS infection care, N is the number of people using the OPS, h is the hospitalization rate for SSTI, L is the average length of infection-related hospital stay for PWID, r is the 67% stay reduction for OPS users, and C is the average daily cost of a hospital stay. Averted Overdose Deaths Marshall et al. (2011) compare the change in overdose deaths within 500 meters of Insite to the change in other Vancouver neighborhoods both before and after the facility's opening. They find a 35 percent reduction in overdose mortality near Insite, compared to a 9 percent reduction further away, suggesting that Insite reduced neighborhood overdose deaths by roughly 26 percent. We assume that a Baltimore OPS of the same size, also operating near capacity, would reduce overdose deaths in its immediate vicinity by a similar percentage. Most likely this underestimates the facility's impact, since this method only estimates averted overdose deaths within 500 meters of the OPS, though the facility would also reduce overdose more than 500 meters away. In order to assign value to the loss of life due to overdose, we follow Andresen & Boyd (2010) in considering only the tangible value to society rather than including the suffering and lost quality of life for loved ones. We estimate the tangible value using 30 years of the median wage for Baltimore City, and since the average age of PWID in Baltimore is 35, we convert 30 years of future wages to present value using a discount rate of 3 percent. So the total value of a single overdose death (V) is calculated as: LawEnforcementActionPartnership.org Formerly known as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition with n equal to 30 years, W as the $25,707 median wage for Baltimore City, and r as the 3 percent discount rate, we find the value to be $503,869. Medication-Assisted Treatment Savings Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs, principally methadone and buprenorphine maintenance, have been shown to reduce patients' health care needs and criminal activity, as well their drug and alcohol use (Gerstein 1994, Barnett 1999, Zaric 2000, CDC 2002, Flynn et al 2003). Studies estimate that they save taxpayers $4 to $13 for every $1 spent, mostly by reducing users' criminal activity to get money to buy drugs (Cartwright 2000, Gerstein 1994, Health Canada 2002, Harris et al 2005, Hilltop Institute 2007). Studies of Vancouver's Insite show that OPS users are significantly more likely than non-OPS-users to accept referrals to MAT (Wood et al 2006, Wood et al 2007). In Sydney's MSIC, 5.8% of OPS users accepted MAT referrals per year. We estimate the financial benefits of OPS referrals to MAT programs, considering both health care and crime costs, according to the model where S MAT is the annual savings due to the OPS increasing MAT u ptake, N is the number of PWID who use the OPS, r is the percent of OPS users who access MAT as a result of OPS referrals, b is the cost-benefit ratio for MAT, and T is the cost of one year of MAT. Ambulance Savings Overdoses require emergency medical assistance, even when they are not life-threatening. Ambulances are called to the scene of over half of all nonfatal overdoses, at an average cost of around $500 per call. (MSIC 2003) By contrast, almost all overdoses in MSIC, Sydney's OPS, were handled by on-site medical staff and did not result in ambulance calls (MSIC 2003, MSIC 2010). We estimate cost savings of averted ambulance calls for a OPS in Baltimore according to the following model: where S a is the annual savings due to the OPS reducing ambulance calls for overdose, I is the annual number of injections in the OPS, o is the rate of nonfatal overdose, c o and c i are the rates of overdose ambulance calls outside and inside the OPS, respectively, and A is the average cost of an overdose ambulance call. Emergency Room Overdose Savings Emergency response personnel often transport overdose victims to the emergency room for treatment. In one Baltimore study, 72% of PWID who had an ambulance called for an overdose reported being taken to the ER. By contrast, overdoses in OPSs lead to emergency room treatment in less than 1% of cases. With a single Baltimore ER visit averaging $1,364, OPSs reduce medical costs significantly by keeping PWID out of emergency rooms for overdose. We calculate the savings according to: LawEnforcementActionPartnership.org Formerly known as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition where S er is the annual savings due to the OPS reducing emergency room visits for overdose, I is the annual number of injections in the OPS, o is the rate of nonfatal overdose, t o and t i are the rates of ER transport for overdose outside and inside the OPS, respectively, and F is the average cost of an overdose emergency room visit. Overdose-related hospitalization savings Overdose victims are occasionally hospitalized for treatment. In one Baltimore study, 26% of PWID who had an ambulance called for an overdose reported being hospitalized. By contrast, overdoses in OPSs lead to hospitalization in less than 1% of cases. With one day in a Baltimore hospital averaging $2,500, OPSs reduce medical costs significantly by keeping PWID out of the hospital for overdose. We calculate the savings according to: where S h is the annual savings due to the OPS reducing hospitalization for overdose, I is the annual number of injections in the OPS, o is the rate of nonfatal overdose, a o and a i are the rates of hospitalization for overdose outside and inside the OPS, respectively, and E is the average expense of an overdose hospital stay.

Charles St., Tower II, 8th Floor | Baltimore, MD 21201 -3718 | www.BHSBaltimore.org January 26 , 202 1 Senate Finance Committee TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT SB 279 - Public Health -Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Site Program Behavioral Health System Baltimore (BHSB) a nonprofit organization that serves as the local behavioral health authority (LBHA) for Baltimore City. BHSB works to increase access to a full range of quality behavioral health (mental health and substance use) services and advocates for innovative approaches to prevention, early intervention, t reatment and recovery for individuals, families, and communities. Baltimore City represents nearly 35 percent of the public behavioral health system in Maryland, serving over 77,000 people with mental illness and substance use disorders (collectively refer red to as \"behavioral health\") annually. Behavioral Health Sys tem Baltimore is in support of SB 279 - Public Health -Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Site Program. This bill authorizes a community -based organization to establish an Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Site Program in no more than six lo cations throughout the state. COVID -19 has increased the need for mental health and substance use disorder services in Maryland. According to data released by the Maryland Department of Health, the number of overdose deaths from drugs and alcohol in Maryland increased 12% in the first three quarters of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. BHSB supports SB 279 as we recognize the need for innovative public health interventions to address the opioid crisis in Baltimore City and our state. While the General Assembly has taken laudable steps to address the opioid crisis through measures such, as increasing access to the lifesaving drug naloxone and authorizing syringe services programs more intervention s are needed. The Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Program proposed in this legislation mirrors the programs established across the world. Evidence from these sites show that facilities that allow safer drug use reduce overdose deaths and provide an entry into treatment. They target high -risk drug -users who would otherwise inject in unsafe places . This population is at significant risk of death from overdose, which medical supervision can effectively eliminate. There has not been a single overdose fatality at any safer drug use facility . A study of a Canadian facility found that overdose mortality dropped 35% in the area surrounding the facility after it opened. 1i The facilities proposed in this bill can serve as an access point to substance use disorder treatment and other social services. One study of a Canadian facility found that participants increased detoxification services by more than 30 percent .2 1 Brandon DL Marshall et al., \"Reduction in overdose mortality after the opening of North America's first medically supervised safer injecting facility: a retrospective population -based study,\" The Lancet 377, no. 9775 (2011): 1429 - 37. 2 E Wood et al., \"Ra te of detoxification service use and its impact among a cohort of supervised injection facility users,\" Addiction 102(2007): 918. We must continue to look for innovative ways to engage people who use drugs around safer drug use and connections to treatment . The Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Site Programs could advance this goal . As such, BHSB urges the Senate Finance Committee Kelley , Chair Members, Senate Finance Committee The Honorable Shelly Hettleman FROM: Pamela Metz Kasemeyer J. DATE: January 26, 2021 RE: SUPPORT - Senate Bill 279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program On behalf of the Maryland State Medical Society (MedChi) , the Maryland Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians (MDACEP), and the Mid- Atlantic Association of Community Health Centers (MACHC), we submit this letter in support of Senate Bill 279. This legislation provides that a community -based organization may establish an Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program in one or more counties with the approval of the Department of Health, in consultation with the local health department . The legislation limits the program to approval of six programs, two in urban areas, two in suburban areas , and two in rural areas. T he program must provide a location supervised by health care professionals or other trained staff where drug users can consume pre -obtained drugs . The program must also provide sterile injection supplies, information regarding safe injection practices, and referrals to obtain naloxone and treatment services. According to the February 2017 Abell Foundation Report, about 19,000 people inject drugs in Baltimore City. Although hundreds of people suffer overdose deaths each year, thousands more experience nonfatal overdose, skin and soft tissue infections, and are at risk for infectious diseases due to unsafe and unsterilized injection environments. The first official supervised drug consumption facility opened in Berne, Switzerland in 1986. Today, there are 97 facilities in 66 cities in 11 countries, with an additional seven planned to open in Canada alone . A large body of evidence -based, peer -revi ewed studies demonstrate that people who utilize these facilities take better care of themselves; use their drugs more safely; and have better access to medical, social, and drug treatment services. MedChi , MDACEP, and MACHC recognize th e research and the potential that these facilities can reduce the costs associated with this public health crisis . For these reasons, the above -named organizations would ask for a favorable report on Senate Bill 279. For more information call: Pamela Metz Kasemeyer J. Steven 2020 Chair Delores Kelly Finance Committee Miller Senate Office Building, 3 East Annapolis, MD 21401 RE: SUPPORT of Senate Bill 279 (Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program) - FAVORABLE Dear Chair Kelly and Senate Finance Committee Members, My name is Sarah Kattakuzhy, MD, and I am a physician, scientist, and Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. I am writing this letter to offer my full support to Sena te Bill 279 \"Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program,\" which will allow community -based organizations to establish overdose prevention programs to reduce overdose deaths, which continue to occur at unprecedented levels in Maryland. I have practiced and conducted research in the fields of HIV, viral hepatitis, and opioid use disorder over the last ten years. The data on Overdose Prevention Sites is unequivocal - not only in preventing overdose, but in reducing HIV and HCV transmission ri sk behaviors, and linking individuals with opioid use disorder into treatment. Furthermore, data supports that individuals with opioid use disorder want Overdose Prevention Sites, and would utilize them as a culturally - competent space centered in safety, c ompassion, and dignity. The \"War on Drugs\" philosophy of alienation, segregation, and stigmatization has left 750,000 Americans dead in the last 20 years. As a physician, I urge the Committee to listen to science, reason, and the voices of your constituent s most affected by opioid use disorder. I ask that the Finance Committee give SB279 a favorable report. If you have any further questions, I would be delighted to speak further on this vital and timely bill. I can be contacted at 202-550-2685 and at skattakuzhy@ihv.umaryland.edu .

We advocate for harm reduction as part of a broader movement for social justice. supports Senate Bill 279 \"Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program,\" which will allow community based organizations such as our organization to establish overdose prevention programs to reduce overdose deaths, which continue to occur at unprecedented levels in Maryland. Baltimore Harm Reduction Coalition is an organization that educates and mobilizes people who are using drugs and sellng sex. We provide life saving equipment to the people most affected by the epidemic. Overdose Preventoin Sites will enable us to better serve the people in need. For over 30 years, it has been proven that Overdose Prevention Sites save lives. We urge the General Assembly to authorize overdose and infectious disease prevention services, a proven intervention used across the globe to decrease overdose deaths. The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program mirrors more than 150 such programs already established across the world. More than 60 cities in 12 countries operate such programs, and numerous studies demonstrate the positive impacts. In all of the 150+ OPS around the world, in which millions of supervised drug injections have occurred, no one has died of a fatal overdose .

When asked what he thinks happens to us when we die, Keanu Reeves once said, \"I know that the ones who love us will miss us.\" Every life cut short due to overdose is a tragedy, both because each death is a person gone far too early, and because every loss rips a hole in the lives of those left behind. I have personally lost a number of close friends to overdose, and I truly believe that these people would still be in my earthly life today if they had had access to an Overdose Prevention Site such as the one being proposed in this bill. If my loved ones had been able to visit an Overdose Prevention Site, I wouldn't have visions of them losing consciousness in their car, or on the kitchen floor as their grandparents slept in the next room. I wouldn't fear that the shivering wracking my bed would suddenly stop, or worry what I might find when I check on my partner who has been in the bathroom for too long. I wouldn't know the feeling of helplessness as he began turning blue on our floor while I desperately tried to find someone with Naloxone because we didn't have any in our house. Instead, I would have the comfort and confidence that each and every one of these friends would be supported, watched over, and cared for as they used their supply. I could sleep easy knowing that they would come home, that I would get another day with them - another day of hugs and laughter, of homemade biscuits and gravy and inside jokes. I ask you to support Senate Bill 279 because I want people like my friends to stick around. I also ask for your support so that people like me don't have to go through life missing those people - so that we can have our days of love and laughter instead of an agonizing hole of grief. For over 30 years, it has been proven that Overdose Prevention Sites save lives. I urge the General Assembly to authorize overdose and infectious disease prevention services, a proven intervention used across the globe to decrease overdose deaths. The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program mirrors more than 150 such programs already established across the world. More than 60 cities in 12 countries operate such programs, and numerous studies demonstrate the positive impacts.

Kelley, Chair, and members of the Senate Finance Committee FROM: Katy Edwards, Progressive Maryland Drug Policy Taskforce Leader, Anne Arundel County (D30) DATE: January 22, 2021 POSITION: Support Thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony on SB279 . Progressive Maryland is a grassroots, nonprofit organization w ith 9 chapters from Frederick to the Lower Shore and more than 100,000 members and supporters who live in nearly every legislative district in the state. In addition, there are dozens of affiliated community, faith, and labor organizations across the state that stand behind our work. Our mission is to improve the lives of working families in Maryland. Please note our strong support for this bill. My name is Katy Edwards and I currently work in police diversion here in the city of Annapolis. I have nine yea rs of experience in behavioral health and throughout this time I have seen how the War on Drugs is a direct attack on impoverished communities throughout this country. Overdose Prevention Sites are currently an essential need throughout the state of Maryl and. \"Over 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020.\" In light of these absolutely horrifying numbers, it is essential to reflect on the fact that OPS sites have never had one single death occur. This is an evidence -based method which reliably saves people's lives. This fact clearly signals that this bill has not been passed due to remaining stigma placed on dru g users throughout our state. If we look to Portugal where overdose prevention sites operate and illicit substance use has been decriminalized, we see extremely large drops in substance use as a whole and consequently a huge drop in overdose deaths. Curre ntly in America, we place moral judgements on drug user's lives and continue to dangerously displace many Maryland residents who currently exhibit co -occurring symptoms. For so many people the path to recovery is not a linear process. It is a well -known fa ct in behavioral health that many drug users face mental health barriers and community stigma only escalates those conditions. In the end, if we are aware that creating safe space for stigmatized people saves lives, we should all aim to work towards that g oal. I call upon my elected officials to continue to work for all people of Maryland without stigma. We urge a favorable report.

Our mission is to improve the lives of working families in Maryland. Please note our strong support for this bill. I am writing in strong support of SB279 to establ ish supervised consumption and overdose prevention sites (OPSs) across the state of Maryland. For too long, people who are addicted to drugs have been driven away from help - away from resources that can give them hope and an escape - due to the fear of p rosecution and imprisonment. Often a law enforcement officer, a correctional officer, or a probation officer may be the only contact the state has with an addicted person. It is not their job - nor should it be their job - to connect the person to social s ervices that can help them through their addiction. This is where an overdose prevention site can be a critical lifeline to an addicted person. The staff of the OPS is an off -ramp from addiction that can avoid the use of law enforcement and correctional r esources. People who are addicted can be directly linked with services at the OPS at the time when they are needed without the constant threat of arrest or harassment. They will be treated as people in need of help instead of criminals who need to be locke d up. Please stand up against policies which morally condemn our community members who are currently experiencing a public health crisis. You can do this by supporting Senate Bill 279. This policy would be one step closer to helping those that are in need of evidence -based assistance without subjective condemnation. We urge a favorable report.

In our sad difficult life, many people find escape through drugs these drugs sometimes ruin their f uture and take their lives many times they go to jail and harm their bodies. If we can find a way to at least allow people to live through this tragic experience then perhaps they can get on the road to recovery. Inside of an overdose prevention site, our community members could find a safe environment to use and maybe find a way out, a way back to a safe normal life. I beg you to agree to try this please for us to work as a community and save people. We should review and understand how these sites have helped other communities. There is no cost -effectiveness for simply locking people up. Thank you for your time and attention. We urge a favorable report.

Please note our strong support for this bill. I'm w riting to urge you to support SB 279. The creation of an important program like the Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Service Program is important to me and I believe many in my local community and state as a whole will benefit from its offerings and language. This afternoon I went outside to walk a guest to their vehicle, we had to dodge various needles, plungers and broken drug burned glass in the gutter and area next to their car. A real sad, painful and embarrassing moment as a property owner as I have pride in ownership and care for our community. As a father attempting to raise my daughter in a clean, healthy safe and sound environment, this is no t acceptable. She's 12 years old and not even allowed beyond the limited bounds of our small yard and chained fence alone (how did we play at 12?). I can't trust many areas we traverse as we see people literally strung out laying on the street in drug induced states, fighting and screaming over drugs and money. This is traumatic coming from a military Veteran who suffers medical conditions and even more harmful on the forming brain of a young girl. I can't keep my blinders on and ignore it any longer as I travel our great state of Maryland. These are hard realities to face and even harder questions and daily reminders to answer to my daughter in our current state. We urge a favorable report.

Please note our strong support for t his bill. As an old, retired emergency physician, I've seen and treated many drug overdose patients. The problem with drug overdoses is that they need to be treated within five minutes of cessation of breathing. If treated in time, the patient lives. If n ot treated in time, the patient dies. It's that simple. That's why having a place to go in order to shoot up drugs of abuse is so important. But there are more reasons to fund this initiative. Drugs are more dangerous than ever. That's because fentanyl an d the various chemical cousins of fentanyl are both extremely potent and less expensive than heroin. Heroin needs to be imported. Fentanyl can be made in a lab in someone's basement or garage. Fentanyl is so potent that the amount needed to kill is less th an a hundredth of an ounce, considerably less. And the powder can be absorbed through the skin. Also, having a place to use these dangerous drugs where there's an available rescuer with Narcan, the rescue drug, means that the drug abusers will come in co ntact with someone who can refer them for detox and rehab. The abusers will have chances to get plugged in to treatment and recovery. We urge a favorable report. Testimony on Maryland Senate Bill 279 Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program TO: Sen. Kelley, Chair, and members of the Senate Finance Committee FROM: Alfrieda Hylton, Progressive Maryland Drug Policy Taskforce County (D24) DATE: January 22, 2021 POSITION: Support Thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony on SB 279 . Progressive Maryland is a grassroots, nonprofit organization with 9 chapters from Frederick to the Lower Shore and more than 100,000 members and supporters who live in nearly every legis lative district in the state. In addition, there are dozens of affiliated community, faith, and labor organizations across the state that stand behind our work. Our mission is to improve the lives of working families in Maryland. Please note our strong support for this bill. I have a granddaughter who's 27 years of age, a heroin addict and I've seen the side effects of the drugs and witness withdrawals, reckless behavior, where she becomes unrecognizable. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the overdo se crisis and to share my views on how it's affecting individuals, families, and communities across our nation. I'm devasted by the misused and increasing prescription and illicit opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose, including paraphernalia, heroin, and methadone. The most alarming is the significant and continued increases in overdose deaths. Too many of our citizens are being robbed of their God -given potential in the prime of their life. Healthcare providers prescribed opioids to treat pain in ways tha t are high risks associated with opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose when prescribed at high doses and longer durations. There is a lack of health system and healthcare provider capacity to identify and engage individuals that provide them with high -quality, evidence -based opioid addiction treatment. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Maryland, nearly 90% of drug overdose deaths involved opioids in 2018; a total of 2,087 deaths (a rate of 33.7) and, in 2018, 67,367 drug overdos e deaths occurred in the United States. The age -adjusted rate of overdose deaths decreased by 4.6% from 2017 (21.7 per 100,000) to 2018 (20.7 per 100,000). Opioids \u2014mainly synthetic opioids (other than methadone) are currently the main driver of drug overdo se deaths. Opioids were involved in 46,802 overdose deaths in 2018 (69.5% of all drug overdose deaths). Two out of three (67.0%) opioid - involved overdose deaths involved synthetic opioids. Thus, treating only the individual with the active disease of addi ction is limited in effectiveness. Do you know that you can help people who are most at risk for opioid use disorder and overdose in the State of Maryland? As well as helping those struggling with opioid, heroin, and methadone use disorder find the right care and treatment. I strongly believe representatives of District 24 are willing to take a major step to combat substance misuse and protect the State of Maryland communities from the scourge of opioid, heroin, and methadone addictions by providing suppo rt to those individuals fighting addictions and having access to appropriate interventions treatment facilities, as well as expanding government services to individuals battling with drug addiction. We urge a favorable report. BCA_FAV_SB0279.pdf Uploaded by: Mehu, Natasha Position: FAV BRANDON M. SCOTT MAYOR Office of Government Relations 88 State Circle Annapolis, Maryland 21401 Annapolis - phone: January Senate Finance Committee FROM: Natasha Mehu , Director of Government Relations RE: SENATE BILL 279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program POSITION: SUPPORT Chair Kelley , Vice Chair Feldman , and Members of the Committee, please be advised that the Baltimore City Administration (BCA) supports Senate Bill (SB) 279. SB 279 authorizes the establishment of up to six overdose and infectious disease prevention serves programs in Maryland. The programs would be established by community -based organizations with the approval of the Department of Health in consultation with the local health department. The sites must be located in areas with high incidences of drug use and may not be located in residential areas. To ensure geographic diversity , the programs would be limited to two programs in urban areas, two programs in suburban areas, and two programs in rural areas of the state to the extent practicable . The bill also outlines staff ing, operations, education, and reporting requirements. Opioid overdoses are a persistent public health crisis in Baltimore City and across the country. Between 1999 and 2014, opioid related overdose deaths quadrupled in the United States, increasing fro m an age -adjusted death rate from 1.4 to 5.9 per 100,000.1 In just the first half of 2020, 427 opioid overdose deaths were reported in Baltimore City.2 1 Kennedy, M., & Kerr, T. (2017, January). Overdose Prevention in the United States: A Call for Supervised Injection Sites. Retrieved November 20, 2020, from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articl es/PMC5308167/ 2 Cohn, M. (2020, June 11). Opioid -related deaths make a disappointing uptick in early 2020, possibly related to coronavirus. Retrieved November 20, opioid overdoses and overdose -related deaths are anticipated to c limb.3 A potential option to address substance use disorder in Baltimore City is the establishment of an overdose and infectious disease prevention site (OPS). An OPS, also known as a \"supervised consumption site,\" is a \"harm reduction intervention that helps to mitigate the harms of drug use, through onsite monitoring and rapid intervention by trained staff in the case of an overdose.\"4 A successful OPS will often offer safe consumption and observation rooms staffed by medical professionals, education an d access to Medicated Assisted Treatment (MAT), recovery counseling, basic medical services, referrals, and support services such as housing assistance, public benefits, and legal services. This model reduces harm to a client's health while connecting them to care and recovery.5 Altogether, the program is part of a continuum of care for people with substance use challenges who often have complex medical needs including severe mental illness, HIV/AIDS, and/or Hepatitis C.6 At present, no OPS facilities exi st in the United States. However, Philadelphia has sought to establish an OPS site, which is pending federal litigation.7 In North America, an OPS was established in Vancouver, Canada as early as 2003, and several more are now situated throughout the Vanco uver area.8 Throughout the world, there are approximately 120 OPS in 11 countries and 2 in the planning phase.9 In Baltimore City, it is difficult to predict how an OPS would function given the above - mentioned legal hurdles faced by Philadelphia and the l ack of OPS in cities with demographics akin to Baltimore's. However, a study led by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (BSPH) researchers published in June of 2019 in the Journal of Urban Health found that 77% of 326 survey participants who us e drugs in three East Coast cities expressed willingness to use OPS.10 Moreover, a Baltimore City -focused 2017 study led by Dr. Susan Sherman, a professor at the BSPH, estimated that a $1.8 million annual investment in an overdose prevention site would save the health care 3 Ibid. 4 Pauly, B., Wallace, B., Pagan, F., Phillips, J., Wilson, M., Hobbs, H., &amp; Connolly, J.

SB 279 provides some assistance for overcoming those hurdles by creating a process in state law for establishing OPS; setting parameters for OPS programs that include superv ision by health care professional or other trained staff who can administer first aid and monitor and provide rescue medication if needed; sterile supplies and disposal services; access or referrals to treatment, testing, or other health services; educatio n; and security.

Founded in March 2017, BRIDGES Coalition for Overdose Prevention Sites is a statewide Baltimore-based advocacy coalition working to end overdose and criminalization by promoting safe spaces, dignity, health, and justice for people who use drugs. BRIDGES was founded with funding from the Drug Policy Alliance and Open Society Foundations, international resources for drug policy reform and reparative justice for communities harmed by the war on drugs. Our coalition was created to address needs named by Maryland policymakers during committee hearings and delegation meetings in 2016, when then-Delegate Dan Morhaim first presented this bill to authorize OPS. Since the inception of BRIDGES in March 2017, our statewide coalition's purpose is to strengthen community buy-in for overdose prevention sites (OPS). Comprised of 30 organizational members dedicated to advocate for Maryland State authorization of OPS, we have led public education and community mobilization efforts via: monthly community organizing meetings, mock demonstrations of OPS, community dialogues, informational hearings with Baltimore City Council, online messaging campaigns, an educational video series , focus groups, surveys with various stakeholders, and seven Maryland General Assembly committee hearings. For four years, we have engaged in well over 3,000 conversations and more than a dozen public events hosted by places of worship, treatment programs, neighborhood associations, and public officials -- all with the same goal of addressing potential community concerns around overdose prevention sites being set up around the state. Maryland needs Overdose Prevention Sites; indoor spaces where individuals can consume their own drugs in the presence of trained professionals with immediate access to life-saving interventions, medical care, emotional support, and non-judgmental therapeutic relationships. 1 We recognize that OPS are not the sole solution to the overdose epidemic and could never replace treatment services. OPS are a crisis intervention positioned within the continuum of care to reduce overdose rates. To most effectively save lives from the growing overdose epidemic, Marylanders need and deserve overdose prevention sites that are community and peer-run, grounded in mutual aid efforts, and implemented with a social justice framework. For over 30 years, it has been proven globally that overdose prevention sites save lives. In all 150+ OPS around the world, in which millions of supervised drug injections have occurred, no one has died of a fatal overdose . We urge the General Assembly to authorize the proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program, which mirrors these programs already established across the world. We ask that the Senate Finance Committee give SB279 a favorable report. For more information about the BRIDGES Coalition for Overdose Prevention Sites, please contact Rajani Gudlavalleti at Owen FAVGood afternoon members of the Senate and fellow Marylanders, my name is Gassoh Goba, a resident of Baltimore City and former Chapter Lead of Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP), an all volunteer organization championing the human and civil rights of people in the sex trade. I'm urging you to pass SB0279, so people who use drugs and harm reductionists can continue the work of dismantling the internal and external damages wrought by the racists and classist War on Drugs - legally and safely. Many harm reductionists and peers today will uplift the various safety, financial and public health benefits that legalizing Overdose Prevention Sites will garner so, I will highlight the importance of this bill to adults living with childhood and adult trauma wounds. Adverse Childhood Experiences, a term coined in 1995, is a subset of childhood adversities typified by abuse, neglect and household dysfunction which children and adults who score highly have an increased likelihood of experiencing health issues ranging from substance abuse, suicidal attempts, depression, missed work and poor academic achievement. Countless studies have been published by the Center of Disease Control, the National Library of Medicine or Harvard University's Center for the Developing Child that highlight the insidious ways prolonged, toxic stress negatively impacts the molecular biology of developing children and adults, further widening the chasm of community and health disparities experienced by communities burdened by such traumas. Communities disproportionately made up of black and brown, immigrants and indigenous peoples who are working poor, disabled, queer, young, houseless or formerly incarcerated - made to suffer the yolk of systems and policies that have yet to be repatriated. As an organizer with SWOP Baltimore, I have connected with dozens of people who use drugs and sell sex in the streets of Baltimore City; many of the people I met during those times shared experiences of childhood and adult trauma, citing this pain as reasons why they use - as a balm for the pain. I will never forget one woman in particular who frustratingly expressed \"how do they expect me to heal 50 years of trauma and pain in a 90 day program\"? The reality for many people who use drugs in Maryland is that they are not ready to stop using and, by forcing paternalistic services and programs that do not recognize the extent of trauma, we are again failing residents and the generations of peoples who have passed who also struggled to carry the yolk of multiple oppressions, childhood and adult trauma. As we move away from the shadow of the Trump presidency and the potential promise of Biden's administration, I urge you, be unafraid of innovation and creative solutions; cultivate compassion and empathy for residents who are falsely seen as \"lost or wasted souls\". I am urging you to not only see but invest in the humanity of people who use drugs, in Overdose Prevention Sites that will be a bridge of connectivity, supporting Marylanders to chart their own healing journey with peers, medical professionals and trauma-informed personnel; to support the creation of spaces, like OPS's, where people who drugs can safely begin unpacking layers of pain within a continuum of care that will not disparage them for using drugs or abandon them for healing at their own pace. Let 2021 finally be the year we move towards building systems of freedom instead of oppression; building tools of connection instead of isolation; fostering hope instead of despair. Let 2021 be the year Maryland legalizes Overdose Prevention Sites and witness the powerful healing connection can play in our communities - thank you.

MATOD members include thousands of highly trained and dedicated addiction counselors , clinical social workers, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, peer recovery specialists and dedicated staff who work every day to save and transform lives. Senate Finance Committee January 26, 2021 Senat e Bill 279 Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program Support The Maryland Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (MATOD) supports Senat e Bill 279, which will allow jurisdictions to develop Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention programs to reduce fatal and non-fatal overdoses, and provide a pathway for people toward needed health care. Fatal Opioid -related overdoses climbed over 14% from January to September 2020 compared to the same 2019 time-frame . The current increase in fatal overdoses translates to the loss of over 2,400 Marylanders during 2020 from Opioid misuse . Despite Maryland's continued efforts of Prevention, Enforcement and Treatment & Recovery, Opioid addiction and misuse in 2020 will unfortunately claim the largest number of Maryland lives in any single year on record. Maryland's \"all hands on deck\" \"all tools available\" approach has effectively saved lives with harm reduction efforts of increased naloxone distribution and syringe exchange services ; increased access and availability to evidenced -based Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) with Methadone and Buprenorphine ; greater implementation of Peer Recovery Specialists in medical and community settings and creative jurisdictional Opioid Intervention Teams (OIT) across the state. More is urgently needed , however, in order to save lives and change the trajectory of the continued Opioid crisis . Substance Use, Behavioral Health and medical care and treatment is only be effective when and if it's received. The U.S. Surgeon General's 2016 \"Facing Addiction\" report noted that \"only 1 in 10 people with a substance use disorder receive any type of substance use treatment\". SB 279 can provide life-saving services for those 90% of Marylanders with the manageable disease of addiction who are not yet engaged in treatment. The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Servic es Program is based on similar programs operating in more than sixty (60) cities in ten (10) countries. The results and evidence from these successful harm -reduction facilities is unequivocal - they reduce overdose deaths, provide an entry into treatment, reduce public use and publicly discarded syringes, are cost-effective and they do not encourage or increase additional drug use or crime. Maryland needs to join the six (6) states considering legislative approval of such sites, and provide another tool in the great work being done to reduce overdose deaths and improve access to needed health care.

Repair Now provides information about the rights of people with criminal records and criminal statuses, is focused on providing information pertaining to expungement, records mitigation, and voting eligibility. Maryland is in the midst of an epidemic of accidental, fatal opiate & opioid overdoses because we are in the midst of a disaster caused by drug prohibition and the drug war. The leading driver of accidental, fatal overdoses is drug prohibition. When we make public policy decisions which lead consumers of any substance to acquire it in the illicit market, we are guaranteeing specific outcomes which will inevitably lead to accidental, fatal overdoses. In the illicit market, there are no quality controls. There are no safety inspectors or safety regulations. And, each person in the supply chain between the producer and the consumer has a financial incentive to adulterate the substance in question in order to increase their personal financial gain. Every time a substance user consumes a substance obtained in the illicit marketplace, they're doing so without knowing exactly what they may be ingesting unintentionally. Prohibition also ensures an unnecessary negative impact in public health outcomes for those who are not using illicit substances. Illicit drug use disproportionately affects those who are homeless or facing housing and employment instability. As a result, many substance users are consuming or ingesting in public spaces, like restrooms or parks. This poses a potential health risk to the public at large and also increases the likelihood of accidental, fatal overdose for substance users who are ingesting in whatever secluded space they can find due to their fear of arrest and stigmatization. Now, of course I understand that this body does not have the power or purview to end the drug war and drug prohibition on its own. But what it can do, is ensure that overdose prevention sites and decriminalization of simple possession of all drugs are part of any strategy to deal with this issue. Overdose prevention sites are already operating in other parts of the world, including Europe and Canada. None of these facilities has ever had a single fatal overdose despite having been in operation for years and, in some cases, decades. These facilities also provide a point of service between public health professionals & social workers with those who are experiencing a substance use disorder. With respect to decriminalization, we know that the criminal justice system is not the best way to connect those with substance use disorders with treatment services. So, why can't we skip the part where we arrest them and go straight to the treatment? If we did that, we should expect that those with substance use disorders to be more likely to come forward and ask for help since they would no longer fear criminal penalties with respect to their personal substance use patterns. In short, I implore you to vote yes on SB279 and explore drug decriminalization as a strategy to address this very serious issue. Respectfully, Scott B.

I am a person in recovery and have seen first hand the need for this type of program. Access to this type of preventative care and resources would have greatly benefited me year ago and I hope it will benefit many people in the near future. For over 30 years, it has been proven that Overdose Prevention Sites save lives. I urge the General Assembly to authorize overdose and infectious disease prevention services, a proven intervention used across the globe to decrease overdose deaths. The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program mirrors more than 150 such programs already established across the world. More than 60 cities in 12 countries operate such programs, and numerous studies demonstrate the positive impacts. In all of the 150+ OPS around the world, in which millions of supervised drug injections have occurred, no one has died of a fatal overdose. I ask that the Finance Committee give SB279 a 0279 Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Site program To: Hon. Delores Kelley, Chair, Hon. Senator Brian Feldman, Vice Chair, and members of the Senate Finance Committee From: Susan G. Sherman, PhD, Baltimore City, Legislative District 40 Dear Chair Kelley, Vice Chair Feldman, and Committee members, I am a Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has been a researcher on drug use, overdose, and HIV in Baltimore and elsewhere over the past two decades. The views that I state are mine and not those of Johns Hopkins University. I write to express my extensive support for Senate Bill 0279. Overdose prevention sites are an important component of a comprehensive, evidence-based strategy to reduce drug use and overdose deaths. They are an incredible opportunity to provide integrated services including drug treatment, case management, and a safe space for people to use drugs that reduces their risk of overdose and infectious diseases. The steep rise in overdose fatalities over the past decade in our state is the result of a perform storm - increases in opioid prescription, a heroin market characterized by more pure heroin as ensuing increases in interdiction, and the rise of cheap, more powerful synthetic adulterants, such as fentanyl, particularly in the eastern half of the U.S. such as Baltimore. It is hard to believe that the enduring overdose epidemic is now occurring in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is the proverbial fuel to an already large fire. As COVID-19 surged in 2020, more than 40 states have reported increases in opioid-related mortality. Fatal overdoses are just the tip of the iceberg, with nonfatal overdoses more frequent but over time, a significant predictor of fatal overdoses. My own research in Baltimore city and elsewhere provide a cautionary tale of the extent of overdoses that are occurring and traumatizing communities, the risks that people incur without safe, supervised places to use drugs, and the degree to which people who use drugs are interested in overdose prevention sites. In our recent study of 385 women who use drugs in Baltimore City, we found that 35.3% witnessed a fatal overdose, 51.9% witnessed a non-fatal overdose, and 28.3% experienced an overdose in the past 6 months. That is so much trauma over a relatively short period of time. As we talk about overdose prevention sites - it is important to understand that people are using drugs in places that could be classified as unsafe consumption sites. In another study of 200 people who use drugs, we found that public injection, meaning injecting in such places as alleys or in abandoned houses, was significantly associated with experiencing nonfatal overdose, arrest, and using a previously used syringe in the past six months.1 Studies have documented that overdose prevention sites reduce public injection, therefore reducing these negative health outcomes.2 Further, study time and again show overwhelming support among people who use drugs for the comprehensive range of services that are offered at overdose prevention sites. Often times the actual room where people they consume drugs under supervision is the space that they spend the least amount of time in an integrated overdose prevention site that also offers such necessary services as case management, primary care, a place to shower, a place to hang out, and a place to feel connected. As with most of us, such one stop shopping is appealing and enhances uptake of collocated services. There is so much research on what overdose prevention sites have and have not caused. One of the most researched overdose prevention sties worldwide is Insite in Vancouver, which opened in 2003 as a part of a broad public health strategy. I visited in 2006 and was amazed at the space. Efficient, clean, clinical, and most importantly, respectful to all who were receiving services. In Insite, there have been no overdose deaths, or any other overdose prevention sites worldwide where hundreds of thousands of people have used their services. In terms of overdose, Insite has had an effect beyond its doors. In the two years after its opening, there was a 35% reduction in overdose events in the 0.25 mile area immediately surrounding Insite compared to 9% in the rest of the city during the same period.3 Further, using Insite has been associated with reductions in HIV and Hepatitis C and increases of entry into drug treatment.4-6 You can imagine, these locations would be ideal for both COVID-19 testing and vaccination for high risk individuals. One of the biggest fears with placing an overdose prevention sites in a neighborhood is the negative response from residents and businesses. We recently conducted a study among 150 businesses located in neighborhoods characterized by high rates of drug use. We found that businesses overwhelmingly supported of overdose prevention sites 82% with 65% supporting a site in their business' neighborhood. This support indicates what could be seen as unexpected support of overdose prevention sites, yet businesses are extremely impacted by public drug use and its attendant outcomes, which likely drives their support. This is the sixth year that the Maryland State Assembly has had a bill proposed to establish pilot overdose prevention sites. The growth in support in the Senate and the House over this time has been so encouraging. But my great fear is that in Maryland and elsewhere, given the vast, unnecessary COVID-19 fatalities, we will become immune to the insanely high rates of preventable overdose deaths, that we will become apathetic in our response. A state authorization is the best legal course of action to protect overdose prevention sites in Maryland. An overdose prevention sites should be one part of a comprehensive approach to overdose prevention, which includes drug treatment. This committee has supported many other such evidence-based public health interventions. I hope this is among them. Sincerely, Dr. Susan G. Sherman References 1.

(Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program) - FAVORABLE Chair Delores Kelly Finance Committee Miller Senate Office Building, 3 East Annapolis, MD 21401 Dear Chair Kelly and Senate Finance Committee Members, We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, write to express our support for SB279 \"Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program,\" which will allow community based organizations to establish overdose prevention programs to reduce overdose deaths, which continue to occur at unprecedented levels in Maryland. Drug and alcohol related intoxication deaths increased in 2018 for the eighth year in a row, reaching a staggering 2,406 fatalities. And while deaths related to heroin and prescription opioids have trended downward in recent years, fentanyl-related deaths have continued to rise (up 42% from 2016-2017, and up another 18% from 2017-2018). With the constant year to year increase in 1 these numbers, it's critical to remember that in 2012, there were only 29 deaths from fentanyl. 2018 saw 1,888 such deaths, more than 65 times larger than the 2012 number. Maryland legislators have taken laudable steps to reduce the devastation of the overdose crisis, but they do not go far enough to halt the overdose epidemic. The General Assembly has approved measures to expand access to the life-saving medication naloxone, increase behavioral health treatment, and establish syringe services programs throughout the state. While these essential policies have increased opportunities for health and safety, the situation remains dire. We urge the General Assembly to authorize overdose and infectious disease prevention services, a proven intervention used across the globe to decrease overdose deaths. The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program mirrors more than 150 such programs already established across the world. More than 60 cities in 12 countries operate such programs, and numerous studies demonstrate the positive impacts. There is an abundance of evidence from Canada and various European countries showing that overdose prevention facilities reduce overdose deaths, provide an entry into healthcare, and reduce public use and publicly discarded syringes. These programs are cost-effective and do NOT encourage or increase 1 Maryland Dept. of Health, Drug- and Alcohol-Related Intoxication Deaths in Maryland, 2018 (May 2019), available at https://health.maryland.gov/vsa/Documents/Overdose/Annual_2018_Drug_Intox_Report.pdf additional drug use, youth drug use, or crime. In addition, a carefully studied underground facility in an undisclosed location in the U.S. has been in operation for five years, with impressive results. 2 Community members, healthcare professionals, law enforcement, homeless advocates, and others in over a dozen U.S. jurisdictions are exploring establishing such services. Since the introduction of the first bill in 2016, stakeholders in Baltimore and across the state have joined the movement for OPS . While other jurisdictions across the United States have struggled to gather community buy-in for OPS, BRIDGES Coalition of Maryland has led organizing efforts for OPS, conducting over 3000 conversations with Maryland constituents. Marylanders are joined by advocates across the United States, from Washington to North Carolina, in pushing for our representatives to take action to save lives. Under President Biden's new administration, there is an opportunity for change in the enforcement of \u00a7856 of the Controlled Substances Act within the Department of Justice for the first time in years. Overdose prevention services reduce health concerns and public order issues by reaching those most at risk of overdose who may otherwise use in public or semi-public locations. The programs are intended for those who are most marginalized including people who are homeless, people with mental health concerns, and street-based sex workers who use drugs. Many of these individuals live in poverty, with limited access to housing and other basic needs. The supervision provided at overdose prevention sites can dramatically reduce overdose fatality risk in Maryland and save scarce resources. In over 30 years of operation, there has never been a single overdose fatality at any overdose prevention facility in the world. A study of a 3 Canadian facility found that overdose mortality dropped 35% in the area surrounding the facility after it opened. Overdose prevention services also reduce hospital admissions associated with overdose 4 and various infections related to drug use, thus freeing up emergency services. A recent study showed Maryland ranks highest in the nation for rates of opioid-related hospital visits. In 2014 there 5 were 2,665 opioid-related emergency department visits in Maryland, up 41% from just a year earlier (with many of those admitted being repeat visitors). These visits come with significant costs, as 6 nearly 74% of opioid-related emergency department visits occur among individuals covered by Medicaid or without any coverage. Overdose prevention services will reduce these opioid- and overdose-related costs. We want to meet the needs of our neighbors, patients, friends, and family members. Overdose prevention service locations serve as an access point to substance use treatment and other health and social services. Far from encouraging drug use, overdose prevention sites help people reduce 2 Peter J. Davidson, Andrea M. Lopez, Alex H.

Referrals to behavioral health services are particularly important, because it is often difficult for participants to access this treatment independently. One study of a Canadian facility found that participants increased detoxification services by more than 30%. Currently a significant segment of Marylanders who could use 7 treatment are not accessing it; SAMHSA estimated that of Maryland residents with medically-documented illicit drug dependence, only about 11.8% received treatment. Overdose 8 prevention sites provide opportunities to establish therapeutic relationships and help individuals to access other healthcare services. Facilities can also provide important medical care on site or through connections to existing resources. This care includes testing and counseling for infectious diseases, which is critical as participants often have a high rate of infection of Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS. In 2017, 18.5% of Marylanders living with HIV were exposed through injection drug use. 9 An analysis of an overdose prevention site in Canada estimated the facility prevents 35 cases of HIV each year, a societal benefit of more than 6 million dollars annually. 10 These programs benefit the individual as well as the community dealing with the effects of the overdose epidemic. For instance, every study that examined the question found that overdose prevention facilities decrease nuisance and public order concerns in surrounding areas, do not increase loitering, and even reduce crime . These programs are also incredibly cost-effective; facilities save millions of dollars every year by preventing disease transmission and public nuisance. A 2017 cost-benefit analysis of a hypothetical facility in Baltimore found that for an annual cost of $1.8 million, a single overdose prevention site would generate $7.8 million in savings, preventing 3.7 HIV infections, 21 Hepatitis C infections, 374 days in the hospital for skin and soft-tissue infection, 5.9 overdose deaths, 108 overdose-related ambulance calls, 78 emergency room visits, and 27 hospitalizations, while bringing 121 additional people into treatment. 11 With historically high rates of overdose deaths, it is clear that our state faces a public health crisis of historic proportions. Countering it and ending needless deaths will require an innovative approach. Maryland needs new solutions to address substance use and overdose.

I am writing this letter to offer my full support to Sena te Bill 279 \"Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program,\" which will allow community -based organizations to establish overdose prevention programs to reduce overdose deaths, which continue to occur at unprecedented levels in Maryland. I have practiced and conducted research in the fields of HIV, viral hepatitis, and opioid use disorder over the last ten years. The data on Overdose Prevention Sites is unequivocal - not only in preventing overdose, but in reducing HIV and HCV transmission ri sk behaviors, and linking individuals with opioid use disorder into treatment. Furthermore, data supports that individuals with opioid use disorder want Overdose Prevention Sites, and would utilize them as a culturally - competent space centered in safety, c ompassion, and dignity. The \"War on Drugs\" philosophy of alienation, segregation, and stigmatization has left 750,000 Americans dead in the last 20 years. As a physician, I urge the Committee to listen to science, reason, and the voices of your constituent s most affected by opioid use disorder. I ask that the Finance Committee give SB279 a favorable report. If you have any further questions, I would be delighted to speak further on this vital and timely bill. I can be contacted at 202-550-2685 and at skattakuzhy@ihv.umaryland.edu . With deep 26, 2021 SB279 (Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program) - FAVORABLE Chair Delores Kelly Finance Committee Miller Senate Office Building, 3 East Annapolis, MD 21401 FROM: John Torsch, Baltimore County, Legislative District 8 Dear Chair Kelly and Senate Finance Committee Members, Ten years ago, my younger brother Danny died in my home of a multiple drug overdose. I have spent the past ten years representing a foundation in Danny's memory. The Daniel Carl Torsch Foundation (DCTF) advocates for harm reduction, addiction treatment, and recovery communities. The DCTF, has been a part of introducing several pieces of legislation that were signed into law, including the 2013 Overdose Response Program, which led to the standing orders for Naloxone that we have today. It is essential to share that I have lost more than 50 friends and family members to drug overdoses, drug-related health complications, and violence related to drugs. As a peer recovery specialist and person in long term recovery from drug addiction, my life is literally \"all addiction all the time.\" During the last few years, I have researched the Overdose Prevention Sites (OPS) model heavily, including visiting six of these sites in four different countries. There is no question that these sites save lives, increase access to treatment and reduce the rate of infectious disease. These sites serve the most vulnerable and stigmatized population in our society. In 2019, I toured Australia's first \"safe injection room\" in Sydney, Australia. The clinic has been in operation for over 15 years. They have never had a fatal overdose during this time and have made over 15,000 referrals to treatment. Miranda St Hill conducted the tour, Service Operations Manager for the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC). I was also able to meet Dr. Graham, who is the acting medical director. Beyond impressed, is the only way for me to describe my visit. The presence of such dedicated medical professionals who show such an incredible amount of compassion and patience for the population struggling with addiction was very inspiring. Most people who use the site are homeless and either sleep in nearby parks or at a local mission. The majority are unemployed. It is sporadic that someone drives, so DUIs are not a problem. But sometimes, some people have a scooter, and they stay until they are fit to ride. The police are needed 3-4 times a year to handle out of control patients. Far less than an emergency room. A full-time security guard has been there for eight years and knows all the clients by name. He is a compassionate man who has specialized training and a positive relationship with those who utilize it. The center has about 170 people come through on an average day. The police said they have a mutual understanding and do not target people waiting in line to enter the center even when they know these people have a small number of illegal drugs on them. Even though these sites' goal is to save lives and encourage treatment, finding a bed is not always easy. The wait can be days or even a week or more. By that time, the desire to seek help is often gone. The beauty of operating one of these sites in Maryland, especially in the Baltimore area, is that we have a tremendous amount of treatment options which are available immediately when someone is ready to take that first step. After leaving the center in Sydney, I stopped by a local mission to see what services they provide to the poor and homeless. While I was there, I noticed a man about my age. He was anxious to speak with me. We sat in the chapel and had one of the realist conversations about addiction and life on the street that I have ever had. He had been addicted for 16 years and has been homeless the whole time. He was able to articulate just how important the safe site was for him. The staff had saved his life over a dozen times. He knew that he would have been in some alley and died alone if he had not chosen to use his drugs at the site. He is part of a street outreach team that encourages others struggling with addiction to utilize the site. When I asked this man what his favorite thing about the site is and why it is so important to him, this is what he said, \"The safe site is the only place in Australia where I'm treated like a human being.\" One of the most touching moments of my life. He had tears in his eyes when he said this, which I shared with him. The connection I felt with this man, the love, and the pain we both shared is something that I will never forget. Hopefully, this testimony answers some questions for those who are hesitant or strongly oppose these sites coming to the US. 2021 will be the deadliest year in history for people who use drugs. Fentanyl has changed the game. Those of us working in this field realize that we are facing nothing less than chemical warfare. More people are using drugs in public places because they know the chance that they will overdose is high. How often do you see a bill proposed that does not ask for funding and simply asks for permission to save lives? That is all we are asking for with this bill, permission to save lives and treat our society's unwanted with the compassion they deserve and the skills that people like myself are trained for. Recently, one of the people that I was providing peer support to, died of Fentanyl poisoning. All he wanted was to live what he called \"normal\" life. The same lifestyle that countless people take for granted every day. He wanted to live in a place where he did not have to walk past a line of people selling the drugs he desperately was fighting to avoid. He tried to wake up in a bed in a warm house, have a cup of coffee and food in his fridge, drive an old pick up to a job he was good at so he could earn an honest wage. Then come home at night, eat dinner, sit in a recliner, and watch TV. Repeatedly, he would say that this is all he wanted. He was so close, and we were working on a plan. All he needed was an ID to make it happen, but he could not get the ID in time. He never got that everyday life back. Instead, he died alone, in the cold, while carrying the Narcan he used to save several other lives. You won't see his story on the news, read about him in any newspaper, or see RIP posts on social media. His name was Brian. He was not a statistic, he was my friend, and I miss him. If he had access to an Overdose Prevention Site, chances are strong he would utilize the site and still have a chance at that \"normal\" life. We recognize that this may be a controversial issue, and it is our intent to stand in support of all legislators who vote favorably on SB279. Mothers and fathers who have lost their children, treatment providers, addiction experts, and people in recovery from drug addiction; we will defend your decision with every breath and on every social media post. I look to more progressive countries to see what is working because the USA strategy is not working. The only hope we have to get ahead of this crisis is love and compassion, meeting people struggling where they are, reducing harm, and increasing access to treatment while providing peer support. The DCTF is prepared to offer our assistance in the operation of one of these Overdose Prevention Sites in an area of Baltimore County (21222). Please take off our handcuffs and say YES to letting us, the boots on the ground, do what is necessary to save and improve countless lives. We respectfully ask that the Finance Committee give SB279 a favorable report to stem the rising tide of overdose deaths in Maryland.

MRHA and its members support this legislation that establishes an Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program by a community -based organiz ation to provide a place for the consumption of pre -obtained drugs, provide sterile needles, administer first aid, and other services in at least two rural areas. This initiative in harm reduction by community -based organizations is a necessary step in add ressing and providing local, community solutions to combat substance abuse disorders. Rural Marylanders are at an increased risk for substance abuse disorder due to unique social determinants of health that create barriers to equitable and quality behavior al health services. MRHA's mission is to educate and advocate for the optimal health and wellness of rural communities and their residents. Membership is comprised of health departments, hospitals, community health centers, health professionals, and commu nity members in rural Maryland. Maryland law states that \"many rural communities in the State face a host of difficult challenges relating to persistent unemployment, poverty, changing technological and economic conditions, an aging population and an out -migration of youth, inadequate access to quality housing, health care and other services, and deteriorating or inadequate transportation, communications, sanitations, and economic development infrastructure.\" (West's Annotated Code of Maryland, State Finan ce and Procurement \u00a7 2 -207.8b) And while Maryland is one of the richest states, there is great disparity in how wealth is distributed. The greatest portion of wealth resides around the Baltimore/Washington Region; while further away from the I -95 corrido r, differences in the social and economic environment are very apparent. MHRA believes this legislation is important to support our rural communities and we thank you for your consideration.

The current opioid epidemic profoundly impacts the lives of thousands of Marylanders each year , including those who are pregnant and parenting. These Marylanders , and many more, would greatly benefit from the h arm reduction practices and security offered by SB0279. According to the C enter for Disease Control , Maryland has the third highest rate of overdose death s in the United States , falling behind only West Virginia and Delaware .1 Governor Larry Hogan himself declared a state of emergency in regard to the opioid crisis in 201 7 and since then, opioi d use and overdoses have continued to pose a threat to public health. Marylanders struggling with addiction continue to be forced into unsafe practices of using unsterile equipment that can transfer diseases . Many are forced to use these illegal substances in unsafe, isolated places in order to avoid legal repercussions. Using in these locations can leave folks struggling with addiction \u2014 including pregnant people -- vulnerable to death if they overuse , as well as sexual violence whil e under the influence in an unsafe, deserted area . Having access to an Overdose Prevention Site would ensure that more Marylanders have access to steril e equipment for their pre -obtained drugs ; would be attended to in the case of an overdose ; and, would have access to constant monitoring in a safe and secure medical facility. It eliminates the threat of predators preying on people who are unconscious while under the influence and introduces the possibility for recovery services, testing for specific diseases they may have contracted through needle sharing , and even reproductive health education services.2 We are hopeful that staff at these sites will be trained to assist pregnant people , so that more will come to seek help at such f acilities , rather than r isk poor health outcomes for fear of criminalization. Overall, this legislation will enhance the lives of those struggling with addiction and allow them access into a safer and monitored drug usage to reduce opioid related deaths. For these reasons, NARAL Pro -Choice Maryland urges a favorable committee report on SB0279 . Thank you for your time and consideration . 1 \"Drug Overdose Deaths,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, March 19, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html 2 Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program.

DRM works to decriminaliz e disability through the creat ion and expan sion of voluntary behavioral health services centered on civil rights , and thereby decrease inappropriate criminal justice involvement for people with disabilities. DRM supports SB 279 as a common -sense approach to save lives during an op ioid cris is, and preserves the civil rights of persons with disabilities by connecting them to voluntary ser vices to support their long -term recovery. There is strong correlation between men tal illness and substance abuse. Studies have found that about half of adults of those who experience a mental illness during their lives will also experience a substance use disorder and vice versa .1 SB 279 saves lives by providing a safe consumption spa ce with trained professionals to prevent death AND also provides connection to voluntary recovery and prevention services for persons experiencing these types of behavioral health disabilities. Too frequently, the lack of connections to voluntary services results in the criminal justice system filling the g aps in services . Persons with behavioral health disabilities involved in the criminal justice system experienc e horrendous outcomes including segregated incarceration , short -term expensive emergency room visits, enrollment in coer cive progra ms and services , or long -term institutionalizat ion. Over dose prevention site s as authorized by SB 279 u se voluntary approaches to engage with persons with behavioral health disabilities in rec overy. Such approa ches are proven to be as effective method to engage people with behavioral health disabilities with recovery as coercive methods2 and ensure the civil liberties of person with disabi lities. SB 279 would stem the tide of mass incarceration of persons with behavioral health disabilities, especially those of color, and provide voluntary services that would contribute to long -term re covery and preserve the dignity and civil rights of persons with disabilities. For all of these reasons, DRM urges a favorable report on SB 279 . 1 NIDA. \"Part 1: The Connection Between Substance Use Disorders and Mental Illness.\" National Institute on Drug Abuse , 28 Kisely, Steve R et al. \"Compulsory community and involuntary outpatient treatment for people with severe mental disorders.\" The Cochrane database of systematic reviews vol. 3,3 CD004408. 17 Mar. 2017, doi:10.1002/14651858.CD004408.pub5 Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

In Maryland, th ird quarter data from the Maryland Department of Health shows a 14% increase in the number of opioid overdose deaths in 2020, over the same period the year before. The numbers were up even before the impact of the pandemic early last year. Maryland must focus on proven ef fective harm reduction strategies. One strategy the State has refused to approve is t he creation of an Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program . NCADD -Maryland supports its creation through Senate Bill 279. This is a harm reduction stra tegy whereby people who consume drugs, can do so under clin ical supervision. The primary purpose of this is to provide immediate assistance in the case of an overdose. Along with direct assistance in saving p eople's lives, these program s, as proposed in SB 279 , would also avail people of: First aid and care for wounds; Sterile syringes and their collection; Referral to services for substance use disorders, HIV, hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases , reproductive health care, and wound care; and Educati on regarding the risk of overdoses and the transmission of various infectious diseases. There are more than 100 such program s in jurisdictions around the world, and a number of cities in the United States are moving toward establishing them. These kinds o f programs have been researched and evaluated for years. Multiple studies show that they reduce the sharing of syringes, and therefore of the transmission of HIV a nd hepatitis. Research also shows a reduction in overdose deaths , discarded syringes, and an increase in the number of people who enter substance use disorder treatment. Overdose prevention sites will reduce opioid overdose deaths and begin to address the public health consequences of the crisis . We urge a favorable report on SB 279 . The Maryla nd Affiliate of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD -Maryland) is a statewide organization that works to influence public and private policies on addiction, treatment, and recovery, reduce the stigma associated with the disease, an d improve the understanding of addictions and the recovery process. We advocate for and with individuals and families who are affected by alcoholism and drug addiction. In support of SB0279 -- Anne Sawyer.pdf Uploaded by: Sawyer, Anne Position: FAVI am writing in support of SB0279 to authorize overdose prevention sites (OPS). I am a long time resident of Highlandtown/Baltimore Highlands in Baltimore City, a neighborhood where many people who use drugs (PWUD) live and work, where there are open air drug markets and the well known sex worker stroll, Conkling Street. I also have experience in harm reduction, including 8 years of Thursday nights working on the needle exchange van on The Block in Baltimore City. If there were an OPS that my PWUD neighbors could access, many would be able not only to access equipment for safer injection and be safe from dying of opioid overdose, but also to access other health and social services including drug treatment programs and homeless services. In the past few years, there have been many house fires near where I live, most in vacant houses to which PWUD gained access. Although establishment of OPS in Maryland will not immediately prevent all the house fires in my neighborhood, it will help reduce them in several ways. First, fires started by people while they are using or soon after will be reduced if those people are using at an OPS. Second, over time, though harm reduction, people will be given opportunities to make changes in their lives that will keep them and their communities safer and healthier.

Truman Parkway Annapolis, Maryland 21401 Phone: 410 -222-7095 Fax: Kalyanaraman, M.D. SB 0279 COMMITTEE: POSITION: Letter of Support TITLE: Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program BILL ANALYSIS: SB 0279 authorizes the establishment of an Overdose and Infectious Disease S ervices Program by a community -based organization. The Maryland Department of Health may approve up to six programs within the State meeting certain criteria . An established program shall provide a location supervised by health car e professionals or other trained staff where drug users can consume pre -obtained drugs through provided sterile injection supplies. The programs must provide access or referrals to certain services (counseling, HIV/hepatitis/STD testing), education, and sta ff training. POSITION RATIONALE: The Anne Arundel County Department of Health supports SB 0279. This legislation would allow community -based organizations, in jurisdictions that are supportive, to es tablish an Overdose and Infectious Disease Service s Program. The benefits of providing overdose prevention services include decreased bloodborne spread of infection, increased access and utilization of detoxification and drug dependence treatment , and reduced public drug use. Safe Hygienic Drug Use This bill would require eli gible programs to provide sterile injection supplies and secure needle disposal. Nonsterile injections can lead to transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis, bacterial infections , and fungal infection s. Providing access to steri le syring es and other injection equipment would reduce the transmission of these diseases . Additionally, access to sterile syringes would decrease other serious, life - threatening, and costly health problems such as infections of the heart valves (endocarditis), ser ious skin infections, an d deep tissue abscesses. 2 https://www.cdc.gov/ssp/syringe -services -programs -faq.html The CDC has identified additional emerging infectious disease risks r elated to injection drug use including increases in methicillin -resistant S taphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection rates, which increased 124% between 2011 and 2016 among people who inject drugs. In addition, people who inject drugs are 16 times as likely a s other people to develo p invasive MRSA infections. These programs would also be required to provide access or referrals to HIV, viral hepatitis and STD testing ; wound care ; and reproductive health education . Programs will also be required to provide education on the risks of c ontracting HIV and viral hepatitis and well as education on the proper disposal of needles and syringes. Connection to these services is essential in areas with a high incidence of drug use. Increased Access to Health and Social Se rvices Eligible p rogra ms are required to provide access or referrals to substance abuse disorder counseling and treatment services as well as those services listed above. The use of overdose prevention programs is associated with increased uptake of both detoxification and drug dependence treatment, including opioid substitution (i.e. heroin to methadone or b uprenorphine ). A Canadian cohort study documents that attendance at a Vancouver facility was associated with increased rates of referral to addiction care centers and increa sed rates of uptake of detoxification treatment and methadone maintenance. Th ese program s would provide harm reduction services and engagement into treatment for those people who might not otherwise seek treatment . (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/2734/POD_Drug%20consumption%20rooms.pd f) Reduced Public Drug Use and Safety Evaluation studies have found an overall positive imp act on the communities where overdose prevention programs are located. Their establishment has been associated with a decrease in public injecting and a reduction in t he number of syringes discarded in the area. For example, in Barc elona, a fourfold reduct ion was reported in the number of unsafely disposed syringes being collected in the vicinity from a monthly average of over 13 ,000 in 2004 to around 3,0 00 in 2012. A study in Sydney noted that there was also no evidence that the exi stence of the facility l ed to either an increase or decrease in thefts or robberies around the facility.

I am proud to join many others who have written in in favor of this bill. As a harm reductionist I'm not in the business of judging people, of denying them care, or of stigmatizing them for what they do. I am in the business of listening to people, serving people, and saving lives. I am in the business of offering compre hensive care that meets people where they are . I am in the business of helping people reach the goals they've set for themselves with the tools available to us , but enough about me - What I'd like to know is what business you are in. Are you in the busi ness of purporting to care? The business of enforcing abstinence -based models that have historically never worked? The business of turning folks away while people die in the street? Or are you in the same business I'm in? In these last several months as the world has navigate d uncharted territory there has been an emphasis on public health and communal care like never before, and its been so amaz ing to see what happens when our government prioritizes health and sa fety of citizens, and the unfortunate reality of wh at happens when it doesn 't. The landscape of subs tance use shows what happens w hen it doesn 't. There has be en a pandemic of preventable harm in this cou ntry for seemingly endless y ears and seemingly no desire to miti gate nor stop it. Every year people die preventable deaths because of an over emphasis on abstinence and punitvity than commitment to care and empathy ; car e and empath y that we 've seen are possible f rom our civil servants. We understand communities self-regulate and know themselves best and that is exactly why We want to keep power in communities while prioritizing harm reduc tion and safety. As a harm reduc tion peer brilliantly poin ted o ut to me recently, the reality is we already have consumption sites: they take the form of alleyways, abandoned homes, port -a-potty s, Burger King bathrooms, bus stops , and other dark cor ners. These sa me spaces serves as graves when people aren't empowered to be safer. We can continue to ignore and invisibilize people or we can serve th em. We can continue to punish and preach abstinence, or we can join the other 60 countries in th e worl d who already offer O PS, countries where the se centers have never seen a single fatal overdose .

I support the Senate Bill 279 \"Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program,\" which will allow community-based organizations such as our organization to establish overdose prevention programs to reduce overdose deaths, which continue to occur at unprecedented levels in Maryland. As a nurse practitioner that takes care of people who use drugs, I have seen first-hand the need for additional overdose prevention services. I prescribe buprenorphine, a medication to treat opioid use disorder, and spend a lot of time talking about overdose prevention with my patients. Since I have started working as a nurse practitioner, I have had many patients experience fatal and non-fatal overdoses. My patients also experience other health related harms such as skin and soft tissue infections, HIV, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases. The current services we have available are not doing enough to keep people alive and healthy. The data supporting overdose prevention sites is incredible. I strongly believe that having overdose prevention sites in the state of Maryland would be very beneficial and would continue the state's legacy of being a harm reduction leader in the country. For over 30 years, it has been proven that Overdose Prevention Sites save lives. We urge the General Assembly to authorize overdose and infectious disease prevention services, a proven intervention used across the globe to decrease overdose deaths. The proposed Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program mirrors more than 150 such programs already established across the world. More than 60 cities in 12 countries operate such programs, and numerous studies demonstrate the positive impacts. In all of the 150+ OPS around the world, in which millions of supervised drug injections have occurred, no one has died of a fatal overdose. We ask that the Finance Committee give SB279 a favorable report.

Kelley Chair, Finance Committee 3 East Miller Office Building Annapolis, MD 21401 -1991 RE: SB0279 - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program - Letter of Opposition Dear Chair Kelley and Comm ittee Members: The Maryland Board of Nursing (\"the Board\") respectfully submits this letter of opposition for Senate Bill 279 (SB 279) - Public Health - Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program. This bill authorizes the establishment of an Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program by a community - based organization. The bill requires a program to provide a location supervised by health care professionals or other trained staff where drug users can consume pre -obtained drugs. The progr am will also provide for distribution of sterile injection supplies and collection of used needles and syringes. Health care providers will need to educate program participants about safe injection practices, monitor participants for potential overdose and administer rescue medication as needed. The bill prohibits Board disciplinary action against a licensee or certificate holder for involvement in the operation or use of the program services. The Board agrees that the prevention of drug overdose and diseas e is critical. Substance use disorder is non -discriminatory in that it can affect an individual at any age, of any gender, race or nationality, and of any occupation. However, the Board believes that this bill increases the risk to public safety. Health ca re professionals may be just one of the types of individuals who utilize the services of this program. With how the bill is currently written, health care professionals who participate in the program, as current substance users, would not be prevented from reporting to their place of practice while still under the influence of controlled dangerous substances. In essence, the Board would be forced to wait until a complaint of working impaired is filed before taking any action to protect patients. This howeve r, overlooks the fact that harm may have already occurred. This bill not only has the potential to encourage drug use, but it may also increase the instances of diversion of medication from patients by health care providers. Drug diversion occurs when a health care provider takes medication prescribed to patients, usually controlled dangerous substances, for their own use or for sale to others. Program participants would be allowed to bring pre -obtained drugs without being questioned about how the drugs wer e obtained.

Jan 2021. https://www.safehousephilly.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2021 - 01/US%20v%20Safehouse%203d%20Circ%20Opinion.pdf This bill further jeopardizes Maryland nurse's ability to stay enrolled in the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC). The NLC allows for nurses to have one multistate license with the ability to practice in all states that have adopted the Compact's le gislative language. The NLC serves to increase access to health care, particularly for underserved communities. To be eligible for multi - state practice, a nurse may only hold an unencumbered license, or a license that is not revoked, suspended, or made pro bationary or conditional. A nurse must be authorized to engage in the full and unrestricted practice of nursing. Nurses who may utilize the Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program, and who may hold a multistate license, will be in direc t violation of the NLC's rules1. The nurse will lose their privilege to practice in multiple states. Which could result over time in fewer nurses being able to practice outside of Maryland. The Board would not be meeting its mission of protecting the publi c if it has information about drug use by a licensee or certificate holder, and does not act upon this information. Additionally, the Board does not automatically resort to discipline for instances of drug use. The Board offers a safe practice (alternative to discipline) program for licensees and certificate holders with substance use disorders who meet certain criteria. The mission of the safe practice program is to ensure patient safety by monitoring nursing professionals who are struggling with substance use disorders. Enrollment in this program is confidential, and does not pose any infraction on a participant's license or certification. An individual enrolled in this program may also keep an active license and work while following a certain number of st ipulations. The Board has provided participation data for the safe practice program from 2016 to 2020 in the table below. Committee Activity Total Active Participants 471 Discharges Received 92 Agreements Signed 99 The Board would also like to reference the decision rendered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the case United States v. Safe House (January 12, 2021)2. The Third Circuit found that owning or operating a \"drug -involved facility\" (a place for using, sharing, or producing drugs) violated the Controlled Substances Act and its operators would be subject to criminal penalties should there be charges. With the establishment of the Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program in Maryland, the Program itself may also be subject to the same challenges under the Controlled Substances Act. For the reasons discussed above, the Board of Nursing respectf ully submits this letter of opposition to SB0279. [1] The Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators.

SB279.UNFAVORABLE.MDRTL.LBogley.pdf Uploaded by: Bogley, Laura Position: UNF Opposition Statement HB396/SB279 Public Health-Overdose and Infectious Disease Prevention Services Program By Laura Bogley-Knickman, JD Director of Legislation, Maryland Right to Life We Strongly Oppose HB396/SB279 On behalf of our members across the state, we respectfully object to HB/SB as written. Without your amendment, this bill could be exploited to expand public funding for abortion and abortion providers. We object to any state mandate that requires taxpayers, employers or insurance carriers to provide funding or coverage for abortion. Such government mandates are a violation of citizens' Constitutional freedoms and natural rights, including the right to life and freedom of speech, assembly and religion. Pregnancy is not a Disease Abortion is not healthcare. It is violence and brutality that ends the lives of unborn children through suction, dismemberment or chemical poisoning. The fact that 85% of OB-GYNs in a representative national survey do not perform abortions on their patients is glaring evidence that abortion is not an essential part of women's healthcare. Women have better options for comprehensive health care. There are 14 federally qualifying health care centers for every Planned Parenthood in Maryland. Abortion has a disproportionate impact on Black Americans who have long been targeted by the abortion industry for eugenics purposes. As a result abortion is the leading cause of death of Black Americans, more than gun violence and all other causes combined. No public funding for abortions Taxpayers should not be forced to fund elective abortions, which make up the vast majority of abortions performed in Maryland. State funding for abortion on demand with taxpayer funds is in direct conflict with the will of the people. A 2019 Marist poll showed that 54% of Americans, both \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" oppose the use of tax dollars to pay for a woman's abortion. Never has more than 40% of the American public supported taxpayer funding of abortion regardless of the context or way in which the question is asked. Love them both 83% of Americans polled favor laws that protect both the lives of women and unborn children. Public funds instead should be prioritized to fund health and family planning services which have the objective of saving the lives of both mother and children, including programs for improving maternal health and birth and delivery outcomes, well baby care, parenting classes, foster care reform and affordable adoption programs. Funding restrictions are constitutional The Supreme Court has held that the alleged constitutional \"right\" to an abortion \" implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds .\" When a challenge to the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment reached the Supreme Court in 1980 in the case of Harris v. McRae , the Court ruled that the government may distinguish between abortion and other procedures in funding decisions -- noting that \" no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life \" -- and affirmed that Roe v. Wade had created a limitation on government, not a government funding entitlement. 420 Chinquapin Round Road / Suite 2-I / Annapolis, MD "}
