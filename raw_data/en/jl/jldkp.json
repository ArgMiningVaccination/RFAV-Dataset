Sorry for taking so long :) I don't catch every episode, but when I do, I find myself inspired in new ways. Thanks for doing what you do and for opening my world up to new ideas through such a thoughtfully curated guest list. I came initially for the relationship stuff, and I love how you've evolved along the way, navigating to topics that call to you. I'm along for the ride and loving the journey you've taken me on. Appreciate you. So much insight & growth!! Where would I be without Mark Groves and his guests?! I have learned so much about myself, those I Iove, the relationships I'm in, and those I hope to be in one day. I love Mark's candor and tough-love teachings; they often hit home. Thought-provoking, stirring, and encouraging. Bravo! Voice of reason Mark has the uncanny ability to deep dive into people's inner thoughts and motivations without even trying. This podcast provides very interesting points of view from wonderful guests (Africa Brooke is my favourite) and he encourages discourse in a world of censorship and self censorship. Love this podcast and Mark, keep "}
