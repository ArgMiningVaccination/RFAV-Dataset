Good sleep is a key cornerstone of good health. Without good sleep you can feel restless, anxious, stressed, cranky, foggy, angry, sad - a real mixed bag of often unstable emotions. This can make you feel really unbalanced. On top of this you are much more likely to crave stimulants to help you through your day. You might want caffeine, sugar, alcohol, nicotine, and perhaps even medication. Add to the fact that you might feel you need to eat more and are less likely to want to exercise and we start to get a really clear understanding of how much poor sleep can impact our health at all levels. When you get stressed or anxious your sleep can suffer and with that poor sleep then you can get into a cycle of broken sleep, which can become a negative habit you need to break. A plan based on natural therapy can help you manage anxiety and stress and promote better sleep, resulting in improved health physically, mentally, and emotionally. Good sleep is based on having a good bedtime routine and reduced stress. You need to get 8 - 9 hours' sleep every night to feel well. You need to go into a deep healing sleep every night, which includes dreaming. Then you can wake up refreshed physically, mentally, and emotionally and ready for the day ahead. Try this simple good sleep plan based on natural therapies to lower your stress and anxiety. - Going to bed and waking up at regular times - Having supper at least 2 hours before you sleep - No screens in the bedroom and for at least 1 hour before sleep - no phones, no tablets, no laptops, no TV! - Instead in that 1 hour before bed do some or all of the following - - Drink something warm like chamomile tea or milk - Have a warm bath or shower - Clear your mind of the day, read, write a journal, or sketch in bed Homeopathy is great for managing anxiety and stress. Sometimes you can be doing all the right things and still a good night's sleep can allude you and this is where homeopathy can help. Homeopathy can be used for anticipatory anxiety. Homeopathy as a holistic form of medicine can be used for emotions, mental health problems as well as physical symptoms. Here are my top 7 homeopathic medicines to help you promote and keep good, deep sleep and ease your anxious mind so you can feel fantastic and get on with your life. 7 Acute Homeopathic Medicines to Ease an Anxious Mind - Passiflora When you need Passiflora you will be feeling restless either once you're in bed or, you might wake up at 3 - 4am then doze until 7.30am missing out on that vital deep sleep. You will wake up feeling groggy and you will want peace and quiet. Your head might feel heavy and dull with difficulty in concentration. - Valerian When you need Valerian there will be great sleeplessness, with much tossing and turning and anxiety. When there is finally some sleep dreams can be confusing. There can be muscular cramps as well felt in your body. - Nat Mur When you need Nat Mur your mind won't let you sleep there will be an idea or perhaps something that has happened dwelling in your mind and it won't go away. There might be grief tied in with it. Perhaps even crying in the sleep or sleep walking. You will feel sleepy in the afternoon but have great difficulty sleeping at night. - Arsenicum Alb When you need Arsenicum Alb there will be disturbed sleep, with twitching and even talking in your sleep. You will feel anxiety and restlessness. Dreams will be full of worry, sorrow and fear. - Nux Vom You need Nux Vom if you have sleeplessness from a rush of ideas. Typically there will be waking up at 3am and then an inability to sleep until morning, upon waking you can feel wretched. In the evening there would have been tiredness, perhaps even a need for a nap but any sleep that does happen will be filled with hurry and worry. There can be talking in the sleep too. - Gelsemium If you are anticipating an event and it is making you feel weak and stressed keeping you up at night, then this could be the right homeopathic remedy for you to take. Gelsemium is great at calming anticipatory anxiety and promoting deeper, better sleep. - Coffea If your thoughts are wandering with a rush of ideas, especially at night then this remedy can help you have a better quality of sleep. The senses can feel heightened, and any small noise can awaken you at night. Once finally asleep there can be frequent and sudden starting and waking.
