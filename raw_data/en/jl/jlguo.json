EINSTEIN SYMPOSIUM CELEBRATES NEW PRESIDENT OF YESHIVA UNIVERSITY In celebration of Richard M. Joel's investiture as the fourth presidentof Yeshiva University, the College of Medicine hosted a special sympo-sium, \"The Jewish Genome: Fact or Fancy,\" on September 16th inRobbins Auditorium. The symposium featured four Einstein scientists whose work involves the study ofJews and their genetic heritage. Dr. Dominick P. Purpura, The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean,organized the symposium, notingthat \"the College of Medicine has been a leader in genetics researchfor many decades. In fact, the first department of genetics at any medical school in the United Stateswas established at our institution in 1963. We think it is especially appropriate, therefore, that themedical school's participation in the investiture of Yeshiva's new president, Richard Joel, include aspecial program on the subject ofJewish genetic research.\" The symposium speakers and the topics they discussed were: Dr. Susan Gross, associate professor ofclinical obstetrics & gynecology andwomen's health and of clinical pedi- atrics, \" The Wandering Jewish Genome .\" An expert on Jewishgenetic diseases\u2014and a leader in ongoing efforts to eliminate them\u2014Dr. Gross discussed Jewish migrationthroughout history. Dr. Robert Burk, professor of pediatrics, microbiology & immun-ology, obstetrics & gynecology andwomen's health, and of epidemiology and population health, \" The CLAL Study: Cancer, Longevity, Ancestry andLifestyle .\" Dr. Burk focused his talk on one portion of the CLAL study:the Prostate Cancer Research Project, which he directs. The proj-ect aims to identify g enetic differences and sim ilarities withinpopulation groups that are especially to prostatecancer, andthe Amish. Dr. asso- ciate ofmedicine and genetics,\"Why Live to 120? \" Dr. Barzilai discussed hisresearch, which is aimed at identify-ing genetic factorsthat may explain why some excep-tionally old peopleremain free of dis- eases that affectothers at a muchyounger Dr. Ruth professor demiology of the and the Dr. ShoshanahTrachtenberg Frackman Faculty Scholar in Biomed-ical Ethics, \" Studying the Jewish Genome: Ethical Implications .\" A renowned bioethicist, Dr. Macklin discussed the ethical issues sur-rounding studies that focus on Jews and other population groups. Prior to his election as the fourth president of Yeshiva, Richard Joelwas president and international director of Hillel, the organizationfor Jewish college students, for 14 years. His connections to the University, however, run deep. He is an alumnusof a Yeshiva high school, and as avery young man he headed the University's alumni affairs office. An attorney who received his bachelor's and law degrees fromNew York University, he also served as an associate dean and professorat the Cardozo School of Law. Twoof his children are Yeshiva graduatesand a third is currently attendingStern College. His presence at Einstein marked a homecoming of sorts. Earlier inhis career Mr. Joel served as an assistant district attorney in theBronx. ROSSETTI HEADS DIABETES RESEARCH CENTER Dr. Luciano Rossetti, professor of medicine and of molecular pharma-cology, and The Judy R. and AlfredA. Rosenberg Professor of DiabetesResearch, has become director of the Diabetes Research Center at Einstein and principal investigatorof the NIH-funded Diabetes Researchand Training Center (DRTC). In both of these roles he succeeded Dr. Norman Fleischer, professor of medicine, who led these programswith great distinction for more than25 years. Dr. Fleischer continues his important involvement in thediabetes center and DRTC as co- continued on page 17Living things consist of nucleic acids, proteins,carbohydrates andlipids. But until recently,only the first two of these \"basic four\" attracted a lot of scientific attention. First camegenomics, the effort to decipher the full complement of DNA in the genes of humans and other species, and recently we've hadproteomics, the study of all theproteins made by our cells and tissues and the shapes that theseproteins assume. Carbohydrates,by contrast, have been a biological backwater. Indeed, one scientistrecently invoked Rodney Dangerfield when describing how little respectthe field has garnered. Sugar's neglect is due partly to an image problem: When we consider carbohydrates at all, wethink of molecules that do little more than provide energy (e.g. glucose) or store it (starch in potatoes, glycogen in animals),offer some structural support (cellulose in plants) or give someof us gas (oligosaccharides inbeans). But perhaps the main reason researchers have shunned sugars is their daunting complexity. The four nucleotides that com- prise DNA, and the 20 amino acidsin proteins, connect like cars on asubway train to form genes andproteins that always have simplelinear structures. By contrast, the10 or so simple sugars (monosac- charides) found in mammals cancombine with each other at numer-ous points to form huge branchingmolecules in which one sugar may be joined to several others.Deciphering the primary structuresof these polysaccharides\u2014the composition and sequence of their building blocks and the position ofthe chemical bonds that hold them together\u2014can be exceedingly difficult. And while research labsusing automated equipment canreadily synthesize protein and DNA molecules containing hundreds ofindividual building blocks, onlyrecently have the most specialized labs synthesized oligosaccharidesof 12 units in length. Researchers have long known that carbohydrates combine with proteins to form glycoproteins orwith lipids to form glycolipids andthat cell surfaces \"glycoconjugates.\" But the sugarycomponents of these lipids andproteins were often dismissed asdecorations\u2014almost literally asicing on the cake. Now it's clear that the carbohy- drates festooning cell-surfaceproteins and lipids can profoundlyinfluence their three-dimensionalstructure as well as their function.Studies in recent years have shownthat carbohydrates play key roles in many important biological activ-ities including cell signaling, theimmune response, inflammation,embryo implantation and develop-ment and cancer progression. Biologists with a sweet tooth for carbohydrates have carved out aspecialty of their own called glyco-biology. The effort by glycobiologiststo identify all of an organism's glycans (the sugar polymersattached proteins or lipids) iscalled glycomics. There's no doubtthat glycomics is still in its infancy, perhaps where genomics was inthe 1960s. But in a sign of the field's growing importance, the National Institutes of Health in October 2001 awarded a five-year,$37-million grant to create andfund the Consortium for FunctionalGlycomics, an international groupof some 70 investigators who arecarrying out research in this area. The consortium is focusing its research efforts on carbohydrates involved in cell signaling\u2014 in particular, the sugar portion of glyocoprotein and glycolipid cell-surface receptors. When activatedby ligands (molecules on the surfaces of other cells or in theextracellular milieu), these cell-surface receptors transmit a signalcascade to the nucleus that tellsthe cell what to do. Some sugar groupings are crucial to cell signal- ing because they provide glyco-proteins with the all-important\"active sites\" to which the signal-triggering ligands bind. Three of the consortium's investigators are Einstein facultymembers\u2014Drs. Pamela Stanley,Fred Brewer and Steven Porcelli. Although they approach glycomicsfrom different directions, eachstudies the role that carbohydratesplay in the all-important task of signaling. Dr. Pamela Stanley, professor of cell biology, plays a lead-ing role in the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. She's a member of the consortium steeringcommittee, which meets every twoweeks via videoconference \u2014 and is in a good position to answer thequestion: Why is the $37-millionNIH grant that created the glycomics consortium referred to as a \"glue grant\"? \"The idea is that gluing together a group of scientists into a consortium shouldspeed progress in the field,\" sheexplains. Dr. Stanley studies glycoprotein cell-surface receptors that mediatecell-to-cell signaling, with a particu-lar focus on how mutations thataffect the sugar component ofthese receptors can in turn affect normal development. Her researchclearly shows that constructing acarbohydrate is no simple task. 2 3 DR. MACKLINNewsReel PRESIDENT AND MRS. JOEL AND DEAN PURPURA AT THE SYMPOSIUM RECEPTION.The Sweet Science of Glycomics DR. BURK DR. GROSS DR. BARZILAI Sugars combine with lipids and proteins to form the glycolipids and glycoproteins that bristle from cell surfaces.

To that end, Dr. Stanley has developed Chinese hamsterovary (CHO) cell lines containing a variety of defective glycosyltrans-ferases. These cell lines have yielded much information aboutglycosyltransferases and haveproven useful for testing the roleof glycosyltransferases in humandisease. In 1980's, a Belgian Jaak identifieda new set in human diseases.Jaeken was treating children whowere mentally retarded and unable to walk. On a hunch, he did liver function tests on these childrenand found that their serum glyco-proteins were \"underglycosylated,\"meaning the the cause: a defect inan enzyme called phosphomanno-mutase that helps to synthesize the carbohydrate portion of cell- surface glycoproteins. Twelve such disorders, all quite rare, have now been identified.Each involves a defect in a differentglycosylation enzyme, and collec-tively they are CDG's are autosomal recessivedisorders, occurring only whenboth parents contribute a gene carrying a mutation. Dr. Stanley has used her mutant CHO tissue cultures\u2014created wellbefore CDG's were known toexist\u2014to test whether mutationssuspected of causing CDG's aretruly responsible for the observedhealth problems. She uses a tech-nique that resembles gene therapy. Each CHO cell line has a muta- tion that alters the activity of aparticular glycosylation enzyme.Dr. Stanley had previously shownthat a cell line can be \"repaired\" by transfecting its cells with \"normal\"DNA that is known to code for thatenzyme. Now, when a new CDG isdiscovered, Dr. Stanley can performthe same sort of transfection, this time taking DNA that codes forthe putatively defective enzyme and transfecting it into a CHO cellline that's defective for the sameenzyme. \"If the DNA from theCDG patient fails to repair themutant cell line, then this providesgood evidence that the mutationwas indeed the reason that the person was sick,\" Dr. Stanleyexplains. \"New CDG's are beingdiscovered all the time,\" says Dr.Stanley. She also notes that, just in the past year, researchers haveshown that two subclasses of mus-cular dystrophy are caused bydefective andhave tentatively linked two othersubclasses to such defects. \"We'venever understood the role of sugars in muscle development, and now we may be learning theanswer,\" she says. So far, diseases known to be associated with glycosylation arerelatively rare. But Dr. Stanley wouldn't be at all surprised if defective glycosyltransferases areimplicated in more commonhealth problems. She mentionspsoriasis and other inflammatorydiseases as leading candidates,since glycoprotein receptors areintimately involved in the body'sinflammatory response. \"It's clear that human disease can result if glycosyltransferasesdon't build the right sugars,\" saysDr. Stanley. \"Now we can start thinking about drugs or possibly even gene therapies that can helppeople with such problems.\" The receptors on cell surfacesaccount for only half thecell-signaling story: Something else must come alongand initiate the signal. As notedearlier, a molecule that binds toand activates a cell-surface receptoris known as a ligand. And arguablythe most important ligands are the lectins. Found on the surfaces of both plant and animal cells, lectins are \"carbohydrate recognition pro-teins.\" A section of the lectin molecule, known as its \"domain,\"activates the receptor on anothercell by binding to one or more ofits carbohydrate molecules. Morespecifically, the binding is betweenthe lectin domain and the \"active\" portion of the carbohydrate mole-cule, referred to as its epitope. Researchers have studied plant lectins for many years. One of theworld's most notorious toxins\u2014 ricin, derived from castor beansand much in the news recently\u2014isactually a plant lectin. There arealso animal lectins, the first of which was purified in 1974 by twoEinstein researchers\u2014Drs. AnatolMorell (now retired) and RichardStockert, professor of medicine\u2014along with collaborators at theNIH. Dr. Fred Brewer, professor inthe department of molecular phar- macology, has continued Einstein'snotable tradition of lectin research.He started out studying plantlectins and more recently hasworked with the animal variety. Dr. Brewer's studies have provid- ed important insights into lectin- carbohydrate binding. He has focused on the phenomenon of \"multivalency,\" which refers to thefact that lectins, and the carbohy-drates they bind to, often possessmore than one binding site as partof their molecular makeup. Forexample, the carbohydrate compo-nent of a glycoprotein will oftensprout several branches,with each containing A glycoprotein withtwo carbohydrate branches willhave a valence of two if both those 5Unlike protein synthesis in which cells faithfully translate RNAderived from a DNA blueprint,there is no straightforward r oad- map for making carbohydrates.Instead, a complex series of enzy-matic reactions transfers simplesugars to growing polysaccharides;these polysaccharides are then covalently attached to of synthesizing out glycosy- lation are glycosyltransferases. Sogenes don't code for sugars as they do for proteins, but they do encodethe glycosyltransferases that build sugars and transfer them to pro-teins. The first glycosyltransferase gene was cloned in the late 1980's. As testament to the importance of glycosylation, current estimatessuggest that more than 300 genes\u2014at least one percent of the entiregenome\u2014encode enzymes involved in this process. Dr. Stanley's group at Einstein has cloned several of these glycosyltransferases. The process of glycosyla- tion has much in common with an assembly line, featuring numerous enzymes that carry out specialized tasks: Each enzymetransfers just one sugar (e.g.,fucose)\u2014and only to a particularlinkage (e.g., fucose added togalactose). So synthesizing a typical branched-chain carbohydrate mayrequire the expression of 50 or so glycosyltransferase genes. And likecars on an assembly line, carbohy-drates are built on the move:Membrane-bound glycosyltrans-ferases in the endoplasmic reticulum, and later in the Golgi apparatus, sequentially add sugarsto (or trim them from) a carbohy- drate as it travels through theseorganelles. (Just how this multi-enzyme task force is recruited tobuild a particular carbohydrateremains unclear. But some credit goes to transcription factors, theproteins that regulate the expres-sion of genes.) Among the many types of mole- cules formed through glycosylationare the glycoproteins destined tobecome cell-surface receptors.Once synthesized, these glycopro-teins migrate to the cell surface, ready to perform their job of detecting signals and transmittingthem to the cell nucleus. One of the most important receptors in all of biology is Notch, a large receptor on the cell surfacesof Drosophila (where it was firstdiscovered) as well as all othermulti-cellular creatures includinghumans. Notch receptors play keyroles in sending signals that control cell growth and determine cellfate\u2014telling some cells to prolifer-ate, for example, and others to undergo programmed cell death. It has been known for a decade that a protein called Fringe influ- ences Notch signaling duringembryonic development and pro-foundly affects the way tissues are organized. Fringe \"directs\" Notchsignaling by modulating the abilityof ligands on adjacent cells to activate Notch receptors. Notchsignaling via these cell-cell interac-tions, for example, guides theformation of somites in developing mammals. In a study published in 2000 in the journal Nature , Dr. Stanley's group, along with colleagues from three other institutions, revealed the mechanism by which Fringe controls Notch signaling: by func-tioning as a glycosyltransferase.Fringe transfers the sugar N-acetyl- glucosamine to the sugar fucose,which in turn is attached to about24 of the 36 epidermal growth factor-like repeats that form a largeportion of the Notch receptor. \"In showing that Fringe's activitydepends on its ability to put asugar onto the Notch receptor,\"says Dr. Stanley, \"an entirely newparadigm for how Notch signalingis was revealed.\" Fringe's transfer of N-acetylglu- cosamine to fucose on Notch turns out to be necessary\u2014but notsufficient\u2014for Fringe to modulateNotch signaling in a co-culture test assay. In a study published in 2001in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Dr. Stanley and colleagues showed that the \"Fringeeffect\" depends on yet anothersugar being transferred to theNotch receptor\u2014this time, galactose added to the N-acetylglucosaminealready provided by Fringe. \"Thiswork identified a new glycosyl- transferase that is involved inmodulating Notch signaling,\" Dr. Stanley says. One way to study glycosyltrans- ferases is to induce mutations in genes that code for them and then An entirely new paradigm was revealed for howNotch signaling is regulated. 7 very important biological process, namely the apoptosis of susceptibleT cells. This finding has spawnedan enormous research effort tofind crosslinked lattices in other biological systems.\" Galectins, one of several sub- classes of animal lectins, are sonamed because these proteins bind to the carbohydrate galactose. Dr. Brewer began working withgalectins before learning of Dr. Baum's work with galectin-1and now studies how othergalectins\u2014there are 14 of them in all\u2014may be influencing T-cellapoptosis. \"We now know the molecular structure of most of the galectins,\"says Dr. Brewer, \"and they've allturned out to be two subunits, each capable ofrecognizing galactose. What makes them fascinating is their biological activity: Nearly all of them areinvolved in inducing apoptosis.\"But one member of the galectinfamily has long been known toinhibit apoptosis. That's galectin-3,notorious for encouraging tumorgrowth by deflecting signals telling tumor cells to kill themselves. Nowit turns out that galectin-3 interfereswith T-cell apoptosis. \"If galectin-1, apoptosis won't happen,\" says counteracts galectin-1 andprevents galectin-3's valency. \"We'vefound that galectin-3 has much the same binding specificity as galectin-1, meaning that both of them bindto the same T-cell glycoproteins. But in contrast to the bivalentstructure of galectin-1 and theother galectins, galectin-3 can be a tetramer. Having four branchesrather than two would give galectin-3an advantage over galectin-1 incompeting for the same receptors.\" Even more interesting, says Dr. Brewer, is the nature of thecrosslinking caused by the that galectin-3forms disorganized cross-linked complexes. So when galectin-3binds to receptors on the surfaceof T cells, it probably holds themin one large aggregate structurerather than induce them to segre-gate into clusters like we see with galectin-1. If so, then galectin-3 prevents apoptosis by actively sup-pressing organized cross-linkingfrom occurring. It's essentially adisorganizing protein.\" \"We've always believed that if you pay enough attention to the physical properties of molecules,they'll tell you what they're doing,\" he says. \"So all along, we've feltstrongly that the structures of thelattices we were observing must befundamentally influencing biologi-cal function. The recent findingsregarding T lymphocytes have helped to confirm this belief.\" Much remains to be learned about structure/activity relation-ships in glycobiology, Dr. Brewersays, since the carbohydrate struc-tures are very complex. \"It's goingto be a real challenge to under- stand how that complexity relatesto the function of carbohydrates,\" he says. \"But once we do that, we'llbe able to put this field onto a reallysolid footing.\" Dr. Steven Porcelli, associate professor of medicine atEinstein, also works with T lymphocytes. He studies how T cells that recognize lipids and glycolipids influence a wide spectrum ofimmune-system responses\u2014combat-ing infections, shrinking tumors andregulating autoimmune reactions. \"T cells have gained a high pro- file in recent years, because they're attacked by the AIDS virus, HIV,\"says Dr. Porcelli. \"As a result ofAIDS, we now know that the T cellis a very important component ofthe immune system: Once we lose Tcells, everything falls apart, and we lose the abilityto ward off even those microbes that normally would be Dr. \"patterns\" associated with pathogens. But only vertebrates possess the more sophisticatedadaptive (acquired) cellular immunity. The T cell, says Dr. Porcelli, is \"the master regulatory cell\" of the adaptive immune response. Tcells are the white cells that recog- nize bacterial or viral antigensfrom previous encounters, says Dr. Porcelli. \"They then respondby recruiting other cells that flood in to kill the pathogens. In addi-tion, the T cell itself can attack thepathogens directly.\" Researchers had long assumed that the antigens recognized by T cells were proteins. But in a paper published in 1994, when Dr.Porcelli was at Harvard, he and his colleagues showed that thisassumption was incorrect. \"Wewere studying how T cells isolated from human blood responded tomycobacteria and found evidence that some of the T cells responding to these bacteria were recognizing something else besides protein antigens,\" he says. \"On further investigation, we found that these T cells were recognizing lipids and glycolipids.\" For the past 15 years, Dr. Porcelli has been studying this novel family of T lymphocytes that respond to lipid and glycolipid anti- gens. Known as CD1-dependent T ce lls, they're found in men as well as mice\u2014and are emerging as anormal and reasonably abundantcomponent of the immune system. At first, says Dr. Porcelli, he and other researchers had \"absolutelyno idea\" what this family of T cellsdid in the body. But whatever theirbranches possess the same epitopeto which a lectin could bind. For their part, multivalent lectins con- tain several protein domains, each of which can bind to the same carbohydrate epitope. Dr. Brewer describes his research this way: \"What we've been doing are the very fundamental studiesof the physical interactions thatoccur between multivalent lectinsand multivalent carbohydrates.This involves looking at such basicproperties as the thermodynamicsof these interactions as well as thestructures formed as a result ofthese physical interactions.\" For their thermodynamic studies, Dr. Brewer and his colleagues systematically measured the energytransfers that result from theseinteractions. \"We're fortunate hereat Einstein to have state-of-the-artinstruments that measure the ther-modynamics of molecules bindingto each other. These instruments allow us to quantitate the energyreleased when lectins bind to carbohydrates.\" A istrue thermodynamically in plantsmust also be occurring in animalsystems. Then there's the fact thatthermodynamics doesn't know the difference between in vitro and invivo. So you know that any interac-tions that you measure in a testtube will also be happening inplants and animals.\" Almost as fundamental as his thermodynamics work is Dr. Brewer's nearly 20 years of research into thestructure of the lectin-carbohy- drate structures.Some of these lattices are in twodimensions, others are in three,but the really intriguing aspect istheir uniqueness.\" He describes a typical experi- ment: \"We would take a tetravalentlectin and combine it in a test tubewith three bivalent carbohydratesthat have the same two epitopes but different structures with respect to their branching. After allowing time for the ingredientsto equilibrate, we'd find that three distinct precipitates usingelectron microscopy and x-ray crys-tallography, we would see that each had a different crosslinked latticestructure that was specific for theindividual carbohydrate and theindividual lectin that formed it. We observed similar results for every class of plant lectin we could put our hands on and real-ized that multivalency made this structural uniqueness possible.\" \"The beauty of the structures we were observing helped propel our research, and so did the growing evidence that cross-linked latticeswere ubiquitous in nature and doing something of fundamentalbiological importance,\" says Dr.Brewer. Indeed, Dr. Brewer's \"lat-ticework\" would help show thatlectins play a starring role in oneof the most important of all biolog-ical activities: the programmed celldeath of T lymphocytes. This T-cell phase of Dr. Brewer's research began in the mid 1990's, when an assistant professor ofpathology at the UCLA School of Medicine named Linda Baumvisited Dr. Brewer's lab at Einstein.\"I was telling her about our cross-linking findings with plant lectins,and she was very interested in ourwork,\" Dr. Brewer recalled. \"She said, 'I'm going to see if that'soccurring in our biological system,'but I had no idea what system shewas looking at and lost track ofher. A few years later, I went to ameeting where one of her studentswas giving a poster presentationand I just about fell over. Lo andbehold, she had found evidencesuggesting that lectin/carbohydratecrosslinking caused programmedcell death in T lymphocytes.\" T lymphocytes, or T cells, help generate the body's immune response via surface receptor molecules that recognize foreignantigens. The vast majority of Tcells aren't needed for immunesurveillance, and some of themmay trigger unwanted immunereactions. These unnecessary andunwanted T cells are eliminated within the thymus gland throughprogrammed cell death, theprocess also known as apoptosis. Dr. Baum found that an animal lectin known as galectin-1 inducesT-cell apoptosis. And she has gath- ered evidence suggesting thatapoptosis is triggered by the latticethat forms when galectin-1 binds with glycoproteins on the T-cellsurface. epithe- lial cells of the thymus gland,where T cells develop. It can bindto four different T-cell glycoprotein receptors, which normally are distributed uniformly over the cellsurface. In studies using fluorescentantibodies, Dr. Baum made thesurprising observation that exposingTcells to galectin-1 makes the four glycoprotein receptors segregateinto two types of discrete clusters.She has hypothesized that thecross-linking has caused this strik-ing shift cell-surface receptors\u2014and the that later ensues. \"Here we'd spent years studying crosslinking having no idea how itwould affect the biology of these molecules,\" says Dr. Brewer. \"Now,research based on our biophysical studies had provided the first goodindication that lattices form on cellsurfaces and that they influence a 6\"It's going to be a real challenge to understandhow that complexityrelates to the function of carbohydrates. But oncewe do that, we'll be able to put this field onto a really strong footing.\" 89role, their presence certainly implied that they conveyed a survival advantage. \"Mice and men diverged from each other some 70 million yearsago,\" notes Dr. Porcelli, \"so thefact that these T cells have beenconserved in both species suggestedthey were likely to have some important functions.\" Studies show that CD1-dependent T cellsrespond to foreign lipids and glycolipids found prominently in the cell walls and membranes of pathogenic mycobacteria\u2014strongevidence that they help fight infec-tions. But in addition, they mayalso influence autoimmune diseases. Before a CD1-dependent T cell can recognize an antigen, that antigen must first go through aprocess called presentation, whichinvolves antig en-presenting immune cells, commonly referredto as dendritic cells. On the sur face of these dendritic cells are special-ized antigen-presenting proteinsthat bind the antigen to form a stable protein/antigen complex,which can now be \"presented\" to Tcells. Finally, this protein/antigencomplex can be recognized by Tcells possessing receptors that canbind specifically to the complex. This mechanism by which CD1- dependent T cells recognize lipidsand glycolipids closely resemblesthe classic \"presentation-recogni- tion\" pathway already well estab-lished for T cells that react to protein antigens. In that classicpathway, peptide-specific T cells\"see\" peptide antigens bound toclass I or II antigen-presentingproteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)of genes. But in the case of lipidand glycolipid antigens, CD1 pro-teins perform the job of binding antigens and presenting them to Tcells. T lymphocytes can be classified according to the proteins that pres-ent antigens to them\u2014hence thename CD1-dependent T cells forthis family of T lymphocytes that recognize CD1 proteins and the complexes they form with lipidand glycolipid antigens. Humansexpress five different forms of CD1proteins on their antigen-presentingcells, which together can bind manydifferent lipid and glycoproteinantigens. \"We were originally focused mainly on how CD1 moleculeswere involved in getting immuneresponses started, especially against foreign glycoprotein anti-gens like those on the surface of bacteria,\" says Dr. Porcelli. \"Butnow we're looking more closely attheir role in stopping the immune response\u2014which is actually very important, since if you're unable to shut off the immune response, you may end up with an autoimmunedisease caused by T cells attackingother cells of the body.\" According to Dr. Porcelli, we all possess T cells capable of reactingto the proteins, lipids and glycol- ipids that are normal parts of ourbodies. \"You can show that these Tcells respond to 'self' constituentswhen you put them in a Petridish,\" he says. \"But the fact that Tcells don't normally cause autoim-mune problems in vivo suggeststhat something is suppressing them.\" Evidence from Dr. Porcelli's lab and others suggests that CD1-dependent T cells help in quellingthese autoimmune reactions. \"T lymphocytes that respond to CD1 must go through a phaseearly in their development calledselection,\" Dr. Porcelli explains.\"During this phase, the T lympho-cyte expresses its antigen receptoron its surface. But if the T cell'sreceptor doesn't 'see' a CD1 mole- cule in its vicinity, that T cell neverbecomes active but instead diesfrom neglect. Most T cells developin the thymus gland, and normallyup to 90 percent will diethis way [i.e., through T-cell apop- tosis, the same process that Dr. Brewer is investigating].\" Accumulating evidence suggests that losing the wrong CD1-depend- ent T cells\u2014those responsible fortamping down immune responses\u2014 may lead to autoimmune diseases.This evidence comes in part fromstudies in which the gene thatcodes for CD1 proteins in mice hasbeen knocked out. \"By taking outthat gene, you cause the mouse to lose the T cells that respond toCD1 proteins, which leads tounwanted autoimmune responses,\"says Dr. Porcelli.

Bothprocesses involve cells that multiplyrapidly\u2014a normal occurrence inembryonic development, butdestructive in cancer. And in bothprocesses, the same genes may beimplicated in the rapid cell division.In her developmental geneticsresearch, Dr. Paula Cohen is study- ing a family of genes involved inboth colorectal cancer and thedevelopment of sperm and ova. Dr. Cohen, assistant professor of molecular genetics, has alwaysbeen fascinated by the complexitiesof pregnancy\u2014especially how preg-nancy usually goes right when somuch can go wrong. Her graduatestudies at King's College in Londonfocused on developmental defects in early pregnancy. After complet-ing her studies in England, Dr.Cohen arrived at Einstein's Belfer Institute for P ostdoctoral Studies in 1993 to continue her training andto work with Dr. Jeffrey Pollard. More recently, Dr. Cohen's research has involved meiosis, the process by which germ cells in theovaries and testes convey geneticmaterial to eggs and sperm. Errors duringmeiosis can lead to mis-carriages and to seriousbirth defects\u2014and littleis known about whythose errors occur. One approach to study-ing meiosis is to isolateindividual eggs (frommice) as they areformed in the ovary, characterize theirgenetic content and note how the cells areconducting their house-keeping at each stage of development. Isolating such indi- vidual cells from a massof tissue can be a tech-nological nightmare:Locating the cells is dif-ficult, and then comes the problem of plucking out a single cell that is less than a thousandth of an inch across without draggingunwanted additional tissue with it. But a new technology\u2014an instru- ment known as a laser capturemicrodissection system\u2014has cometo the rescue. Originally designed for cancer research, laser capture can be used during the earliest stages of tumorformation, when just a few cancer cells may be bobbing in an oceanof a thousand normal cells. After\"capturing\" early cancer cellsthrough laser microdissection, researchers can assess their genetic and protein makeup even before atumor is evident, or compare thegene expression/protein profiles of a cancer cell and its neighboringnormal cell. They can also \"micro-dissect out\" and study cancer cellsin biopsy samples that were takenfrom cancer patients years ago. In the spirit of one field of sci- ence borrowing from another, Dr.Cohen has adapted laser microdis-section for her research in develop-mental biology. She is jubilantabout the technology, which allowsher, for example, to view germcells undergoing meiosis and thenextract them from tissue one by one.\"In 1995, Winfried noted that yeast strains harboring mutations in the repair gene MLH1 not onlyhad repair defects\u2014many geneticdefects had accumulated Cohen. \"And sporu-lation is a meiotic event, hepredicted that the mammalianhomolog of this gene might regulate meiosis as well as partici- pate in colon cancer. Winfriedknew that Jeff P ollard and I were the reproductive biologists at Einstein, so he asked us to lookinto this gene's possible role inmammalian meiosis.\" \"I wasn't a meiosis expert then, but that's how I got involved in thefield,\" says Dr. Cohen. She recalls her excitement upon first examin-ing the testis of an MLH1 whatever. I believe this wasthe first-ever mouse to have zero sperm as a result of knocking out a single gene.\" Her collaboration with Dr. Edelmann has been extreme- ly fruitful. Subsequent research has shown that five of the 11 genes in the mismatch repair family are involved in meiosis, a field in which Dr. Cohen is now a nationally recog- nized authority. \"Colon cancer and devel- opmental biology are very separate fields,\" observes Dr. Cohen, \"and I don't know whether such a convergence of interests\u2014focusing on the same gene family from two dif- ferent perspectives\u2014 could have occurred anywhere else. And that really exemplifies Einstein. The collabo rative environment here is fantastic.\" The principle behind laser cap- ture microdissection is cunninglysimple: a traditional high-powermicroscope for viewing is coupledto a laser that can precisely target an individual cell in a sample. Athin polymer film, resembling a sheet of plastic, coats the sampleon the slide. The operator viewsthe sample under the microscope, locates the cell of interest anddirects the laser to cut around thatspecific cell (or group of cells).The heat of the laser causes thechosen cell to stick to the film; andwhen gravity induces the piece offilm to fall into a collection tube, the cell comes with it. \"For the first time we can look at these different cells with thistechnique and it's just very exciting,\" says Dr. Cohen. She is studying mismatch repair genes\u2014a family of crucially impor- tant DNA repair genes involved in both cancer and meiosis. Mut ations that damage these repair genes can cause a hereditary form of cancerknown as human non-polyposiscolon cancer, and Dr. Cohen isinvestigating their possibleinvolvement in meioticerrors that lead toDown syndrome andother maternal age-related defects. She credits mem-ber\u2014associateprofessor of biologyWinfried Edelmann\u2014forguiding her into meiosisresearch. \"Winfried has led the effort to investi- gate how mutations in this family ofDNA repair genescontribute to heredi-tary colon cancer,\" says Dr. Cohen. \"Hislab generated knock-outmouse models for six of the11 members of this gene family, which were some of the first mousemodels ever developed for coloncancer.\" These repair genes arehighly conserved, she notes, andperform very similar gene-repairfunctions in yeast, mice andhumans.

In thebottom image, the laser has cut out fivedifferent cells, and each shows a uniqueprofile of gene and protein expression. Stephen Atwood, M.D., Class of '72 This photo was taken in a village near the town of Atemble on the north-ern side of Papua New Guinea. This isa riverside village that is reached bydug-out canoe with an outboard motor,so it's actually more accessible thanother villages in the interior. We hadgone there to see a community self-helpprogram where families actuallyassessed their own homes for health,sanitation, and education and thendeveloped a plan on how to improvetheir self-rating. Villages in PNG tendto be pretty self-sufficient. Just a note:the kids in this village dress in the grassskirts and fruit necklaces for festivalsrather than everyday wear. (I guess I was considered a festival!) On the way back from Khenti Aimag (an Aimag is an administrative division similar to a Province) travel is by 4-wheel drive vehicle over unpaved tracks acrossthe steppes. We slowed down to talk to this group bringing back supplies to theirhouse (called a Gir). The camels are characteristic of Mongolia and the GobiDesert, which was south of this Aimag. The horses are famous, and the people ofthe town I had stayed in (Galshir Suom) boasted that Genghis Khan was knownto have raised his fastest horses in their town. This is the 'mayor' of that town, Mr. Ganbaatar, standing with me in front of the Gir that we stayed in. The Gir is a circulartent-like structure that a family can raise or strike in 30 minutes.It's got a wooden frame, with felt and canvas over the outside.There are no windows in it, but a stove in the center is ventedthrough a hole in the center of the roof.This is what the inside of a Gir looks like. The stove is in the foreground. People burn coal, wood, or cow dung. It's amazingly warm inside despite the inhospitable temperature outside.Couldn't resist a little advertising for UNICEF. This is, afterall, what it's really all about.UpClose &Personal spread of diseases or viruses glob- ally, whereas before they remainedmore localized,\" he said. \"Whilethe poor\u2014mostly women and chil- dren \u2014are most directly affected by this 'small world syndrome,' ultimately, we are all at risk.\" The spread of SARS, with many of those diagnosed in North Americaand Europe having recently traveledin Asia, poignantly illustrates thisvery point. \"We need to recognize that dis- eases are not so isolated and toglobalize medical education. To do this, we need to expand oppor-tunities for research, conductsituational analyses, and thoroughlyassess each nation's resourceneeds. We also need to go into the lab and direct technology at addressing global needs, and weneed to make global medicine anintegral part of the medical educa-tion our future doctors receive.\"With the education of future doctors in mind, Dr. Atwood has avision of setting up a graduate stu-dent exchange program where astudent from a U.S. (or Canadianor European) graduate schoolwould work with a graduate stu- dent from an Asian university on aresearch problem that they would define along with UNICEF. Theseproblems could address a broadrange of medically related issuesincluding medicine, public health,and even economics. \"The importance of the pairing would be to allow each student to learn from the skills of his/her col-laborator,\" Dr. Atwood explains.\"It would also be important to pairup faculty advisors from each insti-tution. And the end result wouldbe a Masters or Doctoral thesis, or publication.\" In his address, Dr. Atwood also stressed the role that prestigiousinstitutions, such as Einstein, couldplay in drawing connectionsbetween what is going on in health in developing countries and how itaffects health care in the U.S.(Again, the recent emergence ofSARS as a threat to health world- wide underscores the relevance ofthis issue.) While Dr. Atwood noted that training students and involvingleading institutions in the address-ing of global medical issues iscritical, he also spoke about theimportance of educating the general population about health. During his career he has traveledfar and wide and witnessed thehealing power that knowledge can provide. \"I really enjoy being involved in training and working with peoplewho are struggling with real prob-lems of life and death in the field,\"he said. \"When you apply partici-patory methods and ask the kindof questions that raise people'sawareness and ability to analyze their own situation, you can watch people absolutely unfold and take off. It gave me my first under-standing of what the word empowerment meant.\" Dr. Atwood's most important \"take home\" message about globalizing medicine, stemmingfrom the experiences he has hadduring nearly three decades ofwork abroad, was: \"It cannot be done alone.\" \"Everything in this business is working with others, bringing each individual's expertise and skill tobear on solving the problem athand,\" he said. His selection for the Einstein Alumni Life Achievement Awardrecognized his role in such team efforts\u2014namely his life of service to medicine for the under-served populations of East Asia and thePacific, and acting as an exemplary model for future generations of physicians. In January, when Dr. StephenAtwood (class of '72) returned to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to receive the 2002Alumni Association's LifeAchievement Award, he made a presentation about global medicine.At the time he could not have imagined that, within a few months,the region where he serves as UNICEF's regional advisor forhealth and nutrition\u2014East Asia and the Pacific\u2014would become the epicenter for a disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS), that would bring world-wide attention to the very issue.Dr. Atwood's talk offered insights into the \"globalization\" ofhealth issues as well as suggestionsfor how the medical profession can better address these issues. Through his travels on behalf of UNICEF, Dr. Atwood visits 23developing nations that typicallyhave limited resources. He hasseen, firsthand, the challengesthese nations face in promoting good health and providing ade-quate health care to their people.These challenges have includedvaccinating the children of Indiaagainst polio while also combatingtribal distrust; assuring that insecti-cide to protect villagers in Papua New Guinea against malaria gets used to good effect; and providingeducational and medical tools tohealthcare givers within marginal-ized communities, which are oftenmany miles from the nearest roadsor hospitals. While these examples may not themselves pose a risk globally, our shrinking world does, Dr.Atwood noted. \"Each day, one million people cross borders and travel betweennations or even continents.Boundaries are disappearing, augmenting the potential for theThe editors thank roving physician-photographer Steve Atwood for the photoessay accompanying this story. 11 1012based research. They are already developing new diagnostic testsbased on abnormal proteins thatare the consequence of genomicdysfunction. We are beginning to see gene-testing and protein- testing methods that flag patients with genetically based risks, identifypersons at risk for developingadverse responses to certaindrugs, and spot diseases beforethey are associated with symptoms. Gene chip diagnostics using DNAmicroarrays is already well estab-lished in diagnosing the mostcommon form of non-Hodgkin'slymphoma; and just think, it was three years ago that the so-called lymphochip was invented, with its more than 18,000 snippets ofgenes associated with normal and abnormal lymphocyte development.Protein chips using antibodymicroarrays to detect abnormalproteins are not far behind. I hope I have made the case for beginning immediately to greatlyexpand the teaching of geneticmedicine in general\u2014and genomicsin particular\u2014to the physicians oftomorrow. Indeed, at Einstein, this process is already well underway. Next on my list of items foreducational change is pre- ventive medicine . I have already mentioned howknowledge of a person's genomecan serve as the scientific basis forpracticing preventive medicine,albeit at the level of the individualpatient. This still begs the ques-tion: What kinds of knowledgeand communication skills should aphysician have in order to practiceeffective health promotion anddisease prevention with individualpatients? And what is the role ofthe physician in contributing to the health of populations? From Paul Marantz, a colleague here at Einstein, I learned about a19th century English physician named John Snow. In 1854, Dr.Snow traced the source ofLondon's huge cholera epidemicto a single pump on Broad Street that was leaking sewage into the public's drinking water. He thusended the epidemic by forcefullyputting the pump out of commis-sion. A few years later, stillsavoring his epidemiologic victory,Snow was among the first to rec-ommend that preventive medicine be taught in medical schools. Onehundred and fifty years later, weare still waiting for Dr. Snow's rec-ommendation to be implemented.We should do it now. Just imagine if each physician in the United States was trained appropriately in the science andclinical application of prevention.What could be achieved in preventing the adverse medical,economic or social consequencesof smoking, inadequate diet, lackof exercise, accidents, domesticviolence, lack of immunizations,occupational hazards, toxic environmental exposure and substance abuse? And movingbeyond the individual patient, just imagine how physicians couldinfluence positively the health ofpopulations if they were educatedin principles of disease preventionand behavioral change appropriatefor specific patient populations; if they learned the importance ofrespecting cultural and economic diversity; if they were willing towork as part of systems and as collaborators in health care teams;if they accepted at least someresponsibility for the health of populations? Most physicians of today would probably not oppose Medicareand Medicaid the way individualphysicians and the AMA did whenthese programs were first pro- posed by the White House in the1960's. On the other hand, I don't see too many of today's physiciansor medical students taking robuststands against a White House eco-nomic policy that will cause a hugereduction in health care financing during the next 10 years. I'm alsoconcerned with the medical com-munity's increasing tolerance for a health care non-system that permits more than 40 millionuninsured individuals, includingan enormous number of children.Need I remind you, we are still the only Western industrialized nationthat does not have a national health insurance program exceptfor the elderly or impoverished. We seem even further from the goal of universal health insurancetoday than when such a system was proposed by the White Housein early 1993. I am postulating that a perva- sive and persuasive education inprevention and population sci-ences will stimulate more medical students to become the sociallyresponsible and responsive physi- cians they should be. Perhapsfrom the large number of studentshere at Einstein who participate in myriad community-based health programs, some will emerge tolead the way to a medicine of thefuture that embraces prevention,population health and greatersocial concern. Linked with development ofeducational programs inpreventive medicine, but in many ways standing on its own, iseducation in global medicine . There is no need for me to con-vince you of the interconnectednessof all peoples on this planet andhow poverty, poor public healthand sanitation, contagious diseasesand ecological disasters any placein the world can havemedical conse quences anywhere and everywhere. While the medical stu-dents here todaywere on the path to becoming physi- cians, the scientific foundation ofclinical medicine continued toexpand. New clinical applicationsof biomedical science and technol-ogy were discovered and deployed.The cultural, economic and demo-graphic environment in which medicine is prac ticed continued the transformation begun in the '70s. These changes will continueeven after students graduate andproceed through the years of grad-uate medical education andbeyond. This is why, whether theybe practitioners or teachers must be inde-pendent, self-directed andeffective learners thr oughout their professional lives. How does medical education respond to biomedical science discoveries and changes in thepractice environment? It, too,must change in both evolutionaryand revolutionary ways, sometimesby adding new learning goals; sometimes by integrating wholenew disciplines; sometimes byaltering the strategies of teachingand learning. Obviously andemphatically, medical educationcannot be allowed to develop static cling. I would like to discuss just a few areas of educational change thatare likely to be addressed withsome vigor while the graduatingseniors sitting here today are intheir residency training. These students will need to figure outhow to learn what their medicalstudent successors will be learning.Faculty in the audience will need to integrate new knowledge and approaches into their teaching.And for everyone out there, whatmore do your physicians need to know? So, without further delay: What's ahead for Med Ed? First on my list is genomic medicine . It was only about 15 years ago that the term \"genomics\" joined the medical vocabulary. The sci- ence of genomics takes us beyondthe era when medical genetics was a tool for diagnosing only a fewrelatively rare diseases inherited in simple Mendelian fashion. Ratherthan being the study of single genes and their effects, genomics is the study of functions and inter-actions of all genes in the entiregenome, whose sequence in man, other animals, and microbes, wenow know. Unlike the relatively uncommon nature of single gene disorders,abnormalities in the interactionsof multiple genes plus the influ-ence of environmental factors are already known to play a role in such common diseases as breast cancer, colorectal cancer,Parkinson's disease, HIV infection and Alzheimer's disease. And this is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Except for monozygotic twins, each of us has a unique genome,and this has enormous implica-tions for patient care. Knowledgeof a person's genome will enableus to predict that person's risk ofcommon diseases and undesirableresponses to the environment and to drugs. Thus, we have thepotential for a genomically basedpractice of primary preventivemedicine. We also have the poten-tial for development of genom-ically based diagnostic medicineand therapeutics. Knowledge ofmicrobial genomics will lead to better methods for preventing, diagnosing and treating infectiousdisease and will also contribute tomethods of bioterrorism defense. The transition from genomic science to clinical genomics willnot come easily or quickly. It willprobably be another decade ortwo before genomics takes centerstage of clinical practice. But thisis still well within the professionallifetime of the graduating studentshere today. Drug and medical diagnostic companies are not waiting for afully grown genomic medicine tohappen. They are already develop-ing novel human protein andantibody drugs through genomics-What's Ahead for Med Ed? by Albert S. Kuperman, Ph.D. Associate Dean for Educational Affairs This keynote address was delivered by Dr. Kuperman on May 1, 2003, at the ceremony inducting Einstein students into the medical school honor society,Alpha Omega Alpha.Imagine how physicians could influence positivelythe health of populationsif they were educated inprinciples of disease prevention and behavioralchange appropriate forspecific populations; ifthey the impor-tance of respectingcultural and economicdiversity; if they werewilling to work as part of systems and as collab- orators in health care teams; if they accepted at least some responsibility for the health of populations.The transition fromgenomic science to clinical genomics will notcome quickly or easily. Itwill probably be anotherdecade or two beforegenomics takes centerstage of clinical practice... but still well within theprofessional lifetime ofthe graduating students here today. 1314hidden curriculum and the social- ization process. To quote from onestudent who graduated recentlynot from Einstein but from anotherexcellent medical school: \"For two years lecturers parade up and down describing their ownparticular niche as if it were themost important thing for a studentto learn. And then, during the clinical years, life is brutal. Peopleare rude. The hours are long. Andthere is always a test at the end of the rotation. After a while, I rea- soned that the most importantthing I could do for my patients, for my fellow human beings, was to assure myself some peaceful time. I made a point of hoarding myextra time for simple pleasures. Iread Perri Klass's novel in which she describes how physicians mustrelearn the ability to appreciate the mundane. Her point is that physi-cians must regain their humanityafter they complete their training.For my part I tried hard not to lose it, or at least to hold on to it aslong as possible.\" Whatever inadequacies of medical education in promoting profes- sionalism and humanism in itsstudents may have existed in thepast, they have been greatly exacer-bated in recent years. Teachinghospitals across the land have beenstruggling to survive financiallywhile still maintaining their educa-tional and service missions. Muchof the decline in hospitals' incomeis attributable to the growing unwill- ingness of private and governmentalpayers to factor education timeinto their reimbursement fees. Thehospitals' response has been torequire clinical teaching faculty to be more clinically productive, todevote ever-increasing amounts oftime to reimbursable patient carein order to compensate for rev-enue shortfall. This reduces thetime faculty can give to teaching,research or community service, thus creating a more business-like ethos. In this kind of clinical environment, it becomes morechallenging than ever to make certain that the attitudes andbehaviors characterizing profes-sionalism are manifested on aconsistent basis.Let me give you one example of a program developed to nurture afew qualities of professionalism and humanism, especially the qual-ity of compassion. It is a programoriginally conceived and producedby someone who I view as one of the great people in American med- icine. Her name is Rachel NaomiRemen and she is at the University of California at San Francisco. Shecalls her program \"Healing Arts.\"Originally developed for physiciansexperiencing burnout and theneed to refresh mind and spirit,Dr. Remen then offered the pro-gram as an elective to medical students at UCSF. It was tremen-dously popular among the studentsand was soon replicated at Stanfordand Dartmouth. This year, for thefirst time, a group of faculty in Einstein's Department of FamilyMedicine gave the program to agroup of 40 first-year students who signed up for it. They participatedin five four-hour sessions duringJanuary and February with not asingle dropout along the way. Here are some of the written comments from students whenasked about the most valuable per-sonal or professional insightsgained from the course: \"Not to lose my heart and compassion.\" \"The importance of not losing your- self in the process of becoming a physician.\" \"Sharing emotion (crying, hugging) can be beneficial for patients.\" \"Confidence in what I will bring to my medical practice\u2014not just science and diagnosis, but also relation-ships, caring, even fun.\" Remember, these comments were from students who had completed only five months ofmedical school!In this talk, I've discussed verybriefly five different items foreducational change at Einstein and at medical schools across theland: Genomics, Preventive Medicine, Global Medicine, Integrative Medicine, and Professionalism . There are sev- eral, just as important, that I didnot have time to discuss: Geriatric Medicine, Women's Health, PalliativeCare, and Cultural Competency . But they are no less important. With each passing year, new items may be added to the list and,of course, as we implement changesuccessfully, some listed items maybe removed. Different items will beput into practice at different rates.We have three-year plans, five-year plans, even 10-year plans. Itemsassociated exclusively with knowl-edge and skills, such as genomics,will be implemented faster. Itemsassociated mainly with attitudesand non-cognitive behaviors, suchas professionalism and humanism,take much longer for change to occur. The major point is that wemake an institutional commitmentto addressing these items and actu- ally produce change! If we makethis commitment and if you, the students, make a com- mitment to continue to learn, Ithink the namesake of our medical college would be very pleased. One of the perks we in the Dean's Office have is the chance tochat with Albert Einstein duringmoments when he takes much-needed pauses to relax from hisjourneys through the universe atthe speed of light. I asked him to listen to this talk, though he didseem rather annoyed with me fordisturbing his rest and didn't seemparticularly interested in what Ihave to say about the future ofmedical education. After all, this isthe man who said he only wanted to know God's thoughts and that all the rest are details. But Ireminded him about the medical college to which he gave his name,and that seemed to arouse him. Sohe asked me to accompany him tohis beloved office at the Institutefor Advanced Studies in Princeton. There he listened to my ideas foreducational change and readthrough my notes, which he com- plained about because there wereno mathematical equations. Hereminded me that he never thinks in words at all. He also hated theprinted images of PowerPointslides that I showed him and wasamazed when I told him that stu-dents absolutely adore them. In the end, however, he smiled, expressed satisfaction, and encour-aged me to go ahead with the planfor educational change. He told me that he would visit the schoolagain in about five years to seehow much we accomplished. Whatmore motivation do we need? 15patients. The loss I refer to hasnothing to do with state-of-the-artdrugs, technology, or life-savingprocedures. I refer simply to theloss of primacy of the doctor-patient relationship, the caringbond and superb communicationbetween caregiver and patient, asense by the patient of the care-giver's commitment to his or herhealth, the responsibility of thephysician to engage the patient'sparticipation in his or her healthcare. Viewed from this perspective,integrative medical practice is notjust about herbs, biofeedback,acupuncture, nutritional supple-mentation, imagery andvisualization, ethnic and culturalhealing rituals and the like. It isabout much more. It is aboutrestoring trust, caring, communi- cation, patient participation andcommitment to the relationshipbetween physician and patient.And this is why we should starteducating students in the princi-ples, concepts and practices ofintegrative medicine. The last item for educationalchange that I want to dis-cuss is the need to be more successful in promoting the values and behaviors of professionalismand humanism in our students. In its 1995 \"Project Professionalism,\"the American Board of Internal Medicine specified some of theessential elements of professional-ism. They included: altruism, dutyand service, integrity and honor,accountability, empathy, compassion,respect for others, and excellence. Within the academic community and among the public, there isgrowing concern that physicians' historical commitment to profes-sionalism and humanism iswithering. Indeed, there is ampleevidence of the public's increasingskepticism about the commitmentof physicians to place theirpatients' interests above their own.Despite many studies about causesof erosion of the doctor-patientrelationship, a satisfactory explana- tion has been elusive. This is not tosay that managed care, capitation,constraints in health care fundingand the increased need for docu-mentation and productivity havenot played any role in the declineof professionalism; but individuallyor collectively, these factors are notthe complete story. In the search for more com- pelling explanations for the declineof professionalism and humanism,we should examine what happens during the process of becoming aphysician. The educational and cultural environment of medicalschools has long been suspect withregard to nurturing students' professional and humanistic behav-iors. In fact, medical schools areoften seen as having a harmfulinfluence on such behavior. I real-ize this can be overdone. I am notin the \"chicken little\" camp of edu-cational reform. I do not think thesky is falling. But I do see it full ofgray clouds with respect to the influence of medical education onstudent behavior, especially in theAside from the practical necessityof educating future physicians inglobal health issues, such educationshould also include humanitarianmedicine. The aim here is to moti-vate more physicians to bring thebenefits of their knowledge andexpertise to the cause of improvinghuman health in less developedand emerging nations. Thisnation, with its great workforce of superbly trained physicians,should lead the way in globalhealth efforts. Should we evenimagine that global outreach inthe health arena might one day become public policy, or is this an impossible dream? From genomics, preventive medicine and global medi-cine, I would now like to discuss integrative medicine as another topic for educationalchange. This new concept andapproach to clinical medicinegrew out of recognition by physi- cians that many practices andmodalities of alternative medicinecan, and should, be combinedwith the best of conventional therapies. Integrative medical practice does not accept unconventional,alternative modalities uncritically;such acceptance requires scientificevaluation within the context ofinformed skepticism. Nevertheless,integrative medicine is open toideas and views that, compared toconventional medical practice,offer a wider array of possibilitiesfor health care with interventions that are more natural, less inva- sive, less toxic and less costly. An essential feature of the inte- grative medicine approach is that patients are viewed as whole per-sons with minds, spiritual needsand abundant mechanisms forinnate healing. Mind-body medi-cine plays a huge role in thepractice of integra-tive medicine.Largely due to the work of JohnKabat-Zin and his colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, mind-body medi-cine has a substantial scientificfoundation and evidence base compared not only to other formsof alternative medicine but evencompared to many widely usedconventional medical treatments. Most important, integrative medicine places great emphasis on something that conventional medical practice is losing sight of, and this loss has not gone unnoticed by Integrative medicine. . . is about restoring caring,trust, communication,patient participation andcommitment to the relationship between physician and patient. I am not in the \"chicken little\" camp of educationalreform. I do not think the sky is falling. But I do seeit full of gray clouds withrespect to the influence of medical education onstudent behavior; especiallyin the hidden curriculumand the socializationprocess. 17NEWSREEL continued from page 2 director and remains director of the division of endocrinology. Dr. Rossetti is internationally recognized as a leading physician/ scientist in the field of metabolism.His research centers on understand-ing the abnormalities that underliethe pathophysiology of type 2 dia- betes and the mechanisms by whichhyperglycemia causes resistance to the action of insulin. This latter phenomenon, termed \"glucose toxi-city,\" is a major reason for treatmentfailures in both type 1 and type 2diabetes. He has pioneered research bridging fundamental advance- ments in biochemistry, cell andmolecular biology, with state-of-the-art physiology in the intact organism.For his groundbreaking work he has received numerous honors,including the Irma T.

In 2000 hereceived the Outstanding Scientific Achievement Award of the American Diabetes Association(ADA) and delivered the LillyLecture at the ADA's annual scientific meeting. He recentlyserved as chair of the ADA's PolicyCommittee. Dr. Rossetti is a memberof the editorial board of Diabetes and of the Journal of Clinical Investigation , and is associate editor of the American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology andMetabolism . Dr. Rossetti received his M.D. Trieste UniversityMedical School in Italy and com-pleted postgraduate training and apostdoctoral fellowship in internalmedicine at the Rome UniversityMedical School. He then came tothe United States where he served for four years as a postdoctoral fellow in endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine. He arrived at Einstein in 1991, followingthree years at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. He advanced to prof essor of medicine in 1996 and wasappointed professor of molecularpharmacology in 1998. He hasserved as co-director of the DRTCsince 1997. HISPANIC CENTER OF EXCELLENCE ESTABLISHED The College of Medicine has estab- lished the first\u2014and currently only\u2014Hispanic Center of Excellence inNew York State. The new Center, funded by a $1.2 million grant fromthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is one of just 31such centers nationwide. The grantrecognizes Einstein's leadership in research, education and service to underrepresented communities. Through the Hispanic Center, a number of programs and courseshave been structured to improve theresources available to the communi- ties served by Einstein physicians,and to foster further understandingamong students and faculty of thediverse health concerns of the peo-ple of the Bronx. The Center seeksto expand the number of qualified Hispanic applicants interested in attending medical school or pursuing research opportunities. \"The Hispanic Center of Excellence at Einstein will reflectthe diversity of cultures and nation- alities that make up the Bronx,\" saidDr. Elizabeth Lee-Rey, who, alongwith Dr. Nereida Correa, is a co-director of the center. \"We are thrilled to have this opportunity to set an example forour students and faculty, as well asfor other medical institutions in New York,\" added the Center's pro- gram director, Dr. A. Hal Strelnick. WOLKOFF NAMED DIRECTOR OF BELFER INSTITUTE Dr. Allan Wolkoff, Class of '72, professor of medicine and of anatomy& structural biology, was appointeddirector of the Belfer Institute forAdvanced Biomedical Studies. He succeeded Dr. Dennis Shields, professor of developmental &molecular biology, and of anatomy &structural biology. Dr. Shields, whodirected the Belfer Institute from1996-2002, is credited with develop- ing innovations in the Belfer programthat have turned the Institute into a model postdoctoral training program. Dr.Wolkoff has the distinction of being the first Einstein alumnus to head the Belfer Institute. A Dartmouth graduate, he earned aB.M.S. degree from DartmouthMedical School before coming toEinstein as a medical student.Graduating in 1972, he stayed in the Bronx to complete a residency in medicine at Bronx MunicipalHospital Center (now Jacobi). He then went to the NationalInstitute of Arthritis, Metabolism,and Digestive Diseases as a clinical associate in gastroenterology- hepatology. He returned to Einsteinin 1976. Dr. Wolkoff is director of the program project on liver cell mem- brane proteins, program director of the gastroenterology-hepatologytraining grant, and director ofresearch training for the division of gastroenterology, liver diseaseand nutrition.

ROSSETTI DR.WOLKOFFIn a recent interview for \"Bert's Digest,\" an independent studentpublication of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Dr. HowardDean, a former student of ours('78), was asked: Governor Dean, weunderstand that you met your wifeat Einstein. Dean: \"We met in Dom Purpura's class, which is the mostfrightening class for any medicalstudent. She got 99 on the finalexam, I got a 35, and passing was34. So it is very clear who has thebrains in the family.\" Howard did indeed pass my course but did considerably betterthan he recalls. As a matter of fact,in reviewing his academic record as a medical student at Einstein, Inoticed that he received honors inpsychiatry, neurology, surgery,obstetrics/gynecology, hematology,community medicine and humanbehavior. As I probed further intohis academic file, I discovered thatthe Howard Dean we knew wasnot the same person who graduated from Yale in 1971.It is common for most students applying to a top tier medical schoolto do very well in both science andliberal arts courses, do extremelywell on the Medical College Admissions Test and have a sterlingrecord of extracurricular activitiesranging from community service to life sciences research. And, still somedon't make it. Howard Dean was apolitical science major at Yale whocould have done very much betteras a student than he did. He gradu-ated in 1971 and endured the life ofa stockbroker for two years beforetaking off to Colorado to think andski. He worked at a number of oddjobs, one of which took him to aDenver hospital where he workedfor six months as a night volunteer. What struck him, he writes in theessay accompanying his applicationto Einstein, was the dedication ofthe interns, residents and nursesworking together, their sense of commitment, that rekindled a similartype of motivation in himself. Thisepiphanous experience had to betested, so he took another volunteerjob at St.Vincent's Hospital in NewYork City while reorganizing his as a putative premedical student atColumbia University's School ofGeneral Studies, nearly three yearsafter graduation from Yale. It is a factthat no student can be consideredfor medical school without having performed satisfactorily in generaland organic chemistry, physics andmathematics. Howard had beenexposed to none of these subjects.Despite this, the official record fromColumbia shows that in 1973 and1974 he received no less than an A- in these science subjects and (to my astonishment) A+ in organicchemistry and A+ in biology lab.Such is the power of motivation and dedication to a new life.All applicants to medical school are requested to write a personalstatement summarizing their reasonsfor studying medicine. Howard chose to ask himself two questionsin his essay and attempt to answerthem\u2014to wit: \"How should I usemy talents, and what do I want to be able to look back on as myaccomplishments when I'm 50?\"The answer: \"At 50 I would like tolook back at a career that provided,and would continue to provide,service to others and was rewardedwith the warmth and strength thatcomes from serving interests otherthan one's own.\" The Albert Einstein College of Medicine places great weight on thepersonal interview of a candidatefor admission. Howard was inter- viewed by one of our mostexperienced physicians.The inter-view lasted over an hour. The faculty member's letter sent to the Admissions Committee detailedHoward's experience from the dayof his admission to Yale to the dateof the interview\u2014a period of 6.5years. It chronicled the sometimes erratic course of an unfocusedyoung man unable to find his purpose in life\u2014until his epiphanyworking in a hospital. Our senior faculty member concluded:\"Throughout a long interview withthis lad, I appreciated his direct and VIEWPOINT A Dean's View of Dean We accepted Howard Dean in 1975 and gradu-ated him in 1978 in anaccelerated program. He has never left \"home.\" what seemed to be frank answers to direct and specific questions,some of which are given in thisreport. He demonstrated amature demeanor of a man twicehis age. He convinced me of hissincerity and affinity for the sick,seldom seen with frequencyanymore. Howard B. Dean nolonger represents a lost soul, butyou can count him a winner, for he has indeed come home.\" And so it came to pass that we accepted Howard Dean in 1975and graduated him in 1978 in anaccelerated program. He hasnever left \"home.\" Dr. Dean (left) returned to Einstein in June to give the commencement address to the Class of 2003. Dr. Purpura (above) introduced him. 16by Dominick P .

Raymond passed away on August 16th as a result of acute lymphoblas- tic leukemia, less than five weeksafter the initial diagnosis. He was anoutstanding student who graduatedfrom New York University magnacum laude in 1994 with a degree in biology. He joined our MD-PhD program in 1996. His thesis research was toinvestigate the mechanism of pro-grammed cell death or apoptosis, a process that occurs when a cell's normal processes malfunction. Raymond identified a series of pro- teins that are degraded specifically during the cell death process anddiscovered a novel mechanism bywhich the so-called \"death pathway\"can be activated. His research madean immediate impact on the fieldand has been the subject of severalimportant review articles. His scien-tific career was far too short andthere is no doubt he would have been a leader in his chosen field.He leaves a wonderful legacy in hiswork, which is being pursued not only at Einstein, but also by investi-gators ar ound the world. To commemorate Ra ymond's memory, the department has estab-lished an annual memorial seminarin his name. Raymond will be greatlymissed by his wife Kyung Hee, hisparents, brother Simon and sisterPamela and their families as well as by all his colleagues and friends. The editors wish to thank Dr. DennisShields, professor of developmental andmolecular biology for this remembranceof Raymond Chiu.

Dr. Seiji Ogawa , visiting professor of biophysics and physiology, is arecipient of the 2003 Japan Prize, presented by The Science andTechnology Foundation of Japan. The award, which is widely regardedas the Japanese equivalent of theNobel Prize, recognizes Dr. Ogawa's \"Discovery of the Principle forFunctional ResonanceImaging.\" GLYCOMICS says Dr Porcelli. \"Injecting a glycol-ipid compound into these mice will activate their CD1-dependentT cell response and prevent themfrom developing diabetes. We'rereal interested in that, because we think we can fairly quickly develop a therapeutic approach to humanautoimmune diseases by exploitingthe CD1 immune response.\" Credit for preventing autoim- mune reactions in the diabetes-prone mouse goes to an unlikelysource: a sea sponge. A pharma-ceutical company searching foranti-cancer drugs in sponges hap-pened upon a glycolipid namedalpha galactosylceramide, whichwas synthesized once its structurewas determined. into a tumor-bearingmouse makes the tumor regresssignificantly\u2014somewhat likechemotherapy but without theusual side effects. Rather than poison the tumor as chemo does,alpha glactosylceramide insteaddirects the immune system toattack it. \"What's interesting is that this same glycolipid that provokes animmune response against tumorscan also shut down harmful immuneresponses in the non-obese diabetic mouse,\" says Dr. Porcelli. Research has shown that alpha galactosylceramide acts in men and mice through the same mechanism:It binds specifically to CD1d pro-teins, one of the five different forms of CD1 protein found on antigen-presenting cells. Then, inboth species, this \"CD1d protein/glycolipid antigen\" complex is recognized by CD1d-dependent T cells, which respond by eitherattacking tumors or suppressingautoimmune activity. Most of theresponding T cells are a major subpopulation of CD1d-dependentT cells called natural killer T cells. \"One problem with alpha galac- tosylceramide is that it's sort of a blunt instrument that activatesanti-inflammatory and pro-inflam-matory mechanisms\u2014even both atthe same time,\" says Dr. Porcelli.\"We're now working with chemists to find variants of this glycolipid that more precisely induce one type of immune response or the other.\" As new compounds are synthe- sized, Dr. Porcelli's lab tests theireffects on various strains of mice.Initial experiments are done withstandard healthy mice. A few hours after injecting the compound intothe mouse, researchers measure blood levels of two cytokines: inter-leukin 4, which suppresses manytypes of immune responses includ-ing inflammation; and interferongamma, which is associated with tumor rejection. \"If you find lots of interleukin 4 and little interferon gamma, thenyou know this compound might be good for treating autoimmunediseases,\" says Dr. Porcelli. \"On theother hand, high levels of interfer-on gamma and very little interleukin4 means you might have a cancertreatment.\" The interleukin-4 isreleased by the natural killer T cells that recognize alpha galacto-sylceramide; by contrast, interferongamma is released mainly by differ-ent (but similar sounding) immune cells known as natural killer cells,which are recruited by naturalkiller T cells to help fight infections. The research is going well: \"In the next few weeks, we hope to test about 50 new derivatives of the original glycolipid,\" says Dr. Porcelli. \"We've already found at least two compounds that seem topreferentially produce an anti-inflammatory reaction, so theymight be especially good for treat-ing or preventing autoimmunediseases,\" says Dr. Porcelli. 20EINSTEIN ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF YESHIVA UNIVERSITY JACK AND PEARL RESNICK CAMPUS 1300 MORRIS PARK AVENUEBRONX, NEW YORK 10461 ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED WINTER 2004 EDITOR: SHEILA K.
