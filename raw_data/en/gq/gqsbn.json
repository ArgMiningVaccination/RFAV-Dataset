CRC etiology cross talks with genetic factors, eating habits, immune response and intestinal microbiota composition [2-4]. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte profile strongly associates with prognosis [5,6]. CD8 T lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) cells, for instance, have been related to disease delay and better prognosis [7-9]. Furthermore, the Th1 immune response may con- tribute to remission and better CRC prognosis [10,11]. On the other hand, Th17 cells have been associated with worse CRC prognosis and disease progression [12], although it has already been associated with a better prognosis [9]. Regulatory T cells (Treg) also evidence a dual role [13,14], sometimes suppressing the anti-tumor immune response [15], sometimes attenuating the inflammatory immune response [16]. Evidence suggests that prebiotic food consumption induces the growth of probiotic bacteria [17], which improves the anti-inflamma - tory activity [18] and favors the modulation of cells in the gut-associ- ated lymphoid tissue [19,20]. Yacon is a known source of Fructooli - gosaccharides (FOS) and inulin and therefore, considered a prebiotic food. This tuberous root is originated from the Andes, but it can easily adapt to different climatic regions, altitudes and soils [21]. For this reason, yacon has been cultivated in several countries such as Unit-ed States, Japan, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Czech Republic, Marcon LDN, et al. , J Food Sci Nutr 2020, 6: 069 DOI: 10.24966/FSN-1076/100069 HSOA Journal of Food and Nutrition Research Nadai Marcon1*, Laboratory, Vi\u00e7osa-UFV, Vi\u00e7osa, Minas de Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais, of Applied to Agriculture & Livestock (Bioagro), Labo - ratory of Lactic Acids Concentration and Up-Regulates T-Bet Expression in the Colon of BALB/c Mice During Colorectal Carcinogenesis Abstract Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed type of cancer worldwide. Prebiotics containing Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin have been reported to improve CRC in experimen - tal models. We hypothesized whether consumption of the yacon-based product (PBY-Smallanthus sonchifolius concentrate), as a source of FOS and inulin, could mitigate colonic pre-neoplastic lesion development in mice by enhancing fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) production besides modulating intestinal immune re-sponses. Therefore, we investigate the effects of PBY consumption on anatomical and fecal characteristics, serum biomarkers, fecal SCFA concentration, intestinal lymphocytes population, expression of transcription factors of the adaptive immune response and Aber-rant Crypt Foci (ACF) count in the colon of mice chemically induced to pre-neoplastic lesions. Male BALB/c mice were injected intraper - itoneally with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (20mg/kg body weight/week) for 8 weeks. Thereafter, mice were fed either control (AIN-93M) or PBY diet (AIN-93M supplemented with PBY, for 8 weeks and then euthanized. PBY was not successful in reducing ACF counts; however, it improved fecal SCFA concentration (for-mic, acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric), reduced fecal pH and increased humidity and viscosity of feces. Although there were no significant changes in the intestinal lymphocytes population (CD4, CD8, Natural Killer, Treg and Th17), PBY consumption modulates the immune response in the colon reducing the expression of FOXP3 and increasing RORt and T-bet, which would contribute to activation and proliferation of CD8 T lymphocytes and better CRC prognosis. Therefore, we suggest that PBY might improve intestinal health during the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, espe-cially by modulating SCFA acon (Smallanthus Increases Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Concentration and Up-Regulates T-Bet Expression in the Colon of BALB/c Mice During Colorectal Carcinogenesis. J Food Sci Nutr 6: 069. Page 2 of 12 J Food Sci Nutr ISSN: 2470-1076, Open Access Journal DOI: 10.24966/FSN-1076/100069 Volume 6 Issue 3 100069Ecuador, Korea, New Zealand and Peru [21]. Most of the yacon con- tent is water, which usually exceeds 70% of fresh weight [22]. In the dry matter, the main component of yacon is FOS, however, in low amounts (less than 4% and 0.3 % respectively) [23,26]. Glucose, fructose and sucrose content are around 10 to 20% each [23,26]. Yacon can be incorporated in culinary preparations, juices and salads and also be consumed raw, cooked, dehydrated, or as a syrup [27] or candy [21]. Yacon consumption might modulate the intestinal microbiota by increasing the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli [28,29], which directly inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria [30,31]. Studies have shown that yacon increase fecal Short-Chain Fatty to weight loss triglycerides and cholesterol [35,36]. Yacon also modulates the intestinal inflammatory response by increasing fecal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and serum interleukin (IL)-10 preventing pre-neoplastic lesions during colorectal carcinogenesis in animals [26,39]. Recently, our research group verified the role of the yacon-based product (PBY- Smallanthus sonchifolius concentrate) on intestinal immunity. PBY consumption enhanced Treg cells in the colon of BALB/c mice and mitigated the inflammatory profile by down regulating the expression of RORt [20]. Yacon exhibits antioxidant properties owing to its high polyphe- nol content, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid and protocatechuic acid [25,40]. Its content of fructans, mainly FOS and inulin, favor SCFA production by the intestinal microbiota, especially butyrate, which has been reported to and tumor progression [44]. The benefits of yacon are directly related to the modulation of intestinal microbiota [29] and intestinal immune response [20,38]. Nevertheless, the immune response profile induced by yacon during colorectal carcinogenesis has still not been elucidated. In this study, we use a mouse model that allows in situ evaluation of pre-neoplas - tic lesions, known as aberrant crypt foci (ACF) [26,39], as well as we assess biomarkers similar to used in human studies. Therefore, this model supports the evaluating of the effects of prebiotics on col-orectal carcinogenesis [45]. We used yacon concentrate (PBY) that provides higher concentrations of FOS and inulin, besides, be lesser perishable than fresh yacon. As recommended by Paula and co-work-ers [46], PBY was added to the animals' diet to supply 6% FOS + inulin and hence modulate intestinal function. Thus, we hypothesized whether PBY consumption, as a source of FOS and inulin, could mit - igate ACF development in mice by enhancing fecal SCFA concentra - tion besides modulating intestinal immune responses. Moreover, the effects of PBY consumption were explored on anatomical and fecal characteristics, serum biomarkers, intestinal lymphocyte populations, and expression of transcription factors of the adaptive immune re- sponsein the colon of BALB/c mice chemically induced to pre-neo-plastic lesions.Methods and Materials Animals and experimental design Thirty-six nine-week-old male BALB/c mice were obtained from the Central Bioterium (Health and Biology Science Center) of the Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, Brazil. The animals were housed at the Experimental Nutrition lab in a temperature-controlled room (22\u00b12\u00b0C) with a 12-hours light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to water and food. The animal protocol was approved by the Ethics Com- mittee on Animal Experimentation from the Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, Brazil, under the process number 30/2016 and performed ac- cording to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Na- tional Academy of Sciences (US). Upon arrival, mice were induced to pre-neoplastic colorectal lesions by intraperitoneal injection of 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) (20mg/kg body weight) once a week during 8 weeks [45]. DMH was dissolved in 0.9% saline solution containing and 10mM sodium citrate, at pH 8 [47]. Then, the animals were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: The group receiving control diet (DC; n=17) or the group receiving PBY-supplemented diet (DY; n=19) (Table 1). The sample size was calculated according to the aberrant crypt data reported by de Moura and co-workers [34], to achieve a statistical power of 90%. Diets were offered ad libitum for 8 weeks. Subse- quently, mice were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane and blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus. Mice were euthanized by cervi - cal dislocation and tissue and feces were harvested for analysis. Yacon-Based Product (PBY) and experimental diet Yacon was purchased from a local market in Vi\u00e7osa-Minas Gerais, Brazil. The PBY was processed according to the methodology pro- posed by Rodrigues and co-workers [23], which is currently going Table 1: AIN-93M composition in the control and PBY diets.

The chemical composition of PBY (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fiber, ash, and humidity) was de-termined according to the AOAC methodology (AOAC, 1997). FOS and inulin contents were determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a BIO-RAD brand HPX-87p column (lead stationary phase) using purified water for the mobile phase. The experimental purified diets were based on the AIN93-M diet, as recommended by the American Institute of Nutrition [49]. The PBY-supplemented diet contained 6.0% FOS + Inulin from PBY (Ta- ble 1), as suggested by Paula and co-workers [46]. Casein, sucrose, dextrinized starch, starch, and fiber adjustments were made to control and PBY diets to obtain similar amounts of carbohydrates, lipids, pro-teins, fibers, and calories. The diets were made in a pellet format and stored at -20\u00b0C for a maximum period of thirty days before consump- tion. The calculation of the human equivalent amount of dietary PBY consumed by male BALB/c mice was performed according to the body surface area normalization method as previously describe [50]. PBY supplementation was 353.56g PBY/kg of diet. In our study, the average daily consumption was 6g per mouse. This is equivalent to 2,121g of PBY (corresponding to 272mg of FOS and 88mg of inulin) daily for an adult mouse of 45g, which approximately corresponds to 47g PBY/kg body mass/day. Taking into account that the average hu- man adult weight is 70kg, it is thus converted to 229g per day for hu- mans. It is worth noting that the equivalent dose calculation according to Reagan-Shaw and co-workers [50] was only used as a comparative method, with no intention to extrapolate the results for human intake, since the dose-response to nutrient intake may vary according to the experimental model used or to the individual participant in a study. Body weight and dietary intake In order to evaluate the weight loss/gain of the animals, individual body weight was weekly recorded using a digital weighing scale. Di- etary intake was determined according to the difference between the diet offered and wasted. Quantification was done every 3 to 5 days during the whole dietary intervention on a digital weighing scale. Data represent the diet consumption per cage (7 to 10 animals/cage). Diet consumption (g) was corrected by humidity (fresh diet weight (g)/diet weight (g) in the cage per day). Fecal characteristics Fresh feces were harvested and stored at -80\u00baC for pH determina - tion. For each animal, an aliquot of feces was diluted in distilled water (1:10), homogenized, and the pH was measured ona digital pH meter (Hexis ultra Basic UB-10\u00ae duly calibrated) in a temperature-con - trolled room until pH stabilization [51]. Fecal humidity was determined using approximately 110mg of moist stools. Feces were weighed in Petri dishes, previously dried for 24 hours at 105\u00baC. Afterward, the material (Petri dish + feces) was placed in a desiccator until it reached room temperature and later weighed for determination of humidity through equation 1 [52]. Equation 1: humidity (%) = (Initial Weight*-Final Weight*) x 100 / (Sample Weight) *Initial and final weight: weight of the dishes containing the sam- ples, before and after drying, respectively. In the last week of the experiment, fresh feces were harvested and the fecal score was assessed according to the method used by De Fre- itas and co-workers [53], with some modifications: 1. Firm or normal feces consistency; 2. Viscous non-diarrheal feces; 3. Watery feces, characteristic of diarrhea. Anatomical characteristics After euthanasia, the organs (liver, spleen, small intestine, ce- cum, colon, and abdominal adipose tissue) were excised, weighed using a semi-analytical weighing scale. The hepatosomatic index was obtained by dividing the liver weight by the animal's body weight. The colon length was obtained by measuring from the end portion of the cecum till the end portion of the rectum on a flat surface using a millimeter ruler. Serum biomarkers analysis After euthanasia, blood was collected and centrifuged at 1190 x serum by specific colorimetric assays Brazil), dray\u00ae). Fecal SCFA quantification SCFA quantification was assessed according to the method used by Smiricky-Tjardes and co-workers [54], with some modifications. Fifty mg of frozen feces were weighed and thoroughly vortexed with deionized water (950L). While incubated on ice for 30 minutes, the samples were homogenized for 2 minutes every 5 minutes. Samples were centrifuged (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C) three times and the supernatants were collected. The final supernatant from each sample was filtered through a 0.45m membrane and transferred to vials. SCFA were measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatogra HPLC (Shimadzu\u00ae) HPX 87H column (300 x 7,8mm, Bio-rad\u00ae, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) at 32\u00b0C with acidified water (0.005 M H2SO4) as eluent at a flow rate of 0.6mL/minute. The products were detected and quantified by an ultraviolet detector (model SPD-20A VP) at 210nm. Standard SCFA/g feces. Aberrant Crypt Foci (ACF) counts After removal, the large intestine was washed in PBS solution, opened along the mesenteric margin, placed in paraffin plates with the mucous facing the top of the plate, and fixed in Carson's formalin [55], for 24 hours. Following fixation, flat colons were equally divid- ed into three segments (proximal, medium, and distal) and stained with 0.1% methylene blue for 2 minutes to quantify ACF under a BX-60 light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a magnification of 200X. ACF were counted across the mucosal surface of the large intestine by three independent observers. The ACF categorization was based on the number of aberrant acon (Smallanthus Increases Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Concentration and Up-Regulates T-Bet Expression in the Colon of BALB/c Mice During Colorectal Carcinogenesis.

Each colon-ic section was scored as previously described by Kangand co-workers [57]. The scoring system was based on three independent parameters: severity of inflammation (0-3), depth of injury (0-3) and crypt dam-age (0-4). The sum of such scores provides a total histopathological score with 0 being a normal tissue and 10 being the most extensive/ severe disease symptoms. The assessment of histopathological score was performed using a BX-60\u00ae light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 200x magnification. Three sections per animal that covered the length of 500m of the proximal colon were stained and evaluated in a blinded manner. Determination of leukocytes by immunophenotyping Leukocytes were quantified and characterized in the colon muco- sa as previously described [58], with some modifications. The colon was removed and washed in ice-cold PBS, cut into small fragments and incubated in a cell culture medium, DMEM, pH 7.2 (Sigma-Al- drich ) for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The suspension was centrifuged three times at 42 x g for 5 minutes to collect the supernatant, and lastly at 543 x g for 10 minutes. After the last centrifugation, the re- maining pellet was then resuspended with PBS buffer (100L, pH 7.2). Cell viability was assessed with Trypan blue exclusion and cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber. The obtained leukocytes were incubated with the following antibodies, according acquired (FACS and BD FAC Suite software; BD Biosciences Phar Mingen San Jose, CA, USA) according to size (forward scatter) and granu- larity (side scatter). One or two stains were used to identify TCD4 lymphocytes (CD4 (CD4+CD196+) and Natural Killer cells (CD49b+).

Real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from the whole colon using Trizol re- agent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufac - turer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using 5g of RNA through a reverse transcriptase reaction using a specific kit (GoScript Re- verse Transcription System, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Random primer and RNAse free water were added to the sample and heated for 5 minutes at 70\u00baC. Subsequently, a mixture containing the reverse transcriptase dNTPs and ribonuclease inhibitor was added to the sam- ple and heated for 60 minutes at 37\u00baC. Quantitative mRNA analysis was performed by Real-time PCR DNase free water and the sample (250ng cDNA/\u00b5l) were added at each reaction. Standard PCR con- ditions were used during the reading (7500 software V2.3, Applied Biosystems \u00ae).

Data were analyzed us- ing Graph Pad Prism version 6.0. Mean values were firstly tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the groups with normal distribution were tested using unpaired Student's t-test. Groups that did not show normal distribution were tested using Mann-Whitney test. Statistical differences were considered when the p<0.05 (*) or p<0.001 (**). Results PBY-supplemented diet does not alter diet intake or body weight There was no difference in the weekly weight gain of the ani- mals either during pre-neoplastic lesion induction (1st to 8th week) or dietary intervention (9th to 16th week) (Figure 1A). In addition, there was no change in the average dietary intake between the groups during dietary treatment (Figure 1B). PBY-supplemented diet reduces fecal pH and increases fecal humidity The physical-chemical evaluation of feces contributes to deter - mining the direct and indirect effects of prebiotics on the intestine.

Fecal humidity was higher in the group receiving the PBY-supplemented diet when compared to control (p<0.001) (Figure 2B). Qualitative analysis through the fecal score shown 70% of PBY-treated animals in score 2 (viscous non-di-arrheic stools) and 30% in score 3 (aqueous feces characteristic of diarrhea). Animals fed control diet were 100% in score 2.

There was no significant change in colon length, liver and spleen weight or hepatosomatic index between the groups (Figure 3 A-H).PBY-supplemented diet increases serum albumin and alkaline phosphatase Serum biomarkers analysis was performed to verify possible changes in lipid profile and hepatic and renal function. Total choles-terol, triglycerides, GGT, AST, ALT, creatinine, and urea remained unchanged between the groups (Figure 4 A-I). However, PBY-treat - ed mice exhibited higher albumin (p<0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (p<0.05) when compared to controls (Figure 4). PBY-supplemented diet increases fecal SCFA concentrations The intestinal bacterial activity was assessed through fecal SCFA concentrations.

There was no difference in isobutyric, isova-leric, isocaproic, and caproic acid concentrations between the groups (Figure 5). PBY-supplemented diet does not change ACF counts ACF was assessed to confirm pre-neoplastic lesions formation in DMH-induced mice and to detect the effectiveness of PBY diet in reducing its formation. In both groups, a greater number of ACF cat - egorized as 3 were observed concerning ACF >3 (Figure 6). In ACF 3 categorization, ACF were more abundant in the proximal colon, followed by medial and distal colon (Figure 6). There was no signif-icant difference in total ACF count or categorized (ACF 3 and ACF >3) per colon segment between the groups (Figure 6).

Both groups showed crypt damages. Damage was considered when the crypt light does not reach the intestinal lumen, besides the oval aspect. The control group mostly presented crypts with 2/3 of damage (Figure 7E). PBY-treated animals showed crypts with 1/3 of damage. Inflammatory infiltrates were found in both groups and were minimally expressive (Figure 7E). Damage was mostly restricted to the mucosa. PBY-supplemented diet does not alter the percentage of colonic lymphocytes Immunophenotyping of colonic immune cells was performed to evaluate the intestinal lymphocyte population. There were no signif- icant changes in the percentage of CD4+ and cells, Treg cells (CD4+CD25+), Th17 cells (CD4+CCR6+), NK cells, and CD4/CD8 ra- tio between the groups (Figure 8). Although not significant, there was a reduction on the percentage of CD4 + T lymphocytes (30.4%), and increments in CD8+ (37.7%), CD8+/CD4+ ratio (156.9%) and Treg cells (84.8%) in the colon of PBY-treated animals when com-pared to controls. PBY-supplemented diet increases the expression of RORt and T-bet in the colon Transcription factors of the adaptive immune response were evaluated to verify the pattern of the intestinal immune response in the colon. PBY-treated animals showed down-regulation of (p<0.05) (p<0.05) compared to controls (Figure 9). GATA-3 expression, although up-regulated in the PBY-treated groups (p <0.05), should not be considered biologically relevant due to the very low expression in both groups (DC: 0.023; DY: 0.046). Discussion Yacon has been associated with the reduction of pre-neoplastic lesions in experimental CRC models [26,39], especially by its high content of FOS and inulin. The benefits of yacon are directly related to the growth of probiotic bacteria and their metabolite production, such as SCFA [59].Figure 5: Fecal SCFA concentration in BALB/c mice induced to colonic pre-neoplas- tic lesions and submitted to 8 weeks of dietary treatment.

Thus, this study aimed at investigating the effects of PBY consump- tion on ACF improvement in DMH-induced mice as well as to assess- ingthe immunological mechanisms behind this process. We observed reduced fecal pH and increased humidity and vis- cosity of feces in PBY-treated mice. Yacon-supplemented diet has already been shown to reduce fecal pH in rodents [26] and improve fecal consistency and intestinal transit in humans [28]. In obese indi-viduals, yacon consumption also improves satiety and decreases body weight [27]. However, in our study, dietary intake and body weight remained unchanged between the groups during the dietary interven - tion, probably because such effects should be more pronounced in overweight conditions. The increased weight of colon, cecum, and small intestine verified in PBY-treated mice are supposedly due to the trophic effect of yacon on the intestinal mucosa. Yacon is demonstrat - ed to increase the number and depth of intestinal crypts [31,60] and enhance SCFA production, like butyric acid, by intestinal microbiota metabolism. This SCFA can be used as an energetic substrate for colo- nocytes [61], thus favoring the trophic effect on the intestine. Metabolic function biomarkers are essential to assess health, es- pecially during carcinogenesis. In this study, the PBY diet did not alter biomarker concentrations of lipid metabolism and hepatic and renal function. However, it was verified increased albumin and alka - line phosphatase in PBY-treated animals. Higher albumin levels may be interesting for carcinogenesis-induced animals, as albumin levels decrease during inflammation, which is considered a negative reagent of the acute-phase inflammatory response [62]. Also, albumin levels might have increased owing to higher fecal SCFA concentration in PBY-treated mice, once albumin is responsible to carry fatty acids in the bloodstream [63]. The increase in alkaline phosphatase can be at-tributed to its role in osteogenesis [64], as yacon promotes an increase in intestinal calcium absorption and bone deposition [60]. Fecal SCFA concentration reflects bacterial activity in the colon, an important indicating of intestinal health. PBY-supplemented diet promoted increased formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acid concentrations on feces. Such an increase may be attributed to the prebiotic role of yacon, which contains high concentrations of FOS and inulin [65], stimulating probiotic bacteria growth such as lacto - bacilli and bifidobacteria [28,29]. The use of yacon flour has already been shown to increase propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rodents feces [26]. Besides the trophic effect on the intestinal mucosa, butyrate has also apoptotic action on cancer cells [66]. SCFA, mainly butyric acid, and to a lesser extent propionic acid, are supposed to act as histone which allows the opening of chromatin and, therefore, the gene transcription activation. This process promotes the expression of silenced genes related to apop- tosis and cell cycle arrest, contributing to the suppression of colon cancer cell growth [41,44]. The SCFA-induced cell growth blockade is associated with increased expression of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor and down regulation of cyclin B1 in colon cancer cells [42].

ACF is considered to be pre-neoplastic lesions or a previous event to CRC development [56]. In the present study, DMH-induced col- orectal tumorigenesis in male BALB/c mice resulted in a greater amount of ACF in the proximal colon, followed by the medial colon, and in lesser number in the distal colon. Most of 3 aberrant crypts utmost. ACF induction also compromised the structure of intestinal mucosa, thus affecting the architecture of intestinal crypts, which usually leads to the recruitment of inflam-matory infiltrates. PBY-supplemented diet did not alter intestinal ACF counts. Although an improvement in the crypt structure could be noticed, the histopathological score remained unchanged. Some authors have shown that DMH-induced animals fed with yacon-con- taining diets present a reduction of ACF count [26,39]. Yacon flour, containing 20.4% FOS, added to the diet at 1%, offered for 13 weeks after DMH-induction, significantly reduced the lesions in rats [39]. Similarly, a yacon flour-supplemented diet (7.5% FOS) offered for 8 weeks to DMH-induced rats (25mg/kg body weight) showed more than 40% reduction in ACF count [26]. The lack of changes in ACF counts in our study might be justified by the lesser percentage of FOS and inulin (6%) in PBY-supplemented diet, yacon processing type, or the short period of dietary intervention (8 weeks), which only started after ACF induction. The profile of immune cells in the colon has been studied as a prognostic factor in CRC. Regarding CD4 + (CD4+CCR6+), NK cells and CD4/CD8 ratio, no significant differences between the groups were noticed in our study. Nevertheless, PBY-treated animals had an in- crease in CD8+/CD4+ T cells ratio (156.9%), which denotes a higher prevalence of CD8+ T over CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T lymphocytes are strongly related to the anti-tumor role in CRC [9]. There was also an increase in Treg cells (84.8%) that might be attributed to the modula - tory role of PBY , recently described by our research group [20]. How-ever, the role of Treg cells is still controversial in CRC, as they are related to either tumor progression [68-70] or better CRC prognosis [16,71,72]. Treg cells play a regulatory role in the immune response, secreting cytokines and immune-modulating factors [73], able to sup- press effector function of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells, which act eliminating tumor cells [74]. Furthermore, Treg cells may not only mediate the immunosuppression of immune responses to the tumor [15], but also attenuate the inflammatory immune re- sponse,especially when triggered by intestinal bacteria [16]. This fact denotes the strong immunosuppressive role of Treg cells during intes-tinal dysbiosis, usually seen in the CRC. Similarly to Treg cells, Th17 lymphocytes might have a dual role in CRC [9]. Although related to tumor progression owing to its main cytokine profile and drive highly cyto-toxic CCR5 +CCR6+CD8+ T cells into the tumor tissue, through CCL5 and CCL20 release [9]. Concomitantly, we investigate what could be the main immune pathways induced by PBY diet during colon carcinogenesis. Thus, the expression of transcription factors key to the adaptive immune re- sponse were assessed. The PBY-supplemented diet was able to down-regulate FOXP3 expression and up-regulated both RORt and T-bet expression in the colon. FOXP3 is the key transcription factor for Treg cell differentiation. The differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes, in turn, requires the RORt transcription factor [75], which is expressed in CD4 +T cells in an opposite manner of FOXP3 expression. High amounts of transforming growth factor- (TGF-) and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-21, and RORt expression, whereas a low amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and high amount of TGF- induce FOXP3 expression Intestinal FOXP3 down-regulation in PBY-treated animals could be contribut - ing to reduce Treg cells, which may be beneficial since such cells are be involved in anti-tumor immune response suppression [15]. Inter - estingly, cancer cells may also express FOXP3 [76], thus generating a confounding factor in the overall tissue analysis. Somehow, FOXP3 down-regulation may indicate a positive effect of PBY supplemen - tation; however, it is necessary to differentiate FOXP3 + cancer cells from FOXP3+ lymphocyte populations in intestine tissue for better comprehension of this data. Regarding Th17 cells, we did not ob-serve changes between the groups; nevertheless, RORt up-regulation might suggest a possible stimulation of theTh17 profile in the immune response. T-bet transcription factor initiates the development of the Th1 cell line, which secretes interferon-gamma (IFN-), the main cytokine of this lineage. It also produces IL-2 and TNF- [77]. In contrast, GATA-3 is the specific transcription factor for Th2 cell line develop - ment, which secretes the key cytokine IL-4 in addition to IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-13 [77-79]. It is widely recognized IFN--producing Th1 cells, as well as CD8 T lymphocytes, play an important role in inhibition and death of tumor cells [80]. Moreover, Th1 cells pro-duce IL-2, which is essential for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation [81]. Th1 cells have already been shown to be associated with bet-ter CRC prognosis [10,11]. Therefore, increased T-bet expression in PBY-treated animals could be contributing to impairing tumor growth and, thus, to better disease prognosis. In this study, we confirmed our hypothesis that PBY may in- crease fecal SCFA concentration and modulate the intestinal im- mune against RORt and T-bet up-regulation. Despite our findings, and be knowing the benefits of SCFA (butyric and propionic acids) in neoplastic cell apoptosis, as well as the role of Th1 cells (T-bet expression) in CRC control, it was not possible to verify chang- es in ACF counts with PBY consumption. Therefore, certain limitations in this study should be considered, for instance, the amount of FOS and inulin in PBY-supplemented diet, and the short period of dietary intervention. Besides, the restricted number of samples per analysis that required the entire colon, each one (ACF counts, immunophenotyping, and Real-time PCR) may have contributed to the absence of statistical significance, especially concerning immunophenotyping analysis. We have also considered that the human equivalent amount of dietary PBY (229g PBY per day for a 70kg adult) might be difficult to be achieved at once. Therefore, we suggest that PBY dosage could be spread throughout the day, thus favoring the inclusion of small portions in the usual diet, for exam - ple, in juices, shakes or bakery products. Interestingly, Santana and co-workers (de Souza Lima Sant'Anna et al., 2015) reported that in humans a lower amount of PBY (52g PBY twice daily, containing 10g FOS + inulin), mixed with orange juice for 30 days was effective in improving intestinal constipation and microbiota modulation. This fact suggests that prebiotic consumption long term may be more ef- fective for acon (Smallanthus Increases Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Concentration and Up-Regulates T-Bet Expression in the Colon of BALB/c Mice During Colorectal Carcinogenesis.

PBY also increased fecal SCFA concentration (formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids), thus indicating probiotic activity stimuli. Besides, the increase in SCFA, mainly butyric acid, can contribute to the activation of tumor suppressor genes. PBY consumption also down-regulated FOXP3 expression and up-regulated RORt and T-bet expression in the colon, which would contribute to activation and pro-liferation of CD8 T lymphocytes and better CRC prognosis. Thus, we might infer that during the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis in mice, PBY consumption contributes to driving the anti-tumor im- mune response. Therefore, we suggest that PBY , as a functional food, might improve intestinal health during the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, especially by modulating both SCFA production and colonic adaptive immune response. Studies concerning cell cycle ar - rest genes and apoptosis could contribute to the comprehension of this research.
