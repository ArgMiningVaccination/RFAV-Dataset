Seo Chief U.S. Border Patrol N-95 Respirator Use and Facial Hair 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20229 U.S. Customs and Border Protection The purpose of this memorandum is to serve as a reminder to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees to take the necessary precautions in the workplace due to the risks associated with the Coronavirus (COVID-19), which the World Health Organization (WHO) declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Maintaining CBP's essential functions and services due to the pandemic, emerging infectious diseases or adversarial biological attacks require considerations beyond the traditional scope of continuity planning. The safety and wellness of our personnel, and of the people in our care and custody are our top priority. It is CBP's policy to provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including respiratory safeguards, to employees when necessary. The N-95 Respirator is an air purifying respirator certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The respirator has a filter efficiency rate of 95 percent or greater against oil-free par1iculate aerosols. It can filter against (TB); particulates; viruses; bacteria; dust; fumes; and mist. In addition, fit testing is conducted to achieve a proper fit. Correct usage and maintenance are also integral to the respirator's performance. Note that the N-95 Respirator will filter particulates only, and will not protect Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) against gases, vapors, and oil mists (chemicals). BPAs should also be cognizant that the presence of ce11ain styles of facial hair will render the mask less effective. Other impediments such as facial scars, pseudo-folliculitis barbae, wearing jewelry, and/or the use of headgear, may also interfere with the integrity of the respirator's seal. BP As with neatly trimmed facial hair may undergo fit testing, with the understanding that they will be required to be clean-shaven if they do not pass the initial fit test. Employees must complete the appropriate fit testing, including an online medical evaluation, prior to wearing the equipment to ascertain if it interferes with the seal in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols for donning the N-95 Respirator. In the event of an immediate and N-95 Respirator Use and Facial Hair Page2 urgent need to fit test BP As to prepare for possible mandatory N-95 Respirator usage, the requirement for an online medical evaluation prior to fit testing may be waived at the discretion of management. In the event that an employee requests either a medical or religious exception to said requirement, the employee must submit a formal request through their chain of command. Employees that receive an approved exemption, should note that they assume a level of risk associated with their personal health and safety. Management will make reasonable efforts to inform employees of anticipated respirator use, such as fit tests, as far in advance as possible. This would allow the employee a reasonable amount of time to comply with these protective policies and procedures. Upon management direction, in certain situations, such as alien processing and detention, BPAs will be required to use the N-95 Respirator and other appropriate PPE. Please ensure that this memorandum is disseminated to all sectors and briefed at musters. Additional infonnation regarding the Respiratory Protection Program can be located in Chapter 26 of the HB 5200-0BB Occupational Safety and Health Handbook, dated September 2012.

In response to an interview with China Central Television, Zhong Nanshan, head of a team of experts from the Chinese health authorities, said that 95% of the patients were linked to Wuhan in Hubei Province and Guangdong Province have already confirmed human-to-human transmission.\" He also clarified that there were 14 cases of transmission to healthcare professionals, and from this point that human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. As for the case in Guangdong Province, Zhong said, \"2 patients have never been to Wuhan, and their families have been infected.\" To date, health authorities in Wuhan have only stated that \"the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out,\" and the Chinese government has not yet officially announced the route. Regarding the source of the virus, Zhong said that Wuhan has a large seafood market in the area where patients are concentrated, and that there are shops that feed wild animals in the market. He said that it was highly probable. Communicateq hy\u00b7 Pro MED-ma i I l(b )(B) ---------- and [The occurrence of 14 cases in healthcare workers is most likely due to person-to-person transmission of the 2019-nCov and is not surprising. The rapid increase in cases both in Wuhan City and elsewhere in China has been highly suggestive of person-to-person transmission as well. Prior experience with the SARS-Co V in 2002-2003 including initial \"species jump\" from intermediary animal hosts to humans working in close contact with this animals ( civet cats/palm civets) followed by person-to-person transmission and nosocomial transmission with healthcare workers disproportionately represented among the cases. Similarly, the MERS-CoV has a background endemic rate with sporadic \"species jump\" from camels to humans, and periodic outbreaks when infection control procedures are compromised. With both the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, superspreaders (individuals shedding high virus loads) were also significant sources of transmission of the coronaviruses in outbreaks. Right now there is a heightened awareness focusing on individuals travelling from Wuhan City. One can't help but wonder if the net should be cast wider and case definitions should focus on the clinical presentation of cases, not just limiting suspicion to those individuals with a history of being in Wuhan City. -Mod.MPP] ****** [5] WHO to convene IHR emergency conunittee meeting Date: Mon 20 Jan 2020 02:57 PM EST Source: The Hill [ edited] <https://thehill.corn/policy/healthcare/479057-who-calls-emergency-meeting-as-mystery-virus-spreads> The World Health Organization (WHO) called for an emergency meeting on [Mon 20 Jan 2020] as a mysterious virus spreads across China.

With this muster, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updates CBP about an outbreak of pneumonia cases and a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China_ Situation update There is an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China On January 10, 2020, Chinese health officials reported 41 cases of pneumonia, 7 with severe illness, and one death. No new cases have been identified since January 3, 2020. The outbreak is preliminarily identified to be caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are several known human corona viruses that usually only cause mild respiratory disease, such as the common cold. However, at least twice previously, coronaviruses have emerged to infect people and cause severe disease, such as has been seen with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).These cases tested negative for both SARS and MERS. The characteristics of this virus and how it may affect people are still unclear. Chinese health officials report no confirmed human-to-human spread with this novel coronavirus and no health care workers caring for patients have been reported ill. Reportedly, most patients have had links to a large seafood and live animal market. The market has been closed since January 1, 2020, for cleaning and disinfection. The situation is evolving. CDC will update this muster as more information becomes available. About pneumonia and the Wuhan symptoms Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause mild to severe illness in people of all ages. The main symptoms in the Wuhan pneumonia cases include: o Fever o Cough o Difficulty breathing How can CBP officers protect themselves? Avoid direct physical contact with sick travelers. If you encounter a traveler with fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, maintain a distance of about 6 feet, if possible, and follow CBP protocols for use of personal protective equipment. Wash your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after interacting with a sick traveler or touching potentially contaminated surfaces (e.g., touched by someone who is sick). Wash your hands even if you wore gloves. What does CBP need to do? Remain especially alert for sick travelers with fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing who have been in Wuhan, China in the past 2 weeks. Follow instructions on the RING card or poster: Recognize Isolate Notify Give support. Give the sick person a face mask, if available and can be tolerated, or ask them to cover their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Consider placing the sick person in a private room, if available. Call your CDC quarantine station (www.cdc.gov /guarantine/g uarantinestationcontac tlistfull.html) to notify CDC of any sick traveler with symptoms listed on the RING card, or if you have any questions. For more information: Novel Coronavirus 2019, Wuhan, China: https://www .cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavir us-2019.html Novel coronavirus muster for CBP Importance: High Good afternoon, CDC has prepared a muster for CBP regarding the newly discovered corona virus, see attached. Also, please see the email chain below. Note that we recommend a joint presentation with CDC when possible. If that isn't feasible at some ports in you AOR, we encourage questions and follow up should there be any questions. This is a public health concern based on knowledge at the date of publication (01/11/20). As of today, the first case of the novel Wuhan Coronavirus has been diagnosed in Seattle. The infected individual is an international traveler from China. Please encourage Recognize, Isolate, Notify and Give support to the person (RING) procedures: Recognize; identify an ill person by visual recognition of signs of illness or appearance of sickness. The person may also tell you he or she is not feeling well voluntarily or when asked. Isolate; separate an ill person from other people, including yourself, by at least six (6) feet. Isolation will help reduce the risk of transmission of respiratory and other communicable illness. If the person is coughing or sneezing, offer a tissue or surgical mask and ask him or her to cover his or her nose and mouth. Notify; notify your supervisor, who may contact 911, the local CDC Quarantine Station personnel, and/or the USPS Postal Agent on duty. Give; a supervisor will give you any additional instructions to assist the person and provide a response.

The purpose of this memorandum is to serve as a notice to all Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector employees that we must take the necessar y precautions in the workplace to minimize the risks associated with the spread of the Corona virus (COVID- 19). At this time, CBP is mandating that all USBP frontline personnel utilize the proper level of PPE, referenced in the current CBP Occupational Safety and Health Division (OSH) Job Hazard Analysis (]HA), and PPE Assessment for the operations being conducted. This means that in addition to the potential use of disposable nitrite gloves, outer garments and eye protection, N95 masks must be worn by agents conducting operations in categories that may result in a very high risk or high risk of exposure. Very High Risk categories include all employees who are in extended close contact (less than 6 feet) with symptomatic persons or those suspected of having COVID-L 9; and High Risk categories include line watch operations where an arrest is imminent, transport, processing, and detention. High risk also includes checkpoint operations that place agents (including canine handlers) within limited close contact (within 6 feet) to the motoring public, or potentially contaminated surfaces, as conducting primary and secondary inspections. Agents assigned to canine operations, while conducting pre-primary inspections, are considered medium risk and may don surgical masks in lieu of N95 masks. As always, our agents and professional employees can choose to wear surgical masks in certain other medium or low risk operations where the necessary level of social distancing can be well maintained. These may include horse patrol, riverine patrol and other patrol operations or in low risk categories such as administrative office settings. As the level of risk exposure changes, so should the level of PPE used by our employees. In all cases, only CBP approved and provided facial coverings are authorized for use by on duty personnel. Mandato1y Use of Personal Protective Equipment Page2 Safety remains a top priority for all RGV employees. As a reminder, employees must remain in a constant state of preparedness to don PPE at a moment's notice in response to operational needs. Thank you for your continued resilience and commitment to protecting be health and well-being of our workforce. . ct\u00b7 1e _ \\ O o 2020 MEMORANDUM FOR: FROM: SUBJECT: All Chief Patrol Agents All Directorate C,'!hi.;:.efs\"--=--=\u00b7_/-- b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Rodney S. Scott Chief U.S. Border Patrol 1300 Pennsylvania /\\venue NW Washington. DC 20229 U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mandatory Use of Personal Protective Equipment This memorandum provides direction to U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) frontline personnel concerning the mandatory use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Maintaining U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) essential functions and services, in the event of an emerging infectious disease, requires considerations beyond traditional continuity planning. The safeguarding of our personnel and those in our care and custody is paramount. It is the policy of CBP to provide PPE to employees, when necessary. At this time. CBP is mandating that all USBP frontline personnel utilize the proper level of PPE, referenced in the current CBP Occupational Safety and Health Di\\\u00b7ision (OSI-I) Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment (JHA), for the operations being conducted. In addition to the potential use of disposable nitrile gloves and outer gannents. and eye protection. N95 masks must be worn by agents conducting operations in categories that may result in high risk or very high risk exposure. such as line watch, transport, processing. detention. and check points. Additionally. surgical masks may be worn by employees engaged in operations in categories that are considered low risk, such as adminis trative office settings within Headquarters, Sectors. Stations. and CBP facilities. Employees may also wear surgical masks in certain medium risk operations where the necessary level of social distancing can be maintained. For N95 masks, supervisors are required to ensure that a proper seal test is conducted by the employee. and their equipment remains in operational condition. To ensure consistent levels of protection, CBP personnel must use only approved PPE and approved surgical masks provided by CBP. The use of alternate face coverings (i.e., homemade masks, bandanas, kerchiefs, etc.) is not currently pem1itted. Based on multiple encounter scenarios requiring PPE. as outlined in the JHA. employees !11ust remain in a constant state of preparedness to don PPE at a moment's notice in response to operational needs. These needs include maintaining appropriate facial hair that does not impede the seal of the N95 respirator in accordance with current polici<es. regulations, and standards. While applying appropriate protective measures; including engineering. administrative. work practice controls. and PPE guidance. employees must consider the level and extent of immediate personal contact associated with potential hazards and threats. I Mandatory Use of Personal Protective Equipment Page2 If an employee requests a medical or a non-medical (religious) waiver to this requirement. they must submit a fonnal request through their chain of command. An employee's current waivers remain in effect. Safety remains a top priority for all USBP men and women.

Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Division CBP Senior Medical Advisor Reviewed By: Office of Field Operations, USBP, AMO, and Operations Support Approved by: OSH Division Director CBP Senior Medical Advisor Note: This JHA only applies to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or the disease known as \"COVI 0-19.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Occupatio nal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), World Health Organization (WHO), and other public health agencies are now categorizing the outbreak of COVID-19 that has spread to countries around the globe. including here in the United States, as a global pandemic. While the general risk to CBP personnel and the public for serious harm from COVID-19 is still considered LOW at this point, risk of exposure does vary by geographic location. age, underlying health risk factors, and the nature of work being performed. It is CRITICAL that all personnel take standard precautions recommended in this JHA, along with other credible public health entities. The information, used to develop this JHA, along with additional informative links can be found on the CBP Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page on CBPnet. For the purposes of CBP guidance and protocol, this JHA should be considered CBP policy, and should be implemented accordingly. Rjsk Assessment: Incomplete information regarding incubation, infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, awareness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. The overall risk to CBP personnel is still assessed to be low for serious harm from COVID-19. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with COVID-19, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational awareness regarding this outbreak. Of note, with the growing incidence of COVID-19 in the United States, there is less of an exposure risk distinction between high risk foreign travelers and US residents; CBP employees need to be vigilant regarding workplace, home, and potential off-duty exposure. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the use of N95 respirators is one component in preventing the transmission of COVID 19. Other PPE may be needed under certain conditions and in some work environments as outlined in this JHA. The use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way o preventing disease transmission. All personnel should take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmitting COVID-19 (1) Practice good hygiene; (2) Washing hands frequently; (3) Covering your cough or sneeze: (4) Stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance; (5) Avoiding unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable; (6) Follow CDC and Agency guidance for the use of \"face coverings\"; and (7) avoid touching your face .. Follow state/local/n ational social-distancing guidance off-duty and at home. The use of N95 respirators should be limited to front line personnel and those high risk work situations. See \"Notes\" Page for more information. Note: Risk categories (Very High, High, Medium, and Low) are used in conjunction with this document. These categories refer to the mission-specific risk relative to the hazard identified. Risk categories do not correlate to the overall risk of contracting COVID-19 disease. Additionally, these risk categories are not the same as those used by other agencies such as the CDC. etc. I Operations Risk Categories 1.

This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CSP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus orCOVID-19). At the time of developing this JHA, new cases are being reported in countries around the globe, including the United States. See below links to CDC, OHS, OSHA, WHO, and other reliable COVID-19 resources and information. 2. esp Respiratory Protectjon. All CBP Frontline Personnel, Officers, and Agents who may be in work situations that place them at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, due to processing passengers or travelers with a nexus to COVID-19 affected countries, and may have to wear an N95 respirator as outlined in the above risk-based scenarios are considered to be in \"mandatory use\" N95 Respirator Programs. The mandatory use of an N95 respirator requires a medical clearance, fit testing, and have a clean shaven face, with no facial hair between the mask seal and the face, in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 and CBP HB 5200-088 policies. Frontline and uniformed personnel have had these programs in place for years due to other work situations that also require an N95, such as exposure to TB, handling of Fentanyl and other narcotics, Ebola response, Pandemic and PEID Response Plans, and now COVID-19. 3. Voluntary Use of N95 Respjrators. The voluntary use of N95 respirators or surgical masks is allowed by employers when there is no work task that makes the N95 use \"mandatory.\" In situations such as allowing mission support, administrative, or headquarters personnel that do not typically wear a mask, who would like to wear one for protection to exposures that are not related to specific work tasks, such as traveling to and from work, in congregate settings such as large metropolitan transit systems, buses, etc., use of a surgical mask would be considered \"Voluntary Use.\" In these cases, \"Voluntary Use\" of surgical masks may be allowed to meet the requirement of CDC recommendations for \"Face Coverings\" in social settings outside of work to protect others, since surgical masks are not designed to protect the wearer, they are designed to protect others (see CDC \"Face Covering\" Reference below for more guidance). Such use requires approval from a supervisor to ensure the use will not create a hazard for the employee, impact PPE supplies needed for critical front line \"Mandatory Use\" situations, or cause undue confusion and conflicting policy guidance, such as \"Voluntary Use\" of N95 respirators by front line officers in primary passenger processing areas when they aren't performing any work that requires \"Mandatory Use\" as outlined above. All Respiratory Protection Programs, whether \"Mandatory Use\" or \"Voluntary Use,\" situations will be run in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 standards and policies outlined in CSP Handbook 5200-088, Chapter 26. The use N95 respirator should be reserved for those front line personnel and high risk work situations for which they were intended. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the use of N95 respirators is one component in preventing the transmission of COVID 19. Other PPE may be needed under certain conditions and in some work environments as outlined in this JHA. The use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel should take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmitting COVID-19 (1) Practice good hygiene; (2) Washing hands frequently; (3) Covering your cough or sneeze: (4) Stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance; (5) Avoiding unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable; (6) Follow CDC and Agency guidance for the use of \"face coverings\"; and (7) avoid touching your face .. Follow state/local/national social-distancing guidance off-duty and at home. The use of N95 respirators should be limited to front line personnel and those high risk work situations. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases. cloth-face-co ver.html 8 PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION OFFICE OF BORDER PATROL STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR UNITED STATES BORDER PATROL BORDER STATION FIRST AID UNITS 1.0BACKGROUND With more than 60,000 employees, The United States (U.S.) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is one of the world's largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade. CBP takes a comprehensive approach to border management and control, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection into one coordinated and supportive activity. Within CBP, the United States Border Patrol (USBP) is responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders, and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) regulates and facilitates the flow of trade and travel at Ports of Entry (POE) along these same borders. The USBP/OFO apprehend a significant number of illegal aliens each fiscal year (FY)The estimated number of illegal alien screenings is projected to be between 400-3,000 daily through the spring and summer of 2015, though this number is subject to fluctuations. As this population transits to the U.S., they endure physically demanding and poor living conditions that adversely affect their health and well-being and pose increased public health concern upon apprehension and processing. The majority of USBP Agents and OFO Officers are not medically trained to screen for, and/or treat, medical/public health concerns.

This work increases efficiencies in processing and decreases the amount of time detainees are in USBP/OFO custody. Locations may include USBP stations/OFO POE's, processing facilities and other forward deployed USBP/OFO sites managing illegal alien detainee populations. Any detainee that requires treatment beyond the capabilities of contracted medical staff will be referred to a local medical treatment facility (MTF) for further medical assessment and/or care. 3.0 TASK OVERVIEW The contractor shall fulfill the requirements identified in this Statement of Work (SOW) through the implementation of the tasks outlined in the below categories.

PROCUREiENT SENSITIVE ATTACHMENT 2 STANDARD OPERA TING PROCEDURE FOR HEALTH SCREENING AND MEDICAL EVALUATION OF DETAINEES IN THE CARE AND CUSTODY OF THE U.S. BORDER PATROL HSBP1015Q0078 June 20, 2014 I. Purpose. PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE This SOP identifies the policy, protocols, and procedures for conducting health screening and medical evaluation of detainees in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) United States Border Patrol (USBP). II. Scope. This SOP addresses the current surge of undocumented aliens (UDAs) and does not set a precedent for long-term planning. Any future standard operating procedure (SOP) for full-time staffing of Border Station First Aid Units (BSFAUs) will need to take into account full responsibilities of interagency partners. This SOP applies to the USBP stations where detainees are initially screened for public health concerns, triaged, then if necessary, medically evaluated and treated within Border Station First Aid Units (BSFAUs), or transferred to a local Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). III. Authorities. Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 DHS Delegation No. 5001, Delegation to the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs and Chief Medical Officer (CMO) (July 24, 2008) VI. Background. USBP interdicts and apprehends UDAs year-round along the southwest border, including a growing population of unaccompanied alien children (UAC). Apprehensions have been increasing over the past few years, and the volume of apprehensions has reached a critically high level in 2014, particularly within the CBP Rio Grande Valley Sector along the southern tip of Texas. There is an expectation that this number will continue to rise. The UDA population endures physically demanding and poor living conditions as they transit to the United States, which can lead to negative health impacts and pose increased health concern upon apprehension and processing. Detainees are screened, and if necessary, medically evaluated and treated after coming into CBP custody at the Border Patrol (BP) stations. Given the rise in apprehensions, CBP, with medical policy guidance by OHA, has brought medical assets to the southwest border and established BSFAUs. The BSFAUs are staffed to conduct health screening, triage, medical evaluation, and provide treatment for low acuity medical complaints USBP stations in the southwest border. Detainees found to be suffering from serious medical conditions that cannot be managed in BSFAUs are transported to a local MTF for treatment. PROCUREtviENT SENSITIVE HSBPl 015Q0078 The SOP (through the attached appendices) outlines the reporting requirements for personnel functioning in BSFAUs, to include: conducting health screening, triage, medical evaluation, medical recordkeeping, storage of medications and medical supplies, treatment for scabies, and the handling of emergent exposure to Varicella. They build on existing CBP protocols and are modified to take into account the new BSFAU medical capabilities. V. Appendices Appendix A: Protocol C: Scabies Info1mation Sheet (English & Spanish) Appendix D: Protocol for Handling and Storage of Detainee Medications Appendix E: Emergency Medical Treatment Report Form Appendix F: Patient Encounter Tracking Sheet Appendix G: Formulary and Medical Supplies List HSBP1015Q0078 Appendix A: Protocol for Intake Initial Intake Processing; A. Border Patrol Agents (BP As) separate detainees by age (adult/juvenile-unaccompanied alien children (UAC), sex (male/female), and family unit. The following is a layout of how detainees are separated into various holding facilities. a. Adult (18 years and older) 1. Male 11. Female Ill. Special needs b. Juvenile-UAC (up to 18 years old) lV. Male V. Female Vl. Special needs C. Family Units Health Screening: DEFINITION: A cursory screening by authorized personnel during the initial arrival to border stations to identify detainees who might have illness caused by a communicable disease of public health concern. Detainees are screened for rash, fever, night sweats, persistent cough, diarrhea, vomiting, and other obvious illness, injury or disability, and are referred for a medical evaluation if the screen is positive. B. All detainees shall receive a cursory health screen provided by BSFAU medical practitioners and EMTs upon arrival at border stations to identify detainees who may have a communicable disease of public health concern. The process for conducting the health screening is outlined below: a. Apprehended detainees arrive at the Border Patrol (BP) station. b. Detainees are separated by age, sex, and family unit. c. Special needs detainees are identified for rapid screening and/or medical evaluation and expedited placement. Special needs detainees include, but are not limited to, the following categories: 1. Pregnant women 11. Nursing mothers 111. Individual UAC with a permanent disability or inability to care for self HSBP1015Q0078 iv.

Cough 1v. Diarrhea/ Vomiting v. Other injury, abnormality or disability *****DECISION POINT***** ****************************************************************************** ********************** CALL 911 IN THE EVENT OF SERIOUS ILLNESS OR OTHER EMERGENCY ****************************************************************************** ********************** e. If none of the above signs and/or symptoms are present, then detainees continue intake processing. f. If chief complaint, signs, and/or symptoms are present, but non-urgent: 1. BSFAU providers separate detainees with potential diseases from the general population. Detainees suspected of having an active communicable disease -including Scabies, Chickenpox, or symptoms of an active communicable diseases such as diarrhea or vomiting -should be isolated from the general population and from each other. 11. Detainees proceed to the BSFAU for further medical evaluation, or are transported to the local MTF if a more serious medical condition develops. g. Engage with CBP personnel to ensure nutritional needs are met. h. Water should be freely available at all times. C. Detainees apprehended with medications. 1. BSFAU personnel will examine all prescription and non-prescription medications in the possession of detainees. Detainees with a chronic medical condition based on medications found on their person at the time of apprehension should be prioritized for processing. If the need for a medication cannot be determined at the BSFAU, the detainee will be sent to the local MTF for evaluation. HSBP1015Q0078 a. If deemed appropriate for continued use, the medication will be replaced with the U.S. equivalent formulation of the medication. b. All medications shall be handled according to Appendix E (Protocol for Handling and Storage of Detainee Medications). c. If a prescription is warranted by a particular medical condition, and the BSFAU does not have an adequate supply of the required medication available, the BSFAU provider will write a prescription. The BSFAU provider is not authorized to prescribe medications scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act. d. Once written, the prescription will be submitted to the USBP station supervisor in the processing center to complete a Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDP AR) in order to fill the prescription at a local pharmacy. e. Upon approval of the MEDPAR, either a BPA or BSFAU EMT will pick up the prescribed medication for the detainee. It is acceptable to group batches of prescriptions, to ensure efficiency for USBP and BSFAU personnel. Medical Evaluation: DEFINITION: An assessment conducted with the patient in the physical presence of the mid\u00ad level practitioner. Within the BSFAU this process includes a directed exam of the detainee based on a chief complaint, signs and/or symptoms identified during the Public Health Screening D.

HSBP101 5Q0078 Appendix B: Protocol for Scabies Treatment This protocol: Cannot be implemented until the BSFAU provider has documented that active transmission of scabies is occurring within a cohort CBP USBP EMTs who have successfully completed the scabies protocol training may use this protocol. CBP USBP EMTs may not administer Permethrin to patients younger than one year of age or to patients with a confounding skin rash or other medical complaints. Also, pregnant and nursing mothers will be excluded and should be sent for further medical evaluation. Prior to administering Permethrin, document a history of a normal menstrual period within the preceding 30 days. Personal protective equipment: Exam gloves should be used any time direct contact will be made with any subjects that are confirmed or suspected of having scabies. The following medications for the treatment of scabies shall be used: Prescription: Permethrin cream 5%; Brand name product: Elimite* Permethrin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of scabies in persons who are at least 2 months of age. Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid similar to naturally occurring pyrethrins which are extracts from the chrysanthemum flower. Permethrin is safe and effective when used as directed. It kills the scabies mite and eggs and is the drug of choice for the treatment of scabies. Two (or more) applications, each about a week apart, may be necessary to eliminate all mites, particularly when treating crusted (Norwegian) scabies. Treatment for confirmed or suspected cases of scabies will be Permethrin 5% lotion. The medication should be applied directly to the skin on all areas of the body except the head. On infants, the medicine is also applied to the scalp, face, and neck, taking care to avoid the area around the mouth and eyes; however, use in this protocol is restricted to age 12 months and up. After application, the medication will be left on the skin for 8-24 hours before being washed off. During application and rinsing contact with the eyes, the inside of the mouth, nose and vagina should be avoided as it will cause irritation. Due to potential complications, treatment for pregnant females is optional. Prescription permethrin, such as Elimite cream, is the most commonly used medicine to treat scabies. Unlike the more toxic lindane, pennethrin is HSBP101 5Q0078 considered safe for infants as young as two months old. Only permethrin, crotamiton, and sulfur ointment are considered safe for treating children below age two. Provide patient (or guardian) the Scabies Information Sheet (Attachment D). For Itching: Use of the following over-the-counter medicines can help relieve itching from scabies: Oral antihistamines (such as Benadryl). These medicines will not interfere with the diagnosis or treatment of scabies. Corticosteroid creams (such as hydrocortisone cream). This type of medicine may make the scabies sores look different and make it harder for to diagnose the problem. Hygiene Guidance: Immediately after starting treatment for scabies, clean all the affected person's bedding and the clothing that he or she has worn during the past 2 to 3 days (48 to 72 hours). Wash all items in hot water and dry them in a hot dryer, or dry-clean them.

Purpose Attachment H ATTACHMENT H Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) U.S. Customs and Border Protection Southwest Border Medical Services Contract This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government-developed and applied document used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of this performance-based service contract. The intent is to ensure that the contractor performs in accordance with the performance metrics and the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract. The contract requirement is for Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) and the Office of Field Operations support services. USBP is responsible for providing contract oversight. The contractor's performance will be monitored by the Contracting Officer's (CO) Representative (COR). A properly executed QASP will assist the Government in achieving the objectives of this procurement. 2. Scope To fully understand the roles and responsibilities of the parties, it is important to first define the distinction in terminology between Quality Control Plan and the QASP. The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the contract. The QASP on the other hand, is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the contractor's efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the contract. 3. Government Resources The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan: Contracting Officer -A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into contracts and make related determination and findings on behalf of the Government. The CO for this contract is Amanda Freeman, or any CBP CO with a written warrant, which sets forth limitations of authority. Contracting Officer's Representative -An individual appointed in writing by the CO to act as their authorized representative to assist in the technical administration of the contract. The COR is Normalinda Gonzalez. The limitations of authority are contained in a written letter of appointment. Task Order Manager/Monitor (TOM) -A USBP Agent is designated by the Chief Patrol Agent in each Southwest Border Sector or Port Of Entry leadership to work with the COR and assist in the day-to\u00ad day technical execution and administration of the contract. The TOM may be supported by one or more designated On-Duty Supervisors (ODS) to provide coverage for each work shift. 4. Responsibilities 82 Attachment H The following Government resources shall have responsibility for the implementation of this QASP: Contracting Officer -The CO ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract, and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the CO that assures the contractor receives impartial, fair and equitable treatment under the contract. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the contractor's performance. Contracting Officer's Representative -The COR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and assures proper Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect contract price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the CO for action. The Medical Program Manager, with the input of the CBP Medical Advisor, will support the COR in performing his/her duties by providing input into contractor assessment factors that require medical quality surveillance input from medical Subject Matter Experts. Task Order Manager/Monitor -The TOM is responsible for day-to-day technical execution and administration of the contract. The TOM provides direct Government surveillance of the contractor's performance and provides regular input to the COR for quality assurance reporting. The TOM verifies the Metrics Reporting System is accurately reporting routes and hours delivered. The TOM or their designated ODS' are not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Governm ent's behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect contract price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the CO for action. 5. Methods of Quality Assurance Surveillance Contractor Performance Assessment -The annual Government assessment will be used appropriately as an additional performance oversight and communication tool with the QASP. QASP -The below listed methods of surveillance will be used by the COR in the technical administration of this QASP. In addition to the below instructions, the form to be used for documentation of quality assurance surveillance is the Surveillance Activity Checklist, Enclosure (5). 6. Surveillance Enclosures (1), (2), (3) set forth the performance standards, definitions, and checklist for the COR to document the results of the surveillance. 7. Documentation In addition to providing monthly reports to the CO, the COR will maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendati ons, and any actions related to the Governmen t's performance of the quality assurance function, including the originals of the Quality Assurance Checklists. All such records will be maintained for the life of the contract. The COR shall forward these records to the CO at termination or completion of the contract. 8.

' QASP -Enclosure (2) Enclosure (2) -Definitions for Evaluation Areas and Ratings -All Performance Work Statement will be assessed based on the following definitions: Rating Criteria: For contractor performance rating purposes, the following rating criteria will be used: \"Exceptional\", \"Very Good\", \"Satisfactory\", provided below. A PWS reference and examples of performance must be included for any evaluation area rated other than satisfactory. This information simplifies the verification process for reviewers and when necessary, hastens corrective action by the contractor. When determining ratings take into consideration all sources of contract performance indicators, e.g., results of contractor self-inspections, government inspections, contractor reports, government correspondence to the contractor, etc. This section may also include comments regarding mitigating circumstances to contract performance issues beyond the control of the contractor, comments regarding progress, and other performance related comments. 5 -Exceptional -Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds expectations to the Governm ent's benefit. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. Note: To justify an Exceptional rating, significant events in the evaluation area shall be identified and how it was a benefit to the Government shall be stated. However, a singular event could be of such magnitude that it alone constitutes an Exceptional rating. 4 -Very Good -Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some expectations to the Governmen t's benefit. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. Note: To justify a Very Good rating, a significant event in the evaluation area shall be identified and how it was a benefit to the Government shall be stated. 3 -Satisfactory -Performance meets contractual requiremen ts. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task contain some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. Note: To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor recovered from without impact to the contract. A fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractor will not be assessed a rating lower than Satisfactory solely for not performing beyond the requirements of the contract. 2 -Marginal -Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed reflect a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Note: To justify Marginal performan ce, a significant event in the evaluation area that the contractor had trouble overcoming shall be identified and how it impacted the Government shall be stated. A Marginal rating should be supported by providing the correspondence used to notify the contractor of the contractual deficiency (e.g., Corrective Action Requests; Government Inspection Reports, etc.). 1 -Unsatisfactory -Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the task or sub-task contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's actions appear or were ineffective. Note: To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, multiple significant events in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming shall be identified and how it impacted the Government shall be stated. However, a singular problem could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by providing the correspondence used to notify the contractor of the contractual deficiencies (e.g., Corrective Action Requests; Government Inspection Reports; etc.) 90 ' ' QASP -Enclosure (2) Note 1: N/ A (not applicable) should be used if the ratings are not going to be applied to a particular area for evaluation. 91 HSBP1015Q0078 Enclosure (3) -Surveillance Activity Checklist Surveillance: The COR will perform assessments utilizing the contractor performance evaluation rating definitions listed in Enclosure (3).

Although the initial outbreaks of the 2019 novel Coronavirus are believed to be linked to exposure to shellfish and meat markets in Wuhan, China, new cases of the 2019-nCoV disease have been confirmed in neighboring countries, including some as far away as here in the United States. Cases of person-to-person transmission have been increasing, with spread to multiple countries, including 11 confirmed cases in the USA .. Health authorities in Wuhan, China and surrounding areas are monitoring this disease closely and steps are being taken to contain the disease locally. As of February 4, 2020 all modes of transportation leaving China (air, rail, sea, etc.) are being restricted and every effort is being taken to conduct exit scree ning at surrounding area airports. Additional restrictions have been implemented in the United States to prevent the spread of disease including flight restrictions into a limited number of airports and self-monitored home quarantine for 14 days for anyone returning from affected areas. More information about Coronavirus can be found here at the CDC infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, aware ness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. In general, the overall risk to CBP personnel is assessed to be low. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with nCoV, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP will continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with appropriate stakeholders and will adjust guidance as appropriate. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational aware ness regarding this outbreak. Note: Risk categories (Very High, High, Medium, and Low) are to be used in conjunction with this document only. They refer to the risk relative to the hazard identified; they do not correlate to overall risk of contracting Coronavirus Disease or risk categories used by other agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or in other documents such as the Workforce Health and Safety Coronavirus Health Advisories Screening Guidance, CDC Coronavirus Advisories, or Health Alert Notices (HAN) meant for other audiences.

Use an EPA-registered disinfectant suitable for non-enveloped viruses (e.g. adenovirus, norovirus, poliovirus) to treat spills and to disinfect surfaces after bulk spill material has been removed. See https://ww w.epa.gov/sites/p roduction/files/ 2016- 12/document s/list_a_sterilizer.pdf If an EPA-registered not available, use a 10% common household bleach-water solution (one (1) part chlorine bleach to nine (9) parts of water) to treat spills and to disinfect surfaces. Nitrile or fluid impermeable gloves . Wear an N95 respirator . Eye protection (non -vented goggles) or face shield to cover nose and mouth. Liquid impermeable gown (for large cleanup jobs wear liquid impermeable suit/coveralls). Closed toe shoes and fluid impermeable shoe covers . Dispose of all infectious material as bio hazardous waste in accordance with existing guidance. 4 Notes: 1. This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CBP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This JHA only applies to operations that involve travelers and people who have traveled to, from or through countries identified as being affected by the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). At the time of developing this JHA, cases were being reported daily. See the CDC website below for current information on the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease. 2. CBP Respiratory Protect ion. All CBP Officers and Agents who wear a respirator must be medically cleared and fit tested per the CBP Respiratory Protection Program Policy (See HB 5200-08B) and below link for respirator clearances website. All Voluntary Use of respirators will be per CBP policy as outlined in HB 5200-08B, CH 26. 3. The highest risk of contracting the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease appears to be from it spreading from persons infected by the disease through coughing/sneezing in close contact with other people. Protecting yourself through droplet and respiratory protection much like other respiratory illnesses such as influenza is the best way to prevent the spread of Coronavirus Disease. 4. The HRM, OSH Division will monitor the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease outbreak and will make recommendations to CBP leadership based on information received from DHS Workforce Health and Safety (WHS), CDC, OSHA, WHO and others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), World Health Organization (WHO), and other public health agencies are now categorizing the outbreak of COVID-19, that has spread to countries around the globe, including here in the United States, as a global pandemic. While the general risk from COVID-19 to CBP personnel and the public is still considered low, risk of exposure does vary by geographic location, age, underlying health risk factors, and the nature of work being performed. It is important that all personnel take the standard precautions recommended in the revised JHA, along with other credible public health entities. For the purpose of CBP guidance and protocol, the JHA should be considered CBP policy, and should be implemented accordingly. The attached JHA replaces all previous versions issued and contains specific recommendations which apply to CBP operations related to COVID-19.

Salaza Executive Director.__ ____________ __. Privacy and Diversity Office COVID-19 and Confidential Medical Information With the designation of the COVID-19 virus as a global pandemic, I want to remind CBP leadership of the legal requirements and resources available for collecting and sharing information about CBP personnel (employees and contractors) regarding their health and wellness. Whether or not a specific employee or contractor has contracted COVID-19, the information pertaining to the individual must be treated as Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (Sensitive PII) and as a confidential medical record. As a reminder, medical information about CBP personnel is protected and confidential pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In certain circumstances, supervisors and managers may be told about necessary restrictions on work duties and about necessary accommodations; and first responders and safety personnel may be told if the condition might require emergency treatment. Despite the heightened interest, do not disclose medical information about individual employees or contractors outside of CBP without authorization from the Privacy and Diversity Office (PDO), pursuant to CBP Directive 2120-10. The sharing of aggregate data related to the number of impacted personnel within an office that does not include PII, does not need specific PDO authorization. When collecting and sharing information related to individual employees who may have been exposed to or contracted COVID-19: 1. Anonymize information about personnel to the extent practicable when notifying others of their possible exposure to a positive COVID-19 patient. 2. Collect only the minimum information necessary to respond to official requests or taskers -this should not include names, ages, or other identifying information. 3. Do not share any identifying information about specific employees or contractors outside of CBP without explicit authorization from PDO. 4. Anonymize all information about impacted employees and contractors whenever possible. 5. Only use authorized methods to share identifying information about specific employees beyond the employee or contractor's local chain of command. COVID-19 and Confiden tial Medical Information Page 2 6. Keep confidential any additional medical information an employee or contractor voluntarily discloses. Supervisors may frequently check in on employees and may ask employees if they are experiencing influenza-like symptoms, such as fever or chills and a cough or sore throat. Supervisors must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record. F . d. _________ __. For questions regarding reasonable accomjodations during a pandemic please contact l(b)(5) _ If you are concerned that sensitive PII may have been disclosed without proper authorization as a result of the agency's response to this pandemic event, please contact the fbl(6) I Distribution: All Executive Assistant Commissioners Chief, U.S. Border Patrol All Assistant Commissioners Chief Counsel Executive Director, Privacy and Diversity Office Executive Director, Policy Directorate Executive Director, Planning, Analysis and Requirements Evaluations Executive Director, Laboratories and Scientific Services Executive Director, Intergovernmental Public Liaison Director, Information and Incident Coordination Center Director, Law Enforcement Officer/ Agent Safety and Compliance Director, Office of the Executive Secretariat Senior Advisor, Office of Trade Relations Chief of Staff Deputy Chief of Staff Deputy Chief of Staff (Policy) COVID-19 and Confidential Medical Information Hello All - For your awareness the attached memo was sent out earlier today by the Privacy and Diversity Office entitled \"COVID -19 and Confidential Medical Information\".

Thanks l(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Good Afternoon, Various public healthcare providers were contacted concerning the potential of persons infected with or having been exposed to Novel Coronavirus, namely VVRMC/FDRMC and LSGS personnel. Their main recommendation was to follow CDC guidelines and immediately notify the infection control personnel at the local hospital I medical facility prior to arrival. The more time the better. in order to coordinate procedures for screening/admission. The following personnel were contacted and are the POCs for infectious disease protocols at their respective locations or offices: Air Evac Program Director f b)(6) I 2. fb)(6) Val Hospital b)(6) 3_ (b)(6) ort uncan Hospital lnfe ron Control Officer For additional information the CDC website keeps the most current information on the virus at: https://www.cdc.gov/cor onavirus/2019-nCoV/ind ex.html. To reiterate as with other potential communicable health risks the most important thing we can do is minimize exposure. This could be done by good field interviews and initial medical/health evaluations outside of our holding facilities in order to identify potential cases. rb)(6); (b)(7)(C) Patrol Agent in Charge Special Operations Detachment Del UPDATED 01/29/2020 Wednesday, January 29, 2020 6:08:42 PM imaae_0.0-8.o_no CDC OLJARANTINE STATIONS pd{ CDC Traveler Health Advisory odf CDC EOG CONTACT.Rdf Gentlemen, For immediate implementation.

Although the initial outbreaks of the 2019 novel Coronavirus are believed to be linked to exposure to shellfish and meat markets in Wuhan, China, new cases of the 2019-nCoV disease have been confirmed in neighboring countries, including some as far away as here in the United States. Cases of person-to-person transmission have been increasing, with spread to multiple countries, including 11 confirmed cases in the USA .. Health authorities in Wuhan, China and surrounding areas are monitoring this disease closely and steps are being taken to contain the disease locally. As of February 4, 2020 all modes of transportation leaving China (air, rail, sea, etc.) are being restricted and every effort is being taken to conduct exit scree ning at surrounding area airports. Additional restrictions have been implemented in the United States to prevent the spread of disease including flight restrictions into a limited number of airports and self-monitored home quarantine for 14 days for anyone returning from affected areas. More information about Coronavirus can be found here at the CDC infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, aware ness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. In general, the overall risk to CBP personnel is assessed to be low. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with nCoV, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP will continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with appropriate stakeholders and will adjust guidance as appropriate. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational aware ness regarding this outbreak. Note: Risk categories (Very High, High, Medium, and Low) are to be used in conjunction with this document only. They refer to the risk relative to the hazard identified; they do not correlate to overall risk of contracting Coronavirus Disease or risk categories used by other agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or in other documents such as the Workforce Health and Safety Coronavirus Health Advisories Screening Guidance, CDC Coronavirus Advisories, or Health Alert Notices (HAN) meant for other audiences.

This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CBP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This JHA only applies to operations that involve travelers and people who have traveled to, from or through countries identified as being affected by the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). At the time of developing this JHA, cases were being reported daily. See the CDC website below for current information on the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease. 2. CBP Respiratory Protect ion. All CBP Officers and Agents who wear a respirator must be medically cleared and fit tested per the CBP Respiratory Protection Program Policy (See HB 5200-08B) and below link for respirator clearances website. All Voluntary Use of respirators will be per CBP policy as outlined in HB 5200-08B, CH 26. 3. The highest risk of contracting the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease appears to be from it spreading from persons infected by the disease through coughing/sneezing in close contact with other people. Protecting yourself through droplet and respiratory protection much like other respiratory illnesses such as influenza is the best way to prevent the spread of Coronavirus Disease. 4. The HRM, OSH Division will monitor the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease outbreak and will make recommendations to CBP leadership based on information received from DHS Workforce Health and Safety (WHS), CDC, OSHA, WHO and others.

The process is to have all transport vehicles disinfected once finished with the transportation of detainees. The NGs will be set up at the second guard shack for easy access to this procedure. This cleaning/ disinfecting process will only take several minu tes and should not hinder EPCPC or field operations. Upon apprehension of a group, Agents would drive into the facility, unload the subjects and would properly screen them as per previous instructions. They would then re-load their transport vehicle and transport the subjects to the POE. Agents would then stop by the EPCPC on their way back to the field where the NG personnel would be waiting to disinfect the transport cab of the vehicle. The disinfection process would entail NG personnel using the manual pump sprayer to spray the bleach/water solution as recommended by the CDC into the transport cab of the unit while standing outside the unit. The substance would then be allowed to \"air-out\" for no less than ten (10) minutes prior to using it to transport another subject/group of subjects.

As indicated in the previous emails, this will be taking place at the EPCPC. This has been discussed with EGS and EGT PAI Cs as well as EPCPC (A)DP AIC and they are all onboard with the plan. I have attached a proposed schedule for NG personnel to follow. The schedule shows a start date of Sunday April 5, 2020. However, CAR plans on starting tomorrow at 0600 with our soldiers. They will receive instructions here at that time and then travel to the EPCPC (they should be there by 0700). In order to begin during the next couple of days, EGS and EGT may have to allow their assigned NG personnel to take the day off tomorrow and then push through the rest of the week. I have also attached an aerial map of the facilit at the EPCPC. The decontamination station is at the top of the picture. CAR SBP A (b)(B); (b)(?)(C) will drive to the EPCPC with the CAR NG team to make sure they are set up with the proper PPE, equipment, and instructions. Each station will provide 5 boxes of N95 Respirators, 4 pairs of goggles and 2 boxes of Large/2 boxes of Medium latex gloves ( 4 total). As you know, DRT is working on the procurement of other decontamination equipment. Adjustments will have to be made once we receive such equipment. Please advise when your NG teams will be ready to begin the vehicle decontamination mission. Call me at any time if there are any questions or concerns. Respectfully, l(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Watch Commander U.S. Border command approved this plan, I need to know when you plan to start and if you have the personnel already in place or we need to shift some NG. Thank you, b)(6); (b)(7)(C) From: l(b)C5); (b)(?)(C) Below is a plan we are working on for decontamination of transport units in the southern corridor. We are requesting the support of the National Guard to help us complete this mission on a daily basis at the Eagle Pass Centralized Processing Center (EPCPC). The request is for National Guard Personnel from CAR, EGS and EGT, (2 per station) to cover the three shifts (Days, Swings, Mids). Each of the two soldiers per shift would have different days off and this would ensure coverage every day. I have attached an aerial picture of the EPCPC, which illustrates the proposed decontamination station where NG personnel would be performing their duties. Leadership from the three stations all support the plan and the three stations will provide the PPE and equipment necessary for the NG personnel to perform their mission in a safe manner. Further details regarding this request for support are listed below. Please call me at any time if there are any questions. Respectful ly, rb)(6); (b)(7)(C) 1 Watch Commander U.S. (b)(7)(C) From: fb)(6); (b)(7)(C) Subject: Vehicle Decontamina tion/Disinfecting Procedures Good Afternoon, After discussion with Occupational Safety and Health Specialist (OSH) l(b)(5); (b)(7)(C) and per the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, it has been determined that the steps below will be taken when disinfecting transport vehicles each time they are used to transport subjects. Designated personnel will disinfect the transport cab of the transport unit after each time the vehicle is used to transport detainees regardless of suspicion of possible contamination. Designated personnel will use a manual pump sprayer with a mixture of One 1/3 cup of bleach into one gallon of water. Designated personnel will don the appropriate PPE to include N-95 respirators, Protective gloves and Goggles for eye protection. The bleach/water mixture will be sprayed into the transport area of the vehicle and will be allowed to \"air-out\" for no less than 10 minutes prior to transporting a different group of subjects. If the use of the entire gallon is not necessary during each shift, that solution will be discarded at the end of the shift and a new gallon will be mixed every 24 hours. We recommend the deployment of NG personnel from CAR, EGS and EGT, two (2) per station to cover the three shifts (Days, Swings, Mids). Each of the two soldiers per shift would have different days off and this would ensure coverage every day. I recommend they be staged at the soft sided processing area at the EPCPC with the proper PPE and equipment necessary to complete their daily mission. CAR has purchased manual pump sprays and bleach to help complete this task daily. We have also put together small booklets with instructions for mixing the solution, usage of the manual spray pump, CDC recommendations, and a Safety Data Sheet to be used as a reference. Below is what we expect would happen after a subject or group of subjects is encountered. Upon apprehension of a group, Agents would drive into the facility, unload the subjects and would properly screen them as per previous instructions. They would then re-load their transport vehicle and transport the subjects to the POE. Agents would then stop by the EPCPC on their way back to the field where the NG personnel would be waiting to disinfect the transport cab of the vehicle. The disinfection process would entail NG personnel using the manual pump sprayer to spray the bleach/water solution as recommended by the CDC into the transport cab of the unit while standing outside the unit. The substance would then be allowed to \"air\u00ad out\" for no less than ten (10) minutes prior to using it to transport another subject/group of subjects. PPE would be provided by the three stations to ensure NG personnel are able to perform their mission in a safe manner.

Everything looks good, even though you may be overdoing it a bit on the amount of bleach (1/2 cup). CDC web site says 1/3 cup (https-//www cdc gov/coronavjrus/2019- ncov/prepare/disjnfecting -your-home.htm ]). As far as the Simple Green d Pro 3 Plus, is what the manufacturer suggests as a disinfectant (https:Usimplegreen.corn/products/disinfecting/ ), so that is what I would recommend also. On both, the bleach and simple green, you are required to obtain and follow the manufacturers' directions and the Safety Data Sheet. Any other questions, give me a holler before 1 April 2020 (retirement date). l(b_><5_> ____ lsafety and Health Specialist, Del Rio sector, .... l<b_l<6_l ____ _. On Thu, Mar 26, 2020 at discussed, we are working on providing a set of instructions for personnel to follow when disinfecting a transport unit. Agents are to disinfect transport cab of their assigned unit after each time the vehicle is IJ used to transport detainees regardless of suspicion of possible contamination. The agent will use a manual pump sprayer with a mixture of One 1/2 cup of bleach into one gallon of water. Agents will don the appropriate PPE to include N-95 respirators, Protective gloves and Goggles for eye protection. The bleach/water mixture will be sprayed into the transport area of the vehicle and will be allowed to \"air-out\" for no less than 10 minutes prior to transporting a different group of subjects. If the use of the entire gallon is not necessary during each shift, that solution will be discarded at the end of the shift and a new gallon will be mixed every 24 hours. Please advise if there is anything you deem unsafe about the disinfecting procedure; all suggestions are welcome. Respectfully, l(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Watch Topic: Headquarters POC: Guidance on Preventing Community Spread of COVID-19 Coronavirus Coordination Cell rb)(6) Office: Office of Field Operations, Operations Directorate To reduce the risk of community spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), if you have been potentially exposed to someone suspected of having COVID-19, you may be asked to remain at home and requested to self-observe, self-monitor or self-quarantine. The World Health Organization (WHO) believes COVID-19 does not transmit as easily as influenza, however, experts agree that the following measures play a critical role in slowing the spread of the virus. What can CBP emplovees do to protect themselves from getting the COVID-19 virus? Officers should continue to adhere to the CBP Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) for protective measures and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements. Be vigilant in hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing, and avoiding touching your face, especially your nose, mouth or eyes. Wash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Look out for the health and welfare of your coworkers and family by frequently cleaning and disinfecting your home, work area, and break area. Practice social distancing and voluntarily minimize congregate settings. Keep six feet from other people whenever possible and when in settings such as grocery stores, houses of worship, and others. Minimize congregate settings to essenil:ial activities. For those settings deemed essential, choose less frequented times such as going to the grocery store in early hours or late at night. Stay alert for development of flu-like symptoms. If you, or a household member, develop flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, difficulty breathing, malaise, etc.) follow high risk guidance. o High-Risk is defined as someone with flu-like symptoms or living in the same household, intimate partner of, or providing care in a home setting for a person with flu-like symptoms, suspicious or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. If a traveler is symptomatic, follow standard 'Recognize, Isolate, Notify, Give Support' (R.I.N.G.) notification procedures, and refer the traveler to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for inspection. What should a CBP employee do if thev have come in contact with a high-risk traveler or a fellow CBP employee tests positive for COVID-19? DON'T PANIC. The WHO has stated that the COVID-19 virus does not appear to be transmitted by people who are not currently showing symptoms. If a traveler was processed, and later becomes symptomatic, the likelihood of transmission is very low. CBP has published a COVID-19 specific JHA, which is risk and exposure based. CBP personnel should continue to consult and adhere to the JHA guidance. A COVID-19 workforce Resource Portal with all relevant information is available here . These resources are accessible through the CBPnet, and additional information will be updated to this location and provided to the field, as soon as it becomes available. What should vou do if vou or a family member begin to exhibit svmptoms of COVID-1 9? Actions: Self-Monitoring and Self-Quarantine Stay home until all symptoms of illness have resolved and no fever is registered for 24 hours without the use of medications. Separate the family member exhibiting symptoms from the rest of the family, if possible. Record your temperature twice daily; seek medical care if shortness of breath or illness worsens and you (or your family member) need additional care. Contact the local hospital prior to arriving and notify them of suspicion of COVID-19. No public activities in congregate settings ( e.g. movie theaters, places of worship, grocery stores, etc.). No domestic or international travel, unless approved by local public health authorities . Contact Local Public Health: the local public health department may check in daily to assess for symptoms and fever. Check-ins are through daily phone calls, interactive voice response, internet reporting, or via Skype or other video conferencing, with possible follow-up home visits as needed.

BACKGROUND FOR OFFICIAL USE onLY U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is supporting the U.S. Government's response to an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and which subsequently spread to at least 70 countries worldwide. The virus has been named \"SARS-Co V-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (abbreviated \"COVID- 19\"). On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Alex M. Azar II, declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation's healthcare community in responding to COVID-19. On the same day, the President issued a proclamation suspending the entry of aliens who were physically present in China during the 14-day period preceding their attempted entry to the United States. DHS issued supplemental guidance with instructions on implementation. On February 29, the President issued a second proclamation that suspended the entry of aliens who were physically present in Iran during the 14-day period preceding their attempted entry to the United States. As of March 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considered the risk of COVID-19 to the general American public to be LOW. CBP continues to monitor the situation closely as part of a whole-of-government approach to protecting the American people. CBP will update this guidance as the situation evolves. CBP employees can find additional health and safety information on the DHS Employee Resources site and the CBP COVID-19 Resource Portal. The CDC's latest corona virus situation summary is available at: https :/ /www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/20 19-nCo V /summary .html. II. 0 BJECTIVES Enhance employee and public awareness and understanding of CBP's roles and responsibilities in responding to COVID-19. Ensure that employees are aware of and have access to the resources and information that they may need to ensure their own and their families' health and safety. Emphasize protective measures that CBP is taking to ensure the safety of its workforce and the public. Clarify the measures CBP is responsible for versus the role of CDC and other partner agencies. fOR Of:HCJAL USE onLY 2 FOR OFFICIAL USe OJLY III.

INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS GUIDANCE During an emergency situation or pandemic impacting CBP operations, affected employees, the public and the news media will depend on both the CBP internal and public communications platforms for official and timely information. OPA will coordinate with OIT to ensure 24/7 internal communications capability. There are several key elements that must be followed to ensure consistency and relevance of messagmg: Internal Message Coordination To ensure the appropriate level of coordination and to ensure consistent, credible, comprehensive and accurate messaging, both internal and external information must be coordinated within a single CBP source, specifically OPA. OPA will coordinate closely with the Senior Medical Advisor, EOC, and the Office of Human Resources Management (HRM) to manage a process to ensure all non-operational communications from CBP office are coordinated and approved through the Senior Medical Advisor before dissemination through OPA internal communication channels. Incoming Message Request If a CBP office has non-operational communications that need to be disseminated to the CBP workforce, the requesting office will send their EAC/ AC approved message or information to OPA for initial review and approvalfbl (6l IOPA will advise the requestor that the request is moving forward to the EOC for approval fb)(B) Messages will be distributed using: L..----------' CBP Postmaster (all employees), Ronald Reagan Building-only message, Component-only message, supervisor/manager message, CBP Central (weekly message to all employees).

FOR OFFICIAL USE m1LY 5 FOR OFFICIAL USE onLY EOC Determination The EOC will provide OPA with the final approved message or information along with approval for distribution to either (1) the whole workforce; or (2) specific segments thereof. Based on that determination, OPA will ensure that the message or information is distributed through the appropriate internal communication channel or will request the component to send the message/information out directly if specific to that organization only. The EOC or Public Affairs Assistant Commissioner/Deputy Commissioner, will determine if further approvals are required by the Commissioner's Office or DHS Public Affairs. OPA will advise all parties once the message or information is distributed. Internal and External Communication Spokespersons OPA recommends that key leadership and subject matter specialists be identified as the primary spokespersons during the pandemic crisis. Clear internal communication channels must be used to ensure CBP employees are notified first of any emergent situation. WORKFORCE MESSAGES (INTERNAL) CBP's highest priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families. We are taking every available precaution, in coordination with the CBP Senior Medical Advisor, the CDC, and other expert guidance, to protect you -our workforce -so you can continue your important mission of protecting our nation. CBP has a national pandemic plan and continuity of operations plans that we are prepared to implement based on exposure and risk. CBP has procured plenty of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to keep our workforce safe. We have issued guidance to all employees on the appropriate use of this equipment. CBP has also set aside funding to procure additional PPE if needed. The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is LOW for the general American public and the general CBP workforce. It is important to remember that individual risk is based on exposure, which may vary across the workforce. CBP has developed a COVID-19 specific Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment, which is exposure and risk-based, consistent with CBP's operational mission. In addition, CBP has developed a COVID-19 Resource Portal where you can find relevant health and safety information. 6 FOR OFFICIAL USE m1LY FOR OFFICIAL USE OJLY CBP also has a Medical Surveillance Program to help identify and prevent adverse health effects that may result from work activities. If you feel you may have been exposed, please alert your chain of command immediately. If you become sick, stay home and consult your medical provider. The CDC recommends taking everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. Please take these precautions to limit the possibility of spread to your family or community: A void close contact with people who are sick. A void touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow, then throw the tissue in the trash. After contact with \"high-touch\" or shared surfaces ( counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, etc.), wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 -95% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Washing of hands is especially important after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Please remain cognizant of the health and safety of your colleagues: If you become sick, stay home. Become familiar with leave flexibilities that permit staying home for a sick family member. Emphasize respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene at home and work. Reconsider in-person meetings and business formalities. Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as appropriate. Check the CBP and CDC websites regularly for updated information. As part of our mission to protect this country, your communities, and your families, CBP will continue to support the robust interagency response to COVID-19. CBP has been through these kind of challenges before, and we know how to handle them. CBP is ready, and we will do whatever is necessary to protect the men and women on the frontline. WORKFORCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q: What is the novel coronavirus? A: Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in people. Corona.viruses circulate among animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. A novel corona.virus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing corona.virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis. 7 FOR orrtCIAL ur: ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USe OJLY Additional information about COVID-19 can be found on the CDC website. Q: What are the symptoms of the novel coronavirus? A: According to the CDC reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed COVID-19 cases. The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure: Fever Cough Shortness of breath Employees should call their healthcare professional if: (1) they develop symptoms and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19; or (2) if they have recently traveled from an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of COVID-19. Employees should visit the CDC website for more information. Q: How dangerous is the novel coronavirus? A: The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is LOW for the general American public and the general CBP workforce. Individual risk depends on exposure, which may vary across the workforce. Q: How can employees keep themselves and their families safe? A: The most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and all diseases similar to influenza are the measures outlined below: Get Vaccinated against influenza. Although COVID-19 is a different type of respiratory illness, the influenza vaccine can still help prevent seasonal influenza, which can avoid potential confusion with COVID-19. A void ALL Touching of your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands. The COVID-19 virus can stay viable on hard surfaces such as door knobs, hand rails, bathroom fixtures and faucet handles for up to 12 hours. Touching surfaces that may have been previously touched by individuals in early stages of COVID-19 can result in the indirect spreading from person to person. Stay Home when you are sick and consult your health care provider. If you notice any symptoms of fever, sore throat or trouble breathing and you have been in contact with anyone who has traveled to any region affected by COVID-19 or you are a close contact of some diagnosed with COVID-19, alert your health care provider prior to arrival. Cover your Cough or Sneeze with a tissue or the cuff of your elbow and immediately throw the tissue in the trash. NEVER cover your cough with your hands. Clean and Disinfect. After contact with \"high-touch\" or shared smfaces ( counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, etc.), wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol- 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY JlOR OJlJllCIAL USE m1L\u00a5 based hand sanitizer with at least 60 -95% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Washing of hands is especially important after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Any commonly touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected with EPA registered disinfectants such as Lysol or Clorox disinfecting wipes and sprays. There is also a CDC Disinfecting and Cleaning page with a list of EPA registered disinfectants. N95 Respirator/ Surgical Mask Use by the general public is not generally being recommended by CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), or any public health authorities at this time. CBP leadership is determined to ensure N95 respirators are available to the workforce should the situation change and their use becomes necessary, to include CBP Headquarters staff, mission support personnel, and personnel working in office settings who have traditionally not been provided N95 respirators in the past. Personnel need to understand the difference between a surgical mask (which is primarily for ill passengers/t ravelers), which will not generally provide the user with adequate protection from exposure and the use of an N95 respirator. The CBP Corona virus Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) provides detailed guidance for all personnel on when N95 respirators are considered mandatory and when they would be considered \"voluntary use.\" An example of voluntary use would include situations where CBP provides an N95 respirator for administrative and support personnel using mass transit to and from work when the risk level is increased. Such use would fall into \"Voluntary Use\" and CBP would follow existing \"Voluntary Use\" protocols. Those protocols involve providing an N95 at CBP expense, providing a short educational video on N95 voluntary use (which can be found on the COVID-19 Resource Page), and providing those personnel a copy of Appendix D of 29 CFR 1910.134 (which is an OSHA requirement for any employer who allows \"Voluntary Use\"). This could be provided personally by the individual's supervisor or via email, and Appendix Das well as this guidance will be posted on the COVID-19 Resource Page along with the current JHA. Additional Information on these topics and updated COVID-19 status can be found on the OSH Division COVID-19 Safety and Health Resource Page Here. Q. What should an employee do if he or she becomes ill or is suspected to have or tested positive for COVID-19? A: If a person becomes ill with any of the COVID-19 symptoms (fever, sore throat, difficulty breathing), they should stay home and contact their health care provider right away. Most health care providers are taking precautions to prevent the further spread of disease within the healthcare system. Employees should let their health care provider know if they have traveled to any area affected by COVID-19 or had any contact with confomed COVID-19 cases. Health care providers will determine the need for further testing/confirmation. Individuals may be designated as a 'Person Under Investigation' and may be referred for further evaluation and confirmatory testing. Employees should notify their CBP supervisor that they are being evaluated and should follow up after they have been evaluated by a health care provider. If employees are considered to be at risk for COVID-19, are identified as a 'Person Under Investigation', or test positive for COVID-19, they will be placed on OPM weather and safety leave. See OPM guidance on workplace flexibilities for 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE mlLY employees impacted by COVID-19. This information and more can be found on the CBP COVID- 19 Resource Portal. Q: How long should employees stay home if they are exposed to the coronavirus? A: If an employee has been potentially exposed to someone who is at a high risk of having or who is suspected of having COVID-19, the employee may be asked to remain at home and may be asked to self-observe, self-monitor or self-quarantine for up to 14 days, or longer in specific circumstances, before returning to work. Employees should always consult their healthcare provider and notify their supervisor for more specific guidance. Q: What measures is CBP taking to ensure the health and safety of employees? A: CBP has national pandemic plans and continuity of operations plans in place and a comprehensive Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) has been conducted based on risk. We have appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) N95 at all ports, stations, air branches and every place we operate around the globe. CBP has also set aside funding to procure additional PPE if needed. CBP has HRM Safety and Occupational Health Specialist located in every Field Office and Sector to assist operational components complete the mission of CBP while ensuring that our employees remain safe. Q: An employee at my office tested positive for coronavirus. Will CBP close my office? A: Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, depending upon specific circumstances and based on consultation and guidance from appropriate authorities. Some facilities may be closed out of an abundance of caution. Employees should contact their direct supervisor for further instruction. If a supervisor is aware that someone in their facility has tested positive for the coronavirus, they should contact the nearest CDC office and notify CBP COVID-19 EOC. The CDC's state and local Quarantine Officer at the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine will work to identify which facilities, if any, need to be closed. The CDC will work with CBP if they have identified a facility for closure. Q: Will employees be expected to work if their office is closed? A: If a facility is closed, program offices are encouraged to use telework to the extent that doing so is appropriate. The CBP Telework Policy guidance is as follows: a. An employee who participates in the telework program would generally be expected to perform telework at home as long as the employee is asymptomatic. (See 5 CPR 630.1605.) If a telework program participant in these circumstances needs time off for personal reasons, then the employee would be expected to take other personal leave or paid time off (e.g., annual leave or sick leave to care for a family member). b. A telework-ready* employee who is quarantined at a location other than the employee's home is not eligible to telework because the quarantine location is likely not an approved work location for the employee. This employee should receive weather and safety leave as long as the employee is asymptomatic. c. A telework-ready employee who is restricted from the workplace because of the potential to infect others would generally be expected to perform telework at home as long as the employee is asymptomatic. FOR OFFICIAL UE ONLY POR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 10 FOR OFFICIAL USe OJLY d. An employee who is not a telework program participant would be granted weather or safety leave for quarantine periods based on potential exposure and an inability to perform work at an approved location. Telework is not an option. e. There is currently no provision within the CBP Telework Policy, or applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which would allow or require an employee without a telework agreement to work while quarantined or restricted from the workplace for safety reasons. * Telework-ready is defined as an employee who has a cun-ent approved telework agreement, and is equipped with the appropriate secure and approved technology equipment, and has an approved telework agreement to work from an alternate worksite location. If an employee has a telework agreement but does not have the necessary equipment, (e.g., lap top at their telework location), then they are not telework ready. Q: What code should I use in WebTA to report absence due to coronavirus? A: Employees would enter their leave category (annual, sick, or other type of leave) normally in WebTA utilizing their designated APC and CMIS code and entering the project code 4VR to link the use of leave to the corona virus project code. Q: Will workers' compensation be available to employees who contract coronavirus during the course of their duties? A: Employees have the right to file a workers' compensation claim for illnesses that have been diagnosed as the direct result of performing work duties. If an employee believes they have been exposed to people potentially infected with the novel coronavirus, such as travelers who may have contracted the disease while on travel, they should contact their local Safety and Workers' Compensation Offices for further assistance and take the following steps: 1. Notify your supervisor. 2. Supervisor files an incident report (CBP Form 502) in CBP eCOMP. 3. Next, contact your local workers' compensation point of contact (Injury Compensation Coordinator) to guide you on the process to file a workers' compensation claim and which form to use. (Note: Filing a claim is an employee driven action and you must elect to file a claim CA-I or CA-2). 4. Choose which type of claim to file. a. CA-1 -claim of traumatic injury (exposure on a specific date, time and location, within one 8-hour shift); or b. CA-2 -claim of occupational disease (exposure over time or multiple exposures on more than one date, time and location). 5. Choose whether you want to seek medical attention. Supervisors or Managers must complete their portion of the CA-1 or CA-2 in CBP eCOMP as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the employee completes their portion of the claim. Supervisor completion of their portion of the claim sends an alert to Managed Care Advisors (MCA), who will assign a nurse case manager. For potential corona.virus exposure, the nurse case manager will contact the employee and ask the following questions of the employee. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 11 FOR OFFICIAL Uf! ONLY 1. Did you file a form CA-1 or CA-2? 2. Are you ill/ have you sought medical attention? 3. Has the Public Health Service contacted you as part of an investigation or are you classified as a \"Person Under Investigation\"? 4. What, if any, Personal Protective Equipment were you wearing during the potential exposure event? 5. Did you get a flu vaccination this year?

Requests for on-camera interviews and filming related to COVID-19 should be declined at this time. Requests regarding enhanced health screening or quarantine measures should be directed to CDC. KEY MESSAGES CBP' s highest priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families and we are taking every available precaution to protect our workforce. The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is LOW for the general American public and the general CBP workforce. It is important to remember that individual risk is based on exposure, which may vary across the workforce. U.S. Customs and Border Protection continues to facilitate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) enhanced health screening of travelers entering or attempting to enter the United States with a nexus to mainland China or Iran due to the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID- 19). This enhanced health screening is for symptoms specifically related to the novel coronavirus and is conducted by CDC personnel upon a traveler's arrival. On January 31, 2020, the President of the United States signed a Presidential Proclamation entitled: \"Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus.\" Effective February 2, 2020, 5 p.m. EST, the Proclamation restricted and suspended the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of certain aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Autonomous Regions of Hong 12 FOR OFFICIAL USE OJLY FOR OFFICIAL USe OJLY Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period immediately preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. On February 29, 2020, the President signed a Presidential Proclamation entitled: \"Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Corona virus.\" Effective March 2, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. EST, the Proclamation suspended the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. Consistent with CBP's procedures, and in accordance with the January 31 and February 29 Presidential Proclamations, exempted individuals encountered by CBP with a nexus to China or Iran within 14 days of the encounter or with symptoms of illness are referred to CDC or local health officials for additional health screening. MEDIA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Q. Is CBP screening travelers? What is the process travelers will encounter when they get off the airplane? A. CDC personnel are responsible for the enhanced health screening of travelers in all locations. CBP is working with the CDC to identify an\u00b7iving travelers who have been in mainland China or Iran within the previous 14 days, as they require enhanced health screening. Those travelers are identified by CBP officers during their primary inspection and are referred for secondary screening where CDC personnel conduct the enhanced health screening. CDC makes any determination from there as to whether any additional measures must be taken. Q: How does CBP identify travelers who need additional screening? A: CBP officers use a combination of traveler history records, officer questioning and observation, and self-declarations to identify individuals requiring additional health screening. Q: Will individuals denied entry under the Presidential Proclamations be permitted to withdraw their application for admission? A: Individuals arriving at a land port of entry who are denied entry under the proclamations may be allowed to withdraw their application for admission, at the discretion of the CBP officer. Q. What protective measures are being taken? A. Consistent with existing procedures to prevent the spread of communicable disease, travelers identified with symptoms may be provided with a mask and referred to CDC or EMS personnel for additional health screening. CBP has issued guidance to all employees that outlines the current comprehensive use of Personal Protective Equipment including guidance regarding wearing masks in the appropriate circumstances (using a risk-based approach). 13 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE 0tqL'f Q. Are you expanding screening to land ports of entry or other airports? A: All CBP ports of entry are following the same operational guidance as issued by the Presidential Proclamations and the Department of Homeland Security. With exceptions specified in the Proclamations, foreign nationals (other than immediate family of U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and flight crew) who have been physically present in China or Iran within 14 days of their arrival at a U.S. port of entry will be denied entry into the United States. Additionally, any traveler exempted from the Proclamations who has been in anywhere in mainland China or Iran within 14 days of their return will be refened to CDC for additional health screening. Preclearance locations are following the same protocols as the land border ports and referring individuals requiring additional screening to CDC or local health officials. Q: Is this being expanded to Border Patrol? A: Consistent with existing CBP procedures, individuals apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol between the ports of entry with symptoms of illness are referred to CDC or local health officials for additional health screening. Additionally, all persons in U.S. Border Patrol custody who meet the CDC's coronavirus travel history and enhanced screening guidelines are being referred to CDC for additional screening. Q: Is CBP expanding referrals of individuals from other countries affected like Italy? A: CBP employees are encouraged to maintain situational awareness while processing individuals who have traveled from or transited through affected countries. If individuals are observed with symptoms of COVID-19 we will continue to work with the CDC to determine if a traveler is a possible public health risk by referring them for enhanced screening. As the COVID-19 epidemic progresses, we are reminding all CBP employees to use proper procedures to prevent the spread of communicable disease. Q. Are flights being re-routed or funneled into specific locations? A. Yes, travelers flying into the U.S. who have been physically present in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) or Iran within the past 14 days will be re-routed through one of the following airports: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Georgia Dallas/Ft. Wo1th International Airpoit (DFW), Texas Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), Michigan Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), New Jersey Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Hawaii Washington-Dulles International Airport (IAD), Virginia John F.

A: Not at this time. Q. What happens if a carrier cannot make a determination as to whether to board a passenger? A. Through the Immigration Advisory Program and Regional Carrier Liaison Groups, CBP assesses electronic passenger information and passenger reservation data to provide air carriers with boarding recommendations, but the carriers are ultimately responsible for identifying passengers subject to current travel restrictions to the United States. Q: How many flights have arrived since the new travel restrictions went into place and how many travelers have been referred for additional screening? A: Statement attributable to a CBP official: \"CBP continues to actively work with its partners to identify and refer individuals arriving to the U.S. requiring additional health screening in accordance with the Presidential Proclamations and supplemental guidance issued by DHS. Specific data or details on_fiight arrivals, travelers referred to CDC or individuals deemed inadmissible under the new travel restriction is not available at this time due to operational sensitivities and because information such as flight schedules and arriving passenger data changes rapidly. \" Q: How many individuals from China and Iran did CBP process at ports of entry/apprehend between ports of entry in FY19 and FY20 to date? A: Admissions statistics by country of citizenship are published annually in the DHS Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. CBP publishes apprehension statistics by country of citizenship annually. Please see here for the latest available figures. Q: What is CBP doing to address additional screening if the virus to spread to Central and South America? A: U.S. Customs and Border Protection's highest priority is to ensure the health, safety and security of our workforce and the American people. Agents and officers will maintain situational awareness while identifying individuals who have traveled from or transited through affected countries. If individuals are observed with symptoms of COVID-19 we will continue to work with the CDC to determine if a traveler is a possible public health risk by referring them for enhanced screening. As the COVID-19 epidemic progresses, we are reminding all CBP employees to use proper procedures to prevent the spread of communicable disease. Q: Is there any impact on Trade/Cargo screening? A: CBP continues to process cargo at its normal rate as there has been no identified threat as it relates to cargo shipments. Vessels or embarked crewmembers or passengers that have recently been 15 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY JlOR OJlJllCIAL USe OJLY in China will have their arrivals fu lly vetted to safeguard the American public yet facilitate trade. This safety protocol is not anticipated to slow down the movement of cargo. Refer to CDC or USCG for any additional information.

BACKGROUND FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is supporting the U.S. Government's response to an outbreak: of respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) corona virus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and which subsequently spread to more than 185 countries and all 50 states. The virus has been named \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" ( abbreviated \"COVID-19\"). On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC). On January 31, 2020, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Alex M. Azar II, declared a public health emergency (PHE) for the United States to aid the nation's healthcare community in responding to COVID-19. On the same day, the President issued a proclamation suspending the entry of aliens (with certain exceptions) who were physically present in China during the 14-day period preceding their attempted entry into the United States. DHS issued supplemental guidance with instructions for implementation. On February 29, the President issued a second proclamation that suspended the entry of aliens (with certain exceptions) who were physically present in Iran during the 14-day period preceding their attempted entry into the United States. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. On the same day, the President issued a third proclamation to suspend the entry of aliens (with certain exceptions) who were physically present in the 26 European countries that comprise the Schengen Area1 during the 14-day period preceding their attempted entry into the United States. On March 14, the President issued a fourth proclamation that expanded the travel restrictions to include certain aliens who were physically present in Ireland and the United Kingdom in the 14-day period preceding their attempted entry into the United States. On March 16, the White House announced \"15 Days to Slow the Spread,\" a nationwide effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 through the implementation of social distancing at all levels of society. The COVID-19 social distancing guidelines were subsequently extended through April 30. On April 16, the President Trump announced Guidelines for Opening Up America Again. On April 27, the White House unveiled the Opening Up America Again Testing Overview and Testing Blueprint designed to facilitate development and implementation of the robust testing plans and rapid response programs described in the President's Guidelines for Opening Up America Again. On March 20, CBP implemented its authority under 42 USC \u00a7 265 to immediately expel illegal border crossers to their country of last transit whenever possible. Additional public affairs guidance on this subject may be found in the CBP Communications Plan for the Implementation o,fTitle 42 USC\u00a7 265 at the Northern and Southern Land Borders. 1 The Schengen Area consists of 26 European countries that have generally eliminated passport controls at their internal borders. The Schengen countries are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spajn, Sweden and Switzerland. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL''l 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Also on March 20, the President temporarily restricted non-essential travel across the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land borders to prevent the further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States. The temporary land border restrictions were extended for an additional 30 days beginning on April 20, 2020. The land borders remain open to lawful trade and travel for emergency response, public health, and other essential purposes. On April 3, the President issued a memorandum instructing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in consultation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to use the Defense Production Act to keep certain scarce and threatened personal protective equipment (PPE) materials within the United States for domestic use. CBP is supporting this effort by temporarily holding shipments of specified PPE so that FEMA may determine whether to issue a rated order under the Defense Production Act to purchase the PPE, return it to the sender for use within the United States, or allow part or all of the PPE to be exported. More information about the memorandum may be found in the CBP Public Affairs Guidance for the Presidential Memo on the Allocation of Scarce or Threatened Health and Medical Resources to Domestic Use, April 8, 2020. Also on April 3, the CDC issued a recommendation that all Americans wear cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. On April 18, the President signed a proclamation to provide additional economic support to U.S. businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The order gives the Administration flexibility to allow a 90-day deferment period on certain payments for importers who have faced a significant financial hardship (i.e., who have at least a 40% year-to-year reduction in gross receipts) due to COVID-19. On April 22, the President signed a proclamation entitled: \"Proclamation Suspending Entry of Immigrants Who Present Risk to the U.S. Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the COVID-19 Outbreak.\" Effective April 23, the EO restricted and suspended the entry into the United States of certain classes of immigrant aliens. As of April 19, the CDC reported that cases of COVID-19 and community spread have been observed in all 50 states and that the country as a whole is in the acceleration phase of the outbreak. Close contacts of persons with COVID-19, healthcare workers, people in places where there is ongoing community spread of the virus, and travelers returning from affected international locations where community spread is occurring are at elevated risk of exposure, with the level of risk dependent on location. The CDC also reported that the following groups are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19: people age 65 and older; people who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility; and people of all ages with serious underlying health conditions. CBP employees can find additional health and safety information on the CBP COVID-19 Resource Portal, the DHS Employees website, the CDC website and coronavirus.gov. CBP Facilities Management & Engineering's map of U.S. coronavirus cases is available here. The CDC's latest coronavirus situation summa1y is available here. Information about symptoms and testing is available here.

INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS GUIDANCE During an emergency situation or pandemic impacting CBP operations, affected employees, the public and the news media will depend on both the CBP internal and public communications platforms for official and timely information. OPA will coordinate with OIT to ensure 24/7 internal communications capability. There are several key steps that must be followed to ensure consistency and relevance of messaging. Internal Message Coordinatio n To ensure the appropriate level of coordination and to maintain consistent, credible, comprehensive and accurate messaging, both internal and external information must be coordinated within a single CBP source, specifically OPA. OPA will coordinate closely with the Senior Medical Advisor, EOC, and the Office of Human Resources Management (HRM) to manage a process to ensure that all non-operational communications concerning COVID-19 from CBP offices are coordinated and approved through the Senior Medical Advisor before dissemination through OPA internal communication channels. Incoming Message Request If a CBP office has non-operational communications related to COVID-19 that need to be disseminated to the CBP workforce, the requesting office will send their Executive Assistant Commissioner/ Assistant Commissioner approved message or information to OPA for initial review and approval b)(6) OPA will advise the requestor that the request is moving forward to the EOC for approval b)(6) Messages will be distributed using: CBP Postmaster lonly messages, Component-only messages, supervisor/manager messages, CBP Central (weekly message to all employees). OPA will establish a new COVID-19 messaging title to ensure consistency and a high level of awareness of important, relevant information.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY EOC Determination The EOC will provide OPA with the final approved message or infonnation along with approval for distribution to either (1) the whole workforce; or (2) specific segments thereof. Based on that determination, OPA will either: (1) ensure that the message or information is distributed through the appropriate internal communication channel; or (2) advise the requesting component to convey the message/information directly to its staff. The EOC or Public Affairs Assistant Commissioner/Deputy Assistant Commissioner will determine if further approvals are required by the Commissioner's Office or DHS Public Affairs. OPA will advise all parties after the message or information is distributed. Internal and External Communication Spokespersons OPA recommends that key leadership and subject matter specialists be identified as the primary spokespersons during the pandemic crisis. Clear internal communication channels must be used to ensure CBP employees are notified first of any emergent situation. WORKFORCE MESSAGES (INTERNAL) CBP's highest priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families. We are taking every necessary precaution, in coordination with the CBP Senior Medical Advisor, the CDC, and other expert guidance, to protect you -our workforce -so you can continue your important mission of protecting our nation. CBP has a national pandemic plan and continuity of operations plans that we are prepared to implement based on exposure and risk. It is important to remember that individual risk is based on exposure, which may vary across the workforce. CBP is taking every necessary precaution to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure to our workforce and members of the public with whom we interact. CBP has developed a COVID-19 specific Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment, which is exposure-based, risk-based, and consistent with CBP's operational mission. CBP has ensured that each Sector and Field Office has a supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that is readily available to employees. We have issued guidance to all employees on the risk-based, job-specific use of that equipment. CBP has also set aside funding to procure additional PPE if needed. The CBP Senior Medical Advisor and Occupational Safety and Health team established robust procedures and guidance for supervisors and personnel to assess risk from potential COVID-19 FOlt OFFICIAL USE ONLY 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY exposure, inform recommended actions and ensure mission continuity during a complex, novel and evolving pandemic. To protect CBP employees and their families, CBP has developed a COVID-19 incident tracking tool. This tool is a step toward ensuring employee safety. It will raise awareness of any potential or confirmed exposure and help alleviate the spread of the virus. Anyone who knows -or even thinks -that they have been exposed to COVID-19 needs to use this important tracking tool. If you feel you may have been exposed, please alert your chain of command immediately and repo1t the exposure via CBP's COVID-19 incident tracker. All employees at facilities where an exposure has occurred are notified at the earliest opportunity. Employees who have been in direct contact with a colleague who has tested positive for COVID-19 are provided with guidance based on the specific risks associated with the exposure. CBP has developed a COVID-19 Resource Portal where employees can find relevant and up-to\u00ad date health and safety information. On April 16, the President released Guidelines for Opening America Up Again, providing a plan for rolling back social distancing measures and reopening the country's economy in several phases, depending on location. During each phase of the President's guidelines, you should: Continue to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60 -95% alcohol, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. A void touching your face. Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow. Throw the tissue in the trash. Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible. Strongly consider using face coverings while in public, and particularly when using mass transit. Stay home if you feel sick. Do not go to work or school. Contact and follow the advice of your medical provider. Continue to adhere to state and local guidance, as well as complementary CDC guidance, particularly with respect to face coverings. The CDC also recommends taking everyday preventive actions to help combat the spread of COVID-19. Please take the following precautions to limit the possibility of spread to your family or community: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL''l A void close contact and large gatherings, adhere to social distancing guidelines whenever possible, and remember that not all COVID-19 victims show outward signs of illness. Some people may only have some or none of the following symptoms: fever, cough, difficulty breathing, shaking with chills, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell. A void touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow, then throw the tissue in the trash. After contact with \"high-touch\" or shared surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, etc.), wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 -95% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Washing of hands is especially important after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. More information is available here. Please remain cognizant of the health and safety of your colleagues: If you become sick, stay home. Become familiar with leave flexibilities that permit staying home for a sick family member. Emphasize respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene at home and work. Consider alternatives to in-person meetings and business formalities. Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as appropriate. Check the CBP and CDC websites regularly for updated information. As part of our mission to protect this country, your communities, and your families, CBP will continue to support the whole of America response to COVID-19. CBP has been through these kind of challenges before, and we know how to handle them. We are ready, and we will do whatever is necessary to protect the men and women of CBP. WORKFORCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Symptoms and Risk 1. What is the novel coronavirus? A: Corona viruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in people. Coronaviruses circulate among animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis. Additional information about COVID-19 can be found on the CDC website and in the CDC FAQ. 11 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 2. What are the symptoms of the novel corona virus? A: People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported -ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. People with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19: Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Or at least two of these symptoms: Fever Chills Repeated shaking with chills Muscle pain Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or smell Employees should call their healthcare provider if: (1) they develop symptoms and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19; or (2) if they have recently traveled from an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of COVID-19. Employees should visit the CDC website for more information. 3. How dangerous is the novel coronavirus? A: According to the CDC, COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are: People aged 65 years and older People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, are also at higher risk, including: People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma People who have serious heart conditions People who are immunocompromised Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] 40) 12 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY People with diabetes People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis People with liver disease It is important for all CBP employees to stay informed about the outbreak:, maximize social distancing efforts at work and at home, and continue standard disease prevention practices. Workforce Health and Safety 4. How can employees keep themselves and their families safe? A: The most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are to: Get Vaccinated against influenza. Although COVID-19 is a different type ofrespiratory illness, the influenza vaccine can still help prevent seasonal influenza. This can help ensure COVID-19 symptoms aren't confused with influenza. A void ALL Touching of your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands. Details regarding virus viability on surfaces are still being determined, but current evidence suggests the COVID-19 virus can remain viable on surfaces for hours to days depending on the surface and environmental conditions. Touching surfaces that may have been previously touched by individuals in early stages of COVID-19 can result in the indirect spreading from person to person. Stay Home when you are sick and consult your health care provider. If you notice any symptoms of fever, sore throat or trouble breathing and you have been in contact with anyone who has traveled to any region affected by COVID-19 or you are a close contact of some diagnosed with COVID-19, alert your health care provider prior to arrival. Cover your Cough or Sneeze with a tissue or the cuff of your elbow and immediately throw the tissue in the trash. NEVER cover your cough with your hands. Clean and Disinfect. After contact with \"high-touch\" or shared surfaces ( counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, etc.), wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol\u00ad based hand sanitizer with at least 60 -95% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Washing of hands is especially important after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Any commonly touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected with EPA registered disinfectants such as Lysol or Clorox disinfecting wipes and sprays. There is also a CDC \"Cleaning and Disinfection\" web page with a list of EPA registered disinfectants. N95 Respirator/S urgical Mask Use by the general public is not generally being recommended by the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), or any public health authorities at this time. CBP leadership is determined to ensure N95 respirators are available to the workforce should the situation change 13 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL''l FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and their use becomes necessary, to include CBP Headquarters staff, mission support personnel, and personnel working in office settings who have traditionally not been provided N95 respirators in the past. Personnel need to understand the difference between a surgical mask, which will not generally provide the user with adequate protection from exposure and the use of an N95 respirator. The CBP Coronavirus Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment (JHA) provides detailed guidance for all personnel on when N95 respirators are considered mandatory and when they would be considered \"voluntary use.\" An example of voluntary use would include situations where CBP provides an N95 respirator or surgical mask for administrative and support personnel using mass transit to and from work when the risk level is increased. Such use would fall into \"Voluntary Use\" and CBP would follow existing \"Voluntary Use\" protocols. The use of N95 respirators should be reserved for front line personnel and high risk work situations for which they were intended. Those protocols involve providing an N95 at CBP expense, providing a short educational video on N95 voluntary use (which can be found on the COVID-19 Resource Page), and providing those personnel a copy of Appendix D of 29 CFR 1910.134 (which is an OSHA requirement for any employer who allows \"Voluntary Use\"). This could be provided personally by the individual's supervisor or via email, and Appendix Das well as this guidance will be posted on the COVID-19 Resource Page along with the current JHA. Additional Information on these topics and updated COVID-19 status can be found on the CBP COVID-19 Resources Portal. 5. What measures is CBP taking to ensure the health and safety of employees? A: CBP has national pandemic plans and continuity of operations plans in place and a comprehensive Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment (JHA) has been conducted based on risk. We have also developed COVID-19 Exposure Risk Determination Guidance. CBP has appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators, at all ports, stations, air branches and every place we operate around the globe. CBP has also set aside funding to procure additional PPE if needed. CBP has HRM Safety and Occupational Health Specialists located in every Field Office and Sector to assist operational components as they fulfill CBP's mission while ensuring that our employees remain safe. Additional information can be found on the CBP COVID-19 Resources Portal. 6. What resources are available for employees who are coping with increased stress and anxiety? A: There are several resources available to help employees and their family members cope with the uncertainty about the emergence of COVID-19. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available via telephone, video, and web chat for em lo ees and their de endents for up to twelve sessions per issue per person, 24/7.

Employees can also find a chaplain or peer support member using this interactive map. For more resources, visit CBP's Resilience Website to find information about the Veteran Support Program, tips to reduce stress, helpful mental health apps, and more. Please also visit the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSA) website. 14 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL''l p y a LnrtAr a p lvisit 1 a n r..A FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 7. What programs or resources is CBP providing to assist CBP employees' families? A: HRM will continue to provide services to employees who are working from home and their families by telephone and by video. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will be the primary resource for stress, anxiety, and financial wellness for CBP employees and families. In-person counseling services may be impacted and, if so, services will be available via telephone, video and web chat. EAP is available 24/7 by calling l(b)(B) lby visiting b)(6) land using the login password CBPEAP; or downloadmg the EAP Web app onto your work-issued mobile phone via the CBP Catalog Icon. CBP Backup Care could be an option in the event of school and care facility closures. In-home and in/out of network providers may also be impacted. The Friends and Family option is still available because, for this option, you will identify who will provide care. CBP employees are also encouraged to engage in self-care to boost their immune systems and help alleviate any stress. Personal Protective Equipment 8. Is the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) required? A: In certain work situations, PPE is required when there is a hazard that cannot be controlled by other engineering or administrative controls. In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.131 - 1910.134 standards and the CBP Safety and Occupational Health HB 5200-08B, a Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment (JHA) is a tool used to identify hazards and levels of risk for certain jobs or work tasks that require PPE. In the case of COVID-19, CBP has completed a comprehensive JHA which outlines what PPE is required and when its use is considered mandatory. An example of this could be frontline CBP personnel conducting processing of persons and being in close contact (within 6 feet) of someone who is displaying symptoms and is suspected of having COVID-19. In these types of work situations the use of PPE outlined in the COVID-19 JHA would be required and considered \"mandatory use\". There are also situations in which CBP may authorize \"voluntary use>' of PPE even when there is no actual hazard that would require its use. Both \"mandato ry use\" and \"voluntary use\" of PPE are outlined in the \"notes\" page of the JHA as well as CBP HB 5200-08B and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134. 9. Do I have to be clean-shaven to wear a N95 respirator? A: Any time the use of an N95 respirator is required, the wearer must have a clean-shaven face around the entire area where the seal of the N95 mask touches the face, nose, and chin. This requirement also applies anytime an employee needs to be fit-tested or wear an N95 for work tasks as outlined in the COVID-19 Job Hazard Analysis and PPE Assessment (JHA) or any other work task where an N95 is required by policies or other JHAs (e.g., working in close contact within 6 feet of someone with signs/symptoms and suspected of having COVID-19, working in close contact within 6 feet of someone with active tuberculosis, handling Fentanyl and other loose powder narcotics). 15 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY The \"mandatory use\" of N95 respirators also requires a medical clearance and fit-testing as outlined in OSHA 29 CFR does not require medical clearances or fit-testing in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.131 1910.134, however Appendix D of 1910.134 shall be provided to all employees who use N95 respirators under \"voluntary use\" policies. This can be emailed or provided in hard copy. See CDC, OSHA, CBP and other links regarding N95 respirators on the Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page for more information. Exposure 10. What should an employee do if he or she becomes ill or is suspected to have or tested positive for COVID-19? A: If an employee becomes ill with any of the COVID-19 symptoms (fever, sore throat, difficulty breathing), the employee should stay home and contact his or her healthcare provider immediately. Most healthcare providers are taking precautions to prevent the further spread of disease within the healthcare system, so employees should let their provider know if they have traveled to an area impacted by COVID-19, or have had contact with known COVID-19 confirmed cases. Healthcare providers will determine the need for further testing/confirmation and individuals may be designated as a \"person under investigation,\" and referred for further evaluation and confirmatory testing. Employees should notify their CBP supervisor that they are being evaluated and should follow up after they have been evaluated by a health care provider. Additionally, all incidents of known or suspected exposure to COVID-19 should be reported via the incident incident tracking tool in the COVID-19 Resource Portal. If employees are considered to be at risk for COVID-19, and/or are identified as a 'person under investigati on', they will be placed on OPM weather and safety leave. In accordance with OPM guidance, use of weather and safety leave would supersede the use of sick leave for employees identified as persons under investigation. Use of weather and safety leave would be subject to the normal conditions-for example, weather and safety leave may be granted only if an employee is not able to safely perform work at an approved location. Thus, an employee who is not a telework program participant would be granted weather/safety leave for quarantine periods based on potential exposure. However, in the case of telework program participants, the employee's home is generally an approved location. Thus, the employee would generally be expected to perform telework at home as long as the employee is asymptomatic. If a telework program participant in these circumstances needs time off for personal reasons, then the employee would be expected to take other personal leave or paid time off (e.g., annual leave or sick leave to care for a family member). If an employee (whether or not a telework program participant) is diagnosed as being infected, or likely has been infected, with a quarantinable communicable disease, such as COVID-19, use of weather and safety leave would be inappropriate. Accrued or advanced sick leave would normally be used to cover such a period of sickness. CBP must grant sick leave when an illness prevents an employee from performing work. If the employee exhausts the available sick leave, other paid leave or paid time off may also be available to an employee. See OPM guidance on workplace flexibilities 16 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY for employees impacted by COVID-19. This information and more can be found in the CBP COVID-19 Resource Portal. 11. If I were to get a corona virus test, what would that entail? How long would it take to obtain results? A: CBP employees should call ahead to their doctor or a healthcare facility if they are concerned that they may need to be tested. Based on symptoms and exposure, healthcare professionals will determine if the employee needs to be tested in person and may confer with state authorities about where and how to conduct the testing. Healthcare professionals will provide instructions on how to arrive at the test site in a way that limits exposure. Medical facilities and doctors' offices ask that everyone call ahead so they can make arrangements to protect others when people come in for testing. The type of test will be determined by the healthcare professionals; however, the most common test is a nasopharyngeal sample. A sterile, cotton-tipped swab is gently passed through the nostril and into the nasopharynx. This is the part of the pharynx that covers the roof of the mouth. The swab is then sent to a lab for analysis. All states now have a public health lab testing for coronavirus, and an increasing number of commercial and academic labs are testing as well. Although results times vary depending on how and where you tested, lab results can normally be confirmed within 24 hours of receiving the samples taken at the time of testing. 12. How long should employees stay home if they are exposed to the coronavirus? A: If an employee has been potentially exposed to someone who is at a high risk of having or who is suspected of having COVID-19, the employee may be asked to remain at home and may be asked to self-observe, self-monitor or self-quarantine for up to 14 days, or longer in specific circumstances, before returning to work. Employees should always consult their healthcare provider and notify their supervisor for more specific guidance. 13. If an employee at my office tested positive for coronavirus, will I be informed that I might need to take additional precautions ? A: If a CBP employee at your office building tests positive for COVID-19 and you were in direct contact with that employee, you will be notified by your supervisor and given additional guidance based on the risks associated with the exposure. If you were not directly in contact with the employee, self-observe for symptoms for 14 days from the day of last exposure. If you develop symptoms, isolate yourself at home, contact your healthcare provider, and notify your supervisor. Following the incident, all employees in the building will be notified by HRM through a CBP Postmaster message indicating the level of risk to others in the building. 14. What do supervisors need to keep in mind when handling information related to employees who may have contracted or been exposed to the coronavirus? 17 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOlt OFFICIAL USE ONLY A: Whether or not a specific employee or contractor has contracted COVID-19, the information pertaining to the individual must be treated as Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (Sensitive PII)2 and as a confidential medical record. As a reminder, medical information about CBP personnel is protected and confidential pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In certain circumstances, supervisors and managers may be told about necessary restrictions of work duties and about necessary accommodations; and first responders and safety personnel may be told if the condition might require emergency treatment. Despite the heightened interest, do not disclose medical information about individual employees or contractors without authorization from the Privacy and Diversity Office (PDO), pursuant to CBP Directive 2120-10. The sharing of aggregate data related to the number of impacted personnel within an office that does not include PII does not need specific PDO authorization. When collecting and sharing infmmation related to individual employees who may have been exposed to or contracted COVID-19: 1. Anonyrnize information about personnel to the extent practicable when notifying others of their possible exposure to a positive COVID-19 patient. 2. Collect only the minimum information necessary to respond to official requests or taskers -this should not include names, ages, or other identifying information. 3. Do not share any identifying information about specific employees or contractors outside of CBP without explicit authorization from PDQ. 4. Anonyrnize all information about impacted employees and contractors whenever possible. 5. Only use authorized methods to share identifying information about specific employees beyond the employee or contractor's local chain of command. 6. Keep confidential any additional medical information an employee or contractor voluntarily discloses. Supervisors may frequently check in on employees and may ask employees if they are experiencing influenza-like symptoms, such as fever or chills and a cough or sore throat. Supervisors must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record. For questions regarding information sharing and sensitive PII contactfb_lC_6l ________ For questions regarding reasonable accommodations during a pandemic please contact l(b)(6) I 22 PersonaJly identifiable information, which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarras sment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual.

An employee at my office tested positive for coronavirus. Will CBP close my office? A: Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, depending upon specific circumstances and based on consultation and guidance from appropriate authorities. Some facilities may be closed out of an abundance of caution. Employees should contact their direct supervisor for further instructions. If a supervisor is aware that someone in their facility has tested positive for the coronavirus, they should contact the nearest CDC office and notify the CBP COVID-19 EOC l(b)(B) I The CDC's state and local Quarantine Officer at the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine will work to identify which facilities, if any, need to be closed. The CDC will work with CBP if they have identified a facility for closure. 16. Will employees be expected to work if their office is closed? A: If a facility is closed, program offices are encouraged to use telework to the extent that doing so is appropriate. The CBP Telework Policy guidance is as follows: a. An employee who participates in the telework program would generally be expected to perform telework at home as long as the employee is asymptomatic (See 5 CFR 630.1605). If a telework program participant in these circumstances needs time off for personal reasons, then the employee would be expected to take other personal leave or paid time off (e.g., annual leave or sick leave to care for a family member). b. A telework-ready* employee who is quarantined at a location other than the employee's home is not eligible to telework because the quarantine location likely is not an approved work location for the employee. This employee should receive weather and safety leave as long as the employee is asymptomatic. c. A telework-ready employee who is restricted from the workplace because of the potential to infect others would generally be expected to perform telework at home as long as the employee is asymptomatic. d. An employee who is not a telework program participant would be granted weather or safety leave for quarantine periods based on potential exposure and an inability to perform work at an approved location. Telework is not an option. e. There is currently no provision within the CBP Telework Policy, or applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which would allow or require an employee without a telework agreement to work while quarantined or restricted from the workplace for safety reasons. f. Supervisors should prepare their staff members who are telework-ready to take equipment home and work remotely, when possible. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 19 FOR OFFIClf .. L USE ONLY * Telework-ready is defined as an employee who has a cunent, approved telework agreement to work from an alternate worksite location and is equipped with the appropriate secure and approved technology equipment. If an employee has a telework agreement but does not have the necessary equipment (e.g., a laptop at their telework location), then they are not telework ready. Leave 17. Will I be required to use leave if I can't report to work due to coronavirus? A: Below is the guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management for employees who are affected by COVID-19, regardless of whether the impact is related to job duties. a. An employee who is diagnosed to have been infected by COVID-19 or who is symptomatic and is diagnosed as likely to have the COVID-19 infection may request sick leave, annual leave, leave without pay, or another accrued absence/leave type, or may invoke Family Medical Leave Act rights. Such an employee may no longer be eligible for telework and will not be eligible for weather and safety leave based solely on this situation. b. An employee who has a family member who is diagnosed to have been infected by COVID- 19 or who is diagnosed as likely to have the COVID-19 infection may request sick leave, annual leave, leave without pay, or another accrued absence/leave type, or may invoke Family Medical Leave Act rights in order to care for the affected family member. Such an employee would not be eligible for weather and safety leave based solely on this situation. c. A telework ready employee whose child or adult family member who requires in person care and may have been affected by a school, day care, elder care facility, or similar closure because of the COVID-19 issue, may request sick leave, annual leave, leave without pay, or another accrued absence/leave type if the child or family member cannot care for themselves. Such an employee may not be eligible for telework and is not eligible for weather and safety leave. 18. What code should I use in WebT A to report absence due to coronavirus? A: Employees would enter their leave category (annual, sick, or other type of leave) normally in WebTA utilizing their designated APC and CMIS code and entering the project code 4VR to link the use of leave to the coronavirus project code. Pay and Benefits 19. If I am required to work in an area where my exposure to COVID-19 is high, can I get hazard pay? Including apprehendi ng/transporting/proce ssing potentially infected aliens? A: CBP is working with the Department of Homeland Security to determine if hazardous duty pay is available. In general, General Schedule (GS) employees may receive additional pay for the performance of hazardous duty or duty involving physical hardship (5 U.S.C. 5545(d) and 5 CFR part 550, subpart I). Appendix A to subpart I of part 550 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, contains a list of approved hazard pay differentials. For example, a 25 percent hazard pay differential is authorized for employee exposure to \"virulent biologicals,\" which is defined as 'work with or in 20 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY close proximity to ... [m]aterials of micro-organic nature which when introduced into the body are likely to cause serious disease or fatality and for which protective devices do not afford complete protection.' To be eligible for the hazard pay differential, the agency must determine that the employee is exposed to a qualifying hazard through the performance of his or her assigned duties and that the hazardous duty has not been taken into account in the classification of the employee 's position. A hazard pay differential is not payable if safety precautions have reduced the element of hazard to a less than significant level of risk, consistent with generally accepted standards that may be applicable (see 5 CFR 550.904-550.906 for further information and exceptions). Agency managers, in consultation with occupational safety and health experts, must determine whether an employee is entitled to hazard pay on a case-by-case basis. Prevailing rate (wage) employees may receive an environmental differential when exposed to a working condition, physical hardship, or hazard of an unusually severe nature (see 5 U.S.C. 5343(c) (4) and 5 CFR 532.511). A list of approved differentials is contained in Appendix A to subpart E of part 532, of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. As with hazard pay differentials, determinations as to whether an employee qualifies for an approved environmental differential must be made by agencies on a case-by-case basis. 20. Will workers' compensation be available to employees who contract coronavirus during the course of their duties? A: Employees have the right to file a workers' compensation claim for illnesses that have been diagnosed as the direct result of performing work duties. If an employee believes they have been exposed to people potentially infected with the novel coronavirus, such as travelers who may have contracted the disease while on travel, they should contact their local Safety and Workers' Compensation Offices for further assistance and take the following steps: 1. Notify your supervisor. 2. Supervisor files an incident report (CBP Form 502) in CBP eCOMP. 3. Next, contact your local workers' compensation point of contact (In jury Compensation Coordinator) to guide you on the process to file a workers' compensation claim and which form to use. (Note: Filing a claim is an employee driven action and you must elect to file a claim CA-1 or CA-2). 4. Choose which type of claim to file. a. CA-1 -claim of traumatic injury (exposure on a specific date, time and location, within one 8-hour shift); or b. CA-2 -claim of occupational disease (exposure over time or multiple exposures on more than one date, time and location). 5. Choose whether you want to seek medical attention. Supervisors or Managers must complete their portion of the CA-1 or CA-2 in CBP eCOMP as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the employee completes their portion of the claim. Supervisor completion of their portion of the claim sends an alert to Managed Care Advisors (MCA), who will assign a nurse case manager. For potential coronavirus exposure, the nurse case manager will contact the employee and ask the following questions of the employee. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL\"l 21 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 1. Did you file a form CA-1 or CA-2? 2. Are you ill/ have you sought medical attention? 3. Has the Public Health Service contacted you as part of an investigation or are you classified as a \"Person Under Investigation\"? 4. What, if any, Personal Protective Equipment were you wearing during the potential exposure event? 5. Did you get a flu vaccination this year? For specific Department of Labor (DOL) information on COVID-19, please visit: https://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/InfoFECAC overageCoronavirus.htm 21. Will workers' compensation be available to employees who are exposed to coronavirus during the course of their duties? A: Under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.303, exposure to COVID-19 alone does not constitute a work-related injury entitling an employee to medical treatment under the PECA. The employee must actually be diagnosed with COVID-19 to potentially be afforded coverage. In all cases where an employee reports potential exposure, the supervisor must document the exposure on CBP Form 502. The employee has up to three years to file for workers' compensation benefits as long as a CBP Form 502 is documented in the system. While an employee has the right to file a workers' compensation claim if they believe they have been exposed, it may be in their best interest to wait to file until a confirmed diagnosis is provided by their physician of choice. Please provide guidance and counsel to employees and supervisors on this matter. If an employee elects to file a claim for exposure without diagnosis, then we must process it with OWCP and notify the CE that there is no confirmed diagnosis. When an employee chooses to self-isolate or is quarantined without a medical diagnosis, lost time is incurred by that employee and the claim form must be submitted to OWCP for processing. Under 20 CFR 10.303, a claim filed for exposure without confirmed diagnosis, would most likely be denied if transmitted to OWCP for adjudication. 22. Will workers' compensation be available to employees who are quarantined because of corona virus? A: The FECA does not authorize payment for preventive measures such as quarantines. Therefore, use of form CA-16, Authorization for Medical Examination and/or Treatment, is not authorized for simple exposure cases filed on CA-1; and is never authorized for occupational diseases filed on CA- 2 unless OWCP directs us to issue the form. 22 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL''l FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY V. EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS PRESS GUIDANCE All media inquiries and requests for leadershi interviews must be directed to CBP OPA Headquarters for coordination (b)(5) CBP --------------------- OPA in turn will coordinate all media responses with DHS OP A. Media interviews concerning COVID-19 should be conducted remotely whenever possible. Requests for on-camera interviews and filming related to COVID-19 should generally be declined at this time.

KEY MESSAGES U.S. Customs and Border Protection's highest priority is to ensure the health, safety and security of our workforce and the American people. CBP has implemented robust policies and is using a variety of tools to support the whole of America response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CBP's dedicated agents, officers, and mission support personnel are working tirelessly to protect America's borders, slow the spread of the virus and facilitate the cross-border flow of food, medicine and other essential commerce. 23 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY If CBP observes an individual who has symptoms of COVID-19 or who otherwise meets the CDC's COVID-19 screening guidelines, we will refer the individual to the CDC, DHS medical contractors, or local health officials for enhanced health screening. While confronting the many operational challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, CBP remains steadfast in its commitment to facilitating lawful trade and ensuring the security of America's supply chains. Implementation of Title 42 USC Section 265 Every week, Border Patrol Agents encounter thousands of un-screened, un-vetted and un\u00ad authorized migrants from dozens of countries affected by COVID-19 who have crossed our borders illegally between ports of entry. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dete1mined that the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and temporary holding facilities presents a danger to illegal border crossers, our frontline agents and officers, doctors and nurses, and the American people. It would take just a small number of individuals with COVID-19 to infect a large number of detainees and CBP personnel and potentially overwhelm local healthcare systems along the border. On March 21, 2020, CBP began implementing legal authorities held by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that COVID-19 is not further introduced into the United States. Under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal border crossers are, to the maximum extent possible, immediately expelled to their country of last transit (Canada or Mexico). These illegal border crossers are not held in congregate areas for processing. When immediate expulsion is not possible, the U.S. Government expeditiously returns illegal border crossers to their country of origin. Since implementing these measures, the number of migrants in CBP custody has fallen to the lowest level since we began tracking this figure. By reducing the number of migrants in custody and minimizing physical contact during processing, these measures protect illegal border crossers, CBP agents and officers, U.S. healthcare workers, and the American public from exposure to COVID-19. Land Border Travel Restrictions CBP has been working closely with our partners in Canada and Mexico since the earliest days of this pandemic to establish a North American approach to containing COVID-19 at our shared borders. 24 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY On March 21, CBP introduced temporary restrictions that limit entry at the U.S. northern and southern land borders to persons engaged in essential travel, including lawful trade, emergency response, and public health purposes. On April 20, the travel restrictions were extended for an additional 30 calendar days. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and certain other travelers are exempt from the restrictions on entry at U.S. land borders. These individuals will receive the same processing, evaluation and potential CDC medical screening that all entrants undergo at U.S. ports of entry. Supply chains, including trucking, are not subject to the new travel restrictions. CBP remains steadfast in its commitment to facilitate the cross-border movement of food, fuel, workers and life-saving medicines that are needed to protect our nation Presidential Proclamations The President signed proclamations on January 31, February 29, March 11 and March 14 to suspend the entry into the United States of persons who pose a risk of transmitting the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The presidential proclamations prohibit the entry into the United States of certain foreign nationals who have been physically present in mainland China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom or Europe's 26-country Schengen Area in the 14 days preceding their attempted entry into the United States. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and certain foreign nationals are exempted from the proclamations and may continue to travel from China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom, or the Schengen Area to the United States. These travelers are subject to CDC enhanced health screening upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. Any flight to the United States from China, Iran, Ireland, the United Kingdom or the Schengen Area will be funneled to 13 U.S. airports. CBP is following CDC guidelines and supporting the CDC's enhanced health screening of returning travelers at the 13 funneling airports. CBP officers continue to identify and refer travelers subject to the presidential proclamations or who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 to the CDC or OHS contract medical personnel for enhanced health screening. Specific procedures may vary by location based on operational needs, the flow of passengers, and whether health screening occurs before travelers reach CBP primary inspection. All travelers should heed State Department and CDC travel advisories prior to planning travel. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 25 MEDIA FAQ Contents 1. Workforce Health and Safety 11.

Title 42 (For additional information, see the CBP Communications Plan.for the Implementation of Title 42 USC 265 at the Southern and Northern Land Borders, March 21, 2020) Q: Why is CBP implementing Title 42 USC\u00a7 265? A: This strategy will allow the U.S. government to help slow the introduction of COVID-19 into the United States by expelling inadmissible individuals who have transited through countries experiencing outbreaks of the virus. This will reduce the CBP workforce's risk of exposure during processing and operations. At the same time, CBP will devote resources to combating the criminal element that may try to take advantage of the crisis to further their illegal enterprises. 28 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONL''l FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Q: How is CBP processing Unaccompanied Alien Children under 42 USC \u00a7 265? A: All aliens that CBP encounters may be subject to the CDC's Order Suspending Introduction Of Persons From A Country Where A Communicable Disease Exists (March 20, 2020), including minors. When minors are encountered without adult family members, CBP works closely with their home countries to transfer them to the custody of government officials and reunite them with their families quickly and safely, if possible. CBP also may, on a case-by-case basis, such as when return to the home country is not possible or an agent suspects traf ficking or sees signs of illness, except any alien from the CDC order. Minors excepted from the CDC order who are encountered without a parent or legal guardian will be processed as unaccompanied alien children under Title 8 and will be turned over to HHS/ORR. During any time spent in CBP facilities, minors processed under either Title 42 or Title 8 will receive amenities and services consistent with applicable law and policy. Q: What is going to happen to USBP's normal processing pathways (PACR, MPP, etc.)? A: Border Patrol agents will be given the tools necessary to identify individuals at the border and to adjudicate some cases in the field at initial encounter. This will enable our agents to rapidly make a decision whether to take someone into administrative custody, or to send them without any further Title 8 processing to the nearest port of entry to expel them to Mexico or Canada. Q: Are individuals claiming asylum sent back to the country they are claiming fear of returning to? A: These instances are handled on a handled on a case-by-case basis.

Trade and Cargo Additional messaging concerning the impact of COVID-19 on trade can be found in the Public Affairs Guidance for the Presidential Memorandum on the Allocation of Scarce or Threatened Health and Medical Resources to Domestic Use (dated April 8, 2020) and the Public Affairs Guidance .for Deferred Duty Payments (dated April 18, 2020). Q: How are the new travel restrictions affecting trade on the northern and southern borders? A: CBP will continue to protect the economic security of the United States by processing cargo at a normal rate, as there has been no identified threat of COVID-19 transmission from cargo shipments. Trade will continue across our northern and southern borders to ensure the people of the United States have access to necessary goods and supplies as this pandemic goes on. Q: Do the presidential proclamat ions have any impact on Trade/Cargo screening? A: CBP continues to process cargo, international mail and express consignment packages. The CDC has not identified any threat as it relates to these shipments. All CBP ports of entry are following operational guidance consistent with the recent presidential proclamations and Department of Homeland Security directives. Given the ongoing and rapidly changing situation, CBP is closely monitoring changes to trade volumes and will release those data when they are available and as appropriate. CBP is working to expand efforts to monitor broader effects to import trade activity as the COVID-19 outbreak continues. Q: Is CBP seizing exports of critical medical supplies? A: No. CBP is not seizing exports of critical medical supplies. On April 3, the President issued a memorandum instructing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in consultation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to use the Defense Production Act to keep certain scarce and threatened personal protective equipment (PPE) materials within the United States for domestic use. CBP's role in this effort is to temporarily detain shipments of the PPE specified in the President's Memorandum so that FEMA may determine whether to issue a rated order under the Defense Production Act to purchase the PPE, return it to the sender for use within the United States, or allow part or all of the PPE to be exported. Q: Will CBP be confiscating / seizing goods destined for our trade partners and other countries battling COVID-19? A: As our nation continues to respond to this pandemic, we need to ensure that our government is flexible and responsive to the needs of the American people. The President has been very clear from the start that maintaining the flow of cargo and trade is critical during this crisis. Ensuring the American people have the right medical supplies and goods available while helping other countries respond to the pandemic is going to be a very delicate balancing act over the next few months. The direction provided by the President allows the flexibility to manage that balance. 36 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Working with partner government agencies, CBP will conduct focused operations to identify specific Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) destined for export. If products are identified as subject to the Presidential Memorandum, shipments will be detained and referred to FEMA for a determination. FEMA will notify CBP of its determination and shipments subject to allocation will be detained until they are turned over to FEMA. Q: There are reports of the U.S. seizing PPE shipments from international ports. Is this true? A: CBP does not have the authority to seize, commandeer, or otherwise take goods from a foreign port and has not done so. FEMA and CBP have seen the reporting but have no further information on this outside of what was reported in the open press. Q: What is the process for importing PPE? A: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is providing instruction to the import community regarding the submission of entry information for personal protective equipment and certain other devices. Following the instructions will help facilitate the import process for all; especially for products related to the Coronavirus Disease-20 19 (COVID- 19) public health emergency. It is in the best interest of the U.S. to facilitate and expedite the importation of products into the U.S. market that address immediate, urgent public health needs. Q: What is CBP doing to ensure the timely importation of PPE? A: CBP continues to work extremely hard, in coordination with our FDA, EPA and other interagency partners to ensure that personal protective equipment, medical devices and pharmaceuticals related to the COVID-19 response are cleared for entry as expeditiously as possible while verifying that they are authorized and safe for use. In addition to our standard messaging system, CBP has had multiple caJls with our trade community, to make sure information and updates are communicated. We've also added a COVID-19 specific Trade Announcements and Advisories website. Q: Why is CBP holding up imports of critical medical supplies? A: CBP has been working extremely hard, in coordination with our partners at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to ensure that medical devices related to the COVID-19 response are cleared for entry as expeditiously as possible while verifying that the devices are authorized and safe for use. Q: What volume of PPE imports has CBP processed during the COVID-19 pandemic? A: CBP is committed to ensuring that consumers continue to get the goods they need without interruption despite significant upticks in certain shipment types within the first few months of 2020. Data from February 2020 suggests the value of these shipments has skyrocketed including: A 161.6% increase in diagnostic and testing shipments; A 647.6% increase personal protective equipment shipments; and A 6,215% in medical equipment since Fiscal Year 2019. Q: How is CBP addressing the importation of counterfeit/u nauthorized COVID-19 test kits? A: In February 2020, CBP Field Operations issued guidance to all ports to increase vigilance for possible counterfeit, improperly imported or unauthorized merchandise, especially in the international mail and express consignment cargo environments. 37 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY In accordance with Section 111 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, CBP has also issued a Trade Alert to the field directing further inspection, physical examination, or testing of specific merchandise to ensure compliance with trade laws. Examples of CBP seizures of suspect COVID-19 test kits may be reviewed here, here, here and here. CBP continues to work closely with the FDA to facilitate importation of legitimate health related products. Q: How many counterfeit/ unauthorized goods has CBP seized in relation to the COVID-19 response? A: As of May 1, CBP had recorded: 245 seizures of FDA-prohibited COVID-19 test kits, resulting in over 83,500 tests seized 21 seizures of counterfeit face masks, resulting in over 425,000 masks seized 63 seizures of EPA-prohibited anti-virus lanyards, resulting over 2,200 lanyards seized 51 seizures of FDA-prohibited chloroquine tablets, resulting in over 8,700 tablets seized 14 seizures of Herbal Medicines that included 3,000 tablets. Q: Do the Presidential Proclamations have any impact on International Mail Processing and/or Express Consignm ent operations? A: CBP continues to process cargo, international mail and express consignment packages. The CDC has not identified any threat as it relates to these shipments. All CBP ports of entry are following operational guidance consistent with the recent presidential proclamations and Department of Homeland Security directives. Q: Is CBP offering any relief to importers who are facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic? A: On April 19, President Trump signed an executive order that gives the Administration the flexibility to allow for a 90-day deferment period on certain payments for importers who have faced a significant financial hardship (defined as having at least a 40% year-to-year reduction in gross receipts) due to the COVID-19 response. This payment flexibility will be available only for importers with a significant financial hardship and will apply to payments for goods imported in March and April. Imports subject to duties associated with antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD), and Section 201, 232 and 301 Trade Remedies are not included in this relief effort. CBP has been working closely with the trade community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This order helps address many of the growing concerns raised by importers and manufacturers, by giving the Administration the flexibility to reduce the financial burden of the pandemic on American businesses affected by changes in the current supply chain. Q: Why is the executive order on deferred duty payments necessary? A: Introducing some flexibility into the duty collection process will help address severe economic burdens companies are experiencing due to COVID-19. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 38 FOlt OFFICIAL USE ONLY Q: How long will the executive order on deferred duty payments be in effect? A: This postponement applies to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in March or April 2020. Q: How does CBP respond to claims that the executive order on deferred duty payments comes at the detriment to U.S. business? A: The President has been very clear from the start that maintaining economic stability is critical during this crisis. It should be emphasized that duties are merely deferred, not forgiven. They will be paid at the 90 day deferral period for each entry. Q: The president has said repeatedly that duty payments would not be deferred. Why the change in policy? A: We would refer you to the White House for specifics. This is a limited deferment for stakeholders under extreme financial hardship due to COVID-19. Trusted Traveler Programs (Addition al infonnation can be.found in this press release and at https://ttp.dhs.gov) Q: Why can't I schedule an interview to complete the TTP enrollment process? A: U.S. Customs and Border Protection temporarily suspended operations at Trusted Traveler Program enrollment centers nationwide from March 19 until at least June 1, 2020. CBP is taking this precautionary measure to minimize the exposure of CBP personnel and the public to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This temporary closure includes all public access Global Entry enrollment centers, NEXUS enrollment centers, SENTRI enrollment centers and FAST enrollment locations. Global Entry mobile enrollment events are also paused until further notice. Conditionally-approved applicants who seek an enrollment center interview will need to reschedule online after June 1.

Page 1 of 7 PROCLAMATIONS Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimm igrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavi rus -HEAL TH CARE Issued on: March 14, 2020 ---==== = * * * ====-- On January 31, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9984 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavi rus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This Risk). I found that the potential for widespread transmission of a novel (new) coronavirus (which has since been renamed \"SARS-CoV-2\" and causes the disease COVID-19) (\"SARS-CoV-2\" or \"the virus\") by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Because the outbreak of the virus was at the time centered in the People's Republic of China, I suspended and Ii mited the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the People's Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subjectto certain exceptions. On February 29, 2020, in recognition of the sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, I issued Proclamation 9992 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Non immigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus), suspending and limiting the entry of all aliens who were physically present within the Islamic Republic of Iran during https://www.whi tehouse.gov/pre sidential-actions/proclamation-suspensio n-entry-immigran ... 3/15/2020 Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain A... Page 2 of 7 the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, subjectto certain exceptions. And, most recently, on March 11, 2020, I issued Proclamation 9993 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmig rants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus), suspending and I imitingthe entry of all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period precedingtheiren try or attempted entry into the United States, subject to certain exceptions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services, has determined that the virus presents a serious public health threat, and CDC continues to take steps to prevent its spread. But CDC, along with State and local health departments, has limited resources, and the public health system could be overwhelmed if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale. Sustained human-to-human transmission has the potential to cause cascading public health, economic, national security, and societal consequences. CDC has determined that the United Kingdom is experiencing widespread, ongoing person\u00ad to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the United Kingdom had 594 cases of COVID-19, 5 times more cases than there were 7 days prior. The Republic of Ireland has an open border with the United Kingdom in that persons can generally move freely between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom - by land to and from Northern Ireland and by ferry or aircraft to and from Wales, England, and Scotland. This general ability to travel freely between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland poses the same challenges that the Schengen Area posed for suspending and limiting entry to the United States by travelers who had been physically present within any of the Schengen Area countries. CDC has also determined that the Republic of Ireland is experiencing ongoing sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As of March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the Republic of Ireland had 70 cases of COVID-19, 5 times more cases than there were 7 days prior. https://www.whi tehouse.gov/pre sidential-actions/proclamation-suspensio n-entry-immigran ... 3/15/2020 Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain A... Page 3 of 7 The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the United Kingdom and the Republico f Ireland threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security. Given the importance of protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this harmful communi cable disease, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmig rants, of all aliens who were physically present within the United Kingdom, excluding overseas territories outside of Europe, or the Republico f Ireland during the 14-day period preceding theirentry or attempted entry into the United States. The free flow of commerce between the United States and the United Kingdom and the Republico f Ireland remains an economic priority for the United States, and I remain committed to facilitating trade between our nations. NOW, THEREFORE , I, DONALD J. TRUMP, Presidentofthe United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitation s, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry.

DONALD J. Exposure to Coronavirus \"COVID-19\" March 12, 2020 Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) & PPE Assessment Title: All CBP Supervisor: Prepared By: Personnel in HRM, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Division Affected Areas All CBP Senior Medical Advisor Offices: Locations: CBP Departments: Reviewed By: AIICBP Wide All Office of Field Operations United States Border Patrd Air and Marine Operations Operations Support Required or Recommended Personal Protective Equipment: surgical masks, nitrile Approved by: gloves, N95 respirator, protective outer garments, gown, shoe coverings, face shield or non-OSH Division Director vented goggles CBP Senior Medical Advisor Note: This JHA only applies to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or the disease known as \"COVID-19\". The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization, (WHO), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other public health agencies are now considering the outbreak of COVID-19 that has spread to countries around the globe, including here in the United States, to be a Pandemic. Although the general risk to CBP personnel and the public is still considered LOW at this point, it is CRITICAL that all personnel take standard precautions recommended by CDC, outlined in this JHA and found on the Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page on CBPnet. References to guides, additional information and material, links, and other resources can be found on \"Notes\" page at the end of this document. For the most up to date information about COVID-19 visit the Centers for Disease Control {CDC} COV ID-19 page. Risk Assessment: Incomplete information regarding incubation, infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as ev0lving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, awareness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. In general, the overall risk to CBP personnel is still assessed to be low. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with COVID-19, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP will continue to monitor the situation ck:>sely in coordination with appropriate stakeholders and will adjust guidance as appropriate. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational awareness regarding this outbreak. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the use of N95 respirators and other PPE is needed in certain conditions and work environments as outlined in this JHA, the use of PPE is but one component of COVID-19 disease prevention and the use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel can take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. All personnel should practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently, cover your cough or sneeze, stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance, av0id unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable, KEEP YOUR HANDS BE LOW YOUR CHIN and av0id touching mouth, eyes, nose and mucous membranes where contaminated hands can spread the disease to your respiratory system. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the sp-ead of communicable diseases. Note: Risk categories (Very High, High, Medium, and Low) are to be used in conjunction with this document only. They refer to the mission-specic risk relative to the hazard identified; they do not correlate to overall risk of contracting COVID-19 Disease or risk categories used by other agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or in other documents such as the Workforce Health and Safety Coronavirus Health Advisories Screening Guidance, CDC Coronal.-irus Adl.-isories, or Travel Health Alert Notices T-HAN meant for other audiences.

At the time of developing this JHA, new cases are being reported in countries around the globe, including the United States. See below links to CDC, WHO, OSHA, OHS, and other COVID- 19 resources and information. 2. CBP Respiratory Protection. All CBP Frontline Personnel, Officers, and Agents who may be in work situations that place them at increased risk of exposure to COVID-1 9 due to processing passengers or travelers from COVID-1 9 affected countries who may have to wear an N95 respirator as outlined in the above risk based scenarios are considered to be in \"mandatory use\" N95 Respirator Programs. As such, the mandatory use of an N95 respirators requires a medical clearance, fit testing, and have a clean shaven face and no facial hair between the mask seal and the face in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 and CBP HB 5200-08B. Frontline and uniformed personnel have had these programs in place for years within CBP due to other work situations that also require an N95, such as exposure to TB, Handling of Fentanyl and other Narcotics, Ebola Response, Pandemic and PEID Response Plans, and now COVID-19. 3. Voluntary Use of N95 Respirators. The \\.Oluntary use of N95 respirators is allowed by employers when there is no work task that makes the N95 use \"mandatory\", however circumstances such as allowing mission support, administrative, or HQ personnel that do not typically wear a respirator, who would like to wear one for protection to exposers that are not related to specific work tasks such as traveling to and from work in congregate settings such as large metropolitan transit systems, buses, etc. would be considered \"Voluntary Use\". In these cases, \"Voluntary Use\" of N95 Respirators does not require a medical clearance or a fit test, however it does require approVcll from a supervisor to ensure the use won't create a hazard for the employee, impact N95 supplies needed for critical frontline \"Mandatory Use\" situations, or that would cause undue confusion and conflicting policy guidance such as \"Voluntary Use\" by frontline officers in primary passenger processing when they aren't performing any work that requires \"Mandatory Use\" as outlined above. All Respiratory Protection Program, whether \"Mandatory Use\" or \"Voluntary Use\", situations will be run in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 standards and policies outlined in CBP HB 5200-08B, Chapter 26. 4. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the use of N95 respirators and other PPE is needed in certain conditions and work environments as outlined in this JHA below, the use of PP E is but one component of COVID-1 9 disease prevention and the use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel can take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID- 19. All personnel should practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently, cover their cough, stay away from work if ill and contact their health provider for guidance, a\\.Oid unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable. KEEP YOUR HANDS BELOW YOUR CHIN and a\\.Oid touching mouth, eyes, nose and mucous membranes where contamina ted hands can spread the disease to your respiratory system. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases. References: CBP COVID-19 Frequently ention. Exposure-Risk-Decision Guidan ce U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Division and CBP Senior Medical Advisor have developed a comprehensive coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID19) Job Hazard Analysis (J HA)/PPE Assessment to identify specific work tasks, risk categories, and recomme ndations for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) measures, to mitigate occupational exposure to COVID-19. The CBP JHA is posted on the CBP COVID-19 Dashboard. http://cbpn et.cbp.dhs.gov/HRM/Pages/covid19 resources. aspx This document serves as an adjunct to the CBP JHA and provides guidance for supervisors and personnel to assess risk from potential COVID-19 exposure and inform recomme nded actions based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) risk assessmentguidance and adapted for CBP mission environment. Due to the nature of the evolving situation, not every scenario can be accounted for. In the event of a concern regarding potential COVID-19 exposure, employees and supervisors should use the guidance below to determine risk level and recommended actions. For further questions or clarification, contact the CBP COVID-19 Emergenc y Operations Center (EOC) at fbl(5) I Exposure / Risk Level Recommended Action -Workplaces Low Risk Exposure The overall risk for exposure to COVID-19 at work or home remains low for CBP personnel. NOTE: COVID-19 may be able to be transmitted while a person is asymptomatic, but the preponderance of risk for exposure occurs while persons are actively symptomatic. NOTE: Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, or general flu-like symptoms Low risk exposure- at work or home-is generally characterized as: Being in general proximity (beyond 6 feet) to someone with suspected, or confirmed COVID-19, who is either asymptomatic, or symptomatic. Being in close proximity (within six feet) to someone who has or may have COVID-19, but is not symptomatic at the time of exposure. Being exposed to someone who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but is asymptomatic. Examples of low risk exposure include: Being in the same buildingwith someone with COVID-19, but not within 6 feet or direct contact. Beingon the same airplane as someone with COVID-19, but not within 3 seats/rows of the person. Recommended Actions for Low Risk Exposure EMPLOYEE: Continue standard precautions (NOTE 1) Notify Supervisor If symptoms develop: o Stay home; notify supervisor; consult medical provider If asymptomatic: o Continue normal work and home routine o Self-observation (Definitions) for symptoms until 14 days after exposure If exposure was work-related: o Notify your supervisor. o Contact your Injury SUPERVISOR: Compensation Coordinator - (NOTE 2) If employee is symptomatic: o Advise employee to stay home and consult medical provider o Leave guidance- (NOTE 3) If employee is asymptomatic: o Advise employee to continue normal work and home routine o Self-observation (See Definitions) for symptoms until 14 days after exposure If exposure was work-related : (NOTE 4) Moderate Risk Exposure Moderate risk exposure is generally characterized as: Being in an enclosed space (e.g . room), beyond 6 feet, with a symptomatic person with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time, while not wearing appropriate PPE. Close contact (within 6 feet) with a symptomatic person with COVID-19, with appropriate PPE Direct contact (touching) with a person symptomatic with COVID-19 or with their secretions, while wearing appropriate PPE.

Direct contact with secretions from a person with COVID-19 o Direct employee to stay home, practice social distancing, consult medical provider o Leave guidance- (NOTE 3) If employee is asymptomatic: o Direct employee to stay home, practice social distancing, selfmonitor for symptoms unti I 14 days after exposure (see definitions) o Provide telework guidance\u00ad (NOTE 5) o If exposure was work-related: (NOTE 4) Recommended Actions for High Risk Exposure EMPLOYEE: Stay at home Continue standard precauti ons-(NOTE 1) Practice social distancing Notify supervisor If Symptomatic: o Home isolation (Definitions) o Consult medical provider/local health department for guidance/disposition If Asymptomatic o Home quaranti ne/se If monitoring (Definitions) o Consult medical provider/local health department for guidance/disposition If exposure was work-related: o Notify your supervisor. o Contact Injury Compensation Coordinator -(NOTE 2) SUPERVISOR: If employee is Symptomatic: Home isolation (Definitions) 0 NOTES: o Ensure employee contacts medical provider/local health department for guidance/disposition If employee is Asymptomatic o Home quarantine/self monitoring (Definitions) o Ensure employee contacts medical provider/local health department for guidance/disposition o Leave guidance- (NOTE 3) o Provide telework guidance \u00ad ( NOTE 5) o If exposure was work-related: (NOTE 4) NOTE 1: Standard infection precautions: Avoid contact with sick persons Wash hands frequentlyfor20 seconds with soap and water (or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer) Cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue or elbow Keep hands below chin -avoid touching eyes, nose, mouth If you are sick -stay home, notify supervisor, consult medical provider NOTE 2: Exposure Claim/Worker's Compensation Guidance -EMPLOYEE Contact your loca I workers' compensation point of contact (Injury Compensation Coordinator) to guide you on the process to file a workers' compensation claim and which form to use. CA-1 -claim of traumatic injury (exposure on a specific date, time and location, within one 8-hour shift); or CA-2 -claim of occupational disease (exposure over time or multiple exposures on more than one date, time and location). NOTE 3: Leave Procedures -SUPERVISOR Approve weather and safety leave until it is determined whetherthe employee has COVID-19. If diagnosed with COVID-19, approve sick leave, annual leave, or other absence category available to the employee such as compensatory time off, credit time, etc. NOTE 4: Exposure Claim/Worker's Compensation Guidance -SUPERVISOR Complete an incident report (CBP Form 502) in CBP eCOMP. o Complete supervisor portion of the CA-1 or CA-2 in CBP eCOMP as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the employee completes their portion of the CA-1 or CA-2 NOTE 5: Telework Guidance -SUPERVISOR If not telework ready, approve weather and safety leave until it is determined whether the employee has COVID-19. o If diagnosed with COVID-19, approve sick leave, annual leave, or other absence category available to the employee such as compensatory time off, credit time, etc. Definitions Used in this Guidance: Note: Definitions listed below are adapted from CDC guidance and may or may not fit exactly into each CBP specific work environment or job require ment. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection: Include subjective or measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, general flu-like symptoms Self-observatio n: Remain alert for subjective fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop cough or difficulty breathing during the self-observa tion period, they should take their temperature, limit contact with others, and seek health advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether medical evaluation is needed. Self-monitoring : Monitor themselves for fever by ta king their temperatures twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing. Anyone on self-monitoring should be provided a plan for whom to contact if they develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period to determine whether medical evaluation is needed. Home Isolation: Separation, at home, of a person or group of people known or reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease and potentially infectious from those who are not infected to prevent spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order. Home Quarantine: Separation, at home, of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease. Social distancing: Remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding local public transportation (e.g., bus, subway, taxi, ride share), and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others. If social distancing is recommended, presence in congregate settings or use of local public transportation should only occur with approval of local or state health authorities. COVID-19 CBP Guidance for Leadership, Medical Officers, and Supervisors May 15, 2020 U.S. Customs and Border Protection As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the Homeland, the concentration of community spread will vary from state, city, and county. To avoid illness and slow the spread, please continue to practice good hand hygiene, cover your cough with your elbow, practice social distancing, and when job duties allow, telework whenever possible. In addition, emplo yees' personal risk factors should be taken into account to reduce their risk of exposure. State and local public health officials in affected regions may further close schools and institute other containment and mitigation measures to slow the spread. CBP employees should monitor all state and local public health direction; however, local shelter-in-place orders do not apply to CBP mission\u00ad critical employees for work-related activities. This package of guidance is to help CBP workforce management ensure mission continuity during a complex, novel, and evolving pandemic. Please use this guidance in conjunction with the CBP Job Hazard Analysis and other relevant guidance documents, available on the COVID-19 Resource All employees should continue to follow all guidance from their component leadership. For further questions or clarification, contact the CBP COVID-19 Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at fb)(6) I The following guidance is included: EXPOSURE DECISION TREE FOR SUPERVISORS If an employee is exposed to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 person while on or off duty, the Exposure Decision Tree for Supervisors provides you with appropriate actions. This guidance can also be applied to persons in custody. RETURN TO WORK GUIORNCE If an employee experiences symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or tests positive for COVID-19, the Return to Work Guidance helps you decide when an employee is safe to return to duty without requiring clearance from a medical provider. EXPOSURE GUIORNCE FOR MISSION-CRITICRL EMPLOYEES If a mission-critical employee has been exposed to COVID-19 but is not symptomatic, the Exposure Guidance for Mission-Critical Employees provides recommendations for having them continue to work to maintain the mission. REPORTING GUIORNCE FOR SUPERVISORS The Reporting Guidance for Supervisors outlines steps to report all confirmed and suspected medium to high risk exposure cases. This guidance was originally issued by the Management Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) Workforce Health and Safety Division (WHS) and has been adapted to apply to the CBP workforce. CBP employees will need to remain flexible as the entire Nation recovers from this crisis. The Management OCH CO WHS will continue to monitor Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID- 19 guidance and update Department guidance as the situation evolves. GLOSSAR Y ACTIVE MONITORING CONFIRMED CASE CON TR CT EXPOSURE FRCE COVERING FF RCA ISOLATION LOCAL/PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY U.S. Customs and Border Protection Local public health authorities actively monitor close contact cases in the affected community/locale. Involves daily telephone, text, or in\u00ad person inquiries about fever or other symptoms for 14 days following the last known exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19. An employee who has received a positive diagnostic/viral result from their COVID-19 test. Direct Contact: Direct physical contact with an infectious person or infectious secretions. Close Contact: Being within approximately 6 feet of an infectious person. Limited Close Contact: Less than approximately 10 minutes of close contact. Extended Close Contact: More than approximately 10 minutes of close contact. Casual Contact: Being in general proximity beyond 6 feet of an infectious person. Includes living, visiting, working with, or sharing a healthcare waiting room with someone who is known to have COVID-19. If you have been coughed on (direct contact with infectious secretions) by a known COVID-19 case. High Risk Exposure: Extended (more than 10 minutes) close (less than 6 feet) or direct contact with symptomatic person with suspected or known COVID-19 without PPE. Medium Risk Exposure: Limited (less than 10 minutes) close contact (less than 6 feet) without PPE or extended close or direct contact with PPE OR extended time in enclosed space with suspected or confirmed (symptomatic or asymptomatic) COVID-19 case. Low Risk Exposure: Casual contact (greater than 6 feet) with or without PPE or secondhand contact with a suspected or confirmed (symptomatic or asymptom atic) COVID-19 case. Recommended for preventing community spread of disease. They are not N-95 respirators. While on duty, a surgical mask can be used in any situation where an N-95 respirator is not required. When worn, face coverings should cover nose and mouth. Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The separation of a person or group of people known or reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease and potentially infectious from those who are not infected to prevent spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order. In home/quarters isolation: staying home or in quarters; separating yourself from other people (i.e., trying not to be in the same room as other people at the same time; asking friends, family- not to visit unless necessary). In hospital isolation: when you are ill and receiving medical care, you may be placed in a specialized room designed to separate you from other patients and visitors, while decreasing risk of spread. An agency or authority of the U.S. Government, a state, a territory, a political subdivision of a state or territory, or an Indian tribe, that is responsible for public health matters as part of its official mandate, has quarantine authority. Examples are state and local public health departments, CDC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and CBP. GLOSSAR Y PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS UUARANTINE SELF-0 BSERVATI ON SELF-MONITORING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SOCIAL DISTANCING TESTING U.S. Customs and Border Protection Legally enforcea ble directives issued under the authority of a relevant federal, state, or local entity that, when applied to a person or group, may place restrictions on the activities undertaken by that person or group, potentially including movement restrictions or a requirement for monitoring by a public health authority, for the purposes of protecting the public's health. Federal, state, or local public health orders may be issued to enforce isolation, quarantine or conditional release. The local public health department may issue a public health order to prevent people from leaving a local area, their home, or require monitoring to protect the public's health. Separation , at home, of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease. Individuals stay alert for developing signs and symptoms during self-observ ation period. If symptoms develop during this time, check temperature, self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek medical advice by telephone or local public health department to determine if a medical evaluation is needed. Continue social distancing as directed. People should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperatures twice daily and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing. Take temperature twice daily and record. Make note of any changes in how you feel (particularly if you start to have trouble breathing). Keep your health care provider's contact information handy. If your condition worsens, ask your healthcare provider to call the local or state health department. The common symptoms, which may appear in some combination within 2-14 days after exposure to the virus, are cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever (100.4\u00b0F [38\u00b0C) or higher), chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell. Means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. Telework and teleconferences are an accepta ble alternative Work space modifications for business transactions (glass barriers, moving workspace for added distance, etc.) School closure (proactive or reactive) Workplace closure including closure of \"non-essential\" businesses and social services Cancellation of mass gathering events Voluntary Isolation of contacts Voluntary quarantine of contacts Diagnostic Testing (Viral/PCR): Test requiring a respiratory specimen (nasal or throat swab) that measures the amount of COVID-19 virus in an individual. The Viral/PCR test is currently the only way to confirm an active infection in an individual. Antibody Testing (Serology/ Ab): Test that measures COVID-19 antibody levels after an exposure/infec tion. A positive result does not indicate the individual has an active COVID-19 infection, only that they have been exposed. A diagnostic test will be required to determine if the individual has an active infection. Any positive antibody test will be treated as a presumed positive case until a diagnostic test confirms if there is/is not an active infection EXPOSURE DECISION TREE FOR SUPER VISORS HIGH RISK2 Extended (more than 10 minutes) close (less than 6 feet) or direct contact with symptomatic person with suspected or known COVID-19 without PPE.3 IS EMPLOYEE SYMPTDMRTIC?

CLEANING GUIDANCE FOR MANAGEMENT U.S. Customs and Border Protection WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IF A SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED* CASE OF COVID-19 ENTERS A CBP FACILITY? Components must reportto GSA potential and confirmed cases in Federal buildings and GSA-leased commercial buildings as soon as they are identified. Potential and confirmed cases in DHS direct leases should be communicated to the building owner. For above standard services in all facilities under GSA's jurisdiction, additional cleaning services that exceed CDC guidance, increased frequency of cleaning services, and the use of special cleaning supplies and materials must be paid by the requesting agency. OHS CLEANING AND DISINFECTION GUIDANCE [PDF] CBP can only make / determinations on the reporting status of their own employees to impacted workspaces in Federal buildings and commercial leases.

N95 RE-USE AND ROTATION GUIDANCE U.S. Customs and Border Protection HOW CAN I MANAGE MY LIMITED SUPPLY OF N95 RESPIRATORS? The COVI D-19 pandemic in the United States is causing limited availability and expected delivery delays of filtering face piece respirators (FFRs), including N95 respirators, for CBP locations. Local management can employ re-use strategies to reduce mask usage and help combat supply shortages. MULTI-DRY ROTATION Issue 5 or more N95s to each worker under mandatory use. Wear one mask each day/shift. Each mask is stored alone in a breathable paper bag. Each bag/container is clearly marked with the day or shift and employees name. Mask rotation is repeated in this order with a minimum of five days between each mask use. Masks can be re-used until they are visibly contaminated, show signs of breakage, or wear to face piece, straps, or components. There is not a set number of times the mask can be worn. DOFFING Treat masks as though they are contaminated. Clean hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after touching mask. Avoid touching inside of mask. Check components such as straps, nose bridge, and nose foam material for degradation. Use a pair of clean disposable gloves when donning and performing a user seal check. Perform a user seal check immediately after donning, if a successful user seal check cannot be performed, discard the mask. Re-use of Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) is only allowed in times of crisis-level supply shortages and under certain conditions. Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) are normally disposed of whenever removed for breaks, other duties, or at the end of a shift. Re-use refers to wearing the mask for a period of work, taking it off (doffing), and later putting it on (donning) for another period. The time between doffing and donning can be just for breaks to allow for a whole shift of wear, or it can be several days -whether caused by work schedule, infrequent need, or for decontamination processes. When not in use, the respirator will be stored in a secured location, in a breathable paper sack, labeled with the wearer's name.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization, (WHO), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other public health agencies are now considering the outbreak of COVID-19 that has spread to countries around the globe, including here in the United States, to be a Pandemic. Although the general risk to CBP personnel and the public is still considered LOW at this point, it is CRITICAL that all personnel take standard precautions recommended by CDC, outlined in this JHA and found on the Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page on CBPnet. References to guides, additional information and material, links, and other resources can be found on \"Notes\" page at the end of this document. For the most up to date information about COVID-19 visit the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 page. Rjsk Assessment; Incomplete information regarding incubation, infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, awareness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. In general, the overall risk to CBP personnel is still assessed to be low. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with COVID-19, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP will continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with appropriate stakeholders and will adjust guidance as appropriate. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational awareness regarding this outbreak. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the use of N95 respirators and other PPE is needed in certain conditions and work environments as outlined in this JHA, the use of PPE is but one component of COVID-19 disease prevention and the use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel can take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. All personnel should practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently, cover your cough or sneeze, stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance, avoid unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable, KEEP YOUR HANDS BELOW YOUR CHIN and avoid touching mouth, eyes, nose and mucous membranes where contaminated hands can spread the disease to your respiratory system. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases. Note: Risk categories (Very High, High, Medium, and Low) are to be used in conjunction with this document only. They refer to the mission-specific risk relative to the hazard identified; they do not correlate to overall risk of contracting COVID-19 Disease or risk categories used by other agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or in other documents such as the Workforce Health and Safety Coronavirus Health Advisories Screening Guidance, CDC Coronavirus Advisories, or Travel Health Alert Notices (T-HAN) meant for other audiences.

This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CBP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus orCOVID-19). At the time of developing this JHA, new cases are being reported in countries around the globe, including the United States. See below links to CDC, WHO, OSHA, OHS, and other COVID-19 resources and information. 2. CBP Respjratory Protectjon. All CBP Frontline Personnel, Officers, and Agents who may be in work situations that place them at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to processing passengers or travelers from COVID-19 affected countries who may have to wear an N95 respirator as outlined in the above risk based scenarios are considered to be in \"mandatory use\" N95 Respirator Programs. As such, the mandatory use of an N95 respirators requires a medical clearance, fit testing, and have a clean shaven face and no facial hair between the mask seal and the face in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 and CBP HB 5200-08B. Frontline and uniformed personnel have had these programs in place for years within CBP due to other work situations that also require an N95, such as exposure to TB, Handling of Fentanyl and other Narcotics, Ebola Response, Pandemic and PEID Response Plans, and now COVID-19. 3. Voluntary Use of N95 Respirators . The voluntary use of N95 respirators is allowed by employers when there is no work task that makes the N95 use \"mandatory\", however circumstances such as allowing mission support, administrative, or HQ personnel that do not typically wear a respirator, who would like to wear one for protection to exposers that are not related to specific work tasks such as traveling to and from work in congregate settings such as large metropolitan transit systems, buses, etc. would be considered \"Voluntary Use\". In these cases, \"Voluntary Use\" of N95 Respirators does not require a medical clearance or a fit test, however it does require approval from a supervisor to ensure the use won't create a hazard for the employee, impact N95 supplies needed for critical frontline \"Mandatory Use\" situations, or that would cause undue confusion and conflicting policy guidance such as \"Voluntary Use\" by frontline officers in primary passenger processing when they aren't performing any work that requires \"Mandatory Use\" as outlined above. All Respiratory Protection Program, whether \"Mandatory Use\" or \"Voluntary Use\", situations will be run in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 standards and policies outlined in CBP HB 5200-08B, Chapter 26. 4. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the use of N95 respirators and other PPE is needed in certain conditions and work environments as outlined in this JHA below, the use of PPE is but one component of COVID-19 disease prevention and the use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel can take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. All personnel should practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently, cover their cough, stay away from work if ill and contact their health provider for guidance, avoid unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable. KEEP YOUR HANDS BELOW YOUR CHIN and avoid touching mouth, eyes, nose and mucous membranes where contaminated hands can spread the disease to your respiratory system. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases. 8 03/03/2020 CURRENT AT RISK COUNTRY GUIDANCE: (subject to change) CHINA IRAN Guidance to BP Sectors on COVID-19 Encounters Applies to at risk countries identified in Presidential Proclamations Situation Summary CBP is working with The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to closely monitor an outbreak caused by a novel (new) corona virus (2019-nCo V) first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The situation is evolving. For the most current information, monitor OHS and CBP messages and check the CDC information page at https://ww w.cdc.gov/coro navirus/2019- ncov/index.html frequently for updates. While most of the people identified with 2019-nCoV have association with Wuhan City, there has been significant spread throughout China and increasingly to other countries around the world. To date there have been multiple confirmed cases in the United States; this number is expected to continue to increase. The USG has enacted strict entry restriction and screening measures for persons with travel to China and this scope will increase to other at risk countries identified in Presidential Proclamations with direct nexus to the COYID-19.

The CBP JHA is posted on the CBP COVID-19 Dashboard. http://cbpnet.cbp.dhs.gov/H RM/Pages/ covid 19 resources.as px This document serves as an adjunct to the CBP JHA and provides guidance for supervisors and personnel to assess risk from potential COVID-19 exposure and inform recommended actions based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) risk assessment guidance and adapted for CBP mission environment. Due to the nature of the evolving situation, not every scenario can be accounted for. In the event of a concern regarding potential COVID-19 exposure, employees and supervisors should use the guidance below to determine risk level and recommended actions. For further questions or clarification, contact the CBP COVID-19 Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at (202) 325-2228.

Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection: Include subjective or measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, general flu-like symptoms Self-observation: Remain alert for subjective fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop cough or difficulty breathing during the self-observat ion period, they should take their temperature, limit contact with others, and seek health advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether medical evaluation is needed. Self-monitoring: Monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperatures twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing. Anyone on self-monitoring should be provided a plan for whom to contact if they develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period to determine whether medical evaluation is needed. Home Isolation: Separation, at home, of a person or group of people known or reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease and potentially infectious from those who are not infected to prevent spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order. Home Quarantine: Separation, at home, of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease. Social distancing: Remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding local public transportation (e.g., bus, subway, taxi, ride share), and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others. If social distancing is recommended, presence in congregate settings or use of local public transportation should only occur with approval of local or state health authorities. HQBOR 10/7.1-C MAR 1 3 2020 MEMORANDUM FOR: FROM: All Chief Patrol Agents b)(B); ,,,.b.,.., )(=6)-\": ; ('\"\"b)..,,.(7.,..,. )(C= )------1 Rodney S. Seo Chief U.S. Border Patrol 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20229 U.S. Customs and Border Protection SUBJECT: Emerging Safety and Health Concerns for Employees RE: COVID-19 As you are well aware, the United States continues to face elevated health and safety challenges associated with the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (GOVID-19). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the overall risk of contracting this virus is still low. CDC also reports that most people who contract COVID-19 will exhibit symptoms similar to the flu and will fully recover. With that said, we must acknowledge that our front line personnel are at a higher than average risk of coming in direct contact with someone that is infected with COVID-19. As community spread increases, the risk of our personnel contracting COVID-19 will also increase. As the leadership team for U.S. Border Patrol (USBP), we are each responsible for implementing appropriate measures to minimize and mitigate work related .hazards for all USBP personnel while maintaining the highest levels of border security and public safety. When it comes to preventing the spread of infectious diseases, protecting our workforce also serves to protect their families, our Nation and our ability to cany out our mission. Per the medical experts, vigilance, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), good sanitary habits and social distancing are the most effective ways to isolate this virus and prevent it from spreading. As discussed earlier today and outlined in the CONOPS sent to each Sector, you are directed to implement an Operational Risk Management approach to minimize the potential exposure of all USBP personnel to anyone potentially infected with COVID-19. Additionally, you are directed to develop and implement operational plans to limit the number of individual agents that must be exposed to detainees in confined spaces such as vehicles and processing facilities. To the maximum extent operationally feasible, operations plans will include: Dedicated field transport vehicles to limit potential contan1ination of patrol vehicles o Daily decontamination of vehicles used to transport aliens subsequent to initial ruTest o Immediate decontamination of any vehicle used to transport anyone that is ill Dedicated transport agents (minimum two week assignment) Dedicated processing agents (minimum two week assignment) Emerging Safety and Health Concerns for Employees RE: COVID-19 Page 2 Each Sector will ensure all personnel are familiar with, and uniformly execute the guidance foWld in the following documents which are attached hereto: CBP Job Hazard Analysis and PPE_ Assessment for COVID-19 USBP Operational Guidance provided to sectors on COVID-19 CBP Exposure-Risk-De cision Guidance provided to sectors on COVID-19 Additionally, the following general protective measures shall be applied. Minimize the exposure of detainee populations to CBP personnel and facilities Identify, isolate, and evaluate at-risk detainees as soon as possible Apply decontamination procedures as appropriate Utilize available CBP Medical Surveillance Program services and vaccinations Provide appropriate selection, maintenance, and use of personal protective equipment Mandate use of appropriate PPE in processing centers and high risk areas as warranted We must remain vigilant. All sectors will continue to distribute CBP and USBP guidance and educational materials to the widest extent possible. The most current information on this evolving situation is accessible at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website (cdc.gov). as well as the CBP Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page accessible at CBPnet.

Thanks, l(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Director, Field Operations Tucson Field Office l(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) I As we continue to run into situations of potential exposure by our workforce, it is a good time for everyone to look internally at their operations and begin gaming out scenarios on what you would do if one of your employees contracted COVID-19 or was potentially exposed. The following are a few things to consider: What are necessary steps and actions would you need to take o Utilize a risk based strategy o Don't kill yourself analyzing the \"What If\" scenarios o Approach with the understanding that all facilities are different and there is no cookie cutter approach and each incident will be handled on a case by case basis Work on your communication plan with your employees emphasizing that protection of the workforce is priority number 1 o Work in partnership with NTEU to ensure widest dissemination of information Coordinate with other CBP compone nts within you AOR to ensure a consistent approach What would be your limits to still ensure operations can still continue Coordinate with building owners, other tenants, stakeholders, partner agencies, CDC, and state/local public health to ensure decisions are done collaboratively on any potential closures Have plans in place to properly clean facilities o While surface exposure is still not clear, the perception that we are taking every precaution can go a long way with the workforce. Look at areas where we can limit large gatherings and person to person contact. You know your areas better than anyone. In the coming days you will see information to assist you in this endeavor. Please don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. rb)(6); (b)(7)(C) 1 Deputy Executive Director - Operations Office of Field Operations U.S. Customs and Border Protection (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (office) ---(cell) Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) & PPE Assessment Office: All CBP Job Title: Exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) Title of person who does job: All CBP Personnel in Affected Areas. Location: CBP W ide Supervisor: All Department : All Required or Recommended Personal Protective Equipment: surgical masks, nitrile gloves, N95 respirator, protective outer garments, gown, shoe coverings, face shield or non-vented goggles Date: New Revised X February 4, 2020 Prepared By: HRM, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Division CBP Senior Medical Advisor Reviewed By: Office of Field Operations United States Border Patrol Approved by: OSH Division Director CBP Senior Medical Advisor Note: This JHA only applies to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak linked to Wuhan, China which is being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), World Health Organization, (WHO), Occupational Health Admin istration (OSHA), and other public health agencies. Although the initial outbreaks of the 2019 novel Coronavirus are believed to be linked to exposure to shellfish and meat markets in Wuhan, China, new cases of the 2019-nCoV disease have been confirmed in neighboring countries, including some as far away as here in the United States. Cases of person-to-person transmission have been increasing, with spread to multiple countries, including 11 confirmed cases in the USA .. Health authorities in Wuhan, China and surrounding areas are monitoring this disease closely and steps are being taken to contain the disease locally. As of February 4, 2020 all modes of transportation leaving China (air, rail, sea, etc.) are being restricted and every effort is being taken to conduct exit scree ning at surrounding area airports. Additional restrictions have been implemented in the United States to prevent the spread of disease including flight restrictions into a limited number of airports and self-monitored home quarantine for 14 days for anyone returning from affected areas. More information about Coronavirus can be found here at the CDC infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, aware ness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. In general, the overall risk to CBP personnel is assessed to be low. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with nCoV, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP will continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with appropriate stakeholders and will adjust guidance as appropriate. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational aware ness regarding this outbreak.

Coronaviruses can live for long periods on surfaces, so regular cleaning and disinfection should be performed when working with potentially infected populations. Surface disinfection should be performed after interaction with a suspected sick individual as well as periodically through a work shift. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant suitable for non-enveloped viruses (e.g. adenovirus, norovirus, poliovirus) to treat spills and to disinfect surfaces after bulk spill material has been removed. See https://ww w.epa.gov/sites/p roduction/files/ 2016- 12/document s/list_a_sterilizer.pdf If an EPA-registered not available, use a 10% common household bleach-water solution (one (1) part chlorine bleach to nine (9) parts of water) to treat spills and to disinfect surfaces.

This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CBP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This JHA only applies to operations that involve travelers and people who have traveled to, from or through countries identified as being affected by the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). At the time of developing this JHA, cases were being reported daily. See the CDC website below for current information on the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease. 2. CBP Respiratory Protect ion. All CBP Officers and Agents who wear a respirator must be medically cleared and fit tested per the CBP Respiratory Protection Program Policy (See HB 5200-08B) and below link for respirator clearances website. All Voluntary Use of respirators will be per CBP policy as outlined in HB 5200-08B, CH 26. 3. The highest risk of contracting the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease appears to be from it spreading from persons infected by the disease through coughing/sneezing in close contact with other people. Protecting yourself through droplet and respiratory protection much like other respiratory illnesses such as influenza is the best way to prevent the spread of Coronavirus Disease. 4. The HRM, OSH Division will monitor the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Disease outbreak and will make recommendations to CBP leadership based on information received from DHS Workforce Health and Safety (WHS), CDC, OSHA, WHO and others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization, (WHO), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other public health agencies are now considering the outbreak of COVID-19 that has spread to countries around the globe, including here in the United States, to be a Pandemic. Although the general risk to CSP personnel and the public is still considered LOW at this point, it is CRITICAL that all personnel take standard precautions recommended by CDC, outlined in this JHA and found on the Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page on CBPnet. References to guides, additional information and material, links, and other resources can be found on \"Notes\" page at the end of this document. For the most up to date information about COVID-19 visit the Centers for Disease Control {CDC) COVID-19 page. Rjsk Assessment: Incomplete information regarding incubation, infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, awareness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. In general, the overall risk to CSP personnel is still assessed to be low. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with COVID-19, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CSP will continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with appropriate stakeholders and will adjust guidance as appropriate. CSP personnel should continue to maintain situational awareness regarding this outbreak. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the use of N95 respirators and other PPE is needed in certain conditions and work environments as outlined in this JHA, the use of PPE is but one component of COVID-19 disease prevention and the use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel can take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. All personnel should practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently, cover your cough or sneeze, stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance, avoid unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable, KEEP YOUR HANDS BELOW YOUR CHIN and avoid touching mouth, eyes, nose and mucous membranes where contaminated hands can spread the disease to your respiratory system. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases.

This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CBP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus or COVID-19). At the time of developing this JHA, new cases are being reported in countries around the globe, including the United States. See below links to CDC, WHO, OSHA, OHS, and other COVID-19 resources and information. 2. CBP Respjratory protectj on. All CBP Frontline Personnel, Officers, and Agents who may be in work situations that place them at increased risk of exposure to COVI D-19 due to processing passengers or travelers from COVI D-19 affected countries who may have to wear an N95 respirator as outlined in the above risk based scenarios are considered to be in \"mandatory use\" N95 Respirator Programs. As such, the mandatory use of an N95 respirators requires a medical clearance, fit testing, and have a clean shaven face and no facial hair between the mask seal and the face in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 and CBP HB 5200-0BB. Frontline and uniformed personnel have had these programs in place for years within CBP due to other work situations that also require an N95, such as exposure to TB, Handling of Fentanyl and other Narcotics, Ebola Response, Pandemic and PEID Response Plans, and now COVID-19. 3. Voluntary Use of N95 Respirators. The voluntary use of N95 respirators is allowed by employers when there is no work task that makes the N95 use \"mandatory\", however circumstances such as allowing mission support, administrative, or HQ personnel that do not typically wear a respirator, who would like to wear one for protection to exposers that are not related to specific work tasks such as traveling to and from work in congregate settings such as large metropolitan transit systems, buses, etc. would be considered \"Voluntary Use\". In these cases, \"Voluntary Use\" of N95 Respirators does not require a medical clearance or a fit test, however it does require approval from a supervisor to ensure the use won't create a hazard for the employee, impact N95 supplies needed for critical frontline \"Mandatory Use\" situations, or that would cause undue confusion and conflicting policy guidance such as \"Voluntary Use\" by frontline officers in primary passenger processing when they aren't performing any work that requires \"Mandatory Use\" as outlined above. All Respiratory Protection Program, whether \"Mandatory Use\" or \"Voluntary Use\", situations will be run in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 standards and policies outlined in CBP HB 5200-0BB, Chapter 26. 4. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the use of N95 respirators and other PPE is needed in certain conditions and work environmen ts as outlined in this JHA below, the use of PPE is but one component of COVID-19 disease prevention and the use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel can take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. All personnel should practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently, cover their cough, stay away from work if ill and contact their health provider for guidance, avoid unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable. KEEP YOUR HANDS BELOW YOUR CHIN and avoid touching mouth, eyes, nose and mucous membranes where contaminated hands can spread the disease to your respiratory system. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases.

While the general risk to CBP personnel and the public for serious harm from COVID-19 is still considered LOW at this point, risk of exposure does vary by geographic location, age, underlying health risk factors, and the nature of work being performed. It is CRITICAL that all personnel take standard precautions recommended in this JHA, along with other credible public health entities. The information, used to develop this JHA, along with additional informative links can be found on the CBP Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page on CBPnet. For the purposes of CBP guidance and protocol, this JHA should be considered CBP policy, and should be implemented accordingly. Rj\u00a7k A\u00a7\u00a7G\u00a7\u00a7WGP1\" Incomplete information regarding incubation, infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, awareness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. The overall risk to CBP personnel is still assessed to be low for serious harm from COVID-19. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with COVID-19, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational awareness regarding this outbreak. Of note, with the growing incidence of COVID-19 in the United States, there is less of an exposure risk distinction between high risk foreign travelers and US residents; CBP employees need to be vigilant regarding workplace, home, and potential off-duty exposure. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the use of N95 respirators is one component in preventing the transmission of COVID 19. Other PPE may be needed under certain conditions and in some work environments as outlined in this JHA. The use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way o1 preventing disease transmission. All personnel should take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmitting COVID-19 (1) Practice good hygiene; (2) Washing hands frequently; (3) Covering your cough or sneeze: (4) Stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance; (5) Avoiding unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable; (6) Follow CDC and Agency guidance for the use of \"face coverings\"; and (7) avoid touching your face .. Follow state/local/national social-distancing guidance off-duty and at home. The use of N95 respirators should be limited to front line personnel and those high risk work situations. See \"Notes\" Page for more information. Note: Risk categories (Very High, High, Medium, and Low) are used in conjunction with this document. These categories refer to the mission-specific risk relative to the hazard identified. Risk categories do not correlate to the overall risk of contracting COVID-19 disease. Additionally, these risk categories are not the same as those used by other agencies such as the CDC, etc. Operations Risk Categories 1.

Only use the following moisturizers with the Kojak/Crossmatch Fingerprint Stations: Nivea\u00ae Soft Moisturizing Cream, Aveeno\u00ae Daily Moisturizing Lotion and Gold Bond\u00ae Ultimate Healing Hand Cream. 7 Notes: 1. This JHA and PPE Assessment only applies to CBP operations related to exposure to 2019 Novel Coronavirus orCOVID-19). At the time of developing this JHA, new cases are being reported in countries around the globe, including the United States. See below links to CDC, DHS, OSHA, WHO, and other reliable COVID-19 resources and information. 2. CBP Respjratory Protectjon . All CBP Frontline Personnel, Officers, and Agents who may be in work situations that place them at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, due to processing passengers or travelers with a nexus to COVID-19 affected countries, and may have to wear an N95 respirator as outlined in the above risk-based scenarios are considered to be in \"mandatory use\" N95 Respirator Programs. The mandatory use of an N95 respirator requires a medical clearance, fit testing, and have a clean shaven face, with no facial hair between the mask seal and the face, in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 and CBP HB 5200-08B policies. Frontline and uniformed personnel have had these programs in place for years due to other work situations that also require an N95, such as exposure to TB, handling of Fentanyl and other narcotics, Ebola response, Pandemic and PEID Response Plans, and now COVID-19. 3. Voluntary Use of N95 Respjrators. The voluntary use of N95 respirators or surgical masks is allowed by employers when there is no work task that makes the N95 use \"mandatory.\" In situations such as allowing mission support, administrative, or headquarters personnel that do not typically wear a mask, who would like to wear one for protection to exposures that are not related to specific work tasks, such as traveling to and from work, in congregate settings such as large metropolitan transit systems, buses, etc., use of a surgical mask would be considered \"Voluntary Use.\" In these cases, \"Voluntary Use\" of surgical masks may be allowed to meet the requirement of CDC recommendations for \"Face Coverings\" in social settings outside of work to protect others, since surgical masks are not designed to protect the wearer, they are designed to protect others (see CDC \"Face Covering\" Reference below for more guidance). Such use requires approval from a supervisor to ensure the use will not create a hazard for the employee, impact PPE supplies needed for critical front line \"Mandatory Use\" situations, or cause undue confusion and conflicting policy guidance, such as \"Voluntary Use\" of N95 respirators by front line officers in primary passenger processing areas when they aren't performing any work that requires \"Mandatory Use\" as outlined above. All Respiratory Protection Programs, whether \"Mandatory Use\" or \"Voluntary Use,\" situations will be run in accordance with OSHA 1910.134 standards and policies outlined in CBP Handbook 5200-08B, Chapter 26. The use N95 respirator should be reserved for those front line personnel and high risk work situations for which they were intended. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the use of N95 respirators is one component in preventing the transmission of COVID 19. Other PPE may be needed under certain conditions and in some work environments as outlined in this JHA. The use of N95 respirators and masks is NOT the most effective or primary way of preventing disease transmission. All personnel should take these basic steps to prevent exposure to and transmitting COVID-19 (1) Practice good hygiene; (2) Washing hands frequently; (3) Covering your cough or sneeze: (4) Stay away from work if you are ill and contact your health provider for guidance; (5) Avoiding unnecessary congregate settings where COVID-19 exposure is more probable; (6) Follow CDC and Agency guidance for the use of \"face coverings\"; and (7) avoid touching your face .. Follow state/loca l/national social-distancing guidance off-duty and at home. The use of N95 respirators should be limited to front line personnel and those high risk work situations. These basic preventative measures will greatly reduce the exposure potential for ALL personnel and slow the spread of communicable diseases.

While the general risk to CBP personnel and the public for serious harm from COVID-19 is still considered LOW at this point, risk of exposure does vary by geographic location, age, underlying health risk factors, and the nature of work being performed. It is CRITICAL that all personnel take standard precautions recommended in this JHA, along with other credible public health entities. The information, used to develop this JHA, along with additional informative links can be found on the CBP Safety and Health COVID-19 Resource Page on CBPnet. For the purposes of CBP guidance and protocol, this JHA should be considered CBP policy, and should be implemented accordingly. Rj\u00a7k A\u00a7\u00a7G\u00a7\u00a7WGP1\" Incomplete information regarding incubation, infectious period, and transmissibility, as well as evolving circumstances make a definitive risk assessment challenging. In light of this, awareness and operationally-informed precautions are warranted. The overall risk to CBP personnel is still assessed to be low for serious harm from COVID-19. However, risk increases with increased exposure to persons potentially infected with COVID-19, warranting enhanced precautions described herein. CBP personnel should continue to maintain situational awareness regarding this outbreak. Of note, with the growing incidence of COVID-19 in the United States, there is less of an exposure risk distinction between high risk foreign travelers and US residents; CBP employees need to be vigilant regarding workplace, home, and potential off-duty exposure. While COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the use of N95 respirators is one component in preventing the transmission of COVID 19. Other PPE may be needed under certain conditions and in some work environments as outlined in this JHA.

References: CBP nq-sick/cloth-face-c over.html 8 What law enforcement personnel need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 4'11111 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but cases have been identified in a growing number of other areas, including the United States. Patients with COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness. Data suggests that symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Symptoms can include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and shortness of breath. The virus causing COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. It is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person via respiratory droplets among close contacts. Respiratory droplets are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes and can land in the mouths or noses, or possibly be inhaled into the lungs, of people who are nearby. -Close contact increases your risk for COVID-19, including: \u00bb Being within approximately 6 feet of an individual with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time. \u00bb Having direct contact with body fluids (such as blood, phlegm, and respiratory droplets) from an individual with COVID-19. To protect yourself from exposure If possible, maintain a distance of at least 6 feet. Practice proper hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available and illicit drugs are NOT suspected to be present, use an alcohol-b ased hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Do not touch your face with unwashed hands. Have a trained Emergency Medical Service/Emergency Medical Technician (EMS/EMT) assess and transport anyone you think might have COVID-19 to a healthcare facility. Ensure only trained personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) have contact with individuals who have or may have COVID-19. Learn your employer's plan for exposure control and participate in all\u00ad hands training on the use of PPE for respiratory protection, if available. CS 315526-A 03/16/2020 Recommended Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Law enforcement who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 should follow CDC's Interim Guidance for EMS. https://www .cdc.gov/ coronavirus/2 019- ncov /hcp/guidance -for-ems.h tml. Different styles of PPE may be necessary to perform operational duties. These alternative styles (i.e., coveralls) must provide protection that is at least as great as that provided by the minimum amount of PPE recommended. The minimum PPE recommended is: A single pair of disposable examination gloves, Disposable isolation gown or single\u00ad use/ disposable coveralls*, Any NIOSH-ap (i.e., N-95 or higher- level respirator); facemasks are an acceptable alternative until the supply chain is restored, and Eye protection (i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face). *If unable to wear a disposable gown or coveralls because it limits access to duty belt and gear, ensure duty belt and gear are disinfected after contact If close contact occurred during apprehension Clean and disinfect duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the product label. Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE. Follow standard operating procedures for containing and laundering clothes. Avoid shaking the clothes. For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low. Law enforcement leadership and personnel should follow CDC's Interim General Business Guidance. Search \"Interim Guidance for Businesses\" on www.cdc.gov. with individua l. cdc.gov/CO VID-19 I Interim Cleaning Recommendations for Facili ties Housing Persons Under Quarantine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Updated February 29, 2020 Background There is much to learn about the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is known about early cases of COVID-19, spread from person-to-person via the respiratory route and usually happens among close contacts (within about 6 feet). People with certain types of exposure to cases of COVID-19 may be housed and quarantined for observation until 14 days after their exposure. The purpose of the observation period is to ensure they don't develop symptoms and infect others during this time. Some people stay at home for the observation period, but others may be housed either separately or in groups in other types of facilities. In these facilities, individuals and families are provided separate quarters with separate bathroom facilities. They are instructed that congregation and shared public spaces are to be avoided. Because the people under quarantine are not ill, the risk to cleaning staff is inherently low. Purpose This guidance provides recommendation on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms of persons under quarantine, as well as associated worker protection practices according to expected job tasks. The goal is to minimize interactions between persons under quarantine and cleaning staff. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available. General Recommendations for Housing Facilities for Persons Under Quarantine Employers should develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on-site prior to beginning work. Training should include: o An understanding of when to use personal protective equipment (PPE) o What PPE is necessary and why (see below for PPE recomme ndations) o How to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE o How to properly dispose of PPE Employers must ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA's Hazard Communication standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200. Employers must comply with OSHA's standards on Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030), including proper disposal of regulated waste, and PPE (29 CFR 1910.132). Cleaning staff should perform hand hygiene often including immediately after removing PPE by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. Cleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE (e.g., tear in gloves) or any potential exposures (e.g., contact with a quarantined individual without wearing appropriate PPE) to their supervisor. Employers should educate workers to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms until 14 days after the last day they had possible exposure to the virus. o Cleaning staff should immediately notify their supervisor and the local health department if they develop symptoms of COVID-19. The health department will provide guidance on what actions need to be taken. Cleaning staff should follow normal preventive actions while at work and home including covering their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent and water prior to disinfection. o A list of products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims, maintained by the American Chemistry Council Center for Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. o Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, PPE) for use. Cleaning Activities During the Quarantine Period Because cleaning needs are limited during the quarantine period, CDC is recommending that cleaning staff do not clean occupied rooms in quarantine facilities. Instead, all rooms should be provisioned with personal cleaning supplies, e.g., tissues, paper towels, cleaners and disinfectants that are EPA\u00ad approved against emerging viral pathogens (see list above) for use by persons under quarantine as needed. Rooms and common areas occupied by persons under quarantine should not be cleaned by cleaning staff until all persons under quarantine have been released from quarantine and have vacated the area and no sooner than 24 hours after rooms and common areas have been vacated. During the quarantine: Persons under quarantine should bag trash and place the closed bag outside their door for daily pick up. Similarly, persons under quarantine should bag soiled linens and place the closed bag outside their door for pick up. Cleaning, laundry, and trash removal staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including collection of closed bags. o Staff should remove gloves after cleaning a room or area occupied by persons under quarantine before moving to the next room. o After delivering bags to their final destination, staff should clean and disinfect any hard, cleanable surfaces where bags have been stored (such as on carts or on the floor). o Laundry and trash removal staff collecting the closed bags should remove their gloves promptly after bags are delivered to their destination and cleaning and disinfection has been performed. o Any time staff remove gloves, they should perform hand hygiene immediately by washing their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. If possible, for fabrics or other materials that can be laundered, use the warm water setting and dry items completely on high heat. If a person under quarantine has a special need for assisted cleaning (e.g., an elderly person who is unable to clean a spill such as vomiting in their quarters), public health staff will oversee the cleaning process as part of their evaluation of the individual. Cleaning a Room Vacated by a Person under Quarantine with COVJD-19 (Enhanced Cleaning) Rooms that housed a person under quarantine with COVID-19 should remain closed to further use until cleaned and disinfected by appropriately trained cleaning staff. The room should not be entered by cleaning staff for at least for 24 hours. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process. o These gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used o Additional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk for splash. o Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Cleaning should be undertaken using products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims (https://www.americanchemis try.com/Novel-Coro navirus-Fi ghting-Produc ts-List.pdf) ). All products should be used according to label instructions. o Clean the surface first, and then apply the disinfectant as instructed on the disinfectant manufacturer's label. Ensure adequate contact time for effective disinfection. o Adhere to any safety precautions or other label recommendations as directed (e.g., allowing adequate ventilation in confined areas, proper disposal of unused product or used containers and donning appropriate PPE). o Avoid using product application methods that cause splashing or generate aerosols. o Cleaning activities should be supervised and inspected periodically to ensure correct procedures are followed. o After cleaning and removal and disposal of gloves, staff should perform hand hygiene by washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol\u00ad based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled. Clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in quarantine locations (e.g., counters, tabletops, doorknobs, light switches, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, remotes and bedside tables) according to instructions described for products with EPA\u00ad approved emerging viral pathogens claims. For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Porous materials that will be laundered can be transported to the laundry facility in the usual manner. If possible, launder items using the warm water setting and dry items completely on high heat. When cleaning is completed, collect soiled material and PPE in a sturdy, leak-proo f (e.g., plastic) bag that is tied shut and not reopened. This waste can go to the regular solid waste stream (e.g., municipal trash) as it is not biohazardous or regulated medical waste. If bulk material and spills containing blood or body substances are present, cleaning staff should use absorbent materials, such as towels, to remove the material. The area should then be cleaned and then disinfected with products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims used according to product label instructions. No additional cleaning is needed for supply and return ventilation registers or filtration systems for the building. No additional treatment of wastewater is needed before discharging to sanitary sewer. Cleaning Recommendations for Quarantined Persons from Uncontrolled Sources (e.g. increased likelihood of many cases such as on cruise ships, etc.) Cleaning for facilities housing persons under quarantine because of exposure from an uncontrolled source should be conducted following the Enhanced Cleaning procedures and include cleaning of common areas outlined above. Cleaning a Room Vacated by persons under quarantine without COVID-19 After all persons under quarantine are released and assuming the quarantined persons are not from an uncontrolled source (see above): If all persons under quarantine have been released and vacated the housing area and no persons tested positive for COVID-19, the facility (e.g., rooms, common areas) should be cleaned according to standard procedures. No additional PPE is required beyond what is normally worn for regular housekeeping activities. Cleaning of Common Areas of a Housing Facility (if used) If common areas are used by persons under quarantine, those areas will require cleaning and disinfection during the quarantine period. Common areas of a facility should be cleaned on a daily basis, and as needed. Regardless of known COVID-19 status of persons under quarantine, common areas should be cleaned according to Cleaning a Room Vacated by a person under quarantine with COVID- 19{Enhanced Cleaning) recommendations, since communication to cleaning staff about persons under quarantine who develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 may not be able to occur as quickly as cleaning services are required. No quarantined individuals should be present in a common area during cleaning. Common areas of a facility should be closed off to all persons except for cleaning staff before cleaning and disinfection activities take place.

Interim Guidance for Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 To ensure continuity of operations of essential functions, CDC advises that critical infrastructure workers may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community. A potential exposure means being a household contact or having close contact within 6 feet of an individual with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The timeframe for having contact with an individual includes the period of time of 48 hours before the individual became symptomatic. Critical Infrastructure workers who have had an exposure but remain asymptomatic should adhere to the following practices prior to and during their work shift: Pre-Screen: Employers should measure the employee's temperature and assess symptoms prior to them starting work. Ideally, temperature checks should happen before the individual enters the facility. Regular Monitoring: As long as the employee doesn't have a temperature or symptoms, they should self-monitor under the supervision of their employ\u00ad er's occupational health program. Wear a Mask: The employee should wear a face mask at all times while in the workplace for 14 days after last exposure. Employers can issue facemasks or can approve employees' supplied cloth face coverings in the event of shortages. Social Distance:The employee should maintain 6 feet and practice social distancing as work duties permit in the workplace. Disinfect and Clean work spaces: Clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment routinely. If the employee becomes sick during the day, they should be sent home immediately. Surfaces in their workspace should be cleaned and disinfected. Information on persons who had contact with the ill employee during the time the employee had symptoms and 2 days prior to symptoms should be compiled. Others at the facility with close contact within 6 feet of the employee during this time would be considered exposed. Employers should implement the recommendations in the Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 to help prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Additional information about identifying critical infrastructure during COVID-19 can be found on the DHS CISA website or the CDC's specific First Responder Guidance page. INTERIM GUIDANCE This interim guidance pertains to critical infrastructure workers, including personnel in 16 different sectors of work including: Federal, state, & local law enforcement 911 call center employees Fusion Center employees Hazardous material responders from government and the private sector Janitorial staff and other custodial staff Workers -including contracted vendors -in food and agriculture, critical manufacturing, informational technology, transportation, energy and government facilities ADDITIONAL CONSIDER ATIONS Employees should not share headsets or other objects that are near mouth or nose. Employers should increase the frequency of cleaning commonly touched surfaces. Employees and employers should consider pilot testing the use of face masks to ensure they do not interfere with work assignments. Employers should work with facility mainte\u00ad nance staff to increase air exchanges in room. Employees should physically distance when they take breaks together. Stagger breaks and don't congregate in the break room, and don't share food or utensils. PERSONAL DECONTAMINATION FOR COVID-19 COVID-19 infections are increasing across the world and in the United States. During your work shift you could be exposed to COVID-19 positive individuals and some infectious material may get on your clothing. This material could potentially contaminate your street clothes, vehicle (Gov't or personal) and people/pets you come in contact with. While experts say that surface contamination is a low risk for getting COVID-19 infections, if you regularly interact on your job with individuals who are/ may be positive for the disease, there are general precautions you should take to reduce your risk. You should pay particular attention if you live in a community outbreak area. These precautions include: Clean off the work day: If your workplace has showers, consider showering before going home. If showers aren't available, take a shower as soon as you get home. Don't forget to wash your hair. If you don't have showers at work, remember to always wash your hands well before leaving the workplace. Don't wear your work clothes or uniform home: Take them off and place them in a plastic bag (e.g., drawstring garbage bag), then thoroughly wash your hands. Even if you can't shower, you should try to change to clean clothes before leaving your workplace. Don't forget your shoes: At the end of the day, remove your shoes and put them in a plastic bag. It is easier to place your shoes in a separate bag from your clothes. That way you can avoid bringing them into your home. Don't put your shoes on again until you arrive at work for your next shift. Make sure you wash your hands (or use gloves) after you put on your shoes. If you must wear your work clothes home or commute by public transportation: If commuting by car, consider placing something washable over your car seat and sit on that. You can use a large towel that can be laundered (see laundering directions below) or a garbage bag that can be thrown away. Do not sit on a used covering if your clothes are clean. For public transportation commuters and drivers alike, leave your shoes outside or in a location just inside the door. Change your work clothes as soon as you can. Immediately place them in the laundry or keep them separate from clothing worn around the house. Another useful tip is to change as soon as you get inside the door. Many homes have a laundry room next to a backdoor or garage. You can enter and change, placing the dirty clothes directly into the washer or a designated hamper. Variations of these steps can be used for non-work-related outings, particularly in areas of high community spread or if you live with an at-risk individual. Leave shoes outside or be careful not to wear them throughout your house. Change clothes and keep them separate from clothes worn at home. A separate clothes hamper for \"outside the house clothing\" might be useful. If you use a hamper it is helpful to line it with a garbage bag that can be thrown away or a laundry bag that can be washed. That way you will not need to disinfect the hamper. Laundering Your Work Clothes You can safely launder your work clothes at home by following these steps: If your clothes are in a plastic bag, place the bag in the washer and gently remove them from the bag. You should be able to remove them without touching them. Do not shake the clothing, because if there is virus on the clothing it could disperse it into the air. If you must touch the clothing, use disposable gloves or wash your hands immediate! y. If you used a garbage bag, throw it away. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Ordinary laundry detergent is all you need. Remember that if you use an unlined hamper, clean and disinfect it.

Clinical Features & Epidemiologic Risk Fever1 and symptoms of lower and In the last 14 days before symptom onset, respiratory illness (e.g., cough, a history of travel from Wuhan City, China. difficulty breathing) -or- In the last 14 days before symptom onset, close contact2 with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCoV while that person was ill. Fever1 or symptoms of lower and In the last 14 days, close contact2 with an respiratory illness (e.g., cough, ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV difficulty breathing) patient. The criteria are intended to serve as a guidance for evaluation. Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g., uncertain travel or exposure). Footnotes : 1 Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain fever-lowering medications. Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. 2Close contact is defined as- a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a novel coronavirus for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns gloves, N IOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); close contact can include caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a novel coronavirus case. -or- b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a novel coronavirus case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC's Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with novel coronavirus (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.

' :7 @9.l\u00a78 Accessible Version: Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure 'Workers \\Nho May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVI D-19 FleefM GSA Fleet Vehicle Cleaning & Disinfecting Guidance for COVID-19 Updated on April 6, 2020 GSA Fleet values the health and safety of our customers, employees, and communities. GSA leadership wants to assure you that we are here to support you and will continue to do so during this evolving situation. We are actively monitoring COVID-19 developments and have taken precautions to safeguard our customers and employees. A question frequently asked is how to appropriately clean vehicles. The response below is a summary of information gathered from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), Consumer Reports, and Original Equipment Manufacturers. We encourage all drivers to take additional precautions to limit the spread of COVID-19. The CDC and the WHO emphasize how important it is to frequently wash one's hands and to regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in order to prevent COVID-19 spread. We recognize that vehicles represent a special challenge as they are most often used as shared resources. As with all other surfaces you come into contact with, it is impossible to be positive that COVID19 is not present and the potential for COVID19 exposure exists after each use. Therefore, we believe it is in your best interest to frequently clean the vehicles you are using; especially after the vehicle has left your custody for use by others, for oil changes, for maintenance activities or other events. What to Do: Sanitize frequently touched vehicle surfaces on a regular basis. Be mindful of the cleaning / disinfecting agents used on vehicles to avoid inadvertently damaging the interior or exterior. o Many of the same household cleaners (such as non-bleach, unscented. non\u00ad chlorinated disinfectant cleaners and wipes) that kill coronaviruses on hard surfaces at home can also clean most car interiors without causing damage. o Alcohol solutions that contain at least 70 percent alcohol are effective against coronavirus, according to the CDC. Nearly every interior surface of a vehicle can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. o Vigorous washing with soap and water can also destroy a coronavirus. Soap and water are safe for most car interiors. Be careful not to saturate the surfaces. Consult the cleaning directions provided in the Vehicle Owners' Manual. Follow the cleaning agent manufacturer's product label guidance for the recommended disinfecting procedure, as guidance varies by cleaning product. Read all instructions and precautions of the materials being utilized and follow all safety recommendations when utilizing cleaning products to ensure personal safety. When using wipes, remove excess liquid before wiping surfaces, especially electrical components and touch screens. Test selected cleaning agent in an inconspicuous location. FleefM What to Avoid: Don't use bleach or hydrogen peroxide on the inside of your car. Don't use scented wipes or wipes containing bleach. Don't use ammonia-based cleaners on car touch screens or dashboards, as they can damage anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings. Never combine cleaning chemicals as doing so may lead to toxicity. Sample Vehicle High Touch Areas: Car keys and fobs Door handles, door latches and lock buttons Steering wheel Shift lever Any buttons or touch screens (radios, mirror adjusters, climate controls, etc) Wiper and turn signal stalks Center console and cup holders Driver and passenger armrests and seat belts, grab handles, and seat adjusters Headrests and seat pockets Other Suggestions: Wash your hands before and after driving. Wear gloves when possible outside of your vehicle, especially when fueling. Pumps, keypads and other surfaces are frequently touched and may not have been sanitized. When possible use contactless payment methods to avoid touching keypads or pens. Consider using your knuckles rather than fingertips to touch common use contact areas. Compared to fingertips, knuckles will generally have less contact with other things throughout the day. When finished driving the vehicle for the day, thoroughly wipe down the vehicle with disinfectant wipes or other appropriate cleaning solutions. Resources: 1. CDC Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfection 2. EPA List of Cleaning Chemicals Effective Against Coronavirus (note check to make sure they are safe for vehicle interiors) 3. How to Kill Coronavirus in your Car Without Damaging Interior Surfaces Lastly, GSA Fleet has been asked if we will approve vehicle deep cleaning and sanitization services for our leased vehicles with the expenses charged back through the Agency Incurred Expense (AIE) process. Yes, we will allow agencies to have the sanitization performed without requiring prior approval from GSA; but agencies must use their own procurement mechanisms to arrange and pay for these services. We believe the decision of when to deep clean and sanitize is best left to the leasing agency. 2 CJVI D CDC Protects and Prepares Communities CORONAVIRUS 19 DISEASE CDC is aggressively responding to the global outbreak of COVID-19 and preparing for the potential of community spread in the U.S. Travel \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Conducts outreach to travelers Issues travel notices Schools Laboratory and diagnostics Develops diagnostic tests Provides guidance for schools including school closures and online education options Confirms all positive test results submitted by states Healthcare profe ssionals Develops guidance for healthcare profes sionals Conducts clinical outreach and education Healthcare systems ..........................

Wolf on the Coronavirus Saturday, February 1, 2020 1 :48:14 PM Attachments: image00 1.gif bHS Signature February 1, 2020 Dear Colleagues, As you know, the presence of the novel coronavirus has been affecting the United States, China and additional countries around the world. While the number of cases is extremely low in the United States, the Department of State has now issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory (Do Not Travel) for all of China. This is their highest travel advisory level. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) travel notice for all of China is Warning -Level 3 (A void Nonessential Travel), which is the CDC's highest warning level. Commercial air carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency for the entire United States to aid the nation's healthcare community in responding to 2019 novel coronavirus. The emergency declaration gives state, tribal, and local health departments more flexibility to respond to the coronavirus. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In response to the changing threat and to increase protections to the American people, I have directed that all flights from China and all passengers who have traveled to China in the last 14 days to the U.S. be routed through seven airports where the federal government has established enhanced health screenings with the ability to impose a quarantine if needed. Additionally, the President used his authority to implement travel restrictions on all non-U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident travelers who have been in China in the last 14 days. These actions, coupled with the CDC's ongoing activity, will further protect the American people and help prevent the spread of this virus. Closer to home, there are also simple measures you can personally take. The CDC recommends some easy steps you can take to reduce your risk of contracting the novel corona virus (as well as many other communicable diseases, like the flu). Two of the best measures you can take are to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available) and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. As always, whenever you plan to travel internationally, make sure to check both the Department of State and the CDC travel advisory systems. We will continue to keep you updated as the situation evolves. B + ._ J Sincerely, Chad F. Wolf Acting Secretary, Homeland Security With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. How to Properly Put on and Take off a Disposable Respirator WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY BEFORE PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF THE RESPIRATOR. If you have used a respirator before that fit you, use the same make, model and size. Inspect the respirator for damage. If your respirator appears damaged, DO NOT USE IT. Replace it with a new one. Do not allow facial hair, hair, jewelry, glasses, clothing, or anything else to prevent proper placement or come between your face and the respirator. Follow the instructions that come with your respirator. 1 Putting On The Respirator Position the respirator in your hands with the nose piece at your fingertips. Checking Your Seal2 Place both hands over the respirator, take a quick breath in to check whether the respirator seals tightly to the face. Cup the respirator in your hand allowing the headbands to hang below your hand. Hold the respirator under your chin with the nosepiece up. Place both hands completely over the respirator and exhale. If you feel leakage, there is not a proper seal. Removing Your Respirator DO NOT TOUCH the front of the respirator! It may be contaminated! Remove by pulling the bottom strap over back of head, followed by the top strap, without touching the respirator. The top strap (on single or double strap respirators) goes over and rests at the top back of your head. The bottom strap is positioned around the neck and below the ears. Do not crisscross straps. If air leaks around the nose, readjust the nosepiece as described. If air leaks at the mask edges, re-adjust the straps along the sides of your head until a proper seal is achieved. Discard in waste container. WASH YOUR HANDS! Place your fingertips from both hands al the top of the metal nose clip {if present). Slide fingertips down both sides of the metal strip to mold the nose area to the shape of your nose. If you cannot achieve a proper seal due to air leakage, ask for help or try a different size or model. Employers must comply with the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910. 134 if respirators are used by employees performing work-related duties. 1 Manufacturer instructions for many NIOSH approved disposable respirators con be found at www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirotors/disp_port/ 2 According to the manufacturer's recommendations For more information coll 1-800-CDC-INFO 2010-13.3 to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) Page 1 of 4 Publis hed on CHCOC (https://www.chcoc.gov) Home> Preliminary Guidance to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Preliminary Guidanc e to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Tuesday, March 3, 2020 CPM 2020-04 UNITED STATES OFFICE OF PLRSO. NEL MA AGEME !\\T Whingtoa, DC '20415 MEMORANDUM FOR: HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES From: DALE CABANISS, DIRECTOR Subject: Preliminary Guidance to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) On March 3, 2020, President Donald J. Trump announced the formation of the White House Coronavirus Task Force (the Task Force). The Task Force leads the Administration's efforts to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the virus, while ensuring that the American people have the most accurate and up-to-date health and travel information. At the direction of the Task Force, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides the following preliminary guidance to the Heads of Executive departments and agencies to prepare the Federal workforce for the potential impacts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19). OPM coordinated this guidance with the National Security Council (NSC), Office of Management and Budget (0MB), Department of State (DoS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Federal Protective Service (FPS). This preliminary guidance addresses Federal workforce posture, management of visitors to Federal facilities, and domestic and international travel by Federal employees. Human Resources Flexibilities for Federal Employees Over the past month, OPM has released CPM 2020-01 and CPM 2020-02 reminding agencies of the various human resources flexibilities available to assist agencies. Telework and Federal Mission Resilience To be prepared for COVID-19, departments and agencies must incorporate telework in their continuity of operations (COOP) plans. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 states that \"each executive agency shall incorporate telework into the continuity of operations plan of that agency.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6504(d) (1). Ifan agency COOP plan is in operation, that plan \"shall https ://www.chcoc.gov/print/94 8 9 3/5/2020 Preliminary Guidance to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) supersede any telework policy.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6504(d) (2). Therefore, agencies should immediately review their current COOP plans to ensure that telework has been fully incorporated and that as many employees as possible have been identified as telework employees in the plan, and are telework capable ( or \"telework ready\"). Page 2 of 4 FEMA advises that departments and agencies continue to monitor and prepare for any circumstances that may hinder the performance of essential functions and continue to submit Continuity Status Reports (CSRs) in accordance with Federal Continuity Directive 1. OPM and 0MB plan to host periodic interagency calls concerning questions and issues that arise about relevant human resource issues. In the meantime, agency headquarters-level human resources offices may contact OPM at pay-leave-policy@opm.gov with questions about human resources flexibilities. Agency field offices should contact their appropriate headquarters-level agency human resources office. Individual employees should contact their agency human resources office. CDC Guidance The CDC continues to update the American public that the immediate health risk from COVID- 19 is low at this time. Nevertheless, Federal agencies should review their plans and continue their preparations since this is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. CDC will provide updated information on the CDC website. Additionally, CDC and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have created a page to highlight resources available for the protection of U.S. workers in all settings. See CDC/NIOSH worker resources In addition, the CDC's interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to acute respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, in non-healthcare settings, where it is unlikely that work tasks create an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. The guidance also provides planning considerations for widespread, community outbreaks of COVID-19. See Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions to help mitigate the spread of respiratory diseases. Find a list of these preventive actions at CDC Prevention and Treatment Actions. Employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are recommended to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4\u00b0 F [37.8\u00b0 C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). Employees should notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick. CDC recommends that employees who appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath) upon arrival to work or become sick during the day should be separated from other employees and be sent home immediately. Sick employees should cover their noses and mouths with a tissue when coughing or sneezing ( or an elbow or shoulder if no tissue is available). For further guidance on workplace safety and health for Federal agencies and employees, please visit: OSHA.gov/covid- 19 https ://www.chcoc.gov/print/94 8 9 3/5/2020 Preliminary Guidance to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) Page 3 of 4 Domestic Travel for Federal Employees The intent of this travel guidance is not to be prescriptive, but to present a framework for decision making among the departments and agencies. All agencies shall review their travel policies and begin to reduce non-essential travel as appropriate. Employees planning domestic travel should routinely check COVID-19 Information for Travel for information about COVID-19 for travelers and travel-related industries and take into consideration the location and purpose of their travel. International Travel for Federal Employees Federal employees that have spent time in certain countries or specific regions within counh\u00b7ies that have been designated by the U.S. Department of State as Level 4 (Do Not Travel) due to COVID-19 are advised to stay at home and monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the U.S. Federal employees should seek medical advice if they get sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. Level 4 designated locations can be found at Department of State Destination Travel Advisories. This guidance does not require immediate cancellation of pre-planned, conferences/large meetings that are not located in areas with a Level 4 travel advisory. Federal employees planning to travel to other overseas destinations are advised to individually review the U.S. Department of State's Travel.State.Gov website for up-to-date overseas travel information for destination countries and the Emergency Alert for Coronavirus page. Approval for travel to any country outside the CO NUS is approved by the Chief of Mission for that country. This is usually the Ambassador or his/her designee. Travel advisories are directly available at Department of State Travel Advisories. All Federal employees seeking to travel overseas for official purposes should complete the Department of State's \"eCountry Clearance \" process. Once registered, users will receive up-to-date travel information. Final approval for travel to any country is at the discretion of the Chief of Mission. The \"eCountry Clearance\" system is available via \"myServices \" or at myServices eCountry Travel Registration. Please start the process of requesting overseas travel as early as possible. All USG staff must also obtain all necessary Department of State clearances and attend required trainings. Travelers should consult the CDC's guidelines for the prevention of coronavirus and visit the CDC Travelers' Health Page for information on specific country health conditions. Guidance on Visitor Access to Federal Offices and Buildings The Interagency Security Committee has established standards for day-to-day risk management of Federal facilities. State and Federal health officials are providing ongoing guidance to Federal agencies regarding control and containment of COVID-19 exposure. Based on that health guidance, the Facility Security Committee (FSC) and/or Designated Official (DO) in each Federal facility has the authority and discretion to set requirements for admission to Federal property. See 41 CFR \u00a7102-74.375. Agencies should contact their respective FSC or DO for any further developments on visitor access. https ://www.chcoc.gov/print/94 8 9 3/5/2020 Preliminary Guidance to Agencies during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) Page 4 of 4 At Federal Protective Services (FPS) protected facilities, FPS will work with the FSC and/or DO to implement and enforce any new requirements as necessary. At non-FPS protected facilities, this role is the responsibility of the individual facility security organization. Agencies should contact their respective FSC, DO, or security organization for any developments related to protection of facilities. cc: Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs), Deputy CHCOs, Human Resources Directors, Work-Life Coordinators, Telework Coordinators, and Federal Executive Boards https ://www.chcoc.gov/print/94 8 9 3/5/2020 I.

The situation is evolving. For the most current information, monitor DHS and CBP messages and check the CDC information page at https://www.cdc.go v/coronavirus/ 2019- ncov/index.html frequently for updates. While most of the people identified with 2019-nCo V have association with Wuhan City, there has been significant spread throughout China and increasingly to other countries around the world. To date there have been multiple confirmed cases in the United States; this number is expected to continue to increase. The USG has enacted strict entry restriction and screening measures for persons with travel to China and this scope will increase to other at risk countries identified in Presidential Proclamations with direct nexus to the COVID-19.
