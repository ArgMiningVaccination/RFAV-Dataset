The design of the temple is inspired by citrus crops grown in and around McAllen as well as Spanish colonial architec - ture found in the area. Many of these patterns feature citrus blossoms, barbed quatrefoils, scrolls and ribbons. Blue colors used in the temple's design are reminiscent of bluebonnets, which are the state flower of Texas, and the nearby Gulf of Mexico. The gold and green colors bring to mind other elements of the Texas landscape. Located near the southern tip of Texas, the temple forms a beautiful silhouette over the Rio Grande River to the south. EXTERIOR FEATURES BUILDING: The temple is a steel-frame structure with a precast exterior. The structural steel was fabricated and installed by Southern Steel. The exterior precast was fabri - cated and installed by Gate Precast of Hillsboro, Texas. SPIRE: The temple's height to the top of the dome is 98 feet; to the top of the spire, 108 feet. EXTERIOR ART GLASS: The art glass was designed by Bovard Studio Inc. of Fairfield, Iowa, in conjunction with VCBO Architecture. Holdman Studios in Lehi, Utah, fabri - cated the art glass. LANDSCAPING: The landscape architect is Heffner Design Team, located in McAllen, Texas. FENCE AND WALKWAYS: Fences and walkways use concrete and fabricated pavers designed by VCBO Architecture. Standard Ameristar fencing was used to comply with temple specifications. INTERIOR FEATURES FLOORING: Soft-gold broadloom carpet, designed by Mannington, is used in the general areas and instruction rooms. Wall-to-wall wool rugs are used in the celestial and sealing rooms. Area rugs are rendered in vibrant blues, golds, and greens.

PD80013399 000 EARLY CHURCH HISTORY (1920-1950) As early as the 1920s, Latter-day Saint missionaries from the Mexican Mission taught Spanish-speaking people in the Rio Grande Valley, and a Spanish branch was orga - nized in Brownsville on Sept. 11, 1921. Eventually, they constructed their own building in Brownsville, which was dedicated July 8, 1923. During that same time, missionaries from the Central States Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began their work in south Texas. They held meetings, contacted people, and had some success. An English-speaking Sunday School was orga - nized in Brownsville by 1925, which eventually became the Rio Grande Valley Branch (congregation) in 1927. It has continuously existed since then and is now the Harlingen 1st Ward (congregation). Prior to the establishment of the first English congrega - tion, families such as the newly baptized Dan and Inez Smith (baptized in 1926) attended church in Matamoros, Mexico. In the 1930s, missionaries also taught and baptized the Charles and Emma Ricker family in Rio Hondo. The Smith and Ricker families helped estab - lish the Church, and after a short time the Brownsville congregation had 20 people attending. They soon started a Sunday School in Harlingen as well. Additional growth came during the 1940s and 1950s, when several members of the Church from elsewhere moved to South Texas. Many were farmers coming for the area's year-round growing season. They soon formed a congregation in the Rio Grande Valley and purchased a church building in San Benito, Texas. The Alamo Branch was established in May 1951 and met in a city recreational hall. Members had to clean up every Sunday morning from the dances held the night before. Because of this, local Church members in Alamo began raising money for their own church building through fundraisers such as fish fries, chicken barbecues, \"dime a dip\" suppers, and rummage sales. They were soon able to purchase and remodel the old Pharr Convalescent Center. It took about seven months to finish the renovations. The building was dedicated in October 1956. THE FIRST CHURCH BUILDING IN MCALLEN (1960) Shortly thereafter, members of the Alamo congregation in McAllen began searching for an existing building of their own. However, after a short time, leaders decided to purchase a four-acre tract of land to build on at 2nd St. and La Vista in McAllen. As construction began, the architect decided to install a rock wall to foster unity. Church members collected and contributed rocks for the wall to symbolize all members of the congregation coming together as one. Some rocks were sent, with difficulty, from former members and missionaries who had lived in McAllen. They came from 15 states, including Hawaii. For years, Church members could point out \"their\" rock. As construction moved ahead, a cement truck arrived a day earlier than expected. In those days, pouring concrete was considered a man's job, but the men who were expected to help were at work. When Church member Mary McKasson learned about this dilemma, she quickly organized the local Relief Society (the Church's global women's organization) to help with the cement. Under her direction, the women climbed up scaffolding and directed the pouring of the cement into the proper molds for the chapel's tower. The meetinghouse was dedicated on Aug. 28, 1966. Nearly 600 people gathered for the dedication. The meet - inghouse has become an attractive and well-known part of McAllen, thanks to its location on a major cross-town avenue. CHURCH GROWTH IN SOUTHERN TEXAS (1960-NOW) The Church in the Rio Grande Valley has a rich history of sacrifice, heritage, honor and faith. The hard work that Latter-day Saints have poured into this area is extensive. History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Rio Grande Valley of TexasOne example of this faith was Telesforo Reyes, who had been baptized in La Paloma, Texas, in 1930. He sacri - ficed great time and resources to nurture his family and members of the Church, especially the youth, in the area. He briefly served as the leader of two congrega - tions in two countries at once while the church was still growing in McAllen and in nearby Reynosa, Mexico. In 1975, Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles organized the McAllen Texas Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A stake is a group of wards, much like a Catholic diocese. D. Birch Larsen was called to serve as the first president of this newly organized stake. Around this time, the Spanish American Mission merged into the Texas Mission. Prior to that, missionaries teaching in English and those teaching in Spanish were in two separate missions. This merger helped unify Church members and strengthen local leadership. MCALLEN TEXAS TEMPLE ANNOUNCED IN 2019 On Oct. 5, 2019, during the general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Church President Russell M. Nelson announced the plan to build the McAllen Texas Temple. A temple is a building dedicated as a house of God and is reserved for special worship. It differs from a church meetinghouse, which is used for weekly worship services. In the early history of the Church in southern Texas, members attended the temple in Mesa, Arizona, which required roughly 27 hours of driving. Temple attendance became somewhat easier in 1984, when the Dallas Texas Temple opened, cutting travel down to about 10 hours. In 2000, the Houston Texas Temple was dedicated, requiring only a six-hour trip. And when the San Antonio Texas Temple opened its doors in 2005, it was just four hours away. Now the McAllen Texas Temple will be a blessing to many. One Church member, Elizabeth Rodriguez de Anda, who was baptized as a child in 1951, said the following about the McAllen temple announcement: \"I felt tremendous joy in my heart. Tears fell from my eyes, as I realized our Heavenly Father has been listening to the fervent prayers of countless [Church] members for many years. I thought about the faithful families in the Rio Grande Valley and members who live in Northern Mexico. This temple will be a great blessing and a great privilege for many families. I am grateful to our Heavenly Father for this modern-day miracle.\" \u00a9 2023 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved. Version: 2/23. PD80013398 000 Elder Evan A.
