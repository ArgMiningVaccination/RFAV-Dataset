I would like to first express my gratitude to Professor Mikhail Shapiro for taking a chance on me when he arrived at Caltech and guiding me throughout th is journey. I know that my mind could bounce around like a particle in a box, and I am grateful for your patience and guidance, and for setting reasonable boundary conditions while letting me explore and sometimes tunnel beyond them. Your enthusiasm is inf ectious and inspiring, and I am thrilled to have had the experience of learning how to do science under your mentorship. I am also indebted to my committee members, Profs. Frances Arnold, Dave Tirrell, and Ellen Rothenberg, for discussions, suggestions, an d helpful critiques. Thank you to Frances and Dave again for the experience of working in your labs - I learned lessons that served me well for the remainder of my graduate career. Ellen, thank you for our delightful discussions - I never got to work with you directly, but you somehow were always on top of my project and progress, and I really appreciate your advice as I discovered how fascinating immunology is and started to explore applications therein. When I began my PhD, I had little in the way of wet lab experience and a lot in the way of doubts and confusion. I cannot express enough how much I appreciate, especially in retrospect, the patience and guidance of Prof. Fei Sun, who mentored me during my first rotation in the Arnold Lab. I hope that my fo llies during the first few months were as amusing to you then as they are to me now. Thanks as well to Alborz Mahdavi, who supervised me during my rotation in the Tirrell Lab and provided me with invaluable academic and career advice. It seems unfair to s ingle out anyone in the Shapiro Lab by name, as everyone has made such a delightful impact on my grad school experience. Nevertheless, a few people must be explicitly mentioned. Pradeep, being part of the first batch of Shapiro students with you was amazin g. I'm glad we got to share so many adventures. Chapter 3 of this thesis could not have been completed without Mohamad Abedi. I've never had a chance to work with such a uniquely driven researcher before - I hope that someday I will again have a collaboration iv that's so genuinely fulfilling, fun, and productive. Thank you also to Anupama Lakshmanan for always having a smile and kind words of encouragement. I sincerel y value the privilege of having mentored Di Wu and Echo Wu during their early graduate careers, as well as Sasha Zemsky and Yiwei Jiang in their undergraduate research. I learned a lot about teaching from each of you - sorry that you had to be my guinea pi gs. Thanks as well to friends outside of Spalding, particularly to David Angeles, Heather Curtis, and Sushant Sundaresh for all of the wonderful memories. And thank you to Brittany Moser, who made the first observation of TlpA -gated gene expression in our lab when it was hiding in plain sight. Sometimes it's not obvious that the system you've painstakingly built actually works, and you have to try a little harder to see it - thanks for teaching me that. One of the most important acknowledgements I can make is to my family. To my parents, Ilya and Irina Piraner, for raising me and instilling in me the spirit of hard effort and appreciation for my opportunities. To my grandparents, Lev and Liza Piraner and Mark and Anna Zelikman for being proud of me and lett ing me know it. To my brother Alex and sister in-law Stephanie, for trailblazing the way to Southern California and always being there when I needed support. To my extended family, for extensive encouragement. And again to Brittany Moser, who is not only a fantastic scientist but also a wonderful partner in life, and who has always lifted me up without reservation. I'm thrilled that the rest of our life journeys, both in and out of science, will be shared. v ABSTRACT Synthetic biology is ra pidly contributing to the field of therapeutic development to create increasingly potent agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases. These living \"designer therapeutics\" are capable of integrating mu ltiple sensory inputs into decision making process es to unleash an array of powerful signaling and effector responses. Included in the great therapeutic potential of these agents, however, is a cognate risk of severe toxicity resulting from runaway on -target or erroneously induced off -target activity. The ability to remotely control engineered therapeutic cells after deployment into patient tissue would drastically reduce the potential dangers of such interventions. However, among existing biological control methods, systemic chemical administration typica lly lacks the spatial precision needed to modulate activity at specific anatomical locations, while optical approaches suffer from poo r light penetration into biological tissue . On the other hand, temperature can be controlled both globally and locally \u2014 at depth \u2014 using technologies such as focused ultrasound, infrared light and magnetic particle hyperthermia. In addition, body temperature can serve as an indicator of the patient's condition. Overall, temperature is a versatile signal which can provide a h andle to actuate a biological response for the control of therapeutic agents. In this thesis, a tunable and modular system is developed to respond to thermal perturbations in cellular environments and affect a biological response. At the core of this syst em is a pair of single -component thermosensing proteins whose dimerization is strongly and sharply coupled to their thermal environment. These domains are first utiliz ed in their native context as negative regulator s of transcription in prokaryotes, wherei n they are integrated into genetic circuits to control expression of reporter genes. These gene circuits show strong and sharp thermal activation and can be utilized in multiplex to affect higher order logical operations. Cells imbued with these circuits d emonstrate transcriptional activation upon global thermal elevation within the host animal within which they reside (fever) or upon a spatiotemporally localized temperature shift imparted by focused ultrasound hyperthermia. In subsequent work, one of these bioswitches is introduced into mammalian cells where it functions as a modular Protein -Protein Interaction (PPI) domain, conferring temperature -dependent protein localization . The work conducted in this thesis demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing t emperature as a stimulus for biological activity. This technology can be harnessed to regulate therapeutically relevant processes in bacterial and mammalian cells such as transcriptional regulation and protein localization, and potentially broader protein function . The thermal bioswitches described herei n could be utilized to engineer an array of research tools and biological therapies with actuation driven by spatiotemporally precise noninvasively applied stimuli or by real -time sensing of host conditions. vi PUBLISHED CONTENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS Piraner, D . et al.

Initially, drugs consisted of small molecules which were isolated from natural sources2. Industri alization brought about a revolution in the capabilities of organic synthesis, leading to the creation of natural products from non -natural precursors , the derivatization of these molecules into novel chemical species , and the discovery of new medicinal chemicals3. The advent of high throughput screening brought about yet another method of developing small molecules into therapeutic entities, enabling diverse sets of synthetic chemicals to be rapidly examined for their ability to display pot entially beneficial activities4. As the field of molecular biology develope d, rational drug design became a viable proposition. Overall, the pharmaceutical industry has been largely dominated by small molecule drugs to date5. Despite the enormous success of small molecu les at treating disease, a stubborn set of diseases remains refractory to treatment. Illnesses such as multi -drug resistant infections6, many viral infections7-9, neurodegenerative disorders and motor impairments10-13, and chemotherapeutic -unresponsive cancers14 remain incurable and only partially treatable with conventional small molecule methods. These failings often stem from the fundamental structural properties of small organic molecules: their lack of size inherently 2 results in a relatively small contact area with their therapeutic targets, and their s implicity precludes them from executing logical computations such as sensing their environments and converting signals from their surroundings into structural rearrangements and altered modes of action15,16. The size of small molecule drugs limits their targets to those containing \"druggable pockets,\" or molecular crevices which are able to maximize topological interactions with the contact surface of the drug molecule, and not all disease -driving molecules contain such sites. Furthermore, the lack of environmental sensin g results in biological activity both \"on target\" (at the site of disease) and \"off target\" (in healthy tissue), resulting in side effects which are often dose -limiting17,18. To address the limitations in the specificity of small molecule drugs, new targeting systems are under constant development. Most notably, lipid -based drug carriers such as micelles and liposomes can overcome some of the targeting challenges associated with bare small molecules. In the context of cancer, the larger size of liposomes renders them susceptible to the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, resulting in preferential deposition in the tumor via escape from the local abnormal and leaky vasculature19. This effect can be augmented by decorating the lipid coat with molecular targeting moieties , thereby enhanc ing drug deposition within specific environments20. Using environmentally -labile chemical linkages such as pH -cleavable bonds, these targeting agents can even induce transcytosis into physiological compartments that are traditionally difficult for therapeutic agents to access21. While nanoparticle -based drug delivery shows great promise, the method is not a panacea . Ultimately the small molecule payload cannot, upon delivery, discriminate between diseased vs. healthy tissue , and the ultimate therapeutic potency depends on the biological activity of the drug rather than of the carrier, thereby limiting molecular targets to those within the 3 druggable repertoire . Additionally, EPR -directed accumulation in tumors, while signific ant, leads to on -target delivery slightly in excess of off -target deposition in vital organs22. Furthermore, sin gle-target guidance of the nanoparticles is often insufficient for disease discrimination, although more complex targeting strategies are in development23,24. Finally, the chemical simplicity of lipid membranes limits the variety of behaviors that these nanoparticles and drug carriers can display relative to more complicated, dynamic, and energy -driven systems , and these behaviors are often responsive to broad biological effects such as pH rather than the subtle molecular differences that can differentiate diseased tissue from an off -target, healthy environment. In the 1980 s, antibody -based therapeutics were i ntroduced to the clinic25. Unlike traditional drugs, antibodies are large, complicated, and multifunctional molecules which c an overcome some of the key disadvantages of small compounds. Antibodies contain a relatively large and genetically designable binding surface suitable for target ing non-cleft-like molecular surfaces , thereby greatly expanding the array of druggable protei n targets26. Furthermore, in addition to simple binding and inhibition of molecul ar machinery, antibodies can interact with the host immune system by way of phenomena such as antibody -dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), thereby increasing therapeutic potency beyond that conferred intrinsically by binding of the molecule to its target27. Due in large part to these expanded capabilities, antibodies have become a prominent portion of the modern therapeutic a rsenal28. However, antibody -based therapies have their own limitations. Despite their favorable pharmacokinetics relative to small molecule drugs, antibody half -life is still measured on the order of days29, which typically necessitates multiple expensive and uncomfortable infusion procedures30. Additionally, the large size of antibodies prohibits passive diffusion across the 4 cell membrane and endocytosis into the target cell typically depends on prior binding to an extracellular receptor31, which precludes targeting of cytoplasmic antigens. The large size of antibodies also inhibits their transport from the blood to the diseased tissue29. Furthermore , the specificity of antibodies for a single molecular target can preclude them from being able to sufficiently distinguish healthy cells from diseased tissue , which of ten requires multiple markers32-34. Finally, the difficulty in controlling the therapeutic potency of antibodies in situ often leads to adverse effects related to runaway effects, particularly in biologics targeting the immune system35. The high complexity of extant the rapeutic challenges has led to a concomitant increase in the complexity of the therapeutic agents engineered to treat them. Viruses represent a new class of such drugs, with a complexity exceeding even that of antibodies and nanoparticles36. Viruses consist of genetic materi al encapsulated by a protein, and sometimes lipid, shell. These biological particles are decorated with surface receptors that enable the complicated and coordinated molecular behavior required for efficient entry into the target cell. In the intracellular environment, the virus can act on targets in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, and can alter cell function via transcriptional programs. Some types of viruses are even capable of integrating into the cell's genome, thereby enabling permanent modification o f the cell's functionality. While viral therapy remains a novel research area, some clinical successes have already been achieved, culminating in the 2012 EMA approval of Glybera37 and the 2017 FDA endorsement of Luxturna38. The relatively high complexity of viruses enables them to display some of the most desirable characteristics in therapeutic agents, such as precision targeting based on the molecular environment39 and a broad and controllable range of biological activities40. However, as a natural environmental agent, viruses must combat the 5 intrinsic immunological defenses of the human body41. Not only does immunity severely limit the efficacy of viral therapy, it can also lead to significant and sometimes fatal toxicity by generating massive immune reactions at therapeuticall y-relevant doses42. While viruses remain an exciting therapeutic platform for treating some types of diseases, the fact that viral administration intrinsically renders the therapy at odds with the host immune system fundamentally limits the efficac y and persistence of this approach43. The past two decades have seen enormous progress in the development of technolog ies to engineer and control living cells. Many cell types, both microbial and animal, can be genetically altered and reprogrammed to execute arbitrary biological functions. Such engineered cells have found a variety of applications, ranging from the effici ent production of biofuels to the manufacture of precursors for clothing44 and other materials45. Such cells can also be used to produce both small molecule46 and large molecule47 therapeutic agents . Bioengineering and biotechnology have emerged as ma jor industries within the United States and other developed nations , with one report estimating conservatively that in 201 2 these sector s represented over 2% of the US GDP48. A particularly exciting area of application for engineered cells, whose leading edge is just now entering the clinic, is the engineering of live cells for direct therapeutic applications49. Cells offer a host of adva ntages over other therapeutic modalities . Their enor mous complexity provides a plethora of biological \"knobs\" to tune - cells can be engineered to preferentially replicate under specific and multiparametric environmental stimuli, enabling the sensing of co mplex heuristics to differentiate between diseased and healthy tissue50. Cells can also persist for much longer than non -biological entities51,52, and autologous cell grafts 6 do not compete with the host immune system for survival as is the case for viral therapeutics. Additionally, cells can proliferate at the site of disease53-55, which can amplify therapeutics effects while also decreasing the requir ed dosage for administration, thus reducing cost and potential off-target spread. Finally, cells can employ a suite of biological programs to interface wi th the local environment, interacting with the local immune system and augmenting56 or ameliorating57 inflammation as required by the given therapeutic context. The tremendous range of possibilities afforded by engineering cells for therapeutic applications has led to a great deal of pre -clinical and translational investigation, and the first wave of cell -based therapies has entered the clinic58. 1.2: Microbial Therapeutic Agents Bacteria were the first living cells to be utilized in a clinical setting. The idea of cell -based therapy is often attributed to Dr. William Coley, an American surgeon who, in the late nineteenth century, recognized that cancer patients suffering from infection occasionally displayed spontaneous tumor regression59. Coley began injecting his patients with Erisypelas (now formally known as Streptococcus pyogenes ) and observed some degree of therapeutic efficacy60, although insufficient recordkeeping has rendered his results difficult to reproduce or justify as a modern therapeutic intervention. Additionally, Coley's use of non -engineered pathogenic bacteria was associated with the expected adverse effects of microbial infections such as sepsis and upon the development of X -ray radiation therapy and improvement of surgical techniques in the early twentieth century, Coley's method of treatment fell out of favor in the medical community61,62. 7 An increased understanding of bacteriology and bioengineering has led to a re surgence in microbial therapeutics. Discovery of bacterial strains with restricted pathogenicity has enabled safe administration in the clinical setting, with some forms of microbes often purchased and consumed over the counter63. These naturally occurring bacteria have applications in the treatment of some disorders, particularly those of the gastrointestinal tract64-66. Some probiotic strains of bacteria, particularly E. coli Nissle 191767 and L. lactis NK3468, have demonstrated anti -cancer activity in addition their conventional role in the GI tract. Microbes are a versatile biological platform for modification and engineering . Decades of experience in bioengineering has resulted in the robust ability to engineer many strains of bacteria by the introduction of foreign nucleic acids, either by way of extrachromo somal DNA molecules (e.g. plasmids) or via chromosomal editing (such as via Lambda Red recombination)69-71. The expanded ability to manipulate and program microbial cells with novel functions has resulted in the design of strains that can sense disease states and either report their presence72,73 or treat them in situ63,74. Such facile control over bacterial genetics has generated a great deal of interest in the scope of potential applications for microbial therapies75,76. One of the main limitations of conventional therapeutic molecules is the challenge of targeted delivery. After injection or ingestion, the drug molecule forms a concentration gradient away from the site of adminis tration, often resulting in relatively low dosage to the disease site while maintaining an elevated level in circulation and at potential off -target tissues. Microbes can be utilized as in situ \"micropharmacies\" to directly synthesize therapeutic agents wi thin 8 a diseased tissue67,77 -79. By injecting microbes that directly home to the site of disease, the drug of interest can be locally produced, thereby maintaining the highest concentration at the target site and diluting at distal, healthy organs80. This method of drug delivery can mitigate the toxicity observed in the systemic administration of highly bioactive molecules, as has been limiting for IL-2 therapy for cancer81. Microbes can also be utilized to directly destroy diseased tissue, a behavior which has been of particular interest in cancer therapy. The majority of research into this targeting behavior has focused on the ability of microbes such as Salmonella82,83 and Clostridium84 to traffic to tumors a nd colonize them. Obligate anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium85 and Bifidobacterium86 suffer toxicity from oxygen exposure and ar e thus restricted to surviving in the hypoxic cores of poorly vascularized tumors. In contrast, facultative anaerobes such as E. coli87, Salmonella88, and Listeria89 are able to tolerate the presence of oxygen. These microbes can display preferential tumor a ccumulation by active chemotaxis to necrotic auxotrophy for -associated molecules92 and by growth restriction to immune -privileged regions such as the tumor microenvironment93. While some destruction of diseased tissue is inherently caused by the colonization and replicat ion of these microbes, this activity can be enhanced by augmenting bacteria with non - natural payloads94. Microbes have been engineered to deliver bacterial toxins95, pro- apoptotic factors96-98, genes105, pro-drug converting enzymes106,107, and antibodies108. Addition ally, the foreign surface markers of microbes can render them potent immune adjuvants109,110, and delivering novel immunogenic proteins can further enhance the inflammatory response stimulated by these 9 agents111. Arming microbes with disease -related peptides, proteins , or nucleic acids can prime the host immune system to recognize antigens which it would otherwise tolerate, an application of interest for inducing recognition of tumor -associated self -antigens that are frequently protected by immunological tolerance112-116. Attenuation of bacterial strains can also result in growth restriction to diseased tissue which can be harnessed in a clinical setting117. In the early 1900s, researchers at the Pasteur Institute searched for avirulent strai ns of Bacillus for use as vaccination strains against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative agent of tuberculosis infection. By passaging a slightly attenuated strain on glycerine potato medium, the scientists generated a sufficiently avirulent line of Bacillus for use as a vaccine, and this became the strain utilized in the well - accepted BCG vaccination for tuberculosis118. In the 1970s this strain was found to promote tumor regression in non -muscle -invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients, and intravesical administration of live BCG is now a standard treatment for this disease119. The mechanism of BCG homing and therapeutic activity against bladder tumors is not fully determined , although recent research has suggested a model in which t he microbe binds to the carcinoma surface120 and becomes internalized via micropinocytosis121 stimulating a host immune response122, a process which may be accelerated in cells mutated in the PTEN tumor suppressor123. Biosimilar strains have subsequently been devel oped, and expanded therapeutic applications such as treatment of colorectal cancer are under investigation. The strategy of virulence attenuation has since resulted in the development of the therapeutic bacterial strains Salmonella VNP20009124, AR-192, and ppGpp125, Clostridium Novyi NT126, and including a derivative of S. pyogenes , the bacterium that launched the field of microbial therapeutics127. 10 Progress in bacterial therapy has been hindered by several factors. First, the fact that microbes are immunologically foreign objects in a patient's body renders them subject to immune reaction and as such, the dosages are restricted t o minimize the severity of potential immune reactions128. Even BCG therapy, despite its clinical approval, must be prematurely terminated in a small number of patients due to toxicity129. Additionally, while some specific disorders such as N MIBC possess cognate bacteria which display strong replicative preference for the diseased tissue, many bacterial therapies are reliant on more general environmental cues for targeting. Such signals include hypoxia and the metabolic profile within the tumo r core. Some oth er compartments within the body such as the bone marrow can share some of these molecular heuristics130 and induce off -target colonization and therapeutic activity. Even in experiments demonstrating successful targeting of a disease site, a substantial concentration of bacteria can accumulate in healthy organs such as the spleen and liver131. Finally , there have been notable failures of pre -clinically successful therapeutic strategies failing t o translate from animal models into human trials132, and most positive effects observed in humans have been non-curative133-137. In the most notable failed tr ial, a patient injected with an engineered Listeria strain to vaccinate against HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer suffered systemic listeriosis, resulting in the halt of the trial138. The modest success of translating efficacious microbial interventions from animal models to the clinic suggests that a significant amount of research and development must be undertaken to augment the potency of microbial ther apeutics while restricting their action to sites of disease . 1.3: Mammalian Therapeutic Agents 11 The first implementation of mammalian cells as therapeutic agents in human patients was arguably in 1818, when the British physician James Blundell performed a blood transfusion to treat hemorrhage139. In the early 1900s, preliminary molecular research enabled physicians to segregate patients according to blood type, thereby establishing the paradigm of antigen matching in cell transplantation140,141. The 1950s saw another type of transplantation enter medical acceptance: that of stem cells142. Using this newly discovered, non -terminally differentiated cell type, physicians could rebuild the hematopoietic system in cancer patients who received high doses of chemotherapy. Both RBC transfusions and HSC transplantations have rev olutionized aspects of healthcare and are enduring components of the modern medical industry. In the mid -1990s , Steven Rosenberg's group at the NIH de monstrated that immune cells could also be used in a therapeutic context143. Reasoning that T -cells activated within the tumor environment could be expected to attack the surrounding malignancy, Rosenberg and colleagues isolated T -cells from the tumors of melanoma patients, expanded them ex vivo , and then reinfused them in large numbers back into the patient of origin. These artificially selected T -cells resulted in regression of the melanoma, thereby establishing cell -mediated adoptiv e immunotherapy as a viable therapeutic strategy. Autologous immunotherapy was subsequently utilized for dendritic cells as well. In 2010, the US FD A approved Sipuleucel - T, a blood product generated by treating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a fus ion protein consisting of GM -CSF to enrich dendritic cells and Prostatic Acid Phosphatase, a common prostate cancer antigen, to generate cognate antigens144. Other artif icially stimulated dendritic cells generate d via exposure to tumor -derived peptides, nucleic acids, or raw lysates are currently in late stage clinical trials145. 12 The advent of reliable genetic modification of mammalian cells revolutionized the field by expanding the scope of accessible biological functions and providing novel strategies to control their activation146. Gene delivery into mammalian cells via chemical ( cationic and polycation ic complexes )147,148, physical (electroporation or mechanoporation )149,150, and biological (viral)36 mechanisms, as well as precision gene editing via customized proteins and biomolecular complexes such as Zinc Finger Nucleases, TALENs, and CRISPR -Cas9151, enables unpreceden ted control over cell function and fate. Aided by the 1970s revolution in recombinant DNA technology, which enabled facile manipulation of DNA sequences, gene delivery technologies offered a host of potential therapeutic modalities. A landmark experiment i n 1980 demonstrated safe ex vivo transfer of recombinant plasmid DNA into human bone marrow cells followed by reinfusion into the patients of orig in152. Although this study failed to demonstrate clinical efficac y and was roundly criticized as premature within the scientific and medical communities, it also opened the door for later studies of gene therapies. One of the first technological beneficiaries of recombinant DNA technology was viral gene therapy , which c an repair defective patient cells or introduce therapeutic functionality into host cells de novo40. Viruses had been explored (largely unsuccessfully) as therapeutic agents in their wild type context, but the ability to edit their geno mes and utilize them to deliver arbitrary genes o f interest garnered a great deal of scientific and public attention152. This ambition led to the use of recombinant viruses in clinical trials, with the first attempt aiming to correct X -SCID , a deficiency in immune cell maturation, in a batch of pediatric patients at the turn of the millen nium153,154. While the field of gene therapy encountered significant turbulence during its inception36, more recent research has yielded p romising results and 13 several clinical approvals. The first viral gene therapy was approved in China to treat head - and neck squamous cell cancer in 2003155 and another therapeutic adenovirus was brought to this market in 2005156. 2012 saw the landmark EMA approval of Glybera157, an adeno - associated virus carrying lipoprotein lipase to correct a hereditary deficiency in this enzyme158. The first viral gene therapy approved in the U.S. was Luxturna, an AAV carrying a transgene to restore retinoid cycle function in a subset of retinal dystrophy patients, in 201738. A large array of clinical trials for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapies for a variety of diseases is currently ongoing (reviewed by Dunbar et al40). Genetically engineered viruses have also garnered significant attention for oncolytic therapy via the wide array of alterations that bias viral replication to preferentially occur in tumor ce lls159, with Amgen's Imlygic being the first to receive FDA approval in 2015158. In the past two decades, the use of genetic engineering to modify human cells f or therapeutic efficacy has become a focus of significant research interest. Cells can also be extracted fr om a patient, genetically modified ex vivo , and subsequently reintroduced into the host160. The main advantage of this therapeutic approach is that the cells can be manipulated under controlled conditions, evaluated for quality, and then reinfused as a pre -modified product. Two cell types, hematopoeietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukocytes (particularly T -cells), have been of particular interest in this context40. HSCs are progenitor cells found in the bone marrow and are able to differentiate into adult blood cells of virtually any type. HSCs had previously found application in the context of allogenic transplantation of unmodified patient cells for treatment of chemotherapy -associated lymphodepletion161. T-cells are the main immune cell subtype involved in the adaptive cytotoxic response. By virtue of their unique T-Cell Receptor (TCR), which is randomized and selected during T -cell development, they 14 are able to recognize unique antigens presented on the Major Histocompa tibility Complex (MHC) of potential target cells and selectively kill or otherwise direct an immune response against these specific targets162. The serial killing behavior of this cell type renders it ideal for applications such as cancer therapy in which cell ablation, rather than reprogramming, is required to treat the disease. New advances in gene editing have enabled ex vivo modification of HSCs f rom patients with genetic defects in blood cell function such as -Thalassemia , Sickle cell anemia, Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) , and several others40. After genetic reprogramming, these cells are reinfused into the patient and migrate back to the bone marrow, where they subs equently serve as progenitors to functionally repaired blood cell progeny163. Addition or replacement of mutant alleles in the HSCs has resulted in several successful clinical trials as well as the 2016 EU approval of Strimvelis for ADA. Immuno therapies have also benefitted tremendously from advances in gene delivery. Following the pioneering work of the Rosenberg group in the 1990s on expanding tumor - specific lymphocytes, the past decade has seen a great deal of interest in the ex vivo genetic modification of T -cells and other lymphocytes for improved efficacy against cancer164-166. One of the first instances of ex vivo genetic engineering was the modification of T -cells with a genetic tracer for evaluation of their biodistribution following infusion into a patient167. A great deal of subsequent work has aimed to augment T -cell function for the treatment of cancers. A seminal paper by E shhar and colleagues described genetic retargeting of T -cells toward native (non -MHC -presented) surface antigens by a hybrid protein consisting of an extracellular single -chain antibody domain for recognition of novel antigens and an 15 intracellular domain from the CD3 chain of the TCR for activation of the T -cell effector functions168. The extracellular domain in this design is modular and this fundamental architecture , now k nown as the Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) has since been optimized and retargeted against the B -cell antigen CD19 for treatment of B -lineage blood cancers, culminating in the 2018 FDA approvals of Yescarta and Kymriah, the first C AR-T therapies58. Despite the immense progress which has been made in the genetic conversion of patient c ells into therapeutic agents, significant challenges in the field remain. For direct viral gene delivery into p atients, immunotoxicity and genotoxicity are the two key concerns. Viruses can elicit a strong immune response which can inhibit therapeutic efficacy by vector inactivation41,169. This immune reaction can also destroy virally modified cells by directing T-cell responses against viral capsid proteins or therapeutic transgenes presented by the MHC molecules of the genetically modified cells, thereby blunting the therapeutic effect170. Finally, the immune response may amplify from a local to a systemic phenomenon, driving signal transduction cascades that result in life -threatening systemic inflammation. Such a runaway immune response was famously responsible for the death of Jesse Gel singer, a patient enrolled in an adenoviral gene therapy trial for Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency171. This tragedy not only killed the patient, but also broug ht significant public and regulatory scrutiny toward the field, highlighting the safety concerns of these approaches. Another highly publicized mishap in the history of gene therapy occurred in one of the earliest clinical trials against SCID -X1. While the initial results of the intervention were highly promising, with immune functionality partially restored in the majority of subjects172, several of the enrolled patients subsequently developed leukemia173,174. This result 16 underscores the potential for viral integ ration -induced genotoxicity, in which the process of viral insertion can disrupt the innate cellular machinery responsible for regulation of cell division, leading to malignant transformation. Similarly, a potential pitfall of stem cell -based therapy is th e uncontrolled proliferation of undifferentiated cells, or teratocarcinoma175. While this phenomenon has not been observed in humans, several rodent studie s have demonstrated it to be a concerning possibility in such therapeutic approaches163,176. Cell-based T-cell therapy has also demonstrated significant dangers. Antigen -redirected T - cells can mount a significant immunol ogical response which, similar to the effect induced by high doses of viral genetic vectors, can prompt runaway and potentially fa tal inflammatory reactions, which are termed Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)177. While modest CRS is an expected corollary to CAR -T therapy and in fact can serve as a bio marker of therapeutic efficacy, severe CRS has proven fatal in multiple cases178. Engineered T -cells can also demonstrate toxicity by erroneously attacking off -target tissues . This has occurred by way of \"off-target, off tumor\" toxicity in which the cells mistakenly recognize a healthy tissue antigen with structural similar ity to the tumor antigen179, or via \"on -target, off tumor\" behavior in which the target antigen is found, contrary to prior expectation, to be expressed on healthy tissue as well as in the cancer cells180,181. Both modes of mis -targeti ng have resulted in fatal reactions during clinical trials. In a trial of an affinity -enhanced TCR against the MAGE -A3 melanoma antigen, a patient suffered fatal cardiac toxicity when the engineered T -cells recognized and attack ed Titin, a protein expresse d in striated muscle182. \"On target, off tumor\" attack has been more common, with several trials reporting deaths from this mode of toxicity180,183. Improving the safety of viral and mammalian cell -based 17 therapeutics without compromising therapeutic efficacy remains the primary challenge of t he field. 1.4: Common Challenges in Gene and Cell-Based Therapy While viral and nonviral gene therapy, engineered bacterial therapeutics, and cell -based therapies are disparate strategies with their own idiosyncratic challenges, several overarching themes unify the obstacles that must be overcome before these next -generation interventions become standard clinical practices. The tissue and organ specificity of next -generation therapeutics must be well controlled to ensure that only sites of disease are treated or modified. The complex, and in some cases self -renewing, nature of these therapies is correlated with a high degree of potency, the regulation of which is critical for ensuring patient health. In cases where the intervention proves deleterious, such as malignant expansion of engineered cells184 or life -threatening activity -related toxicity185, physicians must be able to robustly abort the therapy. Finally, the structural and manufacturing complexity of next generation ther apies lead s to high cost, and as such , the therapeutic designs should be controllable by ex vivo factors to avoid necessitating premature cessation of the treatment. The targeting specificity of genetic modification therapies is largely dictated by the me thod of transduction. While ex vivo editing of mammalian cells pre -selects against off -target genetic modification by physically separating the desired cells from the patient prior to modification186, control of in vivo gene delivery specificity largely relies on the vector for editin g. In some cases, differential viral tropism for specific tissues can bias entry and delivery, although natural viral tropism is rarely exclusive to single tissue types187,188. 18 Tropism can be modified via engineering of viral surface proteins, yielding vectors with altered infectivity profiles189. Utilization of ti ssue-specific promoters to drive expression of the genetic payload can further increase specificity of gene delivery190. As a whole, the cell - type specificity of systemically administered genetic interventions is virtually never as precise as that of ex vivo engineered approaches due to the inability to pre -sort the target cell population prior to editing. Introducing methods to control the timing and location of gene delivery within the patient has the potential to vastly improve the safety and efficacy of such methods. The spatial specificity of cell -based therapies is also of great interest, due largely in part to the aforementioned observations of off -tumor toxicity. With the exception of HSC engineering, where activity is usually restricted to its intended niche via the stem cells' useful property of intrinsic homing and engraftment into the patient 's bone marrow after reinfusion161, cell -based therapies are largely limited by off -target adverse effects. Bacterial homing and growth specificity are largely governed by the permissivit y of the surrounding environment. Despite the wealth of available mechanisms to support bacterial prol iferation in tumors, off -target colonization can occur in organs such as the spleen and liver, and in \"tumor -like\" niches such as the bone marrow. Additionally, some diseases for which cell - based therapies would be beneficial do not have obvious environmen tal markers that would promote bacterial growth. In contrast to bacterial therapies, the spatial localization of cell - based immunotherapies is mostly guided by the location of the target antigen191. Ligation of the antigen with the TCR or CAR results in strong pro -inflammatory signaling leading to local immune cell proliferation and recruitment. Unfortunately, this mechanism of spatial localization leaves therapies s uch as CAR -T vulnerable to off -target expression of antigens 19 or target antigen misrecognition, both of which can result in efficacy and toxicity in healthy tissues. As such, a great deal of work is being invested into improving molecular recognition using inhibitory receptors192, logic -gated receptor systems193, and even novel receptor platforms such as modular synthetic variants of the Notch receptor (SynNotch)194 which can be utilized to orthogonally modulate specific biological functions i ncluding expression of the primary antigen receptor. In some cases the administration of a therapy can go awry, leading to unpleasant or potentially fatal side effects that justify abortion of the therapy. The field of gene therapy has observed several su ch instances, such as the death of an adenoviral therapy patient due to severe and systemic inflammation171 and the onset of leukemia in pediatric SCID patients195. CAR-T based therapies have also resulted in patient deaths during clinical trials due to off - target antigen recognition196. As such, the potency of next generation living therapeutics justifies engineered control strategies to enable abortion of the therapy at the whim of the administrating physician. Artificial control over the viability of the treatment can largely address this necessity. In bacterial therapy, auxotrophic strains which require continuous delivery of a nutrient for survival have been developed197. Additionally, kill switches which rely on detection of exogenous factors have been developed to inducibly halt bacterial growth or damage viability198. These methods can be utilized in combinatorial fashion for highly effective biocontainment199,200. For gene therapy and mammalian cell therapy, in which the modified cells are typically patient -derived, complex metabolic engineering is often not an option. Therefore, control of viability is typically enacted in kill switch fashio n using inducible pro -drug-conversion enzymes such as HSV -tk201 or intrinsically lethal proteins such as iCasp9202. A key obstacle to auxotrophy and kill switch -mediated control systems is 20 mutation203. Introduction of a genetic system that damages viability exerts a strong selection pressure on cells, and leaky selection strategies enable population s of escape variants to grow out, thereby continuing the undesired biological activity. This phenomenon i s more prevalent in the bacterial setting, in which polymerase fidelity is not as robust as in mammalian cells and where proliferation can thus occur rapidl y. The relative expense of biological therapies in comparison to conventional drugs results in abortion of treatment being a last resort. Instead, exogenous modulation of therapeutic efficacy can be engineered to allow physicians to tune the potency of the intervention without necessitating complete elimination. A common strategy is the design of system s dependent on inducible gain of function. These include therapeutic genes which are natively transcribed at low levels but can be induced upon detection of an exogenous stimulus, such as engineered T-cells harboring a chimeric antigen receptor driven by a doxycyline -inducible promoter204 and CAR -Ts in which receptor signaling is dependent on chemically -induced dimerization enabled by an infused drug205. Whi le such systems are useful to prevent severe toxicity, the requirement for constant or repeated infusion of the inducer can render them unsuitable for long-term therapies, such as repair of genetic deficiencies. To address this issue, genetic state switche s which can toggle in response to external stimuli are under investigation206. Gene therapies, bacterial cell -based therapies, and mammalian cell therapies are exciting and potentially r evolutionary treatment modalities which may enable treatment of previously undruggable targets and diseases. The molecular complexity of these systems renders them highly engineerable and customizable, and also enables a high degree of therapeutic efficacy and specificity. Nevertheless, off -target activities and undesirable beh aviors largely remain 21 to be addressed. The next generation of biological therapies will likely carry engineered therapeutic modules, possibly in multiplex, to enable precise control over biological behavior. The ability to exert novel biological programs, coupled with exogenous strategies to modulate of abort the intervention if needed, will render these \"programmable\" therapies a powerful tool in the armament of future physicians . 22 1.5: References 1.

The management and suppression of th ese toxicities is at the forefront of current biomedical research. Challenges and opportunities for improvement exist at all stages of therapeutic implementation: during gene editing or delivery, during in vivo administration, and after infusion of the dru g product. Advances in control over these processes have progressed in recent years, but current implementations generally lack spatial specificity or noninvasive access. As such, there remains a significant need for the implementation of a biomodulation m odality with these characteristics. Control of gene editing has been investigated in the context of the linear space of DNA sequence, and also in terms of the three -dimensional spatial coordinates within the target organism. The recognition of viral genoto xicity has prompted investigation into site -specific delivery and integration methods . Avenues of interest include non -integrating retroviruses which enable high efficiency episomal gene delivery1 and also integration targeting via fusion of the viral integrase with sequence -specific DNA -binding proteins2-4. Recently, RNA -programmable recombinases generated via fusion to CRISPR components have also 33 been explored5. Non -viral methods of gene delivery are also candidates for novel control strategies. Site-directed nucleas es such as Cas9, Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), and TALENs significantly reduce the risk of genotoxicity by utilizing sequence -specific interactions with DNA to guide cleavage, although the latter two methods require protein engineering development for each new target, resulting in significant investment in labor and a delivery vector with a relatively large cargo capacity6. Controlling dosage or potency of delivery is highly de sirable for biological therapies with potentially severe side effects . Some genetic payloads are amenable to inducible expression via promoters with intrinsic sensitivity to chemical stimuli such as exogenous drug administration (such as doxycycline deriva tives7) or by communicating with neighboring cells to threshold gene expression based on population density8. Strategies have also been developed to titrate cell behavior at the post -translational level . The high risk of severe cytokine release syndrome in CAR -T therapy has prompted the development of several modified chimeric antigen receptor designs which can be inducibly activated to a ffect intracellular signaling and subsequent T -cell activation but which otherwise remain quiescent9,10. Temporal and spatial control of gene delivery and activation h as also been widely investigated. As with dosage modulation, t emporal control is often achieved via use of chemically inducible promoters to drive the transgene of interest, with doxycycline -inducible systems in particular finding widespread use in the literature11,12. Temporal control can also be implemented on the protein level using ligand -inducible activation or dimerization systems, as has been implemented for chemically -triggered Cas9 gene editing13. Spatial 34 control of biolog ical therapy is also of interest to restrict activity to specific physical regions within a patient. Spatial localization can be conferred via environmental sensing if the target site of the therapy can be sufficiently differentiated from healthy tissue vi a molecular markers. This strategy has been explored extensively in CAR -T therapy, wherein homing strategies have been developed using split primary and secondary (co-stimulatory) T-cell surface receptor signaling to affect AND logic14, and dominant inhibitory receptors to enact NOT logic15. Novel combinatorial sensing systems can integra te multiple signals in parallel. In a r ecently reported tri -partite configuration , a CAR is utilized to sense the primary tumor antigen while a chimeric co -receptor against the normally immunosuppressive cytokine TGF- provides co -stimulation and a third chimeric receptor against IL -4 provides a tertiary signal for expansion and cytokine production16. Platform technologies such as synthetic notch receptors, which couple arbitrary extracellular ligand binding to any desired internal transcriptional program, are also under investigation for improved CAR -T homing to target tissues17. A new direction in controlling the spatial targeting of next generation therapies relies on engineering biological systems to sense external stimuli which can be precisely administered by a scientist or clinician . Image -guided interventions such as radiation therapy, laser and RF ablation, and focused ultrasound are established clinical techniques that utilize geometric information about the spatial coordinates of the disease site to direct the application of the treatment18, but which have largely been ignored as cues for the controlled induction of biological activity. 35 One of the most successful spatially -directed modes of biological modulation is o ptogenetics, the control of biological materia ls with light. This technology has enabled spatiotemporal control via applications such as conjugation o f photocleavable inhibitory compounds to viral capsids19, engineering photoa ctivatable nuclear entry of the viral payload20, and delivery of light-activatable biological cargo21. Optical control of non -viral genetic e diting systems such as Cas922 and ZFNs23 has also been developed. A key drawback of op tical approaches is the poor accessibility of deep tissues; because light scattering through tissue occurs on the length scale of millimeters, at -depth access relies on invasive surgical intervention24. This places a severe constraint on the applications wherein this form of spatial targeting is relevant because a multitude of factors such as patient age and frailty , as well as the proximity of disease to highly sensitive tissues such as brain regions and blood vessels, can render surgery unsuitable or impossible25-27. To overcom e this limitation, technologies with noninvasive penetrance through human tissue are being investigated. A variety of noninvasive techn iques are already in use for disease ablation, such as X -ray irradiation, magnetic hyperthermia, and focused ul trasound. These systems are under investigation for biomodulation, albeit not as extensively as their optogenetic counterparts. One such system utilized oxidative stress and DNA damage -responsive transcription factor binding sites to construct an artificial X -ray responsive promoter, which demonstrates up to 20-fold upregulation of gene expression upon exposure to X -ray photons28. However, DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation can result in deleterious or potentially oncogenic mutations, suggesting that other approaches may be safer moving forward. Magnetic fields are highly tissue -penetrant, enabling noninvasive imaging (MRI)29, and are the subject of much recent work for modulation of b iological function. Organ -specific genome editing has 36 been achieved via delivery of CRISPR components in a baculovirus coated with magnetic nanoparticles which enhance cellular uptake under a regionally -applied alternating magnetic field, enabling payload delivery that outpaces immune inactivation of the vector30. Magnetic nanopar ticles have also been utilized to drive gene expression from a heat-inducible promoter via RF -induced hyperthermia31, to control neural function ectly via activation of MNP - affixed ion channels32, and for drug delivery via mechanically -induced disruption of endothelial junctions by magnetic actuation33. Two drawbacks limit the utility of MNP -based control strategies. First, the difficult y in focusing magnetic fields limits the achievable spatial resolution and no sub -organ targeting has yet been demonstrated using this approach34,35. Additionally, as abiological components, synthetic magnetic nanoparticles cannot replicate as engineered cells or biomolecules multiply, thereby limiting the duration for which they can be stimulated. Biologically encoded magnetic nanoparticles an d nanostructures , which could be expressed constitutively by engineered cells, are under development . The iron chelating protein Ferritin was genetically fused to the TRPV1 calcium channel and was able to stimulate an RF -mediated channel opening36; however, the weak paramagnetism of Ferritin has raised some controversy regarding the mechanism of this magnetic actuation37. Stronger bio magnetic structures exist, such as magnetosomes from naturally magnetotactic bacteria38 but these have yet to be expressed in a heterologous, therapeutically useful host organism . Efforts are under way to engineer biomolecules capable of generating more highly magnetized biological structures and recent advances have enable d magnetic trappin g of E. coli expressing these structures at defined spatial coordinates39; however, actuation of biological functions or behaviors using engin eered highly magnetic biomolecules has yet to be achieved. 37 Focused ultrasound (FUS) represents an alternative tissue -penetrant signaling modality with high potential for intrinsic and engineered biomodulation. Focused ultrasound is a pressure wave emitted by a single concave piezoelectric element or by a set of transducer elements in a concave array40. The ultrasonic waves are produced at an intensity such that they propagate through tissue with minimal biological effect but constructively interfere at the transducer 's focal zone, locally increasing the amplitude of the mechanical perturbation and the resulting energy deposition. As a result, the tissue at the focal point undergoes significant mechanical stress and, if ultrasound is supplied at a sufficient intensity and duration, h eating41. The volume of the focal zone is wavelength -dependent and can be quite small, with an achievable cross -sectional full width half max (FWHM) of less than 10 microns in aqueous media42 or less than 100 microns in low -impedance tissues such as the eye43 using ultra -high frequency (~>40 MHz) transducers . Attenuation, and therefore depth penetration, is also frequency - dependent; while ultra -high frequency ultrasound is useful for ocular control or imaging44, most FUS transducers operate in the 0.5 - 3 MHz range, producing a theoretical diffraction limited resolution of approximately 0.25 - 1.5 mm according to the Abbe diffraction limit. In practice, resolution can be diminished by scattering or nonlinear propagation of the sound wave, as well as transducer geometry. T ypical FWHM values for in vivo focused ultrasound range from 1 - 5 mm laterall y and 1 - 4 cm axially, and this frequency range can accommodate focal depths on the order of 10 cm45-47 in tissue . Focused ultrasound has previously been investigated for biological manipulation via stimulation of endogenous cellular components. One method of ultrasound biomodulation is via non -thermal perturbation. The precise mechanism of this mode of stimulation is under active investigation, but is generally thought to be mediated by mechanosensitive cellular 38 components such as ion channels48. One of the most widely studied applications of this technique is neuromodulation of the brain, which has be en demonstrated in cell cultures and tissue slices49 as well as in living animals50,51. Stimulation of other CNS components such as the retina has also been achieved with high prec ision43, as has modulation of the peripheral nervous system52. Image -guided ultrasound pulse planning using penetrative imaging modalities such as MRI enables quantitative prediction of through -skull sound propagation and consequently the application of focused ultrasound to the brain in a transcranial, fully noninvasive manner53,54. This in turn has enabled noninvasive neuromodulation of the brain in human subjects55. Biomodulation via engineered responses to mechanostimulation is gaining traction as a viable method of interfacing with cells and tissues. Local chemical stimulation can be achieved in the brain by taking advantage of the specialized tissue at the interface between the vasculature and the brain, known as the Blood -Brain Barrier (BBB), which is resistant to the diffusive trafficking of biomolecules and most small-molecule drugs56. Mechanically - induced aberrations in the BBB can be imparted with spatial precision using FUS, resulting in transient gaps through which drugs can transport and induce their biological activity in a localized manner57,58. This approach has been extended to gate the brain access of therapeutic antibodies59 and even of recombinant viruses which were evolved to resist trafficking through the BBB without physical disruption60, thus enabling spatial control over transgene delivery in the brain. While localized BBB disruption enables selective brain access, other tissues are more permeable to foreign molecules a nd require other approaches to a ffect ultrasound -mediated control. Mechanical control can be exerted via ectopic expr ession of stretch -sensitive ion channels such as TRP -4, as has been demonstrated in C. elegans61. A 39 similar strategy relying on the native expression of the mechanosensitive cation channel Piezo1 in T -cells has been utilized to gate transcription from the calcium/NFAT signal transduction pathway in CAR -T lymphocytes62. However, both of these strategies rely on perturbing ionic flux, which is typically regulated by multiple channel and pump proteins63, and these techniques are dependent on local pressure amplification by inorganic microbubbles which will dilute out as the cells divide. As such, while mechanical control is an intriguing mechanism for noninvasive biological stimu lation, there remains a vacancy in the repertoire of biological components for a fully genetic method to control cell function in response to focused ultrasound. 2.2: Ultrasound Hyperthermia as a Noninvasive Biological Stimulus One of the primary clinical applications for focused ultrasound is hyperthermic tissue ablation. High intensity pulses sustained for sufficient duration are able to destroy tissue at the focal point by locally raising the temperature past the thermal limit of tissue viability, enabling selective and noninvasive destruction of diseased regions64. Such ablative treatments are currently utilized for elimination of uterine fibroids and a variety of solid tumors47,65. Transcranial ultrasound ablation has also been utilized to relieve symptoms of essential tremor66 and Parkinson's disease67. Over 80,000 patients had undergone image - guided HIFU therapy as of 2014, demonstrating the widespread clinical adoption of this treatment modality and hardware capability68. Although the primary clinical application of focused ultrasound is destructive in nature, not all stimulation regimes result in tissue ablation. Using real -time monitoring via technology such a s MRI thermometry alongside rapid feedback control, mild hyperthermia can be maintained at sub -ablative temperatures69. 40 Such moderate th ermal elevation can therefore be utilized as a signal to control biological responses. Focused ultrasound is not unique in its ability to noninvasively elevate tissue temperature70. Radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation can capacitatively heat tissue; however, the of RF radiation by tissue r estricts >200 MHz radio waves to an operating depth of less than 4 cm71. For deeper applications, energy ca n be deposited by inductive heating via oscillating magnetic fields which induce eddy currents in tissue (Magnetic Induct ion), or which rapidly reorient paramagnetic or ferromagnetic particles (Magnetic Particle Hyperthermia). Capacitative RF heating betwe en two electrodes also has good depth penetration, but the heating is concentrated at the electrodes themselves, rendering spatial control difficult at intermediate locations . The spatial specificity of Magnetic Particle Hyperthermia is typically mediated by the location of the particles rather than the location of the field gradients due to the poor spatial resolution of field focusing34. Finally, phased RF array heating uses constructive interference be tween electromagnetic waves to a ffect localized temperature elevation ; however, the focal volumes tend to be large relative to the size of the patient72 and interference alon g bone -tissue interfaces can result in deviations from the expected heating pattern73. Altogether, focused ultrasound is currently unique in its ability to noninvasively direct controlled temperature elevati on at millimeter length scales. Biomodulation via hyperthermia has previously been achieved mainly via stimulation of endogenous temperature -sensitive promoters. While most bacterial heat shock promoters demonstrate r elatively low fold -change in expression upon induction74,75, mammalian heat 41 shock promoters (particularly those of the HSP70 family) show robust switch -like behavior. Genetically engineered biolo gical reporter genes such as luciferase and fluorescent proteins have been gated by HSP70 promoters and triggered via laser -induced hyperthermia in vitro76 and in vivo77. Magnetic hyperthermia has also been utilized to activate stress -inducible promoters for expression of imaging78 or therapeut ic transgenes, typically to induce tumoricidal payloads79,80. Despite the multitude of research and clinical studies inv ested in magnetic nanoparticle -mediated hyperthermia, the technique suffers from fundamental limitations in spatial resolution (with spatial specificity generally conferred by localized physical administration of the nanoparticles), constraints on input po wer due to generation of eddy currents in off -target tissues, and the inability of synthetic magnetic nanoparticles to replicate along with the cells which they are to control. Critically, HSP70 has also been activated in vivo using FUS stimulation in genetically modified murine models81,82 in wild -type animals wherein the HSP70 and reporter were delivered as viral transgenes83, and in ex vivo -engineered cells after implanta tion into a model organism84. Hinting at th e potential for thermal control of semi -autonomous cell therapies, a recent study generated chimeric animals wherein hematopoietic stem cells from an HSP - reporter mouse were administered intravenously into a reporter -null recipient mouse, homed to tumor si tes (and bone marrow), and underwent selective activation via MRI -guided HIFU hyperthermia85. While the heat shock promoter system provides a convenient endogenous control strategy for transcriptional programming, it suffers from several important limitations. First, because 42 the primary stimulus for this signal transduction pathway is an upregulation of unfolded proteins, the heat shock pathway has crosstalk with other inputs , such as chemical and metabolic stresses86-89, low pH90, oxidative stress91, signaling molecules such as anti-inflammatory agents94 and proteasome inhibitors89, energy deprivation95, and potentially mechanical stress96. An important corolla ry of this activation mechanism is that the thermal threshold for the activation of the heat shock response is highly dependent on the thermostability of the cell proteome rather than on an intrinsic molecule of the heat shock machinery. T his prediction ha s been confirmed by the observation that the human HSF1 transcription factor, which coordinates the overall heat shock promoter activation, demonstrates an altered setpoint when expressed in Drosophila cells which more closely matches the induction thresho ld of the host organism 's HSF197. This result implies that tuning the activation th reshold of heat shock promoters may be challenging. An additional factor which may interfere with HSP -dependent control of cell function in the clinical setting is the activation of heat shock promoters by hypoxia98-102. This phenomenon suggests that care should be taken in the use of these promoters in motile cell types which could potentially reach naturally hypoxic niches in the body such as the bone marrow103 or cartilage104, and in patients suffering from cancer -associated anemia105 and consequent hypoxia106. A further layer of complexity is added by the differential performanc e of heat shock promoters across various cell types107,108 and by the impaired HSP promoter response in som e cell lineages , particularly in the brain109-112. In bacteria, the inducibility of heat shock promoters is typically low (on the order of ten -fold)74 and they can suffer from significant basal leakage. Addi tionally, due to the mechanistic complexity of the heat shock pathway113 (discussed in more detail below) , the prospect of engineering this 43 system to tune its induction thr eshold and switching sharpness is a daunting task. Finally, because the modular switch in the heat shock pathway is a transcriptional promoter, it would be difficult to utilize this system to exert rapid control over cell function on the timescale of second s to minutes, as would be possible by fusing a thermal switch directly to a protein of interest. More rapid thermoswitching mechanisms have been explored in the context of temperature -sensi tive untranslated regions in RNA , such as naturally occurring ROSE114 and FourU115 elements as well as synthetic sequences116, which form thermo -labile stem -loop structure s to prevent translation or polymerase procession117. While more rapid than transcriptional control, this strategy is still slower than direct protein regulation , often demonstrates switching only over a broad temperature range, and typically demonstrates low fold-changes in resulting gene expression118-120. Additionally, this gating para digm is largely restricted to prokaryotes. As such, a tunable biological syste m with intrinsic thermosensitivity and a simplicity that lends itself to control of cell function on the transcriptional and post -translational levels would be highly desirable f or noninvasive modulation of biological activity. 2.3: Temperature in Biological Systems In order to utilize temperature for biomodulation, the effects of this variable on the cell must be understood and accounted for. Temperature is a globally pervasive parameter in biological systems . The thermodynamics of all reactions are dictated by the relative scaling of their energies to kT , where k is the Boltzmann constant ; thu s, temperature affects equilibrium reaction quotients121. Additionally, the r ate of a reaction is dictated by its activation energy122, 44 which is also scaled by kT; therefore reaction rates are also temperature -dependent. Structural transitions in macromolecules also occur with thermal dependence. These transitions can be confined to the submicroscopic scale, as is the case for free cytosolic proteins, or the y can influence the macroscopic structure of the cell, as is the case for the thermal denaturation of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin above 43 \u00b0C123. As such, thermal perturbations can induce widespread effects on the structure and function of the cell. 2.4: The Cell ular Response to Temperature As may be expected, cells have evolved numerous strategies to cope with stress associated with fluctuations in temperature. Upon sufficient hyperthermia (or other forms of damage such as hypoxia, osmotic stress, mechanical stress, ionizing radiation, organic denaturants, and heavy metal s124,125), cells upregulate the transcription and synthesis of a set of 50 -200 (depending on the organism) proteins termed \"heat shock proteins\" (HSPs)125. These proteins, which are typically named according to their molecular weight, attempt to protect the cell by preventing or reversing damage to the cell's components . These proteins can be grouped into seven functional classes. The most abundant class represents molecular chaperones, which act to disaggregate denatured proteins and protect monomers from re - aggregation. A second class consists of proteolytic enzymes which degrade irreversibly aggregated or misfolded proteins. The third class consists of nucleic acid damage repair proteins which detect non -native covalent modifications of DNA or RNA and attempt to repair them. A fourth, understudied class of proteins alters metabolic flux, presumably to compensate for changes in reaction rates due to alte red enzyme stability or thermal 45 equilibrium . This class of proteins is overrepresented in the stress response of unicellular organisms, while multicellular organisms app ear to rely more heavily on chaperone s. The fifth class of HPSs consists of transcripti onal regulators which effect further changes in gene expression to upregulate downstream stre ss response pathways or inhibit stress -sensitive pathways. The sixth group of HSPs assists in maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton, while the final class performs miscellaneous membrane -associated functions such as regulating membrane fluidity and transporting toxins out of the cell. The most well studied, class of heat shock respons e proteins are chaperones. This diverse family of proteins acts to prevent aggregation of misfolded proteins, stabilize unfolded intermediates until they spontaneously sample their native conformation, assist in the targeting of proteolytic degradation, and aid in other functions such as protein translocation between organelles126. Notably, chaperones are more highly inducible in multicellular organisms, whereas unicellular organisms distribute the workload of damage repair more evenly among the many classes of stress -inducible genes. In accordance with their stoichiometric mode of activity, chaperones are the most highly upregulated set of proteins in the stress response of most organisms, and are also strongly constitutively expressed125. Chaperones recognize conserved featur es of denatured proteins such as hydrophobic patches and motifs, and also specific sequence s. Chaperones can be further divided into subclasses. \"Holdases\" such as sHSPs are typically expressed at high levels only upon detection of denaturation or stress a nd are ATP -independent agents that simply bind to unfolded proteins and sequester them from aggregation. In contrast, \"foldases\" such as Hsp70 and its constitutive paralog Hsc 70 bind unfolded or misfolded protein segments and then utilize 46 ATP hydrolysis to undergo a conformational change to modify their internal environment, presenting the client protein with an alternate energy landscape which may induce it to refold into its native state. This group of chaperones is typically expressed from both inducible and constitutive promoters as separate, homologous genes. Another group of heat shock protein s that assist in chaperone -mediate refolding is the HSP100 family, which pulls single polypeptide chains through a central pore in an ATP -dependent manner, thereb y removing it from a misfolded state or pulling it out of an aggregate and subsequently enabling spontaneous or chaperone -assisted refolding. This family of heat shock proteins is generally restricted to bacteria and lower eukaryotes, implying that higher eukaryotes have an alternate mechanism for disaggregating proteins. The trigger for HSP induction is complex, although the foundational events appear similar between bacteria and higher organisms. The master regulator transcription factor of the heat shock response, termed 32 in bacteria and HSF1 in mammalian cells, is sequestered by constitutively expressed members of the chaperone fam ily itself and prevented from affecting transcription125. Accumu lation of unfolded proteins shifts the equilibrium of chaperone binding away from the heat shock regulator and toward their unfolded clients, thereby releasing the transcription factor and initiating the expression of stress response genes. In bacteria, in duction of HSPs induces a feedback inhibition loop to control 32 function via modulation of its translation, activity, and degradation127. Translation of 32 is further regulated by an intrinsic RNA thermometer in the 5' UTR of its transcript128. In higher organisms, HSF1 regulation is a n even more complex phenomenon wherein intrinsic structural thermosensitivity of the HSF1 regulatory domain, together with post -translational 47 modifications such as phosphorylatio n, acetylation, and SUMOylation , modulate HSF1 activity113. Additional ly, the accessory protein eEF1A1, which loads charged tRNAs into the ribosomal A site, is released during stress -associated translational inhibition and redistributes to the nucleus, where it b oth stabilizes the interaction of HSF1 to its cognate binding sequence in heat shock promoters and also facilitates mRNA export from the nucleus via the 3'UTR of HSP promoter transcripts129. 2.5: Temperature in Cellular Viability Despite the wide array of cytoprotective responses to thermal perturbation, temperature still influences the growth and survival of cells. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms of temperature -associated changes in viability has been undertaken, but no single \"weak link\" has been established as the critical mediat or of survival. While both biochemical reaction imbalances and structural transitions of cellular components could potentially influence viability, t he activation energies of most metabolic reactions are on the order of 10 kcal/mol whereas structural trans itions are typically on the order of 100 kcal/mol123. Because the thermal energy required to impair cell viability is also on the order of 100 kcal/mol, it is assumed that these structural t ransitions, rather than metabolic unbalancing, are the principal cause of hyperthermia -mediated cell death123. These transitions are typically attributed to protein unfolding, although the i dentity, number, and quantity of damaged protei ns that result in cell death have not been elucidated. Protein denaturation results in inactivation of function due to loss of structure and typically also in aggregation due to exposure of previously buried hydrophobic residues. Other large -scale transitions, such as changes in membrane fluidity, 48 have been determined unlikely to contribute significantly to the impairment of viability upon hyperthermia130. While large -scale transitions in DNA occur only at temperatures around 90 \u00b0C, it is possible that structural reorganization in microdomains influences viability, although this has not been investigated in detail. Covalent breaks in DNA are not thought to occur in response to mild hyperthe rmia (up to 47 \u00b0C), although DNA damage can occur secondary to thermal stress due to inactivation of the protein machinery responsible for DNA damage repair131. Likewise, the unfolding of RNA species such as tRNAs and UTR regions could also influence cell health. Cytoskeletal reorganization also occurs upon even mild hyperthermia (for durations on the order of 30 minutes), but different cytoskeletal components (e.g. microf ilaments, microtubules, or intermediate filaments) are disrupted in different cell types and it is unclear if a link exists between structural reorganization and viability132. This reorganization can be reversible and the thermal dosage threshold for reversibility differs between cell types, and likely is dependent on the stage of the cell cycle at which the cells are exposed to hyperthermia132. Disruption of the cortical cytoskeletal system, such as the interface between actin and integrins, is likely to affect signal transduction but the effect of this disruption on viability is unclear. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis of mammalian cells show that erythrocytes, which lack a nucleus, show a single structural transition at a T m of 70 \u00b0C while V79 cells, which contain a nucleus, demonstrate a more complicated transition profile with an onset near 40 \u00b0C130. Thus it i s tempting to conclude that the lethal structural transitions occur in the nuclear compartment, a hypothesis bolstered by evidence that heat -treated cells have altered nuclear density and demonstrate intra -nuclear protein aggregation. However, both the nuc lear and 49 cytosolic compartments demonstrate endothermic peaks at temperatures in excess of 50 \u00b0C, but also onset of excess C p near 40 \u00b0C, indicating that both compartments contain a small fraction of thermo -labile components which may be the determining fa ctors for temperature tolerance130. It should be noted that the critical transition or transitions responsible for cell death may be within or between supramolecular structures rather than within single macromolecules. Structural tran sition s such as protein unfolding occur even during physiological temperatures, and the ability of cells to survive depends on their capacity to compensate for or repair these insults123. Indeed, it has been suggested that a small fraction (on the order of 0.2%) of cells in culture at 37 \u00b0C is lost by virtue of \"thermal noise\" that cells cannot recover from133. In accordance with this postulate, cells constitutively express a baseline level of chaperone machinery that is responsible for repairing stress -mediated denaturation and damage125. The ability of cells to compensate for such damage has also been characterized in vitro ; CHL V79 cells are able to tolerate 5% denaturation with minimal effect on viability whereas 10% protein denaturation results in nearly full lethality123. The ability of cells to compensate for some amount of thermal denaturation appears in multiple kingdoms of life, as differential scanning calorimetry analysis of several bacteria l strains demonstrates th at the optimal growth temperature is generally several degrees higher than the onset of thermal structural transitions. The timing of heating with respect to cell cycle also influences thermotolerance. Structural aberrations have been observed in the macroscopic structure of chromatids during 50 hyperthermia. Correspondingly, cells are most heat -sensitive during mitosis, less so during the S -phase of the cell cycle, and minimally thermo -sensitive during G1123. Induction of hyperthermia during S-phase typically leads to a DNA replication block ade, resulting in entry into mitosis prior to full replication of the chromosomes and subsequent death via mitotic catastrophe131. Interestingly, cellular synthesis of DNA while the DNA repair machinery is inactivated appears to also strongly contribute to cell death - when DNA synth esis is chemically inhibited during and after heat shock, cells are rescued from what would be lethal DNA lesions131. Correspondingly, thermal damage to cell cycle checkp oint proteins can induce cell death by permitting the cell to proceed to mitosis without first completing DNA replication131. Most models of cellular thermal viability a re phenomenological in nature. It has generally been observed that cells in vitro display a biphasi c survival profile in response to hyperthermia ( Fig. 2-1)130. The curve is typically characterized by a pre-exponential phase for the first few minutes of hyperthermia, after which point survival decays in an exponential manner. It should be noted that the decrease in survival can be partially ameliorated by p re-exposing cells to mild heat stre ss, as is depicted in curve C . While this increase in robustness is typically attributed to pre-expression of heat shock proteins , which aid the cell in repairing the effects of Figure 2 -1: In vitro cell viability as a function of time at varying temperatures. Note the initial slow rate of death followed by an acceleration and, at permissive temperature, a stabilization of viability due to chaperone production. Reproduced from (Lepock 2003123) courtesy of Taylor & Francis Publishing. 51 thermal denaturation, it is unclear why some cells are able to remain viable while others succumb to heat stress. The threshold at which cells accumulate sign ificantly more damage than they can repair (i.e. the temperature at which viability decays sharply) is dependent on many factors. While the aforementioned V79 CHO cells demonstrated decreased viabil ity upon even brief exposure to temperatures of 43.5 \u00b0C, ot her cell types such as PC3 prostate cancer cells demonstrate little change in metabolism or survival at the same temperatures and tolerate short, high temperature hyperthermia (48 \u00b0C for 10 minutes) or milder, long duration hyperthermia (44 \u00b0C for 60 minut es) with little measurable change in viability124. Additionally, the use of 3D cultures, w hich more accurately mimic the tissue environment, appears to increase post -heat shock viability relative to 2D culture controls via unidentified mechan isms, calling into question the applicability of a wealth of early data collected on monolayer cultures124. It should be noted that Arrhenius analysis indicates that human cells are slightly more thermotolerant than rodent cells, as indicated by their higher \"thermal break point\" in the slope of the Arrhenius plot and the general shallower slope shape indicating slower killing134,135 (Fig. 2-2). In clinical practice, temperature has been found empirically to influence tumor viability in an integrated dose - dependent fashion70. A variety of mathematical Figure 2 -2: An example of the exponential dependence of in vitr o cell viability on hyperthermic dose. The killing rate for human cells is generally lower than that of rodent cultures. Reproduced with permission from Roizin -Towle and Pirro (1991)135. 52 models have been established t o predict cell viability as a function of thermal dose. To date, all of these models are empirical in nature, with all constants fit to data rather than derived from fundamental thermodynamic or biological considerations131. The dependence of cell survival on temperature above the physiological baseline follows an exponential relationship, as demonstrated in Fig. 2-2. To standardize equivalent thermal exposures, the conven tion in the field is to use the \"Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43 \u00b0C\" (CEM 43 \u00b0C), which is defined by Equation 1-1 : 43 \u00b0=(43) where t is the duration of treatment, T is the average temperature for the given treatment interval, and R is an empirically determined constant set to 0.5 or 0.25, depending on if T is greater than or less than the thermal \"break point\" of human cells (43 \u00b0C on average)136. A large body of literature has been assembled over the past four decades regarding tissue viability after varying CEM43 doses134. These data encompass many different temperatures and durations and indicate that, within the same tissue type and species, the CEM43 conversion is robust regardless of the input temperature. This metric is therefore the \"gold standard\" for prediction of biological effects upon hyperthermic exposure. 2.6: Thermal Regimes for Safe Biomodulation The establishment of the CEM43 metric of thermal dosage enables the categorization of temperature/duration landscapes according to their predicted biological effe cts. While the 53 non-specific effects of hyperthermia such as protein denaturation and metabolic reaction rate imbalances are unavoidable in thermal therapy , the most importan t parameter with respect to temperature -switchable therapeutic agents is the thermal dosage limit below which tissue damage is negligible. In the context of cancer therapeutics, damage to malignant tissue surrounding the thermoswitchable agents can be dism issed or even be deemed beneficial. However, in a general setting the bystander tissue must be spared of the t oxic effects of hyperthermia as much as possible. Fig. 2-3 depicts a representative thermal dosage landscape which could be used to inform stimulation intensities and durations. The area below a threshold curve denotes a region of parameters which would be predicted to be safe for stimulation. Above this curve, no n-specific cell death is expected to occur and the corresponding parameters would therefore be unsuitable for stimulation of therapeutic agents. The mode of cell death upon exposure to hyperthermia var ies between cell t ypes, thermal doses, and possib ly the timing of exposure relative to the cell cycle131. Within the so-called hypert hermic range of 40 - 47 \u00b0C , most cell death occurs via mitotic catastrophe or apoptosis (or a combination thereof). In the ablation range of 48 - 60 \u00b0C, protein denaturation and aggregation is much more widespread and the cell typically coagulates. The objective of FUS hyperthermia -activated therapy would be to operate within the bounds of the sa fe thermal envelope to ensure that the effect on tissue health is specifically modulated by the function of the therapeutic agent. Figure 2 -3: Schematic of the thermal landscape and the regimes in which different hyperthermic temperature / duration exposures can fall. Image adapted from The Focused Ultrasound Foundation. 54 Determining a safe thermal regime requires evaluating viability and damage in native living tissue, as cells in culture can display altered temperature sensitivity124 while ex-vivo tissue can suffer from confounding effects such as poor perfusion and oxygen delivery137. Additionally, anatomical c ontext is crucial for understandin g and predicting thermal damage. Much as in vitro cell viability under hyperthermic conditions depends on the identity of the cell line, thermal damage thresholds also differ between tissues within the same species and between different species137. Due to the experimental and ethical difficulty of conducting experiments on thermal viabi lity in human patients and organs , animal models have been utilized as proxies for most studies . A comprehensive review of previous literature across a variety of animal models by the MRI + EUREKA research consortium 's Thermal Workshop on RF Hotspots led to the recommendation of a CEM43 limit of 9 minutes for RF -induced heating during MRI imaging138. It should be noted that the panel also recommended a ceiling of 39 \u00b0C exposure regardless of duration. While this thermal dosage limit was set conservatively for imaging applications and therapeutic inter ventions may warrant more relaxed criteria, the data analyzed by the consortium suggests that a CEM43 on the order of 10 minutes is a reasonable pr eliminary approximation of the thermal envelope within which focused ultrasound may be utilized for safe biom odulation. As the field evolves and more applications of FUS -stimulated therapeutics are demonstrated in pre -clincal models (particularly in the context of non -tumor tissue, such as in the intestine for management of gastrointestinal disorders), more rigor ous thresholds will be established, likely in a tissue - specific manner. 55 2.7: Temperature in Cancer Medicine and Immunology One of the primary potential applications of next -generation biological therapeutic agents is the treatment of cancer. Hyperthermia -mediated modulation of engineered therapeutic agents has the potential to synergize with a variety of beneficial effects of temperature elevation for tumor destruction139. While ablation of tumor mass by temperatures in excess of 60 \u00b0C directly reduces tumor burden, mild (sub-ablative) hyperthermia and fever -range (39 \u00b0C - 41 \u00b0C)140 temperatures may also benefit cancer treatment by modifying the tumor microenvironment and potentiating the immune response. One of the primary intrinsic benefits of hyperthermia is its ability to mobilize and activate the immune system. Temperature elevation induces immunostimulatory changes in the tumor and associated tissue and also directly in various immune cell compartments. Hyperthermia can alter the surface protein expression profile of tumor vasculature to facilitate extravasation of cytotoxic T -lymphocytes from the bloodstream into the tumor141. As a result of either this altered expression profile or of increased blood perfusion, 42 \u00b0C microwave hyperthermia enables enhanced tumor access by T -cells, Natural K iller (NK) cells, and dendritic cells while decreasing the population and activity of immunosuppressive T-reg and myeloid -derived suppressor cells142. Thermal shifts can also alter the surface proteome on tumor cells to dysregulate the camouflaging balance of surface receptors upon which cancer cells rely for immune evasion. In some tumors, 43 \u00b0C hyperthermia enhances MHC -I expression on the tumor surface, increasing the probabiliry of recogniti on by patrolling CTLs143. In contrast, hyperthermia can inhibit MHC presentation in other tumor 56 types, thereby promoting thei r recognition and destruction by Natural Killer (NK) cells144. Hyperthermia sensitizes some -mediated overexpression of NKG2D activating receptor in NK cells145,146. Hyperthermia can also induce some tumors to produce chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, which actively recruit pro -inflammatory immune cells to the site of disease142. The adaptive immune system also demonstrates temperature -responsive stimulation. In CTLs, h yperthermia increases the rate of contact with antigen presenting cells, possibly via increasing the membrane fluidity of the T -cells147. Fever -range hyperthermia induces PKC relocalization148 and potentiates activation of cytotox ic function in a TCR pathway - dependent manner, as indicated by increased phosphoroylation of the LAT and PKC signaling mediators149. Mild hyperthermia also increases expression of the death ligand FasL on T -cells, potentially via augmentati on of translocation direct HSF1 -mediated transcription150. Exposure to 42 \u00b0C further augmented pro - inflammatory cytokine production by tumor -infiltrating T -cells142. In addition to cells of the lymphoid lineage , myeloid immune cells are also biased toward activat ion at elevated temperatures. Mild hyperthermia recruits monocytes to the tumor, which can then differentiate into macrophages and present tumor -associated antigens to the adaptive immune system151. The induction of monocyte trafficking may be driven largely by the overproduction of CXCL2 and other chemokines by heat -treated tumors152. In macr ophages, fever -range hyperthermia in combination with recognition of soluble damage motifs promotes increased phagocytosis and synthesis of cytotoxic effector molecules153-155. 57 These damage signals can also augment IL -12 secretion by monocyte -derived dendritic cells and bone marrow , in increased T -cell proliferation156,157. Hyperthermia also promotes cytokine TNF general immunostimulatory effect of mild hyperthermia corroborated by the observation of abscopal, CD8+ T-cell dependent tumor retardation in a mouse model where a contralateral tumor was treated with magnetic hyperthermia152. When devising therapeutic stimulation protocols for engineered thermo -responsive cancer therapies, it will be worthwhile to optimize the heating parameters for both the triggering of the temperature switch and also the effector functions of the relevant immune cells, which can diminish upon prolonged exposure to super -febrile thermal regimes154,155. Heat shock proteins, whose conventionally studied role is as molecular chaperones to promote homeostasis, also function as signaling molecules to promote immune activity. This behavior is prominent in tumors undergoing therapeutic hyperthermia or fever. Hsp70, Hsp90, Hsc70, and gp96 are released by damaged tumor cells and bind to TLR4 on the cance r cell surface in a paracrine manner, thereby inducing chemokine production and promoting dendritic Hsp70, Hsp90, and are overexpressed and trafficked to the membrane of chemotherapeutically stressed cancer cells where they promote phagocytosis and maturation of dendritic cells159. These proteins also ligate the immune surface receptor CD91160 on dendritic cells, wherein they induce cross -presentation of chaperoned antigens and upregulation of co -stimulatory surface receptors161. In dendritic cells, internal Hsp90 activity appears necessary for maturation, thereby intrinsically linking 58 this process to fever and hyperthermia158. Ligation of TLR4 by damage -associated Hsp70 from tumor cells also promotes maturation160. There is clear consensus in the literature that temperature elevation promotes the immune response against tumors. However, the mechanisms of immune action can differ depending on context, such as the identity of the tumor cells and their specific response to hyperthermia (e.g. MICA upregulation, MHC up or down -regulation, chemokine release, etc.) and also of the immune cells which are able to infiltrate into the tumor structure during the application of thermal stimulus. Additionally, most reported works suggest that temperature -stimulated immune activation is optimal at or below 41 \u00b0C, above which deleterious effects and damage begin to outpace stimulatory pathways140. It is important to note, however, that inducing a focal thermal elevation a bove fever conditions at the tumor core to stimulate engineering thermo -responsive therapeutics will result in temperature dissipation along a gradient to the periphery. Tumor -infiltrating immune cells further from the focal stimulation zone are expected t o experience more optimal temperatures in the fever range and may therefore act as a secondary mechanism to promote tumor rejection. In addition to potentiating the immune response against tumors, l ocal hyperthermia has complementary effects with other therapeutic modalities139. The most significant benefits are likely to occur due to temperature -associated increase i n blood perfusion70. This enhanced blood transport reoxygenates hypoxic tumors, which are otherwise resistant to radiotherapy162. It also increases the local availability of passively transported therapeutic agents su ch nanoparticles. C ells in S -phase of the replication cycle, while relatively resistant 59 to radiation therapy, are sensitized to hyperthermia123. Actively mitotic cells are also sensitive to hyperthermia, with experiments in CHO cells demonstrating complete destruction of the centriole upon a thermal dose of 45 \u00b0C for 15 minutes132. A variety of clinical trials have demonstrated that combination therapy incorporating local hyperthermia improves treatment outcomes across multiple cancer types71 and this modality is regarded as a leading adjuvant for chemotherapy and radiation therapy163. 2.8: Ultrasound Hyperthermia: Potential for Biological C ontrol Noninvasive technologies have the potential to address many of the shortcomings of next - generation therapeutic agents , such as engineered cells and viruses. Focused Ultrasound Hyperthermia is a signaling modality capable of nearly full -body access and confined spatial resolution on the order of millimeters, rendering it an ideal choice for communicating with endog enous biological agents with spatiotemporal precision. FUS hyperthermia can be measured in real time to ensure that a sub -ablative thermal regime is maintained, and mild hyperthermic exposures have now been sufficiently characterized to ensure minimal deleterious effects to the stimulated tissue. The hardware for HIFU stimulation is clinically available and appears to be gaining market penetrance. As such, the infrastructure for specific ultrasound biomodulation is available and awaiting novel engineered bi ological agents to take advantage of its potential . 60 2.9: References 1.

Tunable thermal bioswitches for in vivo control of Chemical Biology , 13(1), 75 -80. https://doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.2233 3.1: Introduction Rapid advances in synthetic biology1, 2 are driving the development of genetically engineered microbes as therapeutic3-6 and diagnostic7-10 agents for a multitude of human diseases. A critical capability for many envisioned applications is the ability to control the function of engineered microbes in situ to enable spatially and temporally specific activation at anatomical and disease sites such as the gastrointestinal tract or tumors2. However, among existing control methods, systemic chemical administration typically lacks the spatial precision needed to modulate activity at specific anatomical locations, while optical approaches suffer from poor light penetration into tissues11. On the other hand, temperature can be controlled both globally and locally - at depth - using technologies such as focused ultrasound12, infrared light13 and magnetic particle hyperthermia14. In addition, body temperature can serve as an indicator of microbial entry and exit from the host organism and of the host's condition ( e.g., fever). 69 Given this potential, remarkably few high -performance thermal bioswitches are available to control gene expression in engineered microbes. The i deal bioswitch should have a sharp thermal transition resulting in a large change in activity (> 100 -fold over a few degrees), and its switching temperature should be tunable to enable a broad range of applications. In addition, the bioswitch should be ort hogonal to endogenous cellular machinery and compatible with other thermo -responsive components to allow multiplexed thermal logic. Existing temperature -dependent regulators of gene expression - including microbial heat shock factors, membrane -associated p roteins, RNA thermometers, and transcriptional repressors - fail to fulfill these criteria. Microbial heat shock promoters undergo a relatively low level of thermal induction (~10 -fold)15, have crosstalk with other stimuli such as chemical stress16, and may be difficult to tune without deleterious effects on the cell. Likewise, the switching temperature of membrane -associated proteins depends on bilayer composition and occupies second messenger pathways17. Meanwhile, RNA thermometers, while orthogonal to the host and amenable to tuning, generally have small dynamic ranges (< 10 -fold) and broad transitions (> 10 \u00b0C)18-25. Of the available molecular machinery, several natural and mutant transcriptional repressors have the most robust thermal switching and potential for orthogonality26-32. However, the ir relative performance has not been characterized, they have not been systematically engineered to operate at specific transition temperatures, and their potential utility for in vivo microbial therapy applications has not been demonstrated. To address the need for robust, tunable, orthogonal thermal control of engineered microbial systems, we systematically screened candidate transcriptional regulators, developed two 70 orthogonal families of high -performance thermal bioswitches with tunable thr within the biomedically relevant range of 32\u00baC to 46\u00baC, and demonstrated the potential utility of these devices in three distinct in vivo scenarios relevant to mammalian microbial therapy. These scenarios include spatially selective activation with in a mammalian host using focused ultrasound, sensing and response to a fever, and self -destruction at ambient temperatures to prevent environmental contamination after leaving the intended host. 3.2: Results 3.2a: High -Performance Thermal Bioswitches In order to engineer new families of robust, tunable, orthogonal thermal bioswitches, we began by characterizing the performance of six temperature -dependent transcriptional repressors and six endogenous heat shock promoters. Our panel included TlpA, a transcriptional autorepressor from the virulence plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium . This protein contains an approximately 300 residue C -terminal coiled -coil domain that undergoes sharp, temperature -dependent uncoiling between 37\u00baC and 45\u00baC , and an N -terminal DNA binding domain that, in its low -temperature dimeric state, blocks transcription from the 52 bp TlpA operator/promoter26, 32. In addition, we tested a well -known temperature -sensitive variant of the bacteriophage repressor cI (mutant cI857, here referred to as TcI ) acting on a tandem pR/pL operator/promoter27. In most previous applications , TcI repression has been modulated via large changes in temperature ( e.g., steps from 30\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C)27. However, its original description as a virulence factor suggested that much sharper switching may be 71 possible28. Alongside TlpA and TcI, we tested four reported temperature -sensitive mutants of the E. coli repressors TetR (A89D and I193N)29 and LacI (A241T and G265D)30, 31, together with a panel of endogenous heat shock promoters, including GrpE, HtpG, Lon, -performance thermal bioswitches. (a) Constructs used to assay the performance of temperature -sensitive repressors (TSr, top) and heat shock promoters (HSP, bottom). The specific repressors and promoters assayed are listed in blue and gray, respectively. ( b) optical density (oD) - normalized flu orescence after 12 h of thermal induction for the constructs shown in a. nFu, normalized fluorescence units. Fmin represents expression at 31.4 \u00b0C; Fmax is the maximum fluorescence intensity measured for each construct, measured up to 45.7 \u00b0C. The fold cha nges between Fmin and Fmax are listed above each sample. Where not seen, error bars are smaller than the symbol. N = 4 for TSrs and N = 3 for HSPs. The Fmin for TcI (indicated by *) is reported from 72 measurement at 34.2 \u00b0C because expression at lower temper atures was below the detection limit of the assay. ( c) oD-normalized fluorescence from the Tlpa - and TcI -regulated constructs as a function of induction temperature for a fixed duration of 12 h. N = 4. ( d) oD-normalized fluorescence as a function of therma l induction duration at the maximal induction temperature for the Tlpa and TcI constructs. N = 4. ( e,f) oD-normalized fluorescence landscapes for Tlpa - and TcI -gated constructs, respectively, as a function of both incubation temperature and duration. Data shown interpolated from an 8 \u00d7 8 sampling matrix. all samples in d -f were maintained at 30 \u00b0C after the indicated period of thermal induction for a total exper imental duration of 24 h before measurement. Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m. The performance of these constructs is summarized in Figure 3-1b. TlpA and TcI had by far the largest dynamic ranges (355 \u00b1 45 and >1,432, respectively), reflecting a combination of tighter repression at sub -threshold temperatures and stronger promoter activity above threshold. Both of these repressors show sharp thermal transitions, with greater than 30 -fold induction over ranges of 5\u00baC and 3\u00baC centered at 43.5\u00b0C and 39.5\u00baC for TlpA and TcI, respectively ( Fig. 3-1c). Furthermore, both systems are capable of rapid induction, with greater than 10 -fold changes in expression observed after a 1 hour thermal stimulus ( Fig. 3- 1d). Complete time -temperature induction profiles for TlpA and T cI are shown in Figure 3-1, e-f. In addition to their high performance, TlpA and TcI are expected to be more orthogonal to cellular machinery than both the native heat shock promoters and the engineered TetR and LacI repressors, the latter of which are uti lized in multiple endogenous and engineered gene circuits33-35. A homology search36 showed that TlpA and TcI repressors are present in far fewer bacterial species than either TetR or LacI ( Supplementary Fig. 3- S1). Based on these factors, we chose TlpA and TcI as our starting points for further bioswitch engineering. Since the TlpA operator/promoter has not been studied in E. coli , we characterized its molecular mechanisms to inform its utilization in genetic circuits. As shown in 73 Supplementary Figure 3-S2, the TlpA operator is a strong promoter (88 -fold stronger than LacIQ) driven by the transcription factor 70. Interestingly, this promoter has bidirectional activity with identical thermal regulation in both orientations, but approximately 200 -fold lower maximal expression in the reverse direction ( Supplementary Fig. 3-S2, c-d). Th is property will enable convenient adjustment of TlpA -regulated expression according to circuit requirements. 3.2b: Tuning Bioswitch Activation Temperatures Applications in microbial therapy require thermal bioswitches that activate at different transiti on temperatures. For example, a host colonization sensor should be activated at 37\u00baC, while a fever detector may work best with a thermal threshold of 39\u00baC, and a focused ultrasound -activated switch may require a transition point of 41\u00baC to avoid nonspecif ic actuation. Synthetic biology applications outside biomedicine may likewise have a variety of thermal requirements. It is thus highly desirable to be able to tune thermal bioswitches to activate at new temperatures while retaining sharp, robust switching performance. To enable such tuning of TlpA and TcI, we devised a simple and effective high -throughput assay based on colony fluorescence. We grew E. coli expressing GFP under the control of mutant repressors (generated by error -prone PCR) on solid media a nd replica -plated the colonies onto separate plates for simultaneous incubation at desired \"off\" and \"on\" temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 3-S3a). We then imaged the plates with wide -field fluorescence, as shown in Figure 3-2a. As expected, many colonies s how constitutive expression (ostensibly due to loss of repressor function) while others fail to de -repress (most likely retaining their 74 original high transition point). However, several colonies show thermal induction in the desired regime. Within each scr een, we selected several such colonies to undergo liquid phase characterization of induction temperature, switching sharpness, and expression levels (Fig. 3-2b). From these variants, we selected mutants that retained the desirable performance characteristi cs of the wild type repressor, but with shifted transition temperatures. Figure 3 -2: Tuning the transition temperature of thermal bioswitches. (a) Fluorescence image of replica plates used to screen for TlpA variants turning on between 37 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. One colony selected for further assay is indicated by the orange circle. Scale bars, 1 cm. ( b) TlpA variants plotted by their measured midpoint transition temperatures (T50) and 10 -90% transition range (T10 -90), estimated by linear interpolation.

RFR, relative fluorescence units. Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m. Screening of TlpA mutants at off -on temperatures of 30 -37\u00baC and 37 -40\u00baC produced high - performance bioswitches centered at 36 \u00b0C and 39 \u00b0C, respectively, which we named TlpA 36 and TlpA 39 (Fig. 3-2c). For TcI, we selected both downshifted (TcI 38, Tm = 38 \u00b0C) and upshifted (TcI 42, Tm = 42 \u00b0C) variants relative to the original protein ( Fig. 3-2d). Together, 75 the engineered TlpA and TcI repressor families cover the biomedically relevant range of 32\u00baC to 46\u00baC ( Supplementary Fig. 3-S3b) while demonstrating a dynamic range similar to that of the wild type protein ( Supplementary Table 3-T1). The amino acid substitutions identified in these b ioswitch variants are shown in Supplementary Figure 3-S4. The observed decrease in fluorescence at the highest temperatures tested may be due to thermal instability of the cell's transcriptional and translational machinery. Remarkably, a single round of m utagenesis was sufficient in all cases to obtain at least one variant with the desired switching behavior, suggesting that both TlpA and TcI are highly tunable for a broad range of applications. 3.2c: Thermal Logic Circuits Using Orthogonal Bioswitches To enable microbial therapy applications, it is useful to develop thermal logic circuits capable of controlling multiple functions at different temperatures or confining activity to within a narrow thermal range. This would enable cells to, for example, in itiate one therapeutic function upon host colonization and switch to a different function during a host fever response or local activation with focused ultrasound. We hypothesized that since TlpA and TcI act on orthogonal target sequences, we could combine them in circuits designed for multiplexed thermal control or band -pass activation of microbial function. To assess the first possibility ( Fig. 3-3a), we made a construct encoding a GFP modulated by TlpA 36 and an RFP regulated by TcI ( Fig. 3-3b). As predic ted, upon exposure to a range of temperatures, the two reporter genes were activated independently at their expected thresholds, with no apparent crosstalk in their induction ( Fig. 3-3c). Independent thermal control of the co -76 expressed circuits is illustrated by spatially patterned bacterial variants incubated at 37\u00baC and 42\u00baC ( Fig. 3-3d). Next, to develop a thermal band -pass filter ( Fig. 3 -3e), we engineered a circuit placing the expression of RFP under the control of the lambda operator, gated by both TcI (turning on above 36\u00baC) and the temperature -independent wild type cI repressor, which was itself placed under the control of TlpA (activating above 43\u00baC) as shown in Figure 3 - 3f. The cI open reading frame was preceded by a T7 terminator and a weak ribosome binding site to reduce buildup of this repressor at 40 -43 \u00b0C due to leakage of the upstream TlpA operon. This resulted in RFP expression confined between 36 and 44\u00baC, while simultaneously turning on GFP above RFP's turn -off temperature ( Fig. 3 -3, g-h). 77 Figure 3 -3: Thermal logic circuits.

Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m. 78 3.2d: Spatially Targeted Control Using Focused Ultrasound After developing TlpA and TcI -based thermal bioswitches, we demonstrated their utility in three prototypical microbial therapy scenarios. First, we tested the ability of thermal bioswitches to mediate spatially -selective control of microbial therapies using focused ultras ound, a modality that is well established in its ability to elevate temperatures in deep tissues with millimeter spatial precision 12 and utilized clinically to treat diseases such as cancer37 and essential tremor38. Focused ultrasound has been used to activate gene expression in mammalian cells39, but has not, to our knowledge, been employe d to control the activity of microbes in vivo . Such control could be highly advantageous in applications where the activity of a systemically administered microbial therapy needs to be localized to a specific anatomical site, such as a deep -seated tumor or section of the gastrointestinal tract, which would be difficult to reach with optogenetic triggers. To test this concept, we first activated gene expression using focused ultrasound in tissue -mimicking phantoms under the guidance of magnetic resonance ima ging (MRI)40 (Fig. 3-4a). This guidance enabled precise spatial targeting of the ultrasound focus and real -time monitoring and adjustment of local temperature. We fir st applied this technique to a flat lawn of E. coli containing the multiplexed expression circuit shown in Figure 3-3b. This specimen was assembled with a tissue -mimicking tofu phantom, and steady -state focal heating over 45 minutes resulted in a radial th ermal gradient with an average focal temperature of 42\u00baC, as observed by real -time MRI thermometry ( Fig. 3-4b). A corresponding pattern of spatially localized fluorescence is seen in Figure 3-4c. 79 To establish the feasibility of this approach in vivo , we i njected E. coli expressing GFP under the control of TlpA 36 subcutaneously into both hindlimbs of a nude mouse and applied MRI - guided focused ultrasound to one location ( Fig. 3-4d) to produce a local steady -state temperature of 41\u00baC for 45 min to 1 hour. This thermal dose is below the damage thresholds for mammalian tissues such as muscle and brain41, 42. In vivo fluorescence imaging four hours after ultrasound treatment showed robust expression of GFP specifically at the ultrasound - targeted anatomical site ( Fig. 3-4e). Two additional animals undergoing the same procedure are shown in Supplementary Figure 3-S5. TlpA 36 was selected as the thermal bioswitch for these experiments because its activation threshold is approximately 4\u00baC above the typ ical murine cutaneous temperature43, a sufficient difference for site -specific ultrasound activation. Figure 3 -4: Remote control of bacterial agents using focused ultrasound. (a) Illustration of the in vitro focused ultrasound experiment: focused ultrasound is used to heat a target area of a bacterial culture lawn through a tofu phantom (depicted as translucent) under MRI guidance, followed by fluorescence imaging. (b) MRI -based temperature map of the bacterial specimen during steady -state ultrasound application, overlaid on a raw grayscale MRI image of the phantom. ( c) Fluorescence image of the region targeted by ultrasound, showing activation consistent with a bact erial construct expressing GFP under the control of TlpA 36 and RFP regulated by TcI. ( d) Illustration of the in vivo experiment, in which focused ultrasound is used to activate subcutaneously injected bacterial agents 80 at a specific anatomical site. ( e) Rep resentative thresholded fluorescence map of a mouse injected subcutaneously in both left and right hindlimbs with E. coli expressing GFP under the control of TlpA 36, following ultrasound activation directed at only the right hindlimb. Scale bars, 2 mm ( b,c) and 1 cm ( e). 3.2e: Programmed Responses to Mammalian Host Temperature Next, we sought to develop autonomous thermosensitive microbes responsive to endogenous changes in host temperature. First, we investigated whether bacteria can be engineered to sense and respond to a host fever ( Fig. 5a ). We subcutaneously injected one f lank of a nude mouse with E. coli expressing GFP under the control of TlpA 36, and the other flank with E. coli expressing GFP controlled by wild type TlpA as a high -threshold control for non - specific activation. The mouse was then housed at 41\u00baC for two ho urs in an established fever model paradigm44. In vivo fluorescent imaging four hours after fever induction shows robust expression of GFP in the flank injected with TlpA 36-regulated ba cteria ( Fig. 5b ). No significant activation is seen in the opposite flank or in a mouse housed at room temperature (Fig. 5c ). Two additional replicates of this experiment are shown in Supplementary Figure 6. Second, we tested whether a thermal bioswitch o perating at 37\u00baC could be used to confine the activity of genetically engineered microbes to the in vivo environment of a mammalian host and thereby limit the potential for environmental contamination. Towards this end, we designed a genetic circuit in whi ch TlpA 36 controls the expression of CcdA, a bacterial antitoxin, while constitutively expressing the toxin CcdB, thereby restricting growth to temperatures above 37\u00baC ( Fig. 5d ). A degradation tag was fused to CcdA to accelerate cell 81 death at non -permissiv e temperatures. Bacteria carrying this plasmid grew normally above this permissive temperature, while bacteria incubated at 25\u00baC had significantly reduced survival as demonstrated by their CFU counts in Figure 5e . We administered these bacteria to mice by oral gavage and collected fecal pellets after five hours to allow transit through the gastrointestinal tract. The pellets were kept for 24 hours at either 25\u00baC, corresponding to excretion into the ambient environment, or at 37\u00baC, equivalent to persistent r esidence in the gut, and subsequently assayed for colony formation. The survival of cells excreted into ambient temperature was reduced by ten thousand fold compared to cells maintained under host conditions ( Fig. 5f ).

Scale bars, 1 cm. 3.3: Discussion Our results establish two new families of high -performance, orthogonal thermal bioswitches with tunable activation thresholds to enable a variety of biotechnology applications. Both TlpA - and TcI -based switches respond to temperature with hundreds -fold changes in gene expression. If needed, this response could be further boosted using well -established strategies such as tandem operators and positive feedback amplification45, 46. In addition, the temporal response of thermal bioswitch circuits could be made eithe r more transient, by manipulating the lifetime of the resulting transcripts and proteins, or longer -lasting using genetic toggle switches or recombinase -based architectures30, 47. This may enable persistent functions to be controlled with thermal stimuli shorter than those used in this study. Our strategy for tuning the thermal response of TlpA and TcI is rapid and simple to implement. The fact that we could identify high -performance variants with new transition temperatures by screening several hundred mutants suggests that many different sequences could satisfy a given thermal requirement. Here, we focused on bioswitches operating between 32 and 46\u00baC, in keeping with potential therapeutic applications and the thermal tolerance of our bacterial chassis. We expect that a similar selection strategy using thermophilic or cryophilic bacteria could be used to tune TlpA and TcI over a yet broader temperature range for industrial applications such as biofuel production. The thermal stability 83 of the regulated gene product will need to be taken into account in these scenarios. Within the temperature range tested in this study, GFP, RFP and CcdA were functional. The presented bioswitches have sequences orthogonal to bacterial host machinery and to each other, enabling multiplexed thermal actuation. If desired, additional multiplexing could be accomplished by replacing the DNA -binding domains of TlpA or TcI with t hose of other dimeric repressors. Additional engineering may be needed to adapt this technology to other host organisms. Certain species of therapeutic microbes, such as Lactobacillus spp. , are able to use some promoters transferred directly from E. coli48. Others may require incorporation of the relevant operator sequences into promoters native to the host49. Alternatively, fusions of TlpA and TcI with DNA binding domains from other microbes or eukaryotes could adapt TlpA a nd TcI for use in these species. The three in vivo scenarios demonstrated in this work will inform the use of thermal bioswitches in future microbial therapy applications. For example, the ability to detect a host's fever provides a potential safety mec hanism with which to curtail effector activity in response to runaway inflammation, a major and sometimes lethal side -effect of antitumor cell therapy50. In addition, temperature -dependent kill switches can be used to restrict the survival of enterically -administered microbes to host body temperature and thereby mitigate the risk of patients shedding genetically modified, pharmaceutically active organisms into the surrounding environment. Such kill switches can be i ncorporated into recently developed multilayered and multi -input containment circuits for greater efficiency in preventing mutational escape51, 52. Furthermore, the ability to activate microbial function at specific anatomical sites using focused ultrasound opens new therapeutic avenues by potentially 84 allowing a physician to locally target therapeutic effects that would be intolerable via systemic administration. Additionally, the ability to trigger gene expression in vivo can be combined with genetically encoded genomic or proteomic tools53-55 to enable the study of cellular signaling within the context of mammalian hosts. 3.4: Methods Plasmid Construction and Molecular Biology All constructs were made via restriction cloning, KLD mutagenesis, or Gibson Assembly using enzymes from New England Biolabs. All plasmids and their sources of genetic material are described in Supplementary Table 3-T2. All constructs were cloned in Mach1 E. coli (Thermo Fisher) and the sequence -validated plasmids were assayed in NEB10 E. coli (NEB). Fluorescent reporters referred to in the text as GFP and RFP are mWasabi and mCherry, respectively56, 57. Thermal Regulation Assay 2 mL cultures of 2xYT media with 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin were inoculated with a single colony per culture and grown at 30 \u00b0C, 250 rpm for 20 hours. After dilution to O D600 = 0.1 in LB (Sigma) with 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin, the cells were propagated at 30 \u00b0C, 250 rpm for 1.5 hours, after which OD 600 was measured using a Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) in cuvette mode every 10 minutes. At OD 600 = 0.25, the cultures were d ispensed in 25 \u00b5L aliquots into 8 well PCR strips with optically transparent caps (Bio -Rad) using a multichannel pipette and placed into a spatial temperature gradient formed by a Bio -Rad C1000 Touch thermocycler with the lid set to 50 \u00b0C. The temperature in each thermocycler 85 well was verified using a TEF -30-T thermocouple (J -KEM Scientific) immersed in 25 \u00b5L of pure water within a PCR tube. After the prescribed thermal stimulus, PCR strips were removed, vortexed, spun down on a tabletop centrifuge and the fluorescence was measured using a Stratagene MX3005p qPCR (Agilent). Immediately after measurement, the cultures were diluted with 75 \u00b5L LB/Amp and mixed, after which 90 \u00b5L of culture was transferred into 96 well plates (Costar black / clear bottom) for me asurement of OD 600 using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). For studies of gene expression as a function of thermal induction time (Fig. 1, d -f), samples were returned to incubation at 30 \u00b0C after their indicated thermal induction periods su ch that the total experimental duration was 24 hours. Fluorescence measurements were made at the end of this period. Gene expression ( E) was determined according to Equation 1: = (1) Here, F is the raw fluorescence of the given sample and OD is the OD of the given sample at 600 nm. Raw OD measurements for all experiments are provided in Supplementary Figure 3-S7. As expected, bacterial growth is highest in the physiological range of 35 \u00baC to 39 \u00baC. The value of blank fluorescence was determined as the average of all 96 wells in a qPCR plate filled with 25 L LB. Blank OD was taken as the y -intercept of a sta ndard curve of 90 L non -fluorescent E. coli cultures whose OD 600 values were determined by cuvette measurements in a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (96 samples total). Background fluorescence was measured from a non -fluorescent construct derived by muta ting the chromophore measurements for the thermal expression landscapes of TlpA and TcI were performed using the plate reader due to signal saturation of the qPCR at the 24 hour time 86 point (Sample N = 3; Background N = 2 for each time point and temperature). Errors from background measurements were propagated by addition in quadrature. Errors from blank measurements were negligible relative to sample -to-sample variation (relative standard deviation < 2%) and were omitted from the calculation. Colony Screening for TlpA Tuning Error -prone PCR was performed on pTlpA on Polymerase/0.2 mM MnCl 2) and the PCR products were inserted into the parent cons tructs using Gibson Assembly. The resulting libraries were transformed into NEB10 E. coli and plated on LB Agar. Following overnight incubation at 30 \u00b0C and the appearance of colonies, a Replica -Plating Tool (VWR 25395 -380) was used to replicate each seed plate into two receiver plates. One receiver plate was grown overnight at the desired repressed temperature, and the other at the intended activation temperature. Upon the appearance of visible colonies, plates were imaged in a Bio -Rad ChemiDoc MP imager using blue epifluorescent illumination and the 530/28 nm emission filter. Images were examined manually for colonies that appeared dark or invisible on the \"off plate\" but showed bright fluorescence on the \"on plate\". Approximately 103 colonies were screen ed per library. These colonies were picked and subjected to the liquid culture thermal activation assay described above, whereupon their thermal induction profile was compared to that of their parent plasmid. Variants that demonstrated sharp switching and large dynamic range between the desired new transition temperatures were sequenced, re -transformed, and assayed using a higher number of replicates. In Vitro Toxin -Antitoxin Assays 87 NEB10 cells were transformed with the thermally regulated toxin -antitoxin plasmid and allowed to grow at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Because reversion of plasmids carrying toxic genes such as CcdB is known to be a common phenomenon, we used a replica plate screen to isolate colonies that maintained a functional thermal kill switch after tr ansformation. To this end, we replica plated the original transformation into two new plates, one incubated at 25\u00b0C and the other maintained at 37 \u00b0C. Colonies that grew at the permissive temperature of 37 \u00b0C and not at 25\u00b0C were used in downstream in vitr o or in vivo experiments. For in vitro experiments , the selected colonies were grown in 2xYT media with 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin at 37\u00b0C with shaking until OD 600 of 0.6 whereupon they were diluted and plated onto LB agar plates. The plates were incubated overnight at either 25\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C, after which colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Focused Ultrasound MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was performed using a 16 -channel ultrasound generator, motorized MRI -compatible transducer positioning system and an annular array transducer operating at 1.5 MHz (Image Guided Therapy, Pessac, France). Targeting and real-time imaging was performed using a Bruker Biospec/Avance 7T MRI system with RF excitation delivered by a 7.2 cm diameter volume coil and detecti on via a 3 cm diameter surface coil. Temperature monitoring was performed using a continuously applied Fast Low Angle Shot sequence with a T R of 75 ms and T E of 2.5 ms, matrix size of 32 x 32, and varying FOVs as listed below. Phase images were processed in real time using ThermoGuide software (Image Guided Therapy) and temperature was calculated from the per -pixel phase accumulation due to a decrease in proton precession frequency of 0.01 ppm/\u00b0C. 88 For in vitro heating, 100 L of a saturated NEB10 culture expressing the temperature - inducible reporter circuit was plated overnight at 30 \u00b0C and incubated for approximately 12 hours to form a lawn on a plate containing 0.24 %w/v LB (Sigma) and 0.32 %w/v Bacto Agar (BD). An approximately 3 cm x 3 cm square of ag ar was excised from the plate and placed, with the bacterial side facing up, onto a comparably sized pad of 1 cm thick extra firm tofu (O Organics) coated with SCAN ultrasound gel (Parker Laboratories) to exclude air at the interface. A 1 cm high plastic w asher made by drilling through the lid of a VWR 35 mm plastic tissue culture dish was placed onto the bacteria and the assembly was inverted and placed onto the surface coil such that the bacterial lawn, facing down, was supported by the washer. The ultras ound transducer was positioned above the assembly, in contact with the tofu through another thin layer of ultrasound gel. To provide a reference to compensate for global phase drift during the experiment, a second piece of tofu was placed within the field of view but spatially separated by a 1 cm air gap from the object under insonation. A fiber optic thermometer (Neoptix T1) was inserted into the reference tofu, and the difference between the MRI -derived reference temperature and thermometer -reported tempe rature was accounted for at the site of insonation when calculating the true focal heating. Ultrasound was applied with the focus aimed at the tofu immediately adjacent to the agar layer with manual control of power level and duty cycle so as to maintain a temperature of 41.5-43 \u00b0C for 45 minutes. Imaging was performed as described above with a matrix size of 5.39 x 5.05 cm and a slice thickness of 2 mm. The plate was subsequently returned to 30 \u00b0C for 5 hours and imaged using a Bio -Rad ChemiDoc MP imager w ith epi illumination and nm emission filter epi illumination and a 605/50 nm filter (mCherry). 89 Animal Procedures All animal procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the California Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 9 -week old BALB/c female mice and 4 -week old NU/J 2019 female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (JAX); 4 -week old SCID/SHC female mice were purchased from Charles River. For in vivo ultrasound actuation, E. coli expressing the pTlpA36 -Wasabi plasmid grown to OD 0.6, pelleted, and resuspended to OD 24. A 100 L bolus was injected subcutaneously into both hindlimbs of a nude mouse (SCID or NU/J2019). Mice were anaesthetized using a 2% isoflurane -air mixture and placed on a dedicated animal bed with the surface coil positioned below the target limb of the mouse. Anesthesia was maintained over the course of the ultrasound procedure using 1 -1.5% isoflurane. Respiration rate was mainta ined at 20 - 30 breaths per minute and temperature and respiration rate were continuously monitored using a pressure pad (Biopac Systems) and a fiber optic rectal thermometer (Neoptix). The target limb was thermally activated by elevating the temperature to 41\u00b0C and maintaining the elevated temperature for 45 min to 1 hour. Temperature monitoring and adjustment was performed as described above for in vitro experiments. Following ultrasound treatment, the mouse was returned to its cage for four hours, anaesthe tized, and imaged using a Bio -Rad illumination and the 530/28 nm emission filter (mWasabi). For host fever sensing experiments, SCID mice injected with bacteria as described above were housed in an incubator preset to 41 \u00b0C for two hours and control mice were housed at room temperature. Following treatment, all mice were housed at room temperature for four 90 hours, anaesthetized, and imaged using a Bio -Rad ChemiDoc illumination and the 530/28 nm emission filter (mWasabi). Mouse images are representative of three independent in vivo experiments. Fever -induced and control mice were littermates randomly selected for each experimental condition. Investigators were not blinded to group allocation because no su bjective evaluations were performed. For host confinement experiments , BALB/c mice were given drinking water containing 0.5 mg/mL of ampicillin for 24h, and then starved for food overnight. E.coli were grown in 2xYT media containing ampicillin at 37\u00b0C with shaking until OD 600 of 0.6. Cultures were pelleted and resuspended at 108 cells/mL in PBS containing 1.5% NaHCO 3. 200 \u00b5L of the suspension was administered orally using a gavage needle. Food was returned to the mice and the drinking water contained ampici llin throughout the entire experiment. Fresh fecal samples were collected from each mouse 5 hrs after gavage and incubated at 37\u00b0C or 25\u00b0C for 24h, then weighed, homogenized in PBS at 0.1 g/mL, diluted and plated onto LB agar plates containing ampicillin. Plates were then incubated overnight at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. Bacterial colonies were counted as described above for in vitro toxin -antitoxin experiments. The sample size was N = 5 mice, which was chosen based on preliminary experiments indicating that it would b e sufficient to detect significant differences in mean values. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Interaction between TlpA, 70-RNAp holoenzyme and DNA was demonstrated using a gel shift assay. For this, 50 pmoles of fluorescein -labeled double stranded DNA representing the TlpA operator with flanking padding sequences (70 base pairs in total) was incubated with either 50 pmoles of TlpA protein or 5 Units (8.5 pmoles) 70-RNAp holoenzyme (NEB 91 M0551S) individually in 50 uL reaction buffer comprising 40 mM -HCl, 150 mM 10mM MgCl2, .01% Triton -X-100 and 1 mM DTT at a pH of 7.5. As a negative control, the wildtype TlpA operator was replaced with a scrambled version. Following incubation at 37\u00baC for 30 minutes, 1 0 uL of the reaction mixture was supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 5 % and loaded in a nondenaturing 4 % polyacrylamide resolving gel. The gel was run at 65 V for 90 minutes in buffer comprising 45 mM Tris -borate and 1 mM EDTA at a pH of 8.3. DNA was visualized using Bio -Rad ChemiDoc MP imager using blue epifluorescent and the 530/28 nm emission filter. Statistics and Replicates Data is plotted and reported in the text as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Sample size is N = 4 biological replicates in all in vitro experiments unless otherwise stated. This sample size was chosen based on preliminary experiments indicating that it would be sufficient to detect significant differences in mean values. P -values were calculated using a two -tailed u npaired heteroscedastic t -test. 92 3.5: References 1. Ford, T.J. & Silver, P.A. Synthetic biology expands chemical control of microorganisms.

Conditional protein -protein interactions (PPIs) are among the most widespread and versatile modalities employed by cells to regulate molecular signaling pathways2. Consequently, engineered PPIs have had an important role in studying the function of many proteins in the cell and the construction of synthetic cellular devices. In particular, wide ly used chemically - inducible dimerization domains such as FKBP/FRB3 have enabled a vast array of applications ranging from the basic study of protein signaling4 to the engineering of exogenously -gated chimeric antigen receptors for cellular immunotherapy5. Chemical dimerization is effective both in culture and in deep tissues ba sed on the bioavailability of the chemical agent; however, this activity is poorly amenable to spatiotemporal regulation. In contrast, o ptical ly inducible dimerization domains such as Cry 2/CIB 1 offer exquisite spatial and temporal precision , enabl ing micro scopic studies of processes such as the immune response6 and cell motility7, but are limited by the scattering of photons in deep tissue and other complex media . 104 Temperature offers an alternative mechanism for control ling biological signaling with several advantages over chemicals and light . Temperature can be applied to biological samples globally using simple heat sources or electromagnetic radiation, and can be applied locally deep within scattering media usi ng technologies such as focused ultrasound , enabl ing spatiotemporal control with millimeter spatial resolution and temporal resolution on the order of seconds1,8. Previous work on thermal control o f cellular signaling has focused on temperature -actuated transcription and translation, taking advantage of endogenous heat shock promoters9,10, temperature -dependent RNA elements11, or heterologously protein -based transcriptional bioswitches12. In addition, temperature -sensitive variants of individual proteins have been used to study the function of these proteins in model systems13,14. While these pioneering approaches enable thermal control of specific aspects of cellular function, they lack the modularity of chemical and optical dimerizers. Here we introduce a modular approach to controlling protein dimerization with temperature. Starting with a homodimeric temperature -dependent coiled -coil transcription factor from bacteria, we engineer a pair of heterodimeric protein association domains with sharp, tunable thermal unbinding. We demonstrate the ability of these \"thermomers\" to dynamically control protein localization in living mammalian cells. The resulting technology has the potential to provide versatile thermal control of protein -protein interactions in a variety of cell types , complementing the existing set of chemical and optical tools. 105 4.2: Results As the starting point for our design of thermomers, we used the temperature -sensitive transcriptional repressor TlpA from Salmonella typhimurium due to its relatively simple architecture and well -characterized thermal behavior15. While no atomic -resolution structure of this pro tein exists, biochemical and bioinformatics studies have indicated that TlpA consists of an N -terminal DNA -binding domain and a C -terminal coiled -coil domain , the latter of which causes the protein to homodimerize in a temperature -dependent manner . As a dimer, TlpA binds to a cognate DNA operator sequence within its corresponding promoter and prevents transcription. The coiled -coil domain of TlpA undimerizes and uncoils above a temperature of ~42\u00baC, causing unbinding from the operator and allowing transcrip tion to take place. This sharply cooperative transition happens over less than 3 \u00baC, as defined by 10% to 90% activation. We previously demonstrated that the thermal set -point of TlpA could be tuned through directed evolution without compromising cooperati vity, and used its transcription factor activity to spatiotemporally control the function of engineered bacteria with ultrasound hyperthermia12. To turn TlpA into a modular protein -protein dimerization system, we first needed to convert it from a homodimer to a heterodimer. Most applications of inducible dimerization s ystems require the interacting modules to be heterodimeric to enforce selective binding betwe en two desired molecular partners16. To redesign the wild type TlpA into a pair of heterodimeric coiled -coil species ( Fig. 4-1a), we used rational mutagenesis guided by bioinformatic prediction of the TlpA dimerization domain. Coiled -coil domains typically consist of repetitive seven -amino acid residue sequences known as heptad repeat s17. We u sed a 106 published annotation of the TlpA sequence18, cross -referenced against a computational annotation from the COILS19 prediction server , to establish the register of hepta d repeats within the TlpA primary sequence. We then introduced charge -complementary pairs of residues20 predicted either at conventional g -to-e' contacts or at alternative g -to-d' interfaces to disfavor homodimerization and favor heterodimerization (Fig. 4 -1, b-c). The latter architecture occurs when large ionic sidechains at the core peripherally expose their charged termini as has been described for the Fos-Jun coiled coil interaction21. To maintain the highly switch -like thermal dissociation behavior of TlpA , we reasoned that the least perturbative positions for mutagenesis would be at existing interfacial ionic interaction sites in the wild type protein, which are present due to the C 2 symmetry of the parallel coiled -coil structure. We mutagenized all such positions one by one, r eplacing cationic residues with glutamate and anionic side chains with arginine or lysine. We expressed the resulting coiled -coil domains in E. coli, purified the proteins via affinity chromatography, and assayed their helical content over a relevant therm al range via circular dichroism spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 4-S1). From this initial screen we obtained a pair of charge - complemented mutants, dubbed TlpA -G1A a sharp, sigmoidal switching profile with a notable upshift in threshold for an equimolar mixture of the mutant pair relative to pure solutions of either species ( Fig. 4-1d). To validate the in vivo functionality of the TlpA -G1A and G 1B mutants, we utilized the ability of TlpA to modulate the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene in E. coli12. We constructed a temperature -inducible circuit containing two separate copies of the TlpA gene, with a TlpA operator upstre am of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) . 107 To compare the repression efficiency of the G1A/G 1A and G1B/G 1B homodimers to 1B heterodimer, generated circuit variants containing two copies of TlpA -G1A, two copies of TlpA -G1B, or one copy of each TlpA strand ( Fig. 4 -2a). The thermal gene expression profile s of GFP showed all three circuits to produce a highly switch -like cooperative activation. However, the two homodimeric constructs had a clear down shift in their transition temperature compared to the heterodimeric construct containing both TlpA variants (Fig. 4-2b), confirming a stabilized heterotypic -association between the two coiled - coil strands . The RFP output displayed similar activation profiles (Supplementary Fig. 4 - S2). Swapping the positions of the two TlpA copies within the vector did not significantly influence the expression profile, controlling for inadvertent stoichiometric effects (Supplementary Fig. 4 -S3). While the performance of the fi rst-generation heterodimers was encouraging, we noted that the G 1A/G 1A and G 1B/G 1B circuit constructs still demonstrated an activation setpoint above 37 \u00b0C, indicating that the mutants retained the ability to homodimerize under typical mammalian homeostatic conditions . We therefore used our thermal GFP expression assay to evaluate a subset of additional rational mutant pairs selected from our original panel (Supplementary Fig. 4 -S4), and chose the two b est-performing pairs of substitutions from this subset to combine with TlpA G 1A and TlpA G 1B in all possible permutations. This resulted in the second -generation coiled -coil pairs dubbed TlpA G 2-1 - G2-4, each comprising a G 2An and a G 2Bn monomer ( Supplementary Table 4 -T1). In our bacterial bioswi tch assay, all the heterodimeric circuits combining G 2An with its complementary G 2Bn displayed switch -like ac tivation of reporter fluorescence (Fig. 4-2c, Supplementary Fig. 4 -S5). In 108 contrast, t he homodimeric constructs containing two copies of G 2An or G 2Bn were unable to propagate in a stable manner, consistently displaying deletions in the TlpA promoter or the fluorescent reporter gene, even when grown at 30 \u00b0C in recombination -deficient E. coli . We interpret ed this as evidence that the second -generation variants are unable to form homodimer ic interactions at the concentrations defined by our circuits, resulting in constitutive expression from the TlpA promoter and a strong metabolic burden to the host cell22,23. For additional confirmation of the dimerization preference of our engineered coiled -coils, we designed a biochemical ass ay based on covalent crosslinking and size -based gel separation. TlpA dimers hetero - from homodimerization, w e truncated one of the two TlpA sequences by removing its DNA binding domain, thereby altering its electrophoretic mobility on a polyacrylamide gel without perturbing its ability to dimerize (Fig. 4 -3a). HA tags were added at the C -termini of both proteins to facilitate specific detection via Western blotting. We expressed the resulting pairs of truncated and full -length TlpA variants in E. coli. To validate this assay, we expressed a pair of wild -type TlpA coils and crosslinked them at 37 \u00b0C, after a therm al elevation to 45 \u00b0C, and after return to 37 \u00b0C. Three bands corresponding to the expected mixture of the two types of homodimers and one type of heterodimer were visible after crosslinking at 37 \u00baC, while crosslinking at the higher temperature resulted i n the preponderance of monomers, which could be re -annealed by bringing the temperature back down to 37 \u00baC (Fig. 4 -3b). 109 Substituti ng the wild type coiled -coils with our first-generation hetrodimerizing mutants result ed in preferential accumulation of th e TlpA heterodimer at 37 \u00b0C ( Fig. 4 -3c). Constructs containing the second -generation variants demonstrated further reduction in the intensity of the homodimer bands in favor of the intermediate molecular weight heterodimer, with TlpA G 2-3 demonstrating the strongest heterodimeric enrichment. (Fig. 4 -3c, Supplementary Fig. 4-S6). The first - and second -generation heterodimers both showed reversible dissociation at 45\u00baC ( Fig. 4-3d). On the basis of these results, the TlpA G 2-3 pair was chosen as the thermomer construct for further experiments. After validating our engineered heterodimeric TlpA thermomers, we set out to demonstrate their ability to be fus ed with other proteins and confer controlled protein -protein association in mammalian cells. We designed a construct wherein one TlpA -G2-3 strand was N- terminally fused with the palmitoylation sequence of GAP43, thereby compartmentalizing it to the plasma membrane. The complementary strand was fused at the C -terminus to mScarlet -I (Fig. 4 -4a), an RFP chosen for its robust fluorescence at elevated temperature (Supplementary Fig. 4 -S7). To make this system compatible with mammalian homeostatic conditions, w e combined the TlpA -G2-3 heterodimer izing mutations with three previously described amino acid substitutions that lowe r the coiled -coil dissociation temperature to approximately 39 \u00baC12. Using live cell confocal microscopy of transient ly transfected K562 cells, at physiological temperature we observe d strong localization of red fluorescence to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4-4b and Supplementary Fig . 4-S8) and also to the Golgi apparatus ( Supplementary 110 Fig. 4-S9). Increasing the cells' temperature using resistive heating above a threshold of 40 \u00b0C resulted in the redistribution of membrane fluorescence into the cytosol . As a control for non-specific thermal dissociation, cells in which the RFP was directly palmitoylated showed no redistribution of membrane fluorescence within this temperature range (Fig. 4-4c, 4-4d, and Supplementary Fig . 4-S10). This confirms that RFP dissociation from the membrane is driven by a TlpA -mediated binding transition rather than disruption of membrane integrity. To enable the use of the thermomer system with viral gene delivery and genomic integration, we generated a nonhomologous variant of the TlpA G 2A3 strand (nhTlpA G 2A3) in which all degenerate codons were mutagenized to synonymous triplets with minimal identity to the original sequence. This mutagenesis helps avo id template switching -mediated recombination during viral delivery of high -homology constructs25. The resulting open reading frame had 57.48% sequence identity to the paren t sequence, with no more than 5 consecutive homologous nucleotides. Lentiviral delivery of a construct -induced dissociation of red fluorescence from the plas ma membrane, similar to results from transient transfection (Supplementary Fig. 4 -S11). We used this virally -engineered K562 cell line to quantify the co -localization of RFP fluorescence intensity with signal from the plasma membrane as delineated by Cel lBrite Fix 488 staining (Fig. 4 -4e). Cells with thermomer -mediated RFP targeting to the membrane demonstrated co -localization with the dye at physiological temperature, followed by loss of pixel correlation above 40 \u00baC ( Fig. 4-4f). In contrast, control cel ls with directly palmitoylated 111 RFP demonstrate robust co -localization with the membrane stain throughout the temperature range tested, while free cytoplasmic RFP showed no correlation with the CellBrite dye (Fig. 4-4f). We also used the TlpA reporter cell line to evaluate the reversibility of TlpA -mediated membrane localization after heating. Membrane localization was released by a 5 -minute incubation at 42 \u00baC. Upon cooling back to 37 \u00b0C, TlpA re -partition ed to the plasma membrane, indicating reversibility , albeit with slower kinetics than observed for dissociation (Fig. 4-4g and Supplementary Fig . 4-S12 and 4.3: thermomers capable of conferring temperatur e-controlled protein -protein association and localization to genetically fused proteins. This technology complements the large existing repertoire of chemical and optical dimerizers used to control a wide range of protein and cellular functions26. The thermomer constructs also expand upon our previous work on temperature -stimulated transcriptional control12 by enabling thermal actuation in arbitrary cell types and drastically increasing the kinetics of activation relative to that of gene expression. We anticipate that as external control of protein signaling becomes needed for more complex settings, such as cellular therap y27 and engineered living materials28, this will provide a role for temperature - based control modalities that offer spatiotemporal specificity and penetration depth beyond those afforded by systemic drug delivery or optical methods1,8. 112 The simple architecture of the TlpA coiled -coil renders it an att ractive domain for future work in controllin g protein function. For example, conditionally dimeric c oiled -coil fusions have previously been u sed to reconstitute and control a split mutant of RNAse T129 and to conditionally enact DNA binding by a bZIP domain upon photostimulation30. More broadly, coiled -coils have seen a diverse array of applications in biomaterials, affinity purification, assembly of bispecific or high avidity antibodies, and reconstitution of various split proteins or dimerization -dependent protein complexes31,32. To maximize its versatility as a tool for biology and medicine, future work on TlpA -based thermomers is needed to optimize construct size, modularity, and kinetics. At 371 residues, TlpA is nearly four times larger than its drug -responsive counterpart FKBP , which may hinder applications in gene delivery where sequence compactness is of premium importance. Truncation and mutagenesis approaches may offer a strategy by which the size of the thermomer system could be minimized without sacrificing the desired sh arp thermal switching response. In addition, elucidating the mechanism responsible for the unique thermal cooperativity of TlpA would assist in future rational engineering efforts to modify performance and generate novel, orthogonal thermomers. Additionall y, a thorough characterization of potential genetic fusion sites and optimal linker sequences would facilitate the widespread use of TlpA as a thermal fusion tag. In this study, we demonstrated that TlpA retains a cooperative thermal transition as an intac t protein, as an isolated coiled - coil domain, and as a system with distinct fusion sites at the N and C -termini. However, additional engineering may be needed to accommodate fusion partners of different sizes and valency. Finally, we note that while detec tion of TlpA -RFP delocalization kinetics from the 113 plasma membrane appeared to be limited by the timescale of temperature elevation and image acquisition of our apparatus (approximately 2 minutes), re -association in some cells was significantly slower. It w ould be useful to investigate the factors that influence re - association, including diffusion and potential low -affinity contacts between unpartnered TlpA strands, their homodimeric partners and other constituents of the cell. With further optimization, the rmomers promise to provide a high degree of control over a wide range of cellular processes with the versatile application of thermal energy. 4.4: Acknowledgements The authors thank Mohamad Abedi and Andres Collazo for helpful discussions.

The TlpA 39-G2A3 strand is fused to a GAP43 palmitoylation motif, leading to its tethering to the lipid membrane. The partner TlpA 39-G2B3 strand is fused to RFP. At low temperature, the heterodimerization of these strands leads to RFP localization at the membrane. Upon heating , the RFP -fused strand dissociates from the membrane Fluorescence images of a representative K562 cell transfected with the construct shown in a. Robust membrane localization of RFP fluorescence is observed at 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. At 40 \u00baC, RFP begins to dissociate from the membrane, and by 42 \u00b0C red fluorescence is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The nucleus is 120 stained in blue with Hoechst 33342 dye. c) Genetic construct (top) a nd experimental schematic (bottom) of directly palmitoylated RFP control. d) Fluorescence images of representative K562 cell transfected with the construct shown in c, display ing robust membrane localization throughout the temperature range tested. e) Repr esentative fluorescence images of a K562 cell with a lentivirally delivered TlpA -mediated RFP localization construct (shown in a) and the membrane -staining dye CellBrite Fix 488. f) Pixel colocalization of RFP with the CellBrite 488 dye as a function of temperature in K562 cells stably expressing directly palmitoylated RFP (shown in b, n = 8), the TlpA -mediated membrane localization construct (shown in a, n = 15), and free cytosolic RFP (n = 8).

Pixel intensit y was normalized to the maximal per -image value. 121 4.7: Methods Plasmid Construction and Molecular Biology All plasmids were designed using the SnapGene software (GSL Biotech) and assembled via KLD mutagenesis or Gibson Assembly using enzymes from New England Biolabs. All plasmids and sequences will be deposited to Addgene. After assembly, constructs were transformed into NEB Turbo and NEB Stable E. coli (New England Biolabs) for growth and plasmid preparation. Constructs containing long homologous regions such, including all plasmids containing two TlpA ORFs, were propagated using NEB Stable. Thermal gene expression assays were performed in NEB Stable E. coli. Bacterial reporters of gene expression referred to in the text as GFP and RFP are mWasabi1 and mCherry2, respectively. The mammalian fusion protein fluorophore referred to in the text and figures as RFP is mScarlet -I3. TlpA, mCherry eel diagram annotation was performed using the software DrawCoil 1.05. In the creation of dual -expression GFP/RFP thermal reporter plasmids such as that described in Fig. 1e, an additional terminator was placed upstream of each pTlpA promoter to suppress crosstalk from the weak upstream transcription previously observed from this element4. nhTlpA was designed using a homemade script to minimize codon homology while retaining protein sequence identity. Subsequently, 11 nucleotides were altered manually to minimize short repeats that prevented c ustom gene synthesis. The nhTlpA 39 gBlock was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Bacterial Thermal Regulation Assay 122 Determination of temperature -dependent gene expression was performed as described previously4. Briefly, saturated precultures were diluted to OD 600 = 0.1 and propagated at 30 \u00b0C until reaching OD 600 = 0.3 as measured via Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific), at which point 25 uL aliquots were dispensed into PCR tubes with transp arent caps (Bio -Rad) and incubated for 12 hours in a thermal gradient using a Bio -Rad C1000 Touch thermocycler. After thermal stimulus, fluorescence was measured using a Stratagene MX3005p qPCR (Agilent), after which cultures were diluted 4x, transferred i nto microplates (Costar black / clear bottom), and measured for OD 600 using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 plate reader. The background -corrected F/OD is reported as described previously4. Protein Expression and Purification for CD Spectroscopy pET26b -based expression constructs were transformed into BL21 -DE3 E. coli and grown on kanamycin -selective plates. Saturated overnight cultures were diluted 1 mL into 400 mL expression cultures and induce d with a final IPTG (Sigma Aldrich) concentration of 1 mM at OD 600 = 0.6. After 24 hours of expression at 25 \u00b0C, cultures were harvested by centrifugation using a JLA -16.250 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 6,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 8 minutes. Pellets were lysed us ing the detergent Solulyse in Tris Buffer (Genlantis) and debris was were purified on an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) using 1 mL cOmplete columns (Roche) and buffer exchanged into 1x PBS (Corning) using Zeba spin desalting columns. Concentration was determined using the Pierce 660nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteins were stored at 4 \u00b0C until use. Proteins were subsequently analy zed within 24 hours of purification. 123 Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy CD melting curves were taken using an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spectrophotometer (Model 60DS) at 222 nm with 0.1 minute equilibration time and 5 second averaging time. Purified proteins were diluted to 3 \u00b5M in 1x PBS and measured in a 1 mm quartz cuvette. Temperature -dependent protein fluorescence measurement Fluorescent proteins were purified as described above and diluted to 1 \u00b5M for analysis. 25 \u00b5L samples were placed in N=3 replicat es in PCR strips with optically transparent caps (Bio Rad) into a Stratagene MX3005p qPCR (Agilent) for intensity mesaurements. Filter sets used for red, green, and blue proteins were ROX, FAM, and ATTO, respectively. Sample fluorescence was measured conti nuously as temperature was ramped from 25 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C in 1 \u00b0C increments and with 1 minute of equilibration time at each increment. Mass -based validation of heterodimerization Dual TlpA expression constructs were transformed into BL21 -DE3 cells (NEB) and grown as 1 mL precultures in 2xYT/ampicillin for 20 -24 hours at 30 \u00b0C in an Infors Multitron with shaking at 250 rpm. 10 \u00b5L saturated cultures were diluted into 4 mL 2xYT/ampicillin and returned to 30 \u00b0C. At OD 600 - 0.6 to 0.7, cultures were induced with 4 \u00b5L of 1 M IPTG (Sigma Aldrich) and returned to 30 \u00b0C for 12 hours, at which point they were transferred into 2 mL centrifuge tubes (USA Scientific) and pelleted in a Beckman Microfuge 2 0 at maximum speed for 1 minute. Supernatant was carefully and completely aspirated with a pipette, and the pellet was weighed and frozen at -20 \u00b0C for at least 20 minutes. After 124 thawing, Solulyse in Tris Buffer (Genlantis) was added at 10 \u00b5L per 1 mg. Pel lets were gently resuspended via pipetting and shaken in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer at room temperature (800 rpm for 20 minutes). Subsequently the tubes were spun at 13,000 rcf for 10 minutes and the lysate was diluted 5 -fold in Solulyse in Tris Buffer. A pi lot Western blot was performed and total TlpA band intensity was quantified for each variant, after which loading amounts for all variants were normalized to that of the wild type via dilution in Solulyse. For crosslinking, 1 \u00b5L of 50 mM CuCl 2 (Sigma Aldri ch) was added to 10 \u00b5L in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. The lysate and CuCl 2 solution were pre -heated separately for 5 minutes prior to co -incubation. Subsequently, the lysate and crosslinker mixture was shaken at 800 rpm for 10 minutes in an E ppendorf ThermoMixer at the desired temperature. After 10 minutes of CuCl 2-catalyzed crosslinking, the reaction was quenched with 11 \u00b5L buffer (Bio Rad). For uncrosslinked samples, 10 uL Laemmli buffer was added to the lysate at the appropriate tem perature. SDS -PAGEwas performed using 7.5% pre -cast polyacrylamide gels (Bio Rad) run at 75 V for 140 minutes. Western blotting was performed using the Transblot Turbo apparatus and nitrocellulose membrane kit (Bio Rad). Transfer was performed at 25 V for 7 minutes. Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v Blotto milk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 0.05% TBS -Tween for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary staining was performed using the mouse anti -HA sc -7392 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Blots we re then washed three times for 15 minutes at 4 \u00b0C with 0.05% TBS-Tween and stained for 4 hours with goat anti -mouse IgG -HRP sc -2005 (Santa Cruz Biotech) at room temperature. After three 15 -minute washes, HRP visualization was performed using Supersignal We st Pico PLUS reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Imaging was performed in a Bio -Rad ChemiDoc MP gel imager. 125 Mammalian cell culture K562 cells (gift of D. Baltimore) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Corning). Transient transfection was performed using Lonza 4D nucleofection with SF Cell Line buffer and the pre -programmed K562 protocol. Lentivirus was prepared using a third -generation viral vector an d helper plasmids (gifts of D. Baltimore). Virus was packaged in HEK293T cells grown in 10 cm dishes after 2 days of transfection and concentrated via the Lenti -X reagent (Takara Bio). Infection was performed by resuspending viral pellets in 250 uL RPMI an d spinfecting 1E6 K562 cells in 1 mL RPMI with 10 \u00b5L virus at 800 xg, 30 \u00b0C, for 90 minutes. Experiments were performed at least five passages after infection. Live cell microscopy Delta -T dishes (Bioptechs) were coated with 400 \u00b5L 0.1 mg/mL Poly -D Lysine (Sigma Aldrich) for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, 1E6 K562 cells were pelleted at 300 rcf for 5 minutes and resuspended in staining solution (1x PBS or HBSS with 2.5 \u00b5g/mL Hoechst 33342, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For Golgi staining, the (in also contained BODIPY FL 5-Ceramide complexed to BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50 nM final concentration). Cells were stained at room temperature for 10 minutes before being pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL RPMI 1640. For co -localization experiments, the sta ining solution (in HBSS) also contained CellBrite Fix 488 at 1x concentration as described in the product manual, and staining was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. After at least 20 minutes of coating, PDL was aspirated from the Delta -T dishes, which wer e then rinsed once with 1x 126 PBS and dried. Cells were then transferred to the Delta -T dishes, which where adhesively affixed to the swinging plates of an Allegra X -12 centrifuge with SX4750 rotor (Beckman Coulter) and centrifugated at 30 \u00b0C for 15 minutes a t 300 rcf. Imaging was performed at the California Institute of Technology confocal microscopy facility using an LSM880 (Zeiss) with Airyscan. Cells with sufficient overall brightness to discern membrane contrast were imaged; the membrane localization of d immer cells could not be discerned in our thermal imaging configuration but was observable under higher magnification on a conventional glass slide ( Supplementary Fig. 4-S14). Delta -T dishes were mounted onto the thermal stage interfaced with a Bioptechs D elta T4 Culture Dish Controller and imaged using a 1080 - 378 C -Achroplan 40x/0.80 W objective. Airyscan processing was performed in 2D mode using default settings. Image analysis Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss Zen Black software for pre -proce ssing and CellProfiler6 for correlation quantification. Images were manually cropped to include only a single cell per ROI, with approximately 408x408 pixel FOVs. For cells with poor attachment to the plate, resulting in positio n offsets between the red, blue, and green channels, frame alignment between the red and green channels was performed in Zen Black. All available transformations were sampled and the best -aligned transformation on a per -cell basis was used. Blue channel al ignment was performed in CellProfiler using the Mutual Information module, correlating the blue channel image with the inverted red channel image. Exported images were then loaded in CellProfiler and analyzed using a custom pipeline (Supplementary File 4-F1). Briefly, cell boundaries were determined from red channel 127 using Hoescht 33342 -stained nuclei as primary seed objects. Atypically bright green clusters frequently observed on the green channel were excluded from quantification, as were the Golgi -associa ted TlpA clusters on the red channel. Colocalization was calculated for the ROI defined between the outer cell membrane and the nucleus. The nucleus was excluded because it acts as a diffusion barrier to TlpA -RFP but not to free mScarlet -I. For the free mS carlet -I cell line in Fig. 4-4f, a modified pipeline using the CellBrite Fix 488 stain for cell boundary determination was used to improve the detection of cell edges ( Supplementary File 4-F2). For the Direct Membrane Fusion data set in Fig. 4-4f, the 44 \u00b0C point was acquired in a separate experiment using the same cell line and is consistent with the 43 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C data points of the original data set ( Supplementary Fig. 4-S15). 128 4.8: Supplementary Figures Supplementary Figure 4 -S1: Circular di chroism melting curves of engineered TlpA variants. Coiled -coil fragments corresponding to residues 69 -359 of TlpA were purified from E. coli and assayed via CD spectroscopy. Monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm, corresponding the prototypical peak of the -helical spectrum, enables tracking the conformation of TlpA as it transitions from the dimeric coiled -coil state to a monomeric random coil configuration. 129 Supplementary Figure 4 -S2: Thermal R FP expression profiles of the constructs shown in Fig. 4-2b (n = 3) . Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m . 130 Supplementary Figure 4 -S3: Positional independence of the TlpA co -expression construct. The positions of TlpA -G1A and TlpA -G1B within the heterodimer co -expression construct in Fig. 4-2b were exchanged and the thermal GFP (top) and RFP (bottom) expression profile was determined (n = 4). No significant differences were observed in the gene expression profile, thereby excluding position-dependent effects on TlpA behavior within the circuit. Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m . 131 Supplementary Figure 4 -S4: Screening of rationally designed mutant panel via bacterial thermal gene expression assay . Four positions in the TlpA coiled -coil were selected for mutagenesis based on the predicted similarity of their ionic interaction pattern to the G1A/G 1B mutant pair according to the heptad repeat register prediction of Koski et al. The following mutations were examined: a) E151R and R152E b) E229R and and d) E331K/E335K and K336E . The predicted interaction pattern of the wild type protein is depicted (top), and the thermal GFP expression profile is reported (bottom). N = 3. The E229R/R230E and E250R/R251E pairs were selected for introduction into the TlpA -G1A and G 1B variants. Error bars represent . 132 Supplementary Figure 4 -S5: Thermal RFP expression profiles of the first and second -generation heterodimers shown in Fig. 4-2c (n = 3) . Only the construct containing one copy of each heterodimeric strands are depicted because the X nA/X nB homodimeric construct were unable to propagate without accumulating deletion mutations in the TlpA promoters or fluorescent protein open reading frames. Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m . 133 Supplementary Figure 4 -S6: Western blot band intensity profiles of co -expressed full and truncated TlpA strands in Fig. 4-3c. Note that samples lacking a distinct band corresponding to the truncated homodimer (3), such as TlpA -G1, nevertheless display higher band intensity for the truncated uncrosslinked strand (5) relative to the full -length uncrosslinked species (4), confirming that the lack of a low molecular weight homodimer at position 3 results from reduced homodim er affinity rather than full depletion of the light TlpA strand by heterodimer pairing. This is consistent with cationic and anionic TlpA variants having different homodimerization affinities at 37 \u00b0C. 134 135 Supplementary Figure 4 -S7: Thermal stability of a panel of blue (a), green ( b), and red (c) fluorescent proteins. Proteins were prepared in equimolar concentrations and their fluorescence was measured in an rtPCR thermocycler upon a thermal ramp from 25 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C and subsequent re - annealing to 25 \u00b0C, with readings taken continuously over 1 minute intervals. Signal intensity is normalized to the maximum for each given experiment. Because different filter sets were used for the three classes of proteins, relative brightness does not correlate between the red, green, and blue channels . While some proteins such as FF -GFP demonstrated more stable signal over the temperature range tested, the overall brightness was maximal in mScarlet -I and TGP. However, TGP demonstrated significant aggregation when expressed as an untagged cytosolic protein in mammalian cells so mScarlet -I was chosen as the reporter for subsequent experiments. 136 Supplementary Figure 4 -S8: Additional replicates for TlpA membrane localization experiment in Figure 4-4b. Pixel intensity was normalized to the maximal per -image value. 137 Supplementary Figure 4 -S9: K562 cells transfected with the construct shown in Fig. 4-4a were stained with BODIPY -C5-Ceramide to label the Golgi transport pathway. Staining morphology was similar to the locali zation of the mScarlet -I TlpA cargo protein. Four representative cells are shown. Pixel intensity was normalized to the maximal per -image value. 138 Supplementary Figure 4 -S10: Additional replicates of K562 cells transfected with a construct bearing directly palmitoylated mScarlet -I, as in Fig. 4-4d.

K562 cells transduced with the lentiviral construct carrying the TlpA RFP membrane associated construct were assayed by confocal microscopy. Cells were imaged at 37 \u00b0C, elevated to 42 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, and returned to 37 \u00b0C, at which point they were imaged every 15 minutes. Error bars represent \u00b1 s.e.m . 143 Supplementary Figure 4 -S14: Confocal imaging of K562 cell line transduced with the lentiviral construct depicted in Supplementary Figure 4-S11.

In addition to their demonstrated ability to effect transcriptional control in response to both endogenous and ex ogenous thermal perturbations for cell therapy applications1, they may also be utilized in industrial settings such as bacterial ghost production for vaccine development2 and regulation of large -scale protein product ion3. The development of TlpA as a modular thermal bioswitch, as described in Chapter 4, enables a plethora of novel applications such as noninvasive control of protein function in living animals or potentially in cell-based human therapeutics . To realize this potential, TlpA -mediated thermal regulation must progress beyond proof -of-concept control of protein localization and demonstrate the ability to robustly modulate protein activity. Biological systems for controlling protein -protein interactions via non -thermal mechanisms have b een developed and may serve as templates for the expansion of the TlpA -controllable repertoire. Among the most famous of these strategies is the FKBP -based chemically inducible dimerization (CID) system developed by Crabtree and colleagues , which confers stable dimerization in the presence of the drug Rapamycin or derivatives thereof4. 148 Subsequently, orthogonal CID systems based on ligands such as S -(+)-abscisic acid (ABA)5 and a gibberellin derivative6 have been developed. Recently , an antibody -based system for CID aimed at supporting cell therapy applications was introduced and may prove less immunogenic than previous technologies based on foreign proteins7. The broad implementation of CID for elucidating the behavior of biomolecules8 has inspired optogenetic analogues such as the protein domain pairs Phy/PIF9, FKF1/GI10, and pMag/nMag11, which combine the inducibility of their chemical predecessors with novel spatial and temporal axes of control. The wealth of previous work demonstrating the potential of inducible dimerization provides a roadmap along which the development of thermo - controllable dimerization agents can pro ceed. A variety of preliminary experiments have been conducted which may provide valuable insight for future TlpA engineering efforts. 5.2: Potential Approaches to High Resolution Structural D etermination of TlpA While previous work has suggested that TlpA consists of a globular N -terminal DNA binding domain and an elongated C -terminal coiled -coil12,13, neither the atomic -resolution structure of the protein nor the mechanism for its uniquely sharp melting profile has been elucidated. Biological structure is intimately linked to func tion14; a detailed understanding of the atomic arrangement of Tlp A may assist in both the determination of its enhanced switching profile relative to structurally similar proteins such as tropomysin15,16, and also in the design of novel fusion proteins or orthogonally -dimerizing variants for multiplexed control. 149 The three main methods of biological structure determination are Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structure determination is unique in its ability to sample proteins in thei r native aqueous environment19. However, the method is hampered by similarity i n local chemical environments leading to chemical shift degeneracy in the spectra20, which imposes a 30 -50 kDa limit to the size of protein complexes amenable to this analysis. The TlpA dimer, consisting of two 41.5 kDa monomers, may be beyond the reach of this technique, particularly since the helical repeat structure of the coiled -coil results in high structural similarity along the length of the coil, further compressing the range of chemical environments and blending chemical shifts21. Cryo -EM, while reliant on flash freezing, also produces st ructures in a more native -like environment than crystallography. However, this method depends on imaging thousands of representative particles and averaging them to reconstruct an accurate high -resolution model. Previ ous low -resolution transmission electro n microscopy images suggest that the length of TlpA may impart some conformational flexibility and that high expression of the protein may lead to packing into randomly arranged superstructures22, both of which may impede reference averaging. A recent advance in Cryo -EM is the use of auxiliary scaffolding molecules to stabilize proteins structures while acting as fiducial markers for averaging, thereby enabling resolution of proteins which are too small to discern in isolation23-25. This methodology can be combined with the well -established capability of EM to visualize DNA origami superstructures26; in fact, intrinsically -disordered proteins of the nuclear pore have been characterized using this methodology, albeit at low resolution27. It is tempting to 150 imagine a DNA nanostructure containing the TlpA operator/promoter sequence implemented as a scaffold to stabilize protein conformation and enable EM-based structural chara cterization. Furthermore , if another DNA -binding domain can be attached to the C - terminus of TlpA, the protein could be stretched in an extended conformation inside of the DNA cage, thereby minimizing particle -to-particle structural variation. The mainstay of structural biology to date has been X -ray crystallography. This method utilizes chemical perturbations administered in an empirically optimized fashion to generate proteinaceous crystals, the diffraction of which can be reconstructed into a n electron density model. Crystallography can generate atomic resolution models of large proteins; notable solved structures include a 45 nm bundle consisting of 200 -residue -helix . The crystallization poorly and optimization varies on a prot ein-to- protein basis32. We have previously attempted to crystallize full length TlpA1-371 and a truncated portion predicted to correspond to the coiled coil (TlpA69-292) but all crystallization conditions from four 96 -well screening plates (Hampton Research) produced non -crystalline aggregates. Challenges to crystallization included maintainin g solubility at the requisite 10 mg/mL concentration, separation of the 80 kDa TlpA dimer from a 70 kDa contaminant protein which co -eluted with the desired product after histidine affinity purification , and 151 relatively low expression of the protein in solu ble form (on the order of 1 mg per L of culture) . A more focused structural study may employ tandem affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography to obtain crystallographically pure samples of TlpA, and may also screen buffer conditions similar to those that enabled the previous determination of large alpha -helical proteins. Another potential strategy is fragment -based reconstruction in which the full length protein could be subdivided into smaller, potentially more soluble components. Finally, a DNA segment corresponding to the TlpA operator/promoter may bind to and stabilize the protein to enable crystallization33. 5.3: Structural Inferences from B ioinformatics In lieu of an atomic resolution structure, engineering efforts must be guided by bioinformatics and biochemical prediction. The current model of TlpA structure is guided by manual alignment of the primary amino acid sequence of the C -terminal domain with t hat of a prototypical coiled -coil heptad repeat motif12, homology -based spectroscopy suggesting high alpha -helical content12,13,34, and the success of the rational introduction of heterodimerizing mut ations informed by these predictions (Chapter 4). While these techniques hint at the general structural features of TlpA, they fail in two key respects. First, they do not provide insight into the mechanism of unique switching sharpness demonstrated by Tlp A. Next, they fail to predict suitable locations for modification and functionalization of the protein. 152 The overall structure of TlpA is predicted to consist of an N -terminal globular domain followed by a C -terminal coiled coil, as predicted by manual an notation12 and by three different software prediction packages. The linear structural prediction is summarized in Fig. 5-1, which aligns the secondary structure prediction assigned to TlpA by the software Jpred435 with the coiled -coil annotations ascribed by COILS36, PairCoil237, and LOGICOIL38, and also the manual annotation reported in the original publication by Koski et al12. It is evident that , while the C -terminal portion of the protein has a characteristic coiled - coil sequence as evidence d by its homology -based annotation , the per-residue register of the protein is not fully consistent with classical coiled -coil structure. The annotations from all three prediction servers demonstrate truncated heptad repeats and skips, which may indicate either failure of the homology -based algorithms to pr edict the possibility of the given residues at their respective positions in the coiled -coil structure, or deviations from the coiled -coil motif in the real protein structure. Such aberrations are interesting because they may influence the unique temperatu re-sensing abilities of TlpA . Previous studies have implicated breaks in predicted coiled -coil structure in influencing stability39 or having other functional consequences such as bind ing of accessory proteins40. Understanding the fine details of the local structure at these positions is likely to aid in the elucidation of the thermo - sensing mechanism of this protein. 153 Figure 5-1: Sequence prediction annotation of TlpA. The primary sequence of TlpA is annotated by its predicted secondary structure (Jpred4, top) or for its predicted conformity to the characteristic heptad repeat pattern as described by the homology -based prediction software COILS, PairCoil2, and LOGICOIL, and as described in the init ial report of the TlpA gene. In the Jpred4 prediction, brown segments indicate unstructured regions and purple blocks represent -helices. In the coiled - coil predictions, the initial blue segments denote the N -terminal domain annotations and alternating yellow and green segments denote full heptad repeats. Orange and beige segments indicate regions which are predicted to be in a coiled -coil conformation but do not span for an entire heptad, indicating a shift in register. Red segments indicate predicted int erruptions in the coiled -coil motif. The initial discovery of TlpA was motivated in part by its sequence similarity to Tropomyosins (Tpm)s , which are elongated coiled -coil proteins (Fig. 5-2a) that regulate muscular contractions41. The sequence identity between TlpA and tropomyosins from various species ranges f rom 15.5 - 20.2%12 and is clustered into three regions ( Fig. 5-2b). While the sequence identity with TlpA is low even inside these clusters ( Supplementary Fig. 5-S1), it is likely that the general struct ural heuristics of Tpm - that of an approximately 40 nm elongated parallel dimeric coiled -coil - are preserved in the TlpA protein. Both TlpA and Tropomyosin display relatively cooperative thermal unfolding compa red to shorter leucine zippers, -dependent increase in coiled -coil folding cooperativity coincides with simulations predicting as such to a plateau of approximately 50 residues43, a boundary between the lengths of Fos/Jun and the long TlpA and Tpm proteins. Nevertheless, the switching sharpness of TlpA is able to accommodate the transition between homeostatic temperature and mild hyperthermia (37 \u00b0C to 42 \u00b0C) wher eas Tpm would be hard -pressed to unfold within this range , indicating that a structural feature unique to TlpA confers such cooperativity of unfolding. It is tempting to speculate that the break in predicted coiled -coil helical structure between two \"coil islands\" predicted al, Jpred4, and COILS ( Fig. 5-1) may enhance thermo -sensitivity, although these 154 predictions assign the interruptions to different positions within the primary sequence and as such are difficult to draw conclusions from . Inter estingly, both TlpA and Tpm contain a singly cysteine residue which is known to be at the strand -strand interface , either from redox sensing44 and tropomyosin is known to be oxidized due to ROS formation upon myocardial infarction45, which may inhibit its function in the sarcomere. While the function of the TlpA protein in its native context is unknown, and it is dispensable for the infectivity of the bacterium that carries it46, the location o f the tlpA gene in the virulence plasmid of Salmonella suggests a functional role in the host -pathogen interaction. It is known that Salmonella encounters an oxidative burst during macrophage uptake47,48, suggesting a possible dual role for the protein in temperature and redox sensing. Previous work tra cking TlpA auto -regulation demonstrated increased TlpA expression at 37 \u00b0C relative to 26 \u00b0C, and no increase in TlpA levels between 37 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C + 100 \u00b5M H 2O2, but did not assay for expression at 26 \u00b0C + 155 H2O2 to determine if oxidative stress may sensit ize the protein to de -repress its cognate promoter at a lower thermal threshold46. Figure 5-2: Structural similarity of TlpA to Tropomyosin. a) The crystal structure of an - Tropomyosin dimer, a 284 residue 41 nm coiled -coil protein with relatively high homology to the TlpA coiled -coil domain (PDB 1C1G) . b) Alignment of the TlpA protein sequence with that of - Tropomyosin via the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). 5.4: Functional Inferences from B ioinformatics The tlpA gene is found in the pSLT virulence plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium46. Previous characterization has demonstrated that the protein may be secreted by the bacterium via mechanisms other than direct cell -lysis, but it does not escape from endosomes into the host cytoplasm and as such this secretion may not be functionally relevant. Deletion of tlpA does not impact the infectivity or distribution of Salmonella during infec tion BALB/C murine hosts. It should be noted that this study did not measure the temperature of the mice after infection , and even direct LPS injection can produce only mild febrile response in BALB/C 156 mice49, and that the thermal response is age -dependent50. As such, this result may not generalize to other scenarios of infection . However, the study did demonstrate TlpA activat ion upon transition from the external environment (26 \u00b0C) to host temperature (37 \u00b0C) in vitro , suggesting a functional role in this event. This thermal regime is lower than the biotechnological role for whi ch we developed TlpA (sensation of hyperthermia above mammalian core temperature). This discrepancy may be explained by the low copy number of the pSLT virulence plasmid (1 -2 plasmids per cell) compared to the >100 copy number of the ColE1 -based plasmids u tilized in our studies, in conjunction with the known concentration -dependence of the TlpA dissociation threshold34. Functional studies of TlpA have focused on its published role in auto -regulation via the 5' - 3' promoter activity of the sequence directly upstream of the tlpA gene34 (the TlpA operator/promoter). While TlpA auto -regulat ion certainly impacts the transcriptional set point of its own expression level, the fact that TlpA has not been deleted from the virulence plasmid suggest s that it has an important functional role benefiting the bacteria, likely via additional TlpA -regula ted components. One possibility is that TlpA binds to other cognate operator sequences within the virulence plasmid or in the bacterial chromosome; however, we were unable to find homologous sequences in either DNA molecule using BLAST alignment51. Another option is polycistronic regulation of one or more genes downstream of the TlpA repressor. We have demonstrated regulation in this fashion (see pThermeleon, Chapter 3). W e have not performed experimental gene expression analysis of virulence plasmid -associated genes during infection , but the native context of TlpA positions the repre ssor upstream of another coding sequence in a manner which may enable polycistronic 157 regulation ( Fig. 5-3). While the sequence between tlpA and the downstream ORF has not been annotated, we note that it contains an A/T -rich element ( ATAAT) approximately 30 bp upstream of its start codon (roughly the same as the spacing between the TlpA promoter and the tlpA initiati ng methionine), implying that this UTR may itself function as a promoter. The downstream gene has high homology to YacC, a poorly -characterized p eriplasmic protein with unknown relevance to virulence52. Differential gene expression analysis of this YacC homologue upon heat shock can determine if the upstream TlpA regulates it in a polycistronic fashion. An alternative and intriguing possibility for the role of the TlpA system stems from our discovery that TlpA can function as a bidirectional promoter ( Chapter 3, Fig. 3-S2). The reverse -complemented sequence upstream of the TlpA promoter contains an open reading frame in the correct or ientation to be transcribed by reverse activity of the TlpA promoter ( Fig. 5-3). Excitingly, the protein sequence of this gene bears high homology to YadA, an adhesin which serves as an essential virulence factor in several strains of Yersinia53. Future work may expand on the role of TlpA in regulating Salmonella infectivity, and particularly its putative function as a regulator of the native yadA homologue. Figure 5-3: Endogenous sequence context of TlpA. Local sequence of the tlpA locus - 41,287). 158 5.5: from Structural and Functional Activity A ssays The TlpA -based platform for controlling gene expression, described in Chapter 3, can be utilized as a tool to investigate the functional outcomes of modifications to the TlpA repressor. While the requirement for an intact DNA binding domain limits the scope or perturbations accessible at the N -terminus of the protein, internal and C -terminal modifications may be freely examined. Compari son of reporter gene activation between circuits carrying the wild type tlpA gene and its derivatives can inform the role of some struc tural features, as well as the tolerance of the protein to modification at particular locations. Analysis of deletions at the C -terminus demonstrates that, surprisingly, TlpA is highly sensitive to even small truncations in this region. Fig. 5-4a shows that even a 13 residue truncation, predicted by Koski et al to be outside of the coiled -coil region12, greatly disrupts repression and cooperative dissociation of the repressor. The sensitivity of the TlpA C - terminus to modificati on is corroborated in Fig. 5-4b and 5-4c, in which fusion of the anionic triplet Asp -Glu-Asp (DED) or a strongly cationic sequence (SV40 NLS) also result s in disruption of activity. The addition of a short SLGSGS linker partially alleviates disruption, suggesting that proximity to the C -terminus is a factor in destabilization ( Fig. 5-4c). This impediment of functionality is likely due to Coulombic repulsion between the like -charged residues symmetrically apposed between the two strands; partial charge ne utralization via fusion of the cationic NLS sequence to the anionic DED motif alleviates the disruptive effect and even appears to stabilize the complex, possibly via charge cross -complementation (Fig. 159 5-4d). To examine the possibility of fusing protein do mains to the TlpA C -terminus without inhibiting its function , we opted to screen hexahistidine tags as mild disruptive elements separated from the C-terminal residue of TlpA by a panel of flexible linkers ( Fig. 5-4e). Three and five -residue linkers did not confer any st abilization over the no -linker condition. The f ifteen -mer linker did alleviate destabilization at temperatures above 34.1 \u00b0C but appeared slightly de -repressed compared to unmodified TlpA at lower temperatures. In contrast, the 25 -residue lin ker alleviated the disruptive effect of the His 6 tag at all temperatures tested. The L25 linker permits TlpA to tolerate the presence of a larger and more sterically hindered domain, the 40 kDa globular protein MBP ( Fig. 5-4f). Similarly, while shorter linkers are unable to restore cooperative activation to C-terminal fusions the SV40 NLS ( Fig. 5-4g), the L25 linker restores tolerance for this modification, which even confers additional stability through an unexplored mecha nism ( Fig. 5-4h). The a79 NLS54, which contains fewer charged residues, is also tolerated with the L25 linker but not with a shorter spacing region ( Fig. 5-4i). Moving forward, a 25 -residue flexible linker should be the default choice for fusing novel protein domains to the TlpA C -terminus when the application permits such an extended configura tion. 160 Figure 5-4: Tolerance of TlpA to Structural Perturbations. a) Thermal gene expression of bacteria carrying the standard TlpA -gated GFP expression reporter plasmid reporter in Chapter 3. The wild type TlpA demonstrates cooperative unbinding at a critical temperature centered around 44 \u00b0C as described previously, while truncations of the C -terminal 13, 63, or 150 residues (corresponding to the Koski et al annotations of the unstructured tail, third coiled -coil segment, and large inter -coil interruption, respectively). All truncations result in repressors displaying poor repression and non -cooperative thermal transitions. b) Fusion of TlpA to an Asp -Glu-Asp sequence at its C -terminus significantly inhibits the ability of the protein to repress its cognate promoter. c) Fusion of TlpA the SV40 NLS (PKKKRKV), either directly at the C -terminus or spaced by a short SLGSGS linker, promotes transcriptional leakage and abrogates the cooperativity of TlpA unfolding. d) Addition of an acidic Asp -Glu-Asp sequence to the TlpA -SLGSGS -NLS construct, separated from the NLS by a Gly -Ser liner, appears to stabilize TlpA repression, perhaps via associating with the basic charges on the partner TlpA strand. e) Thermal expression p rofile of TlpA variants with C -terminal His 6 tags spaced fused directly at the C -terminus or with linkers GGS short linkers result in tag - induced inhibition of promoter repression, the L15 linker s tabilizes the dimer at temperatures above 34.1 \u00b0C and the L25 linker stabilizes the tag at all temperatures. f) Thermal expression profile of TlpA compared to a variant with the large globular protein MBP fused at the C -terminus via the (GGGGS) 5 linker rev eals no significant alteration in repression. g) TlpA variants fused to the SV40 NLS at the C -terminus, spaced by intermediate -length flexible linkers (GGGGS) 2 or (GGGGS) 3 or with the rigid -helical linker (EAAAK) 2. The intermediate linkers are unable to rescue TlpA repression and cooperativity. h) Thermal expression profile of wild type TlpA compared to variants with the SV40 NLS fused at the C -terminus via a GGGGS or (GGGGS) 5 linker. The long flexible linker is able to tolerize the TlpA protein to the p resence of the cationic NLS. i) Fusion of the alternative NLS a79 to the C -terminus of TlpA is disruptive when spaced by a SLGSGS but cooperativity and repression is recovered when separated by the L25 linker. Note that panels b, c, d, g, h, and i utilize an alternative circuit construction in which a T7 promoter is positioned 5' to the TlpA operator/promoter. All plots represent the mean of N = 3 +/ - SEM. 161 In contrast to the C -terminus, N -terminal analysis of TlpA is difficult via a transcriptional readout due to the required presence of the DN A binding domain in this region . Previous analysis by Hurme et al13 demonstrated via gel shift that internal deletions in the non -coiled - coil N -terminal domain (TlpA 31 -43 and 61 -43) result in loss of DNA binding whereas, surprisin gly, the 165 -320 mutant retained DNA binding (although temperature -dependence was not tested). We tested if the protein is able to accommodate the charged SV40 NLS as an insert between the putative DNA binding domain (residues 1 -68) and the coiled -coil domain (residues 69 -371) and found that this modification was not tolerated ( Fig. 5-5a). Surprisingly, c ircular dichroism spectroscopy analysis of the TlpA coiled coil domain demonstrated that while fusion of a DED tag to the C -terminus destabilizes the prot ein, such modification of the N -terminus is much better tolerated ( Fig. 5-5b). Notably, the thermal transition of the C -terminally -tagged variant remains switch -like, albeit with a loss of cooperativity. This suggests that the genetic repression assay may suffer from a minimal threshold of binding ability below which the protein fails to activate in a switch -like manner regardless of the behavior of its coiled -coil domain. Additionally, the near -wild type melting profile of the N -terminally DED -tagged coile d-coil domain suggests that the junction between the DNA binding domain and the coiled -coil domain strongly influences the ability of the protein to repress its promoter and that this geometry , rather than the thermostability of the cold -coil, may be disru pted in the N -terminal NLS fusion shown in Fig. 5-5a. To further investigate the effects of N -terminal modification , we swapped the DNA binding domain of TlpA for that of the Tet repressor, another dimerization -dependent DNA binding protein, and assayed it s ability to repress the cognate TetR promoter. We fused the TetR DBD at various points within the N -terminal domain of TlpA ( Fig. 5-5c). All variants 162 generated a similar reporter gene expression curve regardless of the fusion site chosen. Comparison of on e variant to a repressor consisting of only the TetR DNA binding domain with no dedicated dimerization domain (Fig. 5-5d) also showed a similar curve, suggesting that fusion of TlpA provides no stabilization beyond the endogenous propensity of the TetR DBD to dimerize at high concentrations. The DNA specificity of coiled -coil DNA -binding proteins has previously been redirected via fusion of the cI DBD to the constitutive coiled - coil GCN455. However, in our bacterial thermal transcriptional assay, constructs with cI DBD -TlpA fusion repressors (and also the cI DBD -GCN4 control) demonstrated no fluorescence above background at any temperature (Fig. 5-5e). It should be noted that, in contrast to its use in the literature to gate expression from the lambda P R promoter56, we utilized these constr ucts in the context of the pTcI -Wasabi backbone (Chapter 3) in which expression is driven by the strong P R/PL hybrid promoter. Unlike in the case of the isolated PR, we are unable to clone a stable P R/PL-containing plasmid in the absence of a repressor, suggesting that the strong expression from this promoter represents a significant metabolic burden and selects for deletion variants. While the Sanger sequencing chromatograms of the TlpA and GCN4 cI -DBD fusion variants did not indicate any deletions or muta tions in the promoter, reporter gene, or repressor, it cannot be ruled out that such an alteration occurred during the course of expression. Moving the chimeric cI/TlpA fusion genes into the literature -reported vector may represent a viable approach to assaying the effects of N - terminal TlpA m odifications and mapping this boundary of the TlpA coiled -coil domain. 163 Figure 5-5: N-terminal modification of TlpA. a) Thermal gene expression profile of a TlpA promoter -gated GFP in the presence of wild type TlpA or a variant in which the SV40 NLS is inserted between the putative DNA binding domain and coiled -coil domains (C -terminal to residue 68). b) Circular dichrois m melting plots tracking ellipticity at 222 nm of the putative TlpA c oiled - coil domain (residues 69 -359) and variants with the cationic Asp -Glu-Asp tag fused at the N or C - terminus. c) Thermal gene expression profiles of a tetA promoter -gated GFP in the pr esence of chimeric proteins consisting of the TetR DNA binding domain (residues 1 -127) fused to TlpA at the indicated positions, spaced by a Gly -Thr linker. d) Thermal gene expression profile of ptetA - GFP gated by the TetR -TlpA chimera fused as position 8 within t he TlpA DNA binding domain, or by the TetR DNA binding domain in isolation. e) Thermal gene expression profile of GFP driven by the tandem pR/pL promoter gated by TcI or a panel of cI DNA binding domain fusions to TlpA variants or to the GCN4 coile d-coil. All gene expression plots represent the mean of N = 3 +/ - SEM. 164 Internal modifications within the TlpA coiled -coil also impact its function. One of the most interesting residues in the protein is its single cysteine, C318, which is predicted to reside at the strand -to-strand interface between TlpA monomers and, as shown in Chapter 4, can be oxidized to form a disulfide. CD Spectroscopic analysis shows that mutation of thi s residue to a serine destabilizes the coiled -coil, resulting in a lower T m and a broader transition (Fig. 5-6a). Correspondingly, installment of this mutation into the reporter gene regulator circuit results in a significant downshift of the thermal trans ition ( Fig. 5-6b). Interestingly, mutating this residue to an alanine, which lacks the terminal sulfhydryl or hydroxyl group, results in an intermediate phenotype, suggesting that while the serine hydroxyls may provide a steric clash leading to destabiliza tion, the sulfhydryl s of the cysteine pair may have a stabilizing effect. This stabilization could be due either to disulfide bond formation57 or from enhanced van der Waals packing58 of this residue. The lack of a significant crosslinked population in the absence of CuCl 2 (Chapter 4) suggests that, at least in vitro , the latter effect is dominant. Introduction of oxidants or reductants into the bacterial media during heat shock may elucidate the influence of redox sensing by C318 in vivo . Other interesting phenotypes can be observed using circular dichroism spectroscopy or in situ control of gene expression. Several residues including glutamate tend to be over -represented at the N -termini of alpha helices and act to stabilize the fold59; as such, we investigated if E67, falling just anterior to our annotation of the coiled -coil domain, could influence cooperative unbinding. Fig. 5-6c demonstrates little difference in the melting curves of our putative coiled -coil domain fragment (TlpA 69-359) and the same protein with an N -terminal V 66E67V68 triplet derived from the preceding N -terminal domain. However, this approach may be useful for future investi gation; other residues such as p roline are also enriched near the N -termini of helices 165 and the stretch of TlpA 60-65 contains two proline residues; comparative stability analysis of fragments containing one or both of these residues may aid in elucidation of the N -terminal helix cap (and thus a suitable fusion point at the N -terminus of the coiled -coil). Figure 5-6C also shows that a sub -fragment of the coiled -coil domain truncated anterior to the interruption predicted by the COILS server (see Fig. 5-1) maintains its ability to unfold cooperatively, albeit at a lower thermal threshold and with weaker cooperativity than its intact counterpart . This fragment may be amenable to stabilization via random mutagenesis and selection (Chapter 3) for use as a fusion tag, wherein its shorter length relative to the wild type TlpA may confer advantages such as conforming to viral packaging limits and decreasing the probability of inducing a penalty to protein folding or expression. The weaker cooperativity of the fragment would also need to be repaired. As demonstrated in Fig. 3-2B, error -prone PCR variants of TlpA display a range of switching sharpness phenotypes, suggesting that this property is, like the T m, amenable to optimization. Furthermore, a small s ub-screen of alanine mutants targeting histidine residues predicted by COILS to pack into the strand - strand interface ( Fig. 5-6d) revealed variant H254A, which demonstrated activation over an apparent span of only 1.5 \u00b0C. It would be interesting to determine if installment of this mutation into the truncated TlpA 69-276 fragment could counteract its apparent length - dependent penalty to switching sharpness. Much work remains to be done in elucidating the sequence determinant s of TlpA behavior using rational truncations and mutagenesis. However, without structural data to guide engineering, such information will be invaluable in generating well -behaving TlpA fusions and even the limited scope of the work performed thus far has yielded useful variants for future applications. 166 Figure 5-6: Internal modifications of TlpA a) Circular dichroism melting plots tracking ellipticity at 222 nm of the wild type TlpA coiled -coil fragment (residues 69 -359) or a variant with the C318S mutation. b) Thermal gene expression profile of GFP driven by the pTlpA promoter in the presence of TlpA 39 or C318 mutants to alanine or cysteine. c) Circular dichroism melting plots track ing ellipticity at 222 nm of the TlpA coiled -coil fragment or structural derivatives VEV -TlpA CCD (TlpA residues 66 -359) and the TlpA 69-276 variant corresponding to the sequence N -terminal to the large coiled -coil interruption predicted by Koski et al. d) Thermal gene expression profiles of pTlpA -driven GFP gated by wild type TlpA or core histidine mutants H201A and H254A. Note the unusually sharp transition displayed by the H254A variant. All gene expression plots represent the mean of N = 3 +/ - SEM. 5.6: Local Structural Deformation and Activity M odulation Many of the potential applications for TlpA as a modular bioswitch rely on the ability to fuse one or more proteins of interest to the coiled -coil dimer. To effectively realize this strategy it is important to understand the dynamics of the fusion points; i.e. the behavior of the N or C-termini of the TlpA strands. Coiled -coil denaturation often initiates via \"fraying\" from the ends of the molecule60, indicating that local pe rturbations in these regions precede s global conformational shifts. This local variation in melting threshold has implications for designing 167 functional protein fusions to TlpA ; for example, co -positioning of an enzyme with a corresponding inhibitor will be dependent on the thermal stability of its terminus of fusion rather than on the overall stability of the TlpA dimer or of the other terminus roughly 40 nm distant ( Fig. 5-7a). Modifications to the termini of the coiled -coil, such as installation of residues that effectively cap the electric d ipoles of the helices, may mitigate the fraying effect61. The methods described in the preceding section , while useful in assaying the overall behavior of the thermoswitch, are unable to provide information on about this specific aspect of denaturation . Circular dichroism spectroscopy reports on the overall -helical content of the protein but cannot differentiate between local transitions at the termini vs. internal locations. The shallow linear increase in ellipticity with rising temperature that occurs prior to the main melting transition of coiled -coils is thought to result from fraying at the ter mini62, but the technique cannot pinpoint the location at which this fraying occurs. In contrast to CD spectroscopy, the in vivo assay for TlpA -mediated transcriptional control is intrinsically dependent on the local stability of TlpA at the N -terminus; however, the dime r-stabilizing effects of DNA binding63 are likely to mask local fraying (and may account for the lower pre-transition slope demonstrated by the pTlpA -Wasabi circuit and its derivatives relative to the CD spectrum of the purified TlpA protein). While a protein -ligand fusion will provide its own energetic stabilization to the complex if the k D of the pair is measurable , the relative G of this association may not match that of DNA -DBD binding and as such it would be useful to understand the dynamics of the coiled -coil terminus in isolation. We have investigated several proximity -based optical approaches such as Forste r Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)64, Proximity Imaging for determining the effects of local thermal perturbations to the TlpA structure. We first investigated the use of chemical fluorophores conjugated to the N -terminus of the TlpA coiled -coil. We utilized an N -terminal cysteine fusion to the putative coiled -coil fragment (Met -Cys-TlpA 69-359) and functionalized it one of two maleimide -conjugated Alexa fluoresc ent dyes containing the spectral overlap necessary for FRET to occur . We reasoned that the internal C318 of TlpA is packed into the interface and would therefore be inaccessible for dye labeling, granting selective tracking of the labeled N -terminus. To correct for thermal effects on the dye itself we employed the method of Sacc\u00e0 et al68, tracking emission intensity of the donor in the presence or absence of the acceptor. Using this approach, we computed the curve shown in Fig. 5-7b, which demonstrates a characteristic melting sigmoid with a slightly broader transition and lower T m than t he bulk melting profile observed by CD spectroscopy in Fig. 5-5b. While it is tempting to draw conclusions about the fraying behavior of the N -terminus from this data, further validation must be performed to assess potential technical challenges . One such challenge is in understanding the cause of sample -to-sample variation. In Fig. 5-7c, the FRET ratio is computed via the Sacc\u00e0 method from pairwise comparison of two wells containing donor -labeled TlpA and two wells containing a mix of donor and acceptor -labeled strands. The two different donor wells produce curves of varying switching sharpness , and it will be important to investigate possible causes of this variability , such as protein denaturation or aggregation, differential labeling efficiency, or potentially partial labeling of the internal cysteine. The latter issue may be circumvented by capitalizing on the single tryptophan residue present in the TlpA N - terminal domain at position 46, which can be directly utilized as a chemical handle via a 169 recently developed selective coupling reaction69 or replaced with an azide -containing derivative for facile click labeling70. A further complexity, shown in Fig. 5-7d, is that despite producing similar curves after normalization, the raw FRET values are quite different between the four possible cross -pairings between two replicates. These difference s could also be caused by the aforementioned factors but must be accounted for prior to drawing conclusions for this assay. A further complexity is the potential for thermal effects on dye fluorescence, and therefore on the FRET ratio itself. While the Sacc\u00e0 FRET formula accounts for dye-specific changes in intensity by background subtracting the signal from a reference donor fluo rophore in the absence of the acceptor, temperature -induced changes to dye fluorescence may influence spectral overlap and the corresponding FRET efficiency . Therefore, dyes should be selected to minimize thermal effects. As shown in Figure 5-7E, both the Alexa 546 donor and the Alexa 594 acceptor demonstr ate changes in signal intensity upon thermal cycling. While Alexa 594 is relatively stable, displaying a 7% change in signal over four cycles between 25 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C and a 3.5% change within a single cycle, the Alexa 546 molecule shows a drastic 28% signal increase over the full experiment (9% within a single cycle). Both dyes show a characteristic drop in si gnal intensity as temperature increases followed by a return to a higher baseline upon cooling, resulting in overall signal growth over multiple temperature cycles. Importantly, the FRET ratio for free dye molecules shows no sign of a cooperative transitio n as a function of temperature ( Fig. 5-7f) and has a smaller magnitude than the protein FRET signal at the same molecular concentration , suggesting that the transition observed with the dye -labeled protein is indeed induced by a conformational change . 170 Figure 5-7: Fluorescence characterization of denaturation at TlpA terminus. a) Schematic of possible interpretations of the pre -transition increase in elipticity observed in circular dichroism analysis of TlpA denaturation. This increase can correspond to i: a mixed population of fully coiled dimers and fully uncoiled monomers , ii: partial uncoiling of at one terminus, which could potentially impact the dimerization of a locally fused protein, iii: partial uncoiling of TlpA at a terminus distal to a potential fusion protein which would not be impacted by the local denaturation. b) FRET melting curve computed according to the method of Sacc\u00e0 et al for the TlpA coiled coil fragment with a cysteine residue ins erted at position 2 and fused to Alexa 546 or Alexa 594 - maleimide conjugates.

As previously reported in the literature, we observed that the melting temperature of TlpA is concentration dependent ( Fig. 5-8a) and shifts by nearly 3 \u00b0C above 1 M ( Fig. 5-8b). While the strength of tlpA gene expression governs the protein concentration at a bulk level, cell - to-cell variability in protein level can be significant especially for systems without feedback inhibition71. To begin address ing this concern, we have investigated the possibility of generating covalent TlpA dimer fusions such that, regardless of the absolute pr otein 171 concentration in solution, local TlpA strand concentration could not fall below a minimum set by the linker length. Because the TlpA coiled -coil dimerizes in parallel orientation, a linker between the C -terminus of one strand and the N -terminus of it s partner would need to span the predicted 30 -40 nm length of the protein. Such a linker may be difficult to clone and would waste a significant amount of sequence space in a viral vector. Instead, we investigated the possibility of harnessing the SpyCatch er/SpyTag system for generating covalent isopeptide bonds spont aneously between two separately expressed proteins72. Structural modeling of a coiled -coil fused to the SpyCatcher domain predicted that the linker between the partner strand and its cognate SpyTag would need to span approximately 13 \u00c5ngstroms (Fig. 5-8c). We therefore constructe d a variant of TlpA fused at the C -terminus to SpyCatcher and also built partner variants in which the TlpA is separated from the SpyTag moiety by Gly 3, Gly 5, and Gly 7 linkers. We found that the resulting constructs produced soluble proteins and that isopeptide bond formation occurred freely for all three variants ( Fig. 5-8d). Unfortunately, the strong -sheet component of the SpyCatcher domain interferes with circular dichroism analysis of the resulting constructs. Future investigation may be perform ed using TlpA -gated gene expression analysis, wherein the TlpA may be driven by a weak inducible promoter in a non -feedback configuration to determine its ability to repress its cognate promoter at increasingly low protein copy numbers. 172 Figure 5 -8: Conce ntration -dependence of TlpA Dissociation. curves of the TlpA coiled -coil fragment at 10 M and 1 M concentration.

Reaching this objective will require robust demonstration that TlpA is functional as a fusion to a variety of protein 173 domains including signaling proteins and enzymes. To date, the ability to fuse TlpA to proteins of interest has been hampered by a lack of concrete structural data. In the absence of an atomic resolution structure or firm evidence for the boundari es of the coiled -coil domain, TlpA domain fusions must begin from one or several educated inferences regarding the optimal junction site. High -resolution structures generated via X -ray crystallography or electron microscopy, in addition to fine ncation and using native transcriptional modulation in bacteria , may en able the production of functional and robust TlpA fusion proteins. Thermal control remains the most accessible method to modulate biological function noninvasively and at depth within large animal models and in human patients (see Chapter 2). The lack of synthetic biology tools to confer temperature -responsive behavior to arbitrary proteins of interest greatly limits the range of ap plications available to this technology both in fundamental research and in the clinic. In prokaryotes, the TlpA and TcI thermal bioswitches have enabled ultrasound and fever -responsive transcription (Chapter 3) . In the future , this technology may enable physicians to activate microbial therapeutics in a \"point and click\" fashion to increase the safety and efficacy of these treatments . In mammalian cells , such control is currently limited to heat shock promoters, which suffer from crosstalk with non-thermal stress pathways and a lack of temperature tunability . The advances described herein in using TlpA as a modular thermal bioswitch to control protein -protein interactions (Chapter 4) demonstrate the feasibility of imparting a novel, noninvasive control axis to any number of biological pathways of interest. Control of sub -cellular localization or inducible association with biological inhibitors of function can enable biomodulation in arbitrary cell 174 types, including in mammalian cells, on timescales of seconds or minutes. In the future, functional analysis of TlpA variants using platforms such as those discussed in this chapter can inform the design of bioactive protein -TlpA chimeras for scientific and clinical applications. We expect that our prototype TlpA -based bioswitch will serve as the foundation of a widespread method to utilize ultrasound -based or physiological hyperthermia as a new and important method to study biological processes, and potentially to enable the development of safer biological therapies . 5.9: Methods Plasmid Construction and Molecular Biology Plasmids were designed using SnapGene (GSL Biotech) and assembled via KLD mutagenes, Gibson Assembly, or restriction/ligation using enzymes from New England Biolabs. All plasmids and sequences wil l be uploaded as a supplemental file. After assembly, constructs were transformed into NEB Turbo, NEB10, or NEB Stable E. coli (New England Biolabs) for growth and plasmid preparation. Thermal gene expression assays were performed in NEB10. Fluorescent r eporters and transcription repression genes and circuits were obtained from our previous work1. Thermal Regulation Assay Determination of temperature -dependent gene expression was performed as described previously1. Saturated precultures were diluted to OD 600 = 0.1 and propagated at 30 \u00b0C until reaching OD 600 = 0.3 as measured via Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific). 25 uL aliquots were dispensed into PCR tubes with transparent caps (Bio -Rad) and incubated for 12 hours 175 in a thermal gradient using a Bio -Rad C1000 Touch thermocycler. After thermal stimulus, fluorescence was measured using a Stratagene MX3005p qPCR (Agilent), after which cultures were diluted 4x, transferred into m icroplates (Costar black / clear bottom), and measured for OD 600 using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 plate reader. The background -corrected F/OD is reported as described previously1. Protein Ex pression pET26b -based expression constructs were transformed into BL21 -DE3 E. coli and grown on kanamycin -selective plates. Saturated overnight cultures were diluted 1 mL into 400 mL expression cultures and induced with a final IPTG concentration of 1 mM a t OD 600 = 0.6. After 24 hours of expression at 25 \u00b0C, cultures were harvested by centrifugation using a JLA - 16.250 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 6,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 8 minutes. Pellets were lysed using the detergent Solulyse in Tris Buffer (Genlantis) ebris were purified on an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) using 1 mL cOmplete columns (Roche) and buffer exchanged into 1x PBS (Corning) using Z eba 7K MWCO desalting columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Concentration was determined using the Pierce 660nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteins were stored at 4 \u00b0C until use. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy CD melting curves were taken using an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spctrophotometer (Model 60DS) at 222 nm with 0.1 minute equilibration time and 5 second averaging time. Purified proteins were diluted to 10 \u00b5M (unless specified otherwise) in 1x PBS and measured in a 1 mm quartz cuvette. Protein FRET measurement 176 10 mM stocks of Alexa 546 and Alexa 594 -maleimide conjugates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were prepared in anhydrous DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). Purified Met -Cys-TlpA was diluted to 2 \u00b5M in 1x PBS and split into two 50 uL aliquots. 10 mM Alexa -maleimide was added so as to achieve 10 -fold molar excess of dye:protein. Reactions were performed overnight at room temperature. Dye was removed via filtration through 7,000 MWCO Zeba column. Labeled proteins were mixed in equal volumes (10 uL each species), heated to 45 \u00b0C for 10 minutes in an Eppendorf Thermomixer to promote strand exchange, and then cooled down to room temperature. For the donor -only sample required for calculating the temperature -corrected FRET ratio, the Alexa 546 -labeled protei n was mixed with 1x PBS instead of the Alexa 594 - labeled variant. The 20 uL samples were transferred to optically clear PCR strips (Bio Rad) and donor fluorescence as a function of temperature was measured on the HXRX channel of the Stratagene MX3005p qPCR instrument. 177 5.10: References 1.
