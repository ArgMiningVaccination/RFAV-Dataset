Liver, kidneys, intestines and the lymphatic system are doing this work on a day-to-day basis, but because we are regularly exposed to so many chemicals in food, air, cosmetics and cleaning products it is useful to adopt some healthy practices that help us to flush the toxins out on an everyday basis. And if we don't do it daily, we need to at least get them out of the body every now and again. An unhealthy, very busy or stressful lifestyle can lead to the accumulation of toxins and even toxin overload that not only affects our body and physical health but also impacts our mental, psychological and emotional wellbeing. Toxin overload is often a reason for fertility issues, but it can also contribute to the development of various chronic conditions, especially autoimmune diseases and diabetes.
