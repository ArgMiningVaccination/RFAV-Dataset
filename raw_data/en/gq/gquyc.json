The Statesare responsible for implementation of programmewhereas the Directorate of NVBDCP, Delhi providestechnical assistance, policies and assistance to the Statesin the form of cash & commodity as per approved pattern.Malaria, Filaria, Japanese Encephalitis, Dengue andChikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes whereasKala-azar is transmitted by sand-flies. The transmissionof vector borne diseases depends on prevealance ofinfective vector mosquitoes and man-vector contact,which is further influenced by various factors such asclimate, sleeping habits of human, density of vectors andtheir biting etc. The general strategy for prevention and control of vector borne diseases under NVBDCP is described below: (i) Integrated Vector Management including Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in selected highrisk areas, Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets(LLINs), use of larvivorous fish, anti-larvalmeasures in urban (ii) Disease Management including early case detection with active, passive and sentinelsurveillance and complete effective treatment,strengthening of referral services, epidemicpreparedness and rapid response. (iii) Supportive Interventions including Behaviour Change Communication (BCC), Inter-sectoralConvergence, Human Resource Developmentthrough capacity building. 6.2.1 Malariaa. Malaria is an acute parasitic illness caused by Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax in India. Nine major species of anophelinemosquitoes transmit malaria in India. The main clinical presentation is with fever with chills; however, nausea and headache can also occur.The diagnosis is confirmed by microscopicexamination of a blood smear and RapidDiagnostic Tests for Pf cases. Majority of thepatients recover from the acute episode within aweek. Malaria continues to pose a major publichealth threat in different parts of the country,particularly due to Plasmodium falciparum due to which severity may develop and may causefatality, if not treated early. b. In India, 9 species of Malaria vectors are prevalent, out of which the major vector for ruralmalaria is Anopheles culicifacies , found all over the country and breeds in clean ground watercollections. Other important Anopheline speciesnamely An.minimus and An.fluviatilis breed in running channels, streams with clean water.Some of the vector species also breed in forestareas, mangroves, lagoons, etc, even in those withorganic pollutants. c. In urban areas, malaria is mainly transmitted by Anopheles stephensi which breeds in man-madeAnnual Report 2012-13 74water containers in domestic and peri-domestic situations such as tanks, wells, cisterns, whichare more or less of permanent nature and hencecan maintain density for malaria transmissionthroughout the year. Increasing human activities,such as urbanization, industrialization andconstruction projects with consequent migration,deficient water and solid waste management andindiscriminate disposal of articles (tyres,containers, junk materials, cups, etc.) createmosquitogenic conditions and thus contribute tothe spread of vector borne diseases. Epidemiological SituationThe status of total cases, Pf cases, deaths and API from 2005 to 2012 (Up to October) is given in the table andthe Graph as follows. The state-wise data on malariacases & deaths since 2009 is at Appendix-1 . Pre-independence estimates of Malaria were about 75 million cases and 0.8 million deaths annually. The problemwas virtually eliminated in the mid sixties but resurgenceled to an annual incidence of 6.47 million cases in 1976.Modified Plan of Operation was launched in 1977 andannual malaria incidence started declining. The caseswere contained between 2 to 3 million cases annually till2001 afterwards the cases have further started declining.During 2011, the malaria incidence was around 1.31 millioncases, 0.67 million Pf cases and 753 deaths. During 2012(till September updated on 2.11.12), 0.74 million cases,0.36 Pf cases and 309 deaths have been reported. About91% of malaria cases and 99% of deaths due to malaria are reported from high disease burden states namelyNortheastern (NE) other States are also vulnerable and have localand focal upsurge. Resistance in Plasmodium falciparum to Chloroquine was observed to be very high and frequentin the studies conducted during 2001 onwards. Therefore,Artemisine Combination Therapy (ACT) is now beingused as first line of treatment for all Pf cases in whole of the county. For strengthening surveillance, Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for diagnosis of P.falciparum malaria has also been introduced in high endemic areasand being scaled up. ASHAs have been trained indiagnosis and treatment of malaria cases and are involvedin early case detection and treatment. The Government of India provides technical assistance and logistics support including anti-malaria drugs, DDT,larvicides, etc. under the National Vector Borne DiseaseControl Programme. State Governments have to meetother requirements of the programme and to ensure theimplementation of programme. North-Eastern States areprovided 100 per cent central assistance for programmeimplementation that includes operational cost. Externally supported projectsAdditional support for combating malaria is provided through external assistance in high malaria risk areas.There are two such externally funded projects which arecurrently being implemented for malaria control: (i) Global Fund Supported Intensified Malaria Control Project (IMCP-II) (ii) W orld Bank Supported Project on Malaria Control & Kala-azar Elimination. Malaria Situation in the country during 2005-2012* Year Cases (in million) Deaths API Total Pf 2005 1.82 0.81 963 1.68 2006 1.79 0.84 2010 1.37 2011 1.31 0.67 753 1.10 2012* 0.74 0.36 309 * Data for 2012 up to SeptemberAnnual Report 2012-13 75The areas covered under these projects are as under: (i) The Global Fund supported Intensified Malaria Control Project (IMCP-II): Global fund Round 9 supported Intensified MalariaControl Project (IMCP-II) is being implementedsince October 2010 for a period of five years in7 NE States.

Objectives: The main objectives were the reduction of the disease to a tolerable level in which the human population can beprotected from malaria transmission with the available means. The Urban Malaria Scheme aims at:a). To prevent deaths due to malaria.b). Reduction in transmission and morbidity. Epidemiological Situation: About 10% of the total cases of malaria are reported from urban areas. Maximum numbers of malaria cases are reported from Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata,Mumbai, Vadodara, V ishakhapatn am, V ijayawada etc.The comparative epidemiological profile of Malaria during 2008-12 in all urban towns of the country is given below: Comparative Epidemiological profile of Malaria in 19 States under UMS during 2008-12 Control Strategy Under UMS, Malaria Control strategies are for (i) Parasite control & (ii)Vector control : (i) Parasite control: Treatment is done through passive agencies viz. hospitals, dispensaries bothin private & public sectors. In mega cities malaria clinics are established by each health sector/ malaria control agencies viz. MunicipalCorporations, Railways, Defence services. (ii) V ector control: Source reduction, use of larvicides, use of larvivorous fish, space spray,minor engineering and Legislative measures. The control of urban malaria depends primarily on the implementation of urban bye-laws to prevent mosquito breeding in domestic and peri-domestic areas or residentialblocks and government/commercial buildings, constructionsites. Use of larvivorous fish in the water bodies such asnatural water bodies, slow moving streams, lakes,ornamental ponds/fountains etc. is also recommended. Larvicides are used for water bodies, which are unsuitable for use of larvivorous fish. Awareness campaigns arealso undertaken by Municipal Bodies/Urban areaauthorities. The Bye-laws have India is mainly caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and is transmitted mainly byYear Population T 5.11 0.92 0.05 8 *Provisional up to September 2012 P .f = Plasmodium falciparum, SPR= Slide which breeds in dirty and polluted water, however, it can also breed in clearwater in the absence of polluted water. The infection isprevalent in both urban and rural areas. The disease is also caused by another positive agent namely Brugia malayi which is transmitted mainly by Mansonia annulifera which is the principal vector of this parasite . M.uniformis also plays a role in transmission of the disease and, therefore, is the secondary vector fortransmission of brugia infection. Prevalence of brugia infection is restricted to small foci of Kerala. The disease is reported to be endemic in 250 Districts in 20 States and UTs. The population of about 600 million inthese districts is at risk of lymphatic filariasis. This diseasecauses personal trauma to the affected persons and isassociated with social stigma, even though it is not fatal. The target year for Global elimination of this disease is by the year 2020. Government of India is signatory to theWorld Health Assembly Resolution in 1997 for GlobalElimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. The National HealthPolicy (2002) has envisaged elimination of lymphaticFilariasis in India by 2015. The strategy of lymphatic filariasis elimination is through: Annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA) of single dose of DEC + Albendazole for a minimumfive rounds or more to the eligible population(except pregnant women, children below 2 yearsof age and seriously ill persons) to interrupt transmission of the disease. Home based management of lymphoedema cases and up-scaling of hydrocele operations inidentified CHCs/ District Hospitals /MedicalColleges. To achieve elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis, the Government of India during 2004 launched annual MassDrug Administration (MDA) with annual singlerecommended dose of DEC tablets in addition to scaling up home based foot care and Hydrocele operation. The co-administration of DEC+ Albendazole has been upscaled since 2007. The programme covered 202 districtsin 2004 whereas by the year 2007, all the 250 LF endemicDistricts were covered. MDA starts the month ofNovember; however, the dates of observance of MDA are staggered depending on the preparedness of the states. The coverage has improved from 72% in 2004 to 87% in2011. MDA-2011 round was observed in 19 States/UTsexcept Bihar (as shown in chart above). In Uttar Pradeshalso it was observed only in 14 districts out of 50 LF States/UTs): 20 Districts: 250Pop.: 600 million Annual Report 2012-13 78endemic districts. Thus in 2011 MDA round, only 176 districts out of 250 were covered. The state wisecoverage is indicated in Appendix-2. The Line listing of lymphoedema and Hydrocele cases was initiated since 2004 by door to door survey in thesefilaria endemic districts. The enlisted cases are regularlybeing updated by state health authorities and more casesare being recorded. This increase is mainly due toincomplete surveys during initial years and reluctance onpart of community to reveal their manifestations oflymphoedema and Hydrocele. The updated figure tillSeptember 2012 revealed about 12 lakh cases with clinicalmanifestations (8 lakhs lymphoedema and 4 lakhsHydrocele). The initiatives have also been taken todemonstrate the simple washing of foot to maintainhygiene for prevention of secondary bacterial and fungalinfection in chronic lymphoedema cases so that thepatients get relief from frequent acute attacks. The statesregularly update the list and intensify the hydrocele operations in their respective states. The microfilaria survey in all the implementation units (districts) is being done through night blood survey beforeMDA. The survey is done in 4 sentinel and 4 randomsites collecting total 4000 slides (500 from each site). Thedata provided by the states indicate reduction in overallmicrofilaria rate in the MDA districts (1.24% in 2004 to0.37% in 2011). 6.2.4 is caused by , which breeds in shady, damp and warm places in cracks and crevices in the soft soil, in masonryand rubble heaps, etc. Proper sanitation and hygiene are Kala-azar Endemic Areas (52 Districts in 4 states) Uttar PradeshBihar Jharkhand West BengalAnnual Report 2012-13 79critical to prevent sand fly breeding. The disease has also been targeted for elimination by 2015 as per tripartite agreement between India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Inpursuance to achieve the elimination goal, case detection and treatment compliance has been strengthened and Rapid Diagnostic Test for Kala-azar and oral drugmiltefosine has been introduced. World Bank is providing State & District level VBD Consultants, Kala azar Technical Supervisor (KTS), mobility for monitoring &supervision and capacity building/training in 46 districts in 3 states namely Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Kala-azar is endemic in 52 districts (31 in Bihar, 4 in Jharkhand, 11 in West Bengal and 6 in UP). The Kala- azar Control Programme was launched in 1990-91. The annual incidence of disease has come down from 77,102cases in 1992 to 29,000 cases in 2010 and deaths from 1,419 to 105 respectively. The cases recorded during 2011 were 33,187 with 80 deaths, whereas during 2012 (tillSeptember updated on 22.11.2012) 17204 cases and 23 deaths have been reported. Appendix-3. Strategy for Kala-azar elimination is through: Parasite elimination and disease management o Early case detection and complete treatment; o Strengthening of referral; Integrated vector control o Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS); o Environmental management by maintenance of sanitation and hygiene; Supportive interventions o Behaviour Change Communication for social mobilization; o Inter-sectoral convergence; o Capacity building by training and Monitoring and Evaluation To realize the goal of elimination of Kala-azar, the Govt. of India is providing 100% support to endemic states since2003-04. Initiatives undertaken for Kala-azar elimination are as follows: Diagnostic tools i.e. RDK for Kala-azar has been introduced in all the Kala-azar endemic districts. Effective Oral drug - Miltefosine has een introduced and expanded in all the affected districts as first line of treatment. Indoor residual spray with DDT 50% for vector control. Incentive to the Kala-azar patient towards loss of wages @ Rs.50/- per day during the period oftreatment. Free diet support to the patient and one attendant accompanying the patient. Incentive to ASHA for Rs.200/- per patient (Rs.50/- for referring a suspected case and Rs.150/- after completion of the treatment afterconfirmation through RDK). Support to states for engaging 46 VBD Consultants and 276 Kala-azar TechnicalSupervisors (KTS) in 46 districts under World Bank Supported Project. 6.2.5 Japanese Encephalitis (JE)Japanese Encephalitis is a zoonotic disease which is transmitted by vector mosquito mainly belonging to Culex vishnui group. The transmission cycle is maintained in the nature by animal reservoirs of JE virus like pigs and water birds. Man is the dead end host, i.e. JE is not transmitted from one infected person to other. Outbreaksare common in those areas where there is close interaction between pigs/birds and human beings. The vectors of JE breed in large water bodies rich in aquatic vegetationssuch as paddy fields. The population at risk is about 350 million. KALA-AZAR SITUATION IN INDIA (2005-2012)Annual Report 2012-13 80Case definition of AES: Clinically, a case of AES is defined as a person of any age, at any time of the yearwith the acute onset of fever and a change in mentalstatus (including symptoms such as confusion,disorientation, coma or inability to talk). And/or new onsetof seizures (excluding/simple febrile seizures). Otherearly clinical findings may include an increase in irritability,somnolence or abnormal behaviour greater than that seemwith usual febrile illness. Epidemiological Situation : JE has been reported from different parts of the country. The disease is endemic in 17 states of which Assam, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal reporting outbreaks.In year 2010, 5167 cases and 679 deaths due to AcuteEncephalitis Syndrome (AES) were reported. Duringthe year 2011, 8249 cases of AES and 1169 deaths havebeen reported. During 2012 (till 21.11.2012), 7698 casesof AES and 1145 deaths have been reported. Out of this3376 cases and 517 deaths are reported from UttarPradesh. State-wise JE cases and deaths are given in Appendix-4. There is no specific cure for this disease. Symptomatic and early case management is very important to minimizerisk of death and complications. Govt. of India launched JE vaccination programme as an integral component ofUniversal Immunization Programme (UIP) with singledose live attenuated JE (SA- 14-14-2) in 11 endemic districts of 4 States namely Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Karnataka for children between 1 and 15years of age and 88.39% coverage was achieved. Furtherduring 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, 28, 21, 30 and 28 districts respectively were covered under JE Vaccination bringing the total number of vaccinated districts to 109as 7 districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh which werebrought under JE vaccination during 2006 were again targeted under special vaccination drive during 2010. In addition, implementation of public health measures such as, Social Mobilization through different media like radio,TV including cable network, miking, inter-personal communication, etc for disseminating appropriate messages in the community is crucial. The emphasis isgiven on keeping pigs away from human dwellings or inpigsties particularly during dusk to dawn which is the biting time of vector mosquitoes. Sensitization of the community regarding avoidance of man-mosquito contact by usingbet nets and fully covering the body are also advocated.Since early reporting of cases is crucial to avoid any complication and mortality, community is given full information about the signs and symptoms as well asavailability of health services at health centres/hospitals.Besides, the states are advised fogging with malathion (technical) as an outbreak control measure in the affected areas. For further strengthening the prevention and control measures against JE/AES, a multipronged strategy and aconvergence with different Ministries has been proposedby GoI in line with the recommendations of GoM. As per this proposal which is under consideration of Government of India, an integrated approach with following Ministrieshas been suggested. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Ministry of Drinking Water Supply & Sanitation, Ministry of Women & ChildDevelopment, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment,Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development. Annual Report 2012-13 816.2.6 Dengue Fever/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever Dengue Fever is an outbreak prone viral disease, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Both Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are involved in transmission. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes prefer to breed in manmade containers, viz., cement tanks, overhead tanks,underground tanks, tyres, desert coolers, pitchers,discarded containers, junk materials, etc, in which waterstagnates for more than a week. This is a day bitingmosquito and prefers to rest in hard to find dark areasinside the houses. Aedes albopictus mosquitoes prefer to breed in natural habitats like tree holes, plantation etc.The risk of dengue has shown an increase in recent yearsdue to rapid urbanization, life style changes and deficientwater management including improper water storagepractices in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, leading toproliferation of mosquito breeding sites. The disease has a seasonal pattern i.e., the cases peak after monsoon and it is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. However, in the southern states and Gujarat the transmission is perennial. Dengue is a self limiting acutedisease characterized by fever, headache, muscle, jointpains, rash, nausea and vomiting. Some infections resultsin Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and in its severeform Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) can threaten thepatient's life primarily through increased vascularpermeability and shock due to bleeding from internalorgans. Though during 2010, highest numbers of caseswere reported (28292) the deaths have declined. TheCase Fatality Rate (CFR) which was 3.3 % in 1996 hadcome down to 0.4% in 2010 and 0.9% in 2011 because of better management of Dengue cases in the country following National guidelines. The disease is spreading to newer geographcal areas every year. District Reported Dengue CasesDistrict Annual Report Dengue is endemic in 31 States/UTs. After 1996, Outbreak with a total number of 16517 cases and 545 deaths upsurge of cases were recorded in 2003, 2005 and 2008. In 2009, total 15535 cases and 99 deaths have been reported. During 2010,28292 cases and 110 deaths were reported whereas during2011, 18860 cases and 169 deaths have been reported. During 2012 (till 15 th November), total 35066 cases and 216 deaths have been reported ( Appendix-5 ). Highest number of deaths were reported by Tamil Nadu (60) followed by Maharashtra (59). There is no specific anti-viral drug or vaccine against dengue infection. Mortality can only be minimized byearly diagnosis and prompt symptomatic management ofthe cases. A strategic action plan has been developed forprevention and control of Dengue and issued to theendemic States for implementation. Guidelines for clinicalmanagement of dengue fever/ dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome cases have been developed and sent to the states for wider circulation. Advisorieshave been sent to the endemic areas for effective vectorcontrol through inter-sectoral collaboration and activecommunity involvement, regular monitoring of Denguecases as well as entomological parameters to forecastlikely outbreaks and to take timely remedial measures.The States have been communicated to undertakewidespread campaigns for community awareness andmobilization through different media like mass media,miking, inter-personal communication, etc. The emphasisis on elimination of mosquito breeding sources like avoidance of water collection in and around houses, removal of all discarded and disposed/junk materials,keeping all water containers/storage facilities tightlycovered and cleaning the water coolers at least once aweek before re-filling. Since early reporting of cases iscrucial to avoid any complication and mortality, the community is given full information about the signs andsymptoms as well as availability of health services athealth centres/ hospitals. Alerting the Hospitals for makingadequate arrangements for management of Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever cases have also beenadvised. The Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control has provided detailed guidelines for the preventionand control of dengue to the affected states. Intensive health education activities through print, electronic and inter-personal media, outdoor publicity as well as an inter-sectoral collaboration with civil society organization(NGOs/CBOs/Self-Help Groups), PRIs and Municipalbodies have been emphasized. Regular supervision andmonitoring is conducted by the Programme. TheGovernment of India in consultation with States hasidentified 347 sentinel surveillance hospitals withlaboratory support for augmentation of diagnostic facilitiesin the endemic states. Further, for advanced diagnosisand backup support 14 Apex Referral Laboratories(Appendix-6) have been identified and linked with sentinel surveillance hospitals. To make these functional, IgM capture ELISA test kits are provided throughNational Institute of Virology, Pune free of cost.Contingency grant is also provided to meet the operationalcosts. For early diagnosis ELISA based NS1 kits have beenintroduced under the programme which can detect thecases from 1 st day of infection. IgM capture ELISA tests can detect the cases after 5th day of infection. The GoI has taken the following steps for prevention and control of Dengue: Monitoring the situation through reports receivedfrom State Health Authorities. A Mid Term Plan for prevention and control ofdengue has been developed in 2011 and circulatedto the states for implementation. The maincomponents of Mid Term Plan for Prevention andcontrol of Dengue are as follows: Surveillance - Disease and EntomologicalSurveillance Case Management - Laboratory diagnosis andClinical Management Vector Management - Environmentalmanagement for Source Reduction, Chemicalcontrol, Personal protection and Legislation Annual Report 2012-13 83 Outbreak response - Epidemic preparedness and Media Management Capacity building- Training, strengthening humanresource and operational research Behaviour Change Communication - Socialmobilization and Information Education &Communication (IEC) Inter-sectoral coordination - with Ministries ofUrban Development, Rural Development,Panchayati Raj, Surface Transport and Educationsector Monitoring an d Supervision - Analysis of reports, review, field visit and feedback 6.2.7 Chikungunya Chikungunya is a debilitating non-fatal viral illness caused by Chikungunya virus. The disease re-emerged in thecountry after a gap of three decades. In India a majorepidemic of Chikungunya fever was reported during 60s& 70s; inMaharashtra). This is also transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus can transmit the disease. Humans are considered to be themajor source or reservoir of Chikungunya virus.Therefore, the mosquitoes usually transmit the disease by biting infected persons and then biting others. The infected person cannot spread the infection directly toother person (i.e. it is not contagious disease). Symptomsof Chikungunya fever are most often clinically indistinguishable from those observed in dengue fever. However, unlike dengue, hemmorrhagic manifestations are rare and shock is not observed in Chikungunya virusinfection. It is characterized by fever with severe jointpain (arthralgia) and rash. Chikungunya outbreakstypically result in large number of cases but deaths arerarely encountered. Joint pains sometimes persist for along time even after the disease is cured. During 2006, total 1.39 million clinically suspected Chikungunya cases reported in the country. Out of Bengal, Lakshadweep and Uttar Pradesh. There are no reported deaths directlyrelated to Chikungunya. In 2007, total 14 States were affected and reported 59535 suspected Chikungunyafever cases with nil death. Subsequently in 2008, 2009and 2010, 95091, 73288 and 48176 suspectedChikungunya fever cases with nil death were reported . During 2011, 20402 suspected Chikungunya fever caseshave been reported whereas during 2012 (till 15 th November 2012) total 14227 suspected Chikungunyacases have been reported (Appendix-7). As already mentioned, Aedes mosquitoes bite during the day and breed in a wide variety of man-made containers which are common around human dwellings. These containers such as discarded tyres, flower pots, old waterdrums, family water trough, water storage vessels andplastic food containers collect rain water and becomethe source of breeding of Aedes mosquitoes. Ae.aegypti played the major role in transmitting the disease in all the states except Kerala, where Ae. albopictus played the major role. Ae. albopictus breeding was detected in latex Annual Report 2012-13 84collecting cups of rubber plantations, shoot-off leaves of areca palm, fruit shells, leaf axils, tree holes etc. There is neither any vaccine nor drugs available to cure the Chikungunya infection. Supportive therapy that helpsto ease symptoms, such as administration of non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs and getting plenty of rest arefound to be beneficial. Government of India is continuously monitoring the situation, sending guidelines and advisories for preventionand control of Chikungunya fever to the states. Sincesame vector is involved in the transmission of Dengueand Chikungunya strategies for transmission risk reductionby vector control are also same. A comprehensive MidTerm Plan for prevention & control of Chikungunya andDengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever has been preparedand disseminated for guidance to the states. Support inthe form of logistics and funds are provided to the states.The central teams are deputed to the affected states fortechnical guidance of the state health authorities. As mosttransmission occurs at home, therefore, communityparticipation and co-operation is of paramount importance for successful implementation of programme strategiesfor prevention and control of Chikungunya. For effectivecommunity participation, people are informed aboutChikungunya and the fact that major epidemics can beprevented by taking effective preventive measures bycommunity itself. Therefore, considerable efforts havebeen made through advocacy and social mobilization forcommunity education and awareness. For carrying out proactive surveillance and enhancing diagnostic facilities for Chikungunya, the 347 SentinelSurveillance Hospitals in States/UTs across the countryare involved in dengue in the affected states also carriesChikungunya tests. Both Dengue and ChikungunyaDiagnostic kits (IgM capture ELISA) to these institutesare provided through National Institute of Virology, Puneand cost is borne by GoI. Further, rapid response by theconcerned health authorities has been envisaged on reportof any suspected case from the Sentinel SurveillanceHospitals to prevent further spread of the disease. The overall strategies for prevention and control are same as in Dengue such as symptomatic management of cases, reduction of breeding sources,personal protection and intensive IEC and capacitybuilding. Initiatives undertaken by Govt. of India for prevention and control of Dengue/Chikungunya are as follows: i. Continuous monitoring of Chikungunya and Dengue situation in states. ii. Circulation of guidelines and advisories for prevention and control of diseases to affectedstates. iii. Launch of intensive IEC and Behaviour Change Communication activities through print, electronicmedia, interpersonal communication, outdoorpublicity as well as inter sectoral collaborationwith civil society organizations (NGOs/CBOs/Self Help Groups), PRIs. iv. Provision of larvicides and adulticides to affected states. v. Identification and strengthening of Apex Referral Laboratories and sentinel surveillance hospitalsfor diagnosis and regular surveillance. vi. NIV , Pune has been entrusted for supply of test kits to the identified institutions free of cost. vii.

The National Leprosy Control Programme (NLEP) was launched by the Govt. of India in1955. Multi Drug Therapy came into wide usefrom 1982 and the National Leprosy EradicationProgramme was introduced in 1983. Since then,remarkable progress has been achieved inreducing the disease burden. India achieved thegoal of elimination of leprosy as a public healthproblem, defined as less than 1 case per 10,000populations, at the National level in the month ofDecember 2005 as set by the National HealthPolicy, 2002. MDT is supplied free of cost byWHO. 2. Following are the programme components -1) Case detection and Management.2) Disability prevention and Medical Rehabilitation.3) Information, Education & Communication (IEC/ BCC) 4) Human Resources and Capacity building.5) Programme Management. 6.3.1 Epidemiological Situation The year 2011-12 started with 0.83 lakh leprosy cases on record as on 1st April 2011, with PR 0.69/10,000. Tillthen 32 States/ UTs had attained the level of leprosyelimination. A total of 543 districts (84.58%) out of total642 districts also achieved elimination by March 2012. A total of 209 high endemic districts were identified for special actions during 2011-12. After thorough analysis atotal of 2019 blocks & 2 urban areas were identified forspecial action. The States were advised to post welltrained District Leprosy Officer in all the districts wherethese blocks are located. In addition one officer shouldbe identified in each of these blocks to strengthen theprocess of supervision and monitoring. At the end of the year 2011-12, Leprosy Status is as below: 1. 33 States/ UTs had already achieved the level of elimination i.e. PR less than 1 case per 10,000population. One State (Chhattisgarh) and OneU.T. (Dadra & Nagar Haveli) has remained withPR between 1 and 3 per 10,000 population.2. A total of 1.27 Lakh new Leprosy cases was detected during the year 2011-12 giving ANCDRof 10.35 per 100,000 population. 3. A total of 0.83 Lakh Leprosy cases on record as on 1 st April, 2012 with PR 0.68/10,000 Population. 4. The Proportion amongst new leprosy cases detected during 2011-12 indicates of MB (49.0),Female (37.0), Child (9.7), Visible Deformity(3.0), ST cases (15.8) and SC cases (18.4). 5. 2548 reconstructive surgeries were conducted in 2011-12 for correction of disability in leprosyaffected persons. 6. Out of 140590 leprosy cases discharged during the year (2011-12), 127899 cases were releasedas cured after completing treatment. 7. Out of 219075 global leprosy cases reported in 2011, 127,295 cases were reported by India. ThusIndia contributed about 58% of new casesdetected globally in 2011 and this trend is likelyto continue for some more years. The trend ofPrevalence and Annual New Case DetectionRate Per 10,000 population since 2001-02 is shown in the Graph below: 6.3.2 Activities under NLEP 1. Diagnosis and treatment of leprosy - Services for diagnosis and treatment (Multi drug therapy) are provided by all primary health centres andgovt. dispensaries throughout the country freeof cost. Difficult to diagnose and complicatedcases and cases requiring reconstructive surgeryare referred to district hospital for furthermanagement. ASHAs under NRHM are beinginvolved to bring out leprosy cases from villages Annual Report 2012-13 93for diagnosis at PHC and follow up cases for treatment completion. ASHAs are being paid incentive for this activity from the programme budget. 2. Training - Training of general health staff like medical officer, health workers, health supervisors, laboratory technicians and ASHAs are conducted every year to develop adequate skill in diagnosis and management of leprosy cases. The District Nucleus staffs under theDistrict Leprosy Officer monitors the activities in the PHCs and provide on job training wherever needed to the General Health Care Staff. 3. Urban leprosy control - To address the complex problems in urban areas, the Urban Leprosy control activities are being implemented in 422urban areas having population size of more than 1 lakh. These activities include MDT delivery services & follow up of patient for treatmentcompletion, providing supportive medicines & dressing material and monitoring & supervision. 4. IEC - Intensive IEC activities are conducted for awareness generation and particularly reduction of stigma and discrimination against leprosy affected persons. These activities are carriedthrough mass media, outdoor media, rural media and advocacy meetings. More focus is given on inter personal communication. Mass mediacampaign was carried out through the Prasar Bharti & Private T.V . Channels and F.M. Channels to spread awareness about leprosy inthe General Public. IEC activities for NLEP are also a component of the all NRHM IEC Campaigns. The State/Districts also participatein Health Melas for spreading awareness about leprosy. 5. NGO services under SET scheme - Presently, 39 NGOs are getting grants from Govt. of India under Survey, Education and Treatment (SET) scheme. The various activities undertaken by theNGOs are, IEC, Prevention of Impairments and Deformities, Case Detection and MDT Delivery. From financial year 2006 onwards, Grant-in-aidis being disbursed to NGO through State Health (Leprosy) Societies. 6. Disability Prevention and Medical Rehabilitation - Emphasis is being given on correction of disability in leprosy affected personsthrough reconstructive surgery (RCS). An amount of Rs. 5000/- is provided as incentive toleprosy affected persons from BPL family for undergoing per major reconstructive surgery inidentified Govt./NGO institutions to compensateloss of wages during their stay in hospital. Support is also provided to Government institutions in the form of Rs. 5000/- per major RCS conducted,for procurement of supply & material and otherancillary expenditure required for the surgery. /head2right For prevention of disability among persons with insensitive hands and feet, they are givendressing material, supportive medicines and micro-cellular rubber (MCR) footwear. The patients are also empowered with self care procedure for taking care of themselves. 7. Supervision and Monitoring -Programme is being monitored at different level through analysis of monthly progress reports, through field visits by the supervisory officers and programmereview meetings held at Central, State andDistrict level. For better epidemiological analysis of the disease situation, emphasis is given to assessment of New Case Detection andTreatment Completion Rate and proportion ofgrade II disability among new cases. District nucleus is a nodal agency at a district level. Without the complete districts nucleus team, it is verydifficult to monitor the programme regularly. It may bementioned that leprosy services are being provided through the Primary Health Care Institutions with the General Health Staff. The component called DistrictNucleus was kept at the District level under the DistrictProgramme Officer with persons from erstwhile vertical staff under NLEP. Independent Programme Evaluation was carried out during the year 2010 through an independent agency. 6.3.3 Initiatives i. Special Activity in High Endemic Distt .- 209 Districts had reported ANCDR (Annual NewCase Detection Rate) more than 10 per lakhpopulation. Special activity for early detection and complete treatment, Capacity building and extensive IEC, Adequate availability of MDT,Strengthening of Distt. Nucleus, Regularmonitoring & supervision and review, Regular follow up for neuritis and reaction, Self care practices, Supply of MCR footwear in adequate quantity and Improvement in RCS performanceAnnual Report 2012-13 94through camp approach were carried out in the above districts during 2011-12, to reduce the disease burden. ii. Involvement of ASHA - A scheme to involve ASHAs was drawn up to bring out leprosy casesfrom their villages for diagnosis at PHC and followup cases for treatment completion. To facilitatethe involvement of ASHA, they were being paidan incentive as below during the year 2011-12. (i) On confirmed diagnosis of case brought by them - Rs. 100/- (ii) On completion of full course of treatment of the case within specified time- PB leprosy case -Rs. 200/- and MB Leprosy case - Rs. 400/- ASHAs under the NRHM were involved in Leprosy programme for last 4 years. However during 2011-12,their participation has substantially increased. 6.3.4 BudgetThe Budget allocation under NLEP for 2010-11 was Rs. 45.32 crore and expenditure of Rs. 37.35 crores wasincurred during the year. 44.02 crores. Rs. 40.63 crores expenditure has been incurred during the year. 6.4 REVISED NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROGRAMME (RNTCP) 1. TB Disease burden in India Tuberculosis (TB) is major public health problem in India. India with population of 1.22 billion (17% of globalpopulation) contributes to about 21% of the global TBBurden. It is estimated by WHO that annually about twomillion incident TB cases occur in India with mortality ofaround 0.28 million. The state-wise estimated TB incidentcases are in:TB Incidence: The National estimates of Annual Risk of TB Infection (ARTI) which gives an indirect measurement of incidence of TB, prior to 2000 was 1.7% and estimates based on National ARTI survey in 2001-03 reduced to 1.5% and based on latest ARTI Survey in2007-09 has further reduced to 1.1%, thus showingdeclining trend. TB Prevalence (all forms of TB) has been reduced from 586 cases per lakh population (1990) to 249 casesper lakh population as per the WHO Global Report 2010.Repeat population surveys conducted by NIRT (ICMR)indicate an annual decline in prevalence of disease by12%. Based on the TB prevalence rates per lakhpopulation, India is the 17th amongst the 22 highest burdencountries in the world. TB Mortality in the country has reduced from over 42 deaths due to TB per lakh population in 1990 to 23 deathsdue to TB per lakh population as per the WHO GlobalReport 2010. 2. Goal of the ProgrammeThe goal of TB control Programme is to decrease mortality and morbidity due to TB and cut transmissionof infection until TB ceases to be a major public healthproblem in India. 3. Objectives of the programme To achieve and maintain cure rate of at least 85% among New Sputum Positive patients. To achieve and maintain case detection of at least 70% of the estimated NSP cases in thecommunity. The current focus of the programme is on ensuring universal access to quality TB diagnosis and quality treatment services to all TB patients in the community.

Benefits already accrued in 11th Five Year PlanAnnual Report 2012-13 955. RNTCP Achievements Since its inception, the programme has initiated >15 million patients on treatment, thus savingmore than 2.6 million additional lives. Graph 1: Population in India covered under DOTS and Total Tuberculosis Patients put ontreatment each quarter Treatment success rates have tripled from 25% in pre-RNTCP era to 87% presently and TB death rates have been reduced from 29% to 4% during the same period. Since 2007, RNTCP has also achieved the NSP case detection rate of more than 70% in line with the global targets for TB control while maintaining the treatment success rate of >85%. Graph 2: Annual New sputum smear positive case detection rate and treatment success rate in DOTS areas, 2001-2012. Graph 3: Trends in notification of different types of TB cases under RNTCP Quality assured diagnostic facilities are available through nearly 13000 designated microscopycentres (DMCs) across the country. To ensure quality of sputum microscopy, external quality assurance is being routinely conducted throughout the country as per a standardizedprotocol based on international guidelines with allcomponents for ensuring quality - on site evaluation, panel testing and blinded crosschecking. All states are implementing the 'Supervision and Monitoring strategy' - detailing guidelines, tools and indicators for monitoring the performance from the PHI level to the national level. The programme is focusing on the reduction in the default rates amongst all new and re-treatment cases and is undertaking steps for the same. To improve access to tribal and other marginalized groups the programme hasdeveloped a Tribal action plan which is being implemented with the provision of additional TB Units and DMCs in tribal/difficult areas, additionalstaff, compensation for transportation of patient& attendant and higher rate of salary to contractual staff. Annual Report 2012-13 96 The programme has introduced Pediatric patient wise boxes, in 2006, with formulations and dosesspecifically designed for convenient usage inchildren. >2000 NGOs and >10,000 Private Practitioners are involved in the programme in different signedschemes under NGO/PP schemes. In addition292 medical colleges (including private ones) have been involved in RNTCP by the end of 1stQ 2012. Health facilities in government sectors outside Health Ministry have been involved viz. ESI,Railways, Ports and the ministries of Mines, Steel, Coal, etc. Intensified Public Private Mix project is being undertaken with Indian Medical Association(IMA) in 16 States and with Catholic Bishop Conference of India (CBCI), a Faith Based Organisation (FBO), in 19 States under the GlobalFund supported Rolling Continuation Channel(RCC) Project. Under the Global Fund Round 9 project, civil society organizations are undertaking activities in374 districts across 23 states to enhance thevisibility and reach of the programme and engage with communities and community based care providers to improve TB care and control. 6.4.1 Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB)Disease burden: WHO Global TB Report 2011, estimates that approximately 64,000 cases of Multi-DrugResistant-TB (MDR-TB) emerge annually from thenotified cases of pulmonary TB in India, based on thedata available from population based drug resistancesurveys carried out in 3 states of India that revealed theprevalence of MDR-TB to be ~3% have reported XDR-TB in India. However, theextent and magnitude of this problem is yet to bedetermined. Preliminary results show that there is not yetany XDR-TB amongst new cases and ~0.5% amongstre-treatment cases. However, when translated intonumbers the M/XDR TB cases are significant and posea serious challenge to TB epidemiology unless effectivelymanaged. The national guidelines for programmaticmanagement of drug resistant TB is available, periodicallyupdated (Revised on June 2012) and have clear guidancefor quality management of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.6.4.2 Key Features of RNTCP for Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB (PMDT ) in India Diagnosis of M/XDR TB Decentralized diagnostic and treatment services \u007f Diagnosis: Clinical indication to offer Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) - Initially: All failures of first line regimen, contacts of known MDR TB case(Criteria A) - Subsequently: + All smear positive re-treatment cases at diagnosis, any smear positive follow upcase (Criteria B) - For XDR-TB: if culture positive at 6 months and culture reverted cases (Criteria C) \u007f Drug susceptibility testing - Specimen transport to accredited reference laboratory - Line Probe Assay (LPA) - if available - is preferred DST method for first line drugs - DST for 2 nd line drugs done at 3 National Reference Labs (National TB Institute-Bangalore; National Institute of Research inTuberculosis-Chennai and Lala Ram SarupInstitute-New Delhi) Treatment of M/XDR TB Treat based on Rifampicin (Rif) / DST results (Rif mono-resistance rare) Initial Hospitalization at Drug Resistant TB Centers (DR-TB Centre) followed byambulatory careMDR Diagnostic Technology Choice Molecular DST (e.g. LPA DST ) First Liquid culture isolation and LPA DST SecondSolid culture isolation and LPA DST Third Liquid culture isolation and Liquid DST Fourth Solid culture isolation and DST FifthAnnual Report 2012-13 97 Standardized treatment Regimen for MDR-TB - DOT - (6-9 months) Ethionamide; Ethambutol - PAS used as a substitute drug in case of intolerance Standardized treatment Regimen for XDR-TB - daily DOT - (6-12 months) Capreomycin; PAS, Moxifloxacin, High dose INH, Clofazimine; Linezolid;Amoxycilin-Clavulanic Acid / (18 months) PAS,Moxifloxacin, High dose INH, Clofazimine;Linezolid; Amoxycilin-Clavulanic Acid - Clarithromycin and Thiacitazole used as a substitute drug in case of intolerance. Status and Progress in Scaling-up of PMDT Services in India Quality diagnosis and treatment services under programmatic management of drug resistant TBwere introduced since 2007. 43 RNTCP Certified Culture-DST laboratories are currently functional with rapid molecular test(Line Probe Assay - LPA) available in 31 ofthese labs. Figure 1: RNTCP Network of Culture and DST Laboratories - Sept '12 PMDT services are available in all 35 states of the country across 527 districts covering a population of 864 million (71%) as on 25 th Oct 2012 and are being rapidly scaled up. 24/35 states have achieved 100% geographical coverage and the remaining states are expected to achieve complete geographical coverage by2012-13 Figure 2: Proportion of Population with Access to PMDT services in India as on Sept '12 Graph 4: Population in India covered under PMDT services, C-DST Laboratories Certifiedand Total MDR TB cases put on treatment eachquarter. Anecdotal reports of TB that is resistant to all available anti-TB drugs highlights urgency to scale Annual Report 2012-13 98up RNTCP PMDT services for M/XDR TB nationwide. All states are expected to move towards universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment ofMDR TB patient by gradually extending theopportunity to diagnose early during the treatmentcourse of TB patients. Figure 3: Status of PMDT services implementation in districts in India by variousMDR TB Suspects Criteria as on Sept'12 PMDT guidelines refined and updated in June 2012 under guidance from National DOTS Pluscommittee. 6.4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation of RNTCPRNTCP has a developed a strategy document for supervision and monitoring of RNTCP. The same wasupdated in 2012. This strategy defines the role of eachstaff and officer in supervision & monitoring of theprogramme from the most peripheral level to central level.Frequency of visits, checklists for supervision, andindicators for monitoring their interpretation and possible solution and corrective actions are defined in the strategy. 6.4.3.a Programme review and monitoring indicators at various levels Review of progress and programme performance is review at various level on a regular basis in a structuredmanner. This includes biannual national review meetingof STOs and Consultants. Quarterly review of DistrictTB Officers and programme partners at state level including the State Task Forces for medical colleges is aregular features. District-wise programme performanceis reviewed using Monitoring Indictors published byCentral TB Division on quarterly and annual basis. Epi-Info based EPI-CENTRE is used for compilation of TUwise aggregated information on case finding, smearconversion and treatment outcome reports throughout thecountry. Programme management information at TU anddistrict level is also compiled in the same manner. 6.4.3.b Programme EvaluationsEach State/UT is expected to carry out state level Internal Evaluation of RNTCP implementation in atleast twodistricts per quarter. Central Internal Evaluation of atleast two states is carried out per quarter with two districts in each state. Use ofEpidata software for quick data entry of findings fromvisits to DOT Centres, DMCs, TUs and patient visits hasbeen recently introduced and the analysis of the samegives the objective insight in programme evaluation ofthe districts. Structured Programme Evaluation has beenthe a very important tool for systematic feedback to theprogramme implementation at district and state level. 6.4.3.c Focussed Action PlanDespite of regular supervision, monitoring and evaluation, there is a wide variation in performance of the State/UTs and districts throughout the country. In manyinstances, the reason is that there was no systematicattempt to find the reasons of underperformance of theseareas at local level or inadequate capacity building andsupport from the state level. These districts wereidentified by CTD in consultation with the State/UTs. Withthe objective to improve the performance in such areas,the special guidance was given by Central T Division tothe State teams to conduct situational analysis in anobjective manner. Based on the situational analysis, Focussed Action Plans were prepared by the state teams for each of these listedunderperforming districts in the country. The same wereshared with CTD and feedback on each plan was givento prioritize and strategize high impact activities for eachof these districts. With the specific action suggested tothe state teams including the concentrated efforts by thestate teams for supportive supervision of these districtsand hand holding for planning and conducting activities inthese districts by state and district teams in a coordinated Annual Report 2012-13 99manner. Action Taken Reports on plan for each of these districts in an on-going activity since Jan 2012. The impactof the Focused Action Plan strategy will be assessed in the year 2013. 6.4.3.d Improving TB surveillance by transitioning to Case Based Web Based recording andreporting (Nikshay) RNTCP since implementation followed international guidelines for recording and reporting for TuberculosisControl Programme with minor modifications. Epi-info based EPI-CENTRE software was being used for the purpose of electronic data transmission from district levelupwards. Initially DOS version was in use and the programme shifted to windows version in 2007. However, the data available at district, state or national level is inaggregated form. So, with the objective to improve TB surveillance in the country, programme has undertaken the initiative todevelop a Case Based Web Based application named Nikshay. This ICT application (Nikshay) was launched on 15th May 2012 by NIC (HQ) and Central TB Division. The data entry of the individual TB cases is being done at the block level DEOs of NRHM (same person doing the MCTS entry). So, for successful implementation ofNikshay the ICT infrastructure at block level, computer, internet and manpower (NRHM appointed DEO) is being used under the direction of AS& MD (NRHM). Currently in its initial phases, Nikshay has been divided into 16 strategic phases: Phases 1, 2, 3, 4: Basic Information about facilities and officials in the RNTCP, Information of TB cases initiated on DOTS, Notification of TB and registration system: This will involveregistration of health establishments and data entry of notified TB cases at TU and district level. Phase 5: Programmatic Management of DR TB: Details of MDR-TB requests and results will be uploaded by DST labs and treatment details willbe uploaded by the treatment centres. Phase 6: SMS based treatment monitoring and follow up: Push query and pull information ontreatment adherence from DOT provider on weekly basis with periodic SMS alerts to patients. Phase 7, 8: Linkages between facilities for transfer & referral: Linkage of various publichealth establishments and track the transfer of patient from one centre to another. The data entryfor referral will be done at the TU level and thereceiving TU will be alerted through variouschannels. Phase 9: Hand held device use: Nikshay application will be made available on androidhandheld device Phase 10: Multiple entry mode: will include mapping and defining output of automaticmachines for rapid diagnostics for TB Phase 11, 12: Web based TB Notification and mobile, IVRS based notification for private healthfacilities Phase 13: Automated output with inbuilt statistical software Phase 14:Programme management: This phase will enable electronic transfer of incentives torelevant stakeholders including drugs and logisticsmanagement Phase 15: OR Proposal tracking system Phase 16: GIS mapping of DR-TB cases & TB cases notified Tills Sept 2012, more than 2,00,000 patients are already registered under this system. 6.4.4 TB Notification in India6.4.4.a BackgroundTuberculosis was never a notifiable disease nationally in India. Though in some of the states it was for quite along time, it was never properly implemented due to manyreasons. India's National TB Control programme providesquality assured diagnostic and treatment services to allthe TB patients including necessary supportivemechanisms for ensuring treatment adherence andcompletion. But these services cannot be made availableto large number of patients availing services from privatesector, as they are not currently reported to theprogramme. The National Programme is unable to supportTB patients and facilitate effective treatment as there isno information on TB and M/XDR TB diagnosis andtreatment in private sector and unable to monitor and actfor this looming epidemic. The country has a huge privatesector and it is growing at enormous pace. Private sectorAnnual Report 2012-13 100predominates in health care and TB treatment. Extremely large quantities of anti-TB drugs are sold in the private sector. Poor prescribing practices among private providerswith inappropriate and inadequate regimens and unsupervised treatment continues in private sector without supporting patient for ensuring treatment adherence andcompletion with unrestricted access to first and second line TB drugs without prescription. High cost of TB and M/XDR TB drugs for privately treated patients is leadingto further poverty and treatment interruptions. A large number of patients are not benefitted with these programme services and leads to non adherence,incomplete, inadequate treatment leading to M/XDR TB, mitigating all the efforts of the programme to prevent emergence and spread of drug resistance. If the TBpatients diagnosed and treated under private sector are reported to public health authorities, the mechanisms available under the programme can be extended to thesepatients to ensure treatment adherence and completion. The impending epidemic of M/XDR TB can only be prevented to a large extent by this intervention. To curb this situation, Government of India declared Tuberculosis a notifiable disease on 7th May 2012 with the following objectives. 6.4.4.b Objectives of TB Notification 1. To have establish Tuberculosis surveillance system in the country 2. To extend mechanisms of TB treatment adherence and contact tracing to patients treated in private sector 3. To ensure proper TB diagnosis and case management and further accelerate reduction of TB transmission 4. To mitigate the impeding Drug resistant TB epidemic in the country 6.4.4.c Implementation tools & methods For the purpose of notification, the contact details of the nodal officer at district level and the reporting formats are available on the website www .tbcindia.nic.in. All the health establishments throughout the country in public as well as private and non governmental sector are expectedto notify TB cases.For the purpose of notification the definition of TB cases is as below: Microbiologically-confirmed TB case - Patient diagnosed with at least one sputum specimen positive for acid fastbacilli, or Culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis,or RNTCP-approved Rapid Diagnostic molecular testpositive for tuberculosis. OR Clinical TB case - Patient diagnosed clinically as tuberculosis, without microbiologic confirmation andinitiated on anti-TB drugs. List of RNTCP Staining or - Fluorescence stains and examined under direct or indirect microscopy with or without LED. Culture: - Solid(Lowenstein Jansen) media or - Liquid media (Middle Brook) using manual, semi- automatic or automatic machines e.g. Bactec,MGIT etc. Rapid diagnostic molecular test: - Conventional PCR based Line Probe Assay for MTB complex or - PCR based under direct or indirect microscopy. Sputum Culture: Sputum culture on solid (Lowenstein Jansen) media or liquid media (Middle Brook) usingmanual, semi-automatic or automatic machines e.g.Bactec , MGIT etc. Rapid molecular test: Line MTB or Nucleic (CB-NAAT) 6.4.5 of Joint TB/HIV collaborationSince the advent of the collaborative efforts in 2001, TB- HIV activities have evolved to cover most of therecommendations as per the latest WHO policy statement issued in 2012. In 2007, the first National Framework forAnnual Report 2012-13 101joint TB-HIV collaborative activities was developed which endorsed a differential strategy reflective of theheterogeneity of TB-HIV epidemic. Coordinated TB-HIV interventions were implemented including establishment of a coordinating body at national and state level,dedicated human resources, integration of surveillance, joint monitoring and evaluation, capacity building and operational research. 6.4.5.a Progress in TB / HIV collaboration Tremendous progress has been made in the implementation of collaborative TB/HIV activities. Intensified TB case finding has been implemented nationwide at all HIV testing centers (known as integrated counselling and testing centres, or ICTCs) and has now been extended to all ART centres, with better reporting coming from States implementing the intensified TB-HIV package. 6.4.5.b Challenges in TB-HIV collaboration However, several challenges remain. Only about 50% of TB patients know their HIV status and of those identified as HIV positive, only about 60% are linked to ART as the majority are poor and unable to reach centralized ART centres. As compared to TB services, which are mostly decentralized and integrated into the general healthsystem, HIV services remain largely centralized. Thus, this gap between RNTCP and NACP infrastructure results in suboptimal linkages. Sputum smear microscopy is not a sensitive tool to diagnose TB among PLHIV , and access to a culture based diagnosis (or equivalent technology) is lacking. Implementation of airborne infection control measures in health care settings is alsolimited. The INH preventive therapy is not yet a policy; but is being tested for operational feasibility for further decision. Despite the achievements, the mortality among HIV-infected TB patients continues to be unacceptably high. 6.4.5.c Vision: Universal access to TB/HIV care (2012-17) There may be several reasons for the high mortality among HIV-infected TB patients: these include undiagnosed or late diagnosis of HIV, delayed or missed TB diagnosis among PLHIV, provision of inadequate chemotherapy to drug-resistant TB cases in the contextof unavailability of decentralized culture and DST facilities, late presentation by HIV/TB patients (indicated by low CD4 counts at the time of diagnosis), andoperational issues like long distances to travel for patients and lack of finances resulting in suboptimal linkages tocentralized ART services. Available evidence suggests mortality reduction may be most effectively driven by efficient, early and improved HIV diagnosis, improveddiagnosis of TB among PLHIV and prompt initiation ofART treatment among HIV-infected TB patients.Results from the SAPIT (Starting ART at three points inTB treatment), CAMELIA (Cambodian early versus late initiation of ART) and STRIDE (Strategy immediate) trials have all demonstrated the mortality benefit of earlycompared to deferred initiation of ART during TBtreatment, especially in the subgroup of patients withadvanced immunodeficiency. The National AIDS ControlOrganization's adoption of recent WHO recommendations to treat all HIV-infected TB patients with ART, irrespective of CD4 count, and other measures being putin place to enhance access of HIV-infected TB patientsto ART should help enhance survival. Hence, RNTCPand NACP (National AIDS Control Programme) havejointly planned the following interventions in their next strategic plans (2012-17): 1. Given the need to strengthen collaborative efforts, the next five-years would focus on reinforcingmechanisms for ensuring effectiveimplementation and improving service delivery for TB and HIV infected patients. 2. Decentralization of HIV testing facilities and co- location in all TB microscopy centres has beenplanned to ensure universal coverage of HIVtesting among TB patients. 3. Early and improved diagnosis of TB and Rifampicin resistance, through rapid diagnostic technology for PLHIV is envisaged. Field-testingand deployment of improved TB diagnostic drug-resistant TB among PLHIV is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality. 4. Measures to improve access of HIV-infected TB patients to ART centres by provision of travelsupport and engagement with the affectedcommunity have been planned. 5. Early initiation of ART for all PLHIV with CD4 counts of <350, and for all HIV-infected TBAnnual Report 2012-13 102patients irrespective of CD4 count. Early initiation of ART is expected to improve immunecompetency and prevent the development of TB. 6. Recording and reporting formats have been modified to optimize supervision and monitoringof implementation of TB/HIV collaborativeactivities. 7. More than half of PLHIV globally and in India do not know their HIV status and are diagnosedlate. Initial results of research into the feasibilityof \"PITC among TB suspects\" as a method ofachieving early and improved diagnosis of HIVhas been promising, and broader surveillance isplanned to drive policy decisions. Again, earlierHIV diagnosis can broaden opportunities for HIVcare and treatment, including TB prevention. 8. The National Technical Working Group for TB/ HIV has approved an operational feasibility cumefficacy study for Isoniazid Preventive treatmentamong PLHIV . The study will be led by NationalInstitute for Research in TB (earlier TRC,Chennai) and conducted in 12 ART centres inthe country. The results of this study will guidenationwide scale-up. 6.4.5.d Operational Research for TB-HIVRNTCP conducted an operational research on provider initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) among TBsuspects based on recommendation of National TechnicalWorking Group (NTWG). The study was conducted inone district each of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka(Vizianagaram and Mandya), with an objective to assessif PITC was feasible and effective in finding out \"new\"HIV cases given that all TB suspects were offered HIVtesting. This study showed that HIV prevalence amongTB suspects can be as high as that among TB patientsranging between 7%-10%, and also that PITC can befeasibly implemented in settings with decentralized HIVtesting facilities. Acknowledging the strong evidence,NTWG recommended the national programmes toimplement PITC among TB suspects in high HIV settings;the same would be piloted in 1-2 high prevalence statesat all DMC with co-located HIV testing facility for aperiod of 3-6 months with mechanisms for recording andreporting to finalize the operational guidance before scale-up to other high HIV settings. The NTWG alsorecommended national programmes to implement similarsurveillance activities in moderate and low HIV settings.Accordingly, protocols have been developed and surveillance has been initiated in 10 districts of the country. Evidence generated from these studies will guide scale-up across the country. 6.4.5.e Global guidelines for treatment of TB among persons living with HIV: unresolved issues Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) in India uses a fully intermittent thrice-weekly rifampicin-containing regimen for all TB patients including those who are HIV-infected; whereas, WHO recommends daily TB treatment at least during the intensive phase. The WHOrecommendation was based on the results of a meta- analysis demonstrating increased risk of recurrence and failure among HIV-infected TB patients receivingintermittent TB treatment, compared to a daily regimen. Review of the primary evidence indicates limited, low- quality information on intermittency, mostly fromobservational studies in the pre-antiretroviral treatment (ART) era. Molecular epidemiology in India indicates that most of the recurrences and many of the failures resultedfrom exogenous re-infection, suggesting poor infection control and high transmission rather than poor regimen efficacy. Subsequently published studies have shownacceptable TB treatment outcomes among HIV-infected TB patients receiving intermittent anti-TB regimens with concomitant ART. Treatment outcomes among HIV-infected TB patients treated under programmatic conditions show low failure rates but high case-fatality; death has been associated with lack of ART. Hence, thehighest priority is to reduce mortality by linking all HIV- infected TB patients to ART. While urgently seeking to reduce death rates among HIV-infected TB patients,given the poor evidence for change and operational advantages of an intermittent regimen, RNTCP intends to collect the necessary evidence to inform national policydecisions through randomized clinical trials. 6.4.6 Childhood tuberculosis under RNTCP Background: The actual burden of pediatric TB is not known due to diagnostic difficulties but has been assumed that 10% of total TB load is found in children. Globally, about 1 million cases of pediatric TB are estimated tooccur every year accounting for 10-15% of all TB; with more than 100,000 estimated deaths every year, it is one of the top 10 causes of childhood mortality. Though MDR-TB and XDR-TB is documented among pediatric age group, there are no estimates of overall burden, chieflyAnnual Report 2012-13 103because of diagnostic difficulties and exclusion of children in most of the drug resistance surveys. Contrary to traditional national TB programmes pediatric tuberculosis (i.e., TB among the population aged less than 15 years) has always been accorded high priority by RNTCP since the inception of the programme. In order to simplify the management of pediatric TB, RNTCP in association with Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) hasdescribed criteria for suspecting TB among children, has separate algorithms for diagnosing pulmonary TB and peripheral TB lymphadenitis and a strategy for treatment and monitoring patients who are on treatment. In brief, TB diagnosis is based on clinical features, smearexamination of sputum where this is available, positive family history, tuberculin skin testing, chest radiography and histopathological examination as appropriate. The treatment strategy comprises three key components. First, as in adults, children with TB are classified, categorised, registered and treated with intermittent short-course chemotherapy (thrice-weekly therapy from treatmentinitiation to completion), given under direct observation of a treatment provider (DOT provider) and the disease status is monitored during the course of treatment. Second, based on their pre- treatment weight, children are assigned to one of pre-treatment weight bands andare treated with good quality anti-TB drugs through ''ready-to-use'' patient wise boxes containing the patients' complete course of anti-TB drugs are made available to every registered TB patient according to programme guidelines. Progress 1. The number of pediatric TB cases registered under RNTCP has shown an increasing trend in the past five years and for 2011, about 90,000 cases were notified accounting for 7% of all cases. Expectedly, smear negative and EP cases predominate. 2. Treatment for MDR-TB for children is now available under the programme and a new weight band (<16kg) has been created. 3. The treatment outcomes of pediatric TB cases, though not reported routinely under theprogramme, have been studied in operational research settings. Operational research conducted in the states of Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat reported very high treatment successrates (about 95% among new TB cases) among pediatric TB patients indicating the effectiveness of RNTCP regimens and management guidelines. National consultation on management of childhood tuberculosis in 2012 In order to reconcile between global and national guidelines, to review the evidence base and update the RNTCP guidelines in consensus with Indian academy of paediatrics, a national consultation was organized in January 2012. The above mentioned issues wereextensively deliberated and several changes have been recommended in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of childhood TB. National Technical Working Group on Pediatric TB, a mechanism for continuing consultation: A national technical working group of 10-12 experts on pediatric TB is constituted with clearly defined terms ofreference . This provides a forum for continuing consultations with experts and an opportunity to evolve the guidelines based on evolving evidence. 6.4.7 Medical Colleges Systematic involvement of medical colleges under RNTCP has been a huge success story. Under RNTCP Medical Colleges play important roles in service delivery, advocacy, training and operational research. Medical colleges have been effectively organized at a large scale through task force mechanisms at state, zonal and national levels, with RNTCP supporting with additional human resources, logistics for microscopy, funds to conductsensitizations, trainings and research in RNTCP priority areas. RNTCP has partnered with 291 Medical Colleges in India and in 2011 they have contributed in a major way in finding more TB cases, especially smear negative and extra - pulmonary cases. In 2011, 87,271 cases, 49,031 smear-negative TB cases and 83,824 extra-pulmonary TB cases were diagnosed at medical colleges and referred for treatment; altogether, this accounts for about 15% of all cases diagnosed and registered for treatment in the country. 656 faculty members from Medical Colleges are trained as master trainers, these trained human resource available in themedical colleges are supporting program beyond the academics and participating in the National as well as local training as facilitators for over 338 CMEs and workshops as part of advocacy efforts and also participating in Internal Evaluations and appraisals. 243Annual Report 2012-13 104Medical Colleges are running ICTC, 154 ART centres and 240 of Medical Colleges having standard cross referrals between RNTCP and ICTC/ART centers. 6.4.8 New Initiatives in Public-Private Mix (PPM) National Technical Working Group (NTWG) has been formed to provide a forum for dialogue and guide innovation and learning & provide guidance on technical aspects such as the appropriate diagnostic and treatmentstandards, guidance on the scope and geographic distribution of initial projects, and policy requirements for improved PPM. MoU has been signed with Indian Pharmaceutical Association (IPA), All India Organisation of Chemists & Druggists (AIOCD), Pharmacy Councilof India (PCI) and SEARPharm Forum representing World Health Organization (WHO) - International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Forum of NationalAssociations in South-East Asia for engaging pharmacists in RNTCP for TB Care & Control in India. Special focus activities include promoting the rational use of Anti-TBdrugs and contributing to preventing the emergence of drug resistance. The First Meeting of the Core Committee held in October 2012. 6.4.9 Financial Performance XI th plan (2007-12) Year-wise Details of RNTCP budget Allocation and expenditure: 6.5 NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR CONTROL OF BLINDNESS (NPCB) 6.5.1 Background National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) was launched in the year 1976 as a 100% centrally sponsored scheme with the goal of reducing the prevalence of blindness to 0.3% by 2020. Rapid Surveyon Avoidable Blindness conducted under NPCB during 2006-07 showed reduction in the prevalence of blindness from 1.1% (2001-02) to 1% (2006-07). Main causes of blindness are (62.6%) Refractive (4.70%), Others (4.19%) Estimated National Prevalence of Childhood Blindness / Low Vision is 0.80 per thousand. The allocation for the 11 th Plan (2007-12) was Rs.1250.00 crore. The allocation for the current financial year (2012- 13) is Rs.290.00 crore. 6.5.2 Main objectives of the programme a) To reduce the backlog of blindness through identification and treatment of blind; b) To develop Comprehensive Eye Care facilities in every district; c) To develop human resources for providing Eye Care Services; d) To improve quality of service delivery; e) To secure participation of V oluntary Organizations/Private Practitioners in eye Care; f) To enhance community awareness on eye care. 6.5.3 Salient features/strategies adopted to achieve the objectives Provision of assistance to make eye care programme comprehensive by covering diseasesother than cataract like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, corneal transplantation, vitreo-retinal surgery, treatment of childhood blindness etc. Reduction in the backlog of blind persons by active screening of population above 50 years, organizing screening eye camps and transporting operable cases to fixed eye care facilities Coverage of underserved area for eye care services through public-private partnership.
