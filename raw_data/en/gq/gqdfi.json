The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:30 p.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Weldon, Waxman, Maloney, Kucinich, Tierney, Carrillo, coun- sel; Rethmeier, communications director; Allyson Blandford, as-sistant Briggs, chief clerk; Robin Butler,officer manager; Joshua E. Gillespie, deputy chief chiefclerk; and Jean Gosa and Earley Green, minority assistant clerks. Mr. B URTON . Good afternoon. A quorum being present, the Com- mittee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimousconsent that all Members and witnesses' written and opening state-ments be included in the record. And without objection so ordered.I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits and extraneousor tabular material referred to be included in the record. And with-out objection so ordered. Because my good friend Mr. Waxman has to leave at 2 and be- cause my opening statement is going to include a couple of clips onvideo, I've asked him if he'd like to go ahead and make his openingstatement first, and he'd like to do that. So we'll let him start offand then I'll go into the details I want to go into in my openingstatement. Mr. Waxman.Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the courtesy of al- lowing me to go first in the opening statements. There is a Demo-cratic Caucus meeting at the same time as this committee hearingand it's unfortunate the scheduling conflict exists. So I wanted to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr statement. I unfortunately won't be able to be here for the testimony of many of the witnesses. Mr. Chairman, in my lifetime polio has gone from every parents' fear to being a distant memory. Measles epidemics are few and farbetween. Congenital rubella, which can cause blindness, deafness,and autism, is increasingly rare. In just the last decade the mostcommon causes of bacterial meningitis in young children have beencontrolled. We have vaccines to thank for these incredible accom-plishments. While millions of American children have been protected by im- munization, no vaccine is 100 percent safe. The government mustensure that these vaccines are as safe as they can be, insist thatvaccines are only administered when the benefit greatly outweighsthe risk, and provide those who are injured with quick and faircompensation. Today's hearing will focus on the allegation that routine child- hood immunizations cause autism. Too often in this debate, though,solid public health information gets lost among sensational allega-tions or in recent days disgraceful political acts that are intendedto protect special interests. This committee, unfortunately, hasplayed a role in sowing confusion. Mr. Chairman, I think you've been well intentioned in your ef- forts and genuine in your convictions, but often your theories havejust been wrong. Two years ago, for instance, this committee pub-licized allegations that the measles-mumps-rubella, MMR, vaccinecauses autism. This allegation frightened many parents. But theallegation has been disproven by scientific evidence. Studies in Eu-rope and here in the United States by the Institute of Medicinehave concluded that the MMR vaccine is not associated with au-tism and there should be no confusion about that. Mr. Chairman, you've repeatedly, and rightly in my view, asked for more scientific studies so that we can know as much as possibleabout any adverse health consequences from vaccines. But it's im-portant for our committee to pay attention to those studies oncethey are completed. In fact, it's important that parents know abouttwo recently concluded peer-reviewed research reports. The first,which appeared in a recent issue of New England Journal of Medi-cine, examined the theory that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinecauses autism. Concerns about a potential link have terrified Brit-ish parents and have resulted in measles outbreaks in the UnitedKingdom because of the children who are not getting vaccinated. At previous committee hearings some Members and witnesses have called for a comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinatedchildren in testing the safety of this vaccine. Well, this comparisonis exactly what the New England Journal of Medicine study pro-vides. It found no increase in autism among those children whowere vaccinated compared to those who were not. The commentarythat accompanied the study said that this study should put to restparents' concerns over the safety of the MMR vaccine. A second peer-reviewed research report was published in the Lancet 2 weeks ago. This study addressed the theory that thimero-sal, a mercury based vaccine preservative, causes children to sufferneurological damage, including autism. In this study researchersmeasured the amount of mercury in the bloodstream of recently VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr They found that this level does not exceed safe values in any child. The commentary that accompanied this studysaid it provided, ''comforting reassurance.'' It should be reassuringto parents that thimerosal has been removed from all routine vac-cine immunizations except for the recently recommended flu vac-cine and that additional studies on thimerosal are under way.These two research reports, with more research under way, aregood news for public health. And I ask that these studies and thecommentaries be included in the record. Mr. Chairman, if I\u2014\u2014Mr. B URTON . Without objection. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you. The vaccines are an essential part of child health and parents should know that leading experts such asthe CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to rec-ommend that children receive all vaccines currently approved forroutine use. Now, I know that we have witnesses today who are going to in- clude\u2014the list of witnesses are going to include some scientiststhat dispute these findings. Now, that's appropriate for them todispute the findings. And in fact many of them dispute the findingsat the peer-reviewed meetings that resulted in these two studies.If scientists have scientific arguments, they should take it up withtheir scientific peer members. That's how scientific evaluation pro-ceeds: Theories, evidence, contradictions, discussions, and then aconsensus and then a challenge to that consensus. But this commit-tee and politicians in the Congress are not the ones to make sci-entific decisions. And those who are in the minority and disagreewith the scientific conclusions of their peers should challenge theirpeers by additional scientific arguments in evidence. I want tomake that point very, very clearly, because what we have in thishearing is one of a series of hearings where we had a political argu-ment that's being made which seems to be refuted by the scientificevidence, and the answer to that is more political arguments andhearings, and I fear that these hearings only scare people withoutscientific arguments to back them up. Now, the bad news for vaccine safety\u2014the good news is these two studies reassure us about the vaccines, but the bad news forvaccine safety, however, has come on the political front. During therecent passage of the homeland security bill the Republican leader-ship snuck in two vaccine-related provisions that help industry anddo nothing to help people who are injured by vaccines. The first ofthese provisions gave manufactures of the smallpox vaccine andhospitals that administer the vaccine virtually complete immunityfrom lawsuits but does nothing to compensate people who suffervaccine-related injuries or death. The net result is that Republicanshave managed to protect everyone but those who need the protec-tion the most. Imagine an emergency room worker who is vac-cinated against smallpox in order to protect the rest of us in caseof a bioterrorist attack. If this hero or heroine on the front linesbecome incapacitated by the vaccine, he or she has no guaranteeof compensation for his or her sacrifice. This is completely unac-ceptable. Republicans also snuck in another vaccine-related provision into the homeland security bill that has no bearing on homeland secu- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 protection for Eli Lilly, a man- ufacture and distributor of thimerosal. The provision was cherrypicked from a list of recommendations made by an expert panelthat overseas the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Not in-cluded in the homeland security bill were those recommendationsmade by this same expert panel that helped families and children,including increasing the death benefit, doubling the statute of limi-tations for the program, and allowing the program to pay for familycounseling. Here's a telling fact: The Republican leadership is so embar- rassed by what they did that they won't even admit about whatthey've done. After the thimerosal provision was put in the bill,House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the provision was put inat the request of the White House. But when I wrote to the WhiteHouse about this the White House claimed the idea originated inCongress. But to this day, not a single Member of the Republicanleadership will admit responsibility for this provision. I don't know what kind of values these actions represent, but they are not the values that I want to have any part of. They putthe interests of powerful and wealthy special interest ahead of fam-ilies with children suffering from debilitating illnesses. This is anembarrassment to the Congress and to our great country. As we revisit these issues in the next Congress I hope that Re- publicans when considering changes to the Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program do not forget that the purpose of the programis to help families not just to reduce the liability for industry; I alsohope that the politics of vaccine safety reinforce rather than under-mine the success of immunization. The lesson from the homelandsecurity bill is not that people should fear that the smallpox vac-cine is always dangerous or believe the allegations that thimerosalcauses autism; the lesson is that protecting industry alone is unac-ceptable, both as public policy and principle. I thank the witnesses that are going to be here today\u2014I know this is a hearing where they've been asked to testify. I'm going tohave a chance to review the record of the testimony. And I'll lookforward to reviewing the record but I want to underscore again sci-entific issues should be decided by scientific principles and evi-dence, not by politics and not by presenting discredited minorityviews that have not yet been able to prevail in scientific evaluationas if they were fact and as a result scare a lot of people to do some-thing that would be more harmful than helpful. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy in allow- ing me to make this statement, and I'll look forward to reviewingthe record. Mr. B URTON . Let me just say before Mr. Waxman leaves he's been a big help in trying to change the vaccine injury compensationfund to be more responsive, and I do appreciate that. The one thingthat I would like to say though is that Mr. Waxman does have alot of other responsibilities and as such he has had to leave a num-ber of times before we go into the details about scientific researchthat shows conflicting information. And I know that he reads thesedocuments but I think sitting here and hearing the scientists fromaround the world that we've had come before us might give you alittle different perspective, and I'm very sorry that you're not going VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr able to be here today and have not been here for some of the witnesses that I think might have piqued your interest, maybe dis-suaded you from some of the positions you've taken. Nevertheless,you're my buddy. I'm glad you work with me. Mr. W AXMAN . Will you yield to me? Thank you very much for your comments. I have had a chance to review the testimony of wit-nesses. I've had my staff very much involved in this issue. I've beeninvolved in vaccine issues for at least 20 years in the Congress ofthe United States. And if you come in with a preconceived idea andhear witnesses say what you believe to be the case, I'm sure it reaf-firms your views. But I think still these issues of science ought tobe decided by the scientific method. That's the thing that's goingto protect us. I thank you for letting me make the statement.Mr. B URTON . I will send to your office, it will only take you about 20 minutes, I have a couple of tapes I would like for you to takea look at. I will let Mr. Weldon go next and I'll let my colleagues speak as well because I am going to take a little bit of time about my open-ing statement. I don't want to be discourteous to them. So Dr.Weldon. Mr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to commend you for calling this hearing and I specifically want to commend youfor your willingness to explore this issue. If scientists behavedpurely like scientists and did purely objective research all the time,then the comments made by Mr. Waxman would be valid. The re-ality is scientists and medical researchers operate with a system ofbiases that frankly can be very, very politicized. And the claimsthat were made by the ranking member that these issues essen-tially have been put to rest I don't believe are valid. Specificallywhen you look at the issue of the MMR, the Danish study, the datafrom the Danish study which he was referring to, which I'm surewe're going to hear more about today from our witnesses, was valu-able but it didn't really get at answering the question of reallylooking at kids with regressive autism. I don't think the opinion ofthis committee has ever been that mercury per se or the MMR perse causes autism, and I think the general consensus of scientificopinion is that this is probably a multifactorial disease. And whilethe Danish study provided some valuable information, really itdidn't answer the question, I think, of regressive autism. And the other thing that was very disturbing about the Danish study is they documented a tenfold increase in the incidence of au-tism in Denmark. There's absolutely no comment in the New Eng-land Journal about that issue. And let me just say I share Mr. Waxman's sentiments on vac- cines. Vaccinations and septic systems have probably done more tosave hundreds of millions of lives in the civilized world than any-thing else, and we all need to be very, very grateful to these tre-mendous breakthroughs in vaccinations. But there's, I think, somevery, very troubling issues that have not been resolved. The thingthat I continue to find extremely disturbing is the fact that theCDC still does not allow researchers access to the vaccine safetydata. If everything was so objective and any scientist at all canlook at this stuff, it would be one thing, but they continue to deny VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr to this information. And until we get a free and open dialog within the scientific community, I don't think, for one, I willever be satisfied that there isn't some data suggesting that somechildren may have serious side effects from some of these vaccinesthat is really going undetected, unnoticed and they may actuallycause autism. Let me just conclude by saying that the issue with the MMR that got all this started was a clinical study, and the Danish study isagain another epidemiologic study. And a clinical study is very,very cheap and easy to do but nobody seems to want to do it. Wehad somebody at one of our previous hearings, a Dr. Kriegsmanfrom New York, who had replicated some of Wakefield's workshowing that these kids are developing inflammatory bowel dis-ease, and then he wanted to do the next step, he wanted to actuallydo the pathologic analysis on these biopsy specimens, and the insti-tution that he worked at said, no, they don't want to get into it,this is too controversial. So if everything was so objective and scientific like Mr. Waxman is saying, why do you have a major institution in New York Citysaying, no, we don't want to get into that? You know, to a certain extent the problem is we're trying to in- vestigate a sacred cow. For a lot of people in the medical commu-nity, there's this tremendous fear. If you say anything negativeabout vaccines, then parents will stop vaccinating their kids andthen you'll have all these outbreaks of these diseases. I don't thinkparents are that stupid. I think parents will continue to vaccinatetheir kids. We have a responsibility to them to really find out ifthere's truth in all this. I don't think the answers are in, and Idon't think this mercury study really helps us that much either. Itprovides\u2014let my just say it's a great study and we're going to hearmore about the mercury study because it gives us data in an arenawhere we had no data, so I'm thankful for that, but basically stud-ies 40 kids. We don't know if the kids that get autism in responseto mercury are kids who don't handle the mercury properly. AndI don't think the ranking member was accurate at all to say thatthis puts this issue to rest. Frankly, I've been very, very surprisedat his attitude in all this because before I got here I had an imageof him as being somebody who would really go after all these toxinissues and all these pollution issues, and ethyl mercury, which iswhat thimerosal disassociates into, is chemically very, very similarto methyl mercury in its structure. It's very, very bothersome whenyou follow the vaccine\u2014well, it's not in the vaccines anymore, buta few years ago when you followed the vaccine schedule you weregiving kids doses 10, 20, 30 times the toxic dosage for these kids.And the recent\u2014I guess it was in the Lancet study that looked atthese kids and looked at excretions, I think it was a very valuablestudy but it doesn't answer the question that the kids that becomeautistic may be the kids that don't process the thimerosal properly,and that study only had 40 kids in it. So I say to you, Mr. Chairman, keep it up. I would like to see you get a subcommittee chairmanship in the next Congress and I'dlike you to continue pushing this vaccine safety issue until we getanswers to some these questions, until the CDC starts opening upthat VSD data to independent researchers. You know, in Florida VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr this thing called a sunshine law. What everybody says is sunshine is the best antiseptic. The best way to get answers on thevaccine safety data is to open it up and let objective scientists comein and look at it. If these vaccines aren't that safe then that willbe validated. I think I've gone more than 5 minutes, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you. I yield back. Mr. B URTON . Just to followup on what you said, the Justice De- partment filed a motion asking the Special Master to keep all infor-mation secret, and that follows along with what you're talkingabout. That's very disconcerting to me. Mr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman, if I could just interject one other point. I objected to the language that was put in the Homeland Se-curity Act on protecting the vaccine producers. And you know, Mr.Waxman just said that these studies show that it's safe and thenhe criticized us for protecting, he criticized Republican leadershipfor protecting the manufacturers. If what he said is true, thatthey're safe, then why should he be critical of us protecting themanufacturers? The truth is that language shouldn't have been inthere. I objected to it and I think you objected to it as well, andit was a Member of the Senate who put that language in there.And I'm ready to work with Mr. Waxman and all the other Mem-bers on the minority side when we try to move that vaccine safetybill in the next Congress. I know Senator Snowe is very, very inter-ested in doing something about this, and I think we can fix thisissue. And the one thing that Mr. Waxman said which is correct is that we need to make sure the kids are protected. But I might say thatif mercury isn't a problem and if MMR isn't a problem, then, youknow, why should he be concerned that language was in there? Ithink the language should be changed. I'm ready to work with you,Mr. Chairman and Mr. Waxman, to try to fix it. Mr. B URTON . Very good. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. K UCINICH . As I listen to the debate and have listened to it over this past year between two individuals who I respect mosthighly in this Congress, Chairman Burton and Mr. Waxman, itcauses me to reflect on how is it possible that you can get two peo-ple who care so much about this country and whose dedication tothe people is unquestioned and revered, how Mr. Waxman, for ex-ample, who's been the champion in Congress in challenging the to-bacco companies, long before anyone thought about it, understoodthe health questions that were involved, and built a national rep-utation around that. And on the other hand you have ChairmanBurton, who I happen to believe has been far ahead of the rest ofthe country in raising issues about the safety of vaccines, andrightly so, how is it you can get this kind of conflict. Here's how I think it happens: There are really profoundly dif- ferent philosophical views on how knowledge is organized and Ithink it is reflected here, and I think it's worth thinking aboutwhen we think about the debate that goes on here. One approachdeals in allopathic medicine, another one respected holistic medi-cine. One approach is linear, the other one is nonlinear in its think-ing. One is rational, the other one is intuitive. The one approachis deductive, the other one is inductive. Neither is VerDate 11-MAY-2000 different ways of looking at the world. They often can lead to the discovery of matters that are urgent to the public inter-est, which is why I'm here to state my support for the efforts ofChairman Burton. He's been courageous and he has gone forwardwith dedication and persistence, and his commitment to the searchfor a cause for autism has provided leadership toward a goal thatwill eventually help not only his own family but also thousands ofindividuals with autism throughout the world. I want to thank the witnesses who have researched studies and experienced firsthand the effects of autism. As you know, autismspectrum disorders present a significant problem to our youth. TheCenters for Disease Control estimates almost 400,000 children areaffected by autism. Equally disturbing are estimates by the Inter-national Child Development Resource Center that autism-relatedcosts will exceed 1 trillion in the next 50 years. $1 trillion. As therates of autism appear to be increasing in many States, autism pre-sents a problem of profound significance to all of us. It is essentialthat we continue to address this issue. The NIH has taken significant steps to find answers with an international effort that brought together researchers from Canada,Britain, France and Germany to study causes and mechanisms ofautism. From this research theories about the connection betweenautism and vaccines are being developed, providing possible cluesthat bring us closer to the answers we seek. The NIH should beapplauded for these efforts. At the same time we must recognizethe research is ongoing. It is by no means complete. The Institute of Medicine reports that the report that was pub- lished last year concluded, ''the evidence is inadequate to accept orreject a causal relationship between exposure to thimerosal fromvaccines and neurological development, disorders of autism, ADHD,speech and language delays.'' It also called for more research. Fromthis report and other recent research it could be possible that thi-merosal is a contributing factor in autism. And unless we have fo-rums like this, there is no way to move that discussion and thateffort forward. With these conclusions in mind, it's unjust that an exemption has been provided to vaccine manufacturers in the homeland secu-rity bill in sections 1714 to 1717. This exemption will effectivelyshield vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits from claimants that al-lege injury from thimerosal containing vaccines. Even those claim-ants involved in pending litigation will be forced to drop their law-suits and begin a new process through the Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program. While I believe that the Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program is largely a good program, it is in need of re-form and I support the chairman's legislation to make needed re-form, H.R. 3741. The exemption that slipped into the homeland security bill will deny many thimerosal injury claimants redress because the currentlaw governing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program imposesa 3-year statute of limitations. This will restrict the number ofclaimants that can seek redress for their injuries. The overall effectof the sections 1714 to 1717 will be that many claimants will beprevented from seeking recourse through the judicial system andsome claimants are prevented from any sort of redress. Meanwhile, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr are ultimately responsible will be shielded from that responsibility. Both the substance of these provisions and theprocess in which they were added were wrong. I know, Mr. Chairman, you share my concerns. You addressed these passionately on the floor of the House and addressed to theHouse on the day that the House passed the homeland security leg-islation and emphasized over and over these same points. Thiscommittee has investigated this issue in depth over the past 3years. Should this committee have introduced legislation to repealsections 1714 to 1717? And I hope the committee takes the lead onthis issue. Well, sections 1714 to 1717 may be just one issue of the many that this committee has investigated relating to autism. I look for-ward to reading the testimony of the witnesses as it relates to sev-eral vaccines and the work of a number of government agencies. I thank the witnesses for their work, hope to continue to improve the way our government addresses autism and want to say that Iam proud to be on a committee that is chaired by Dan Burton andI'm proud to be brought to this committee by my dear friend HenryWaxman. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich follows:] VerDate very much. Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. M ALONEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to thank you and Ranking Member Waxman for focusing on this importantissue. I would especially like to thank you, Chairman Burton, foryour determination, courage and long time commitment to inves-tigating an issue that I know is very personal to him, autism. MayI also say that I have often been on the other side of issues withChairman Burton. We don't always agree, but I have seen his dog-ged determination firsthand and if anyone can get to the truth onthis issue, he can, and I applaud your effort, Chairman Burton. I have understood from the Republican staff that in his opening statement the chairman will detail a chronology of events sur-rounding autism research and the role of the Federal Government.But I do not believe that his presentation will include what I thinkwas an outrageous abuse of legislative power, the Majority LeaderDick Armey's gift to Eli Lilly that added last minute provisions inthe Department of Homeland Security bill. These provisions thatwere added in the dark of night deny families of autistic childrenthe right to file suits seeking compensation from manufacturers ofthimerosal. Let me be very clear the new law blocks pending litigation against the manufacturers of this mercury based preservative, thi-merosal, being brought by the families of autistic children. The newlaw forces families to seek relief from the Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program. The New York times called the leadership'slate addition, ''an abuse of congressional process.'' And I believethis is an understatement and I request unanimous permission toplace in the record the editorial from the Times. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, we'll do that. [The information VerDate in yesterday's Wash- ington Post. Donna Brinker, the mother of an autistic son namedThomas, said, ''I believe in protecting our homeland but it petrifiesme to think that our nation would protect any industry at the ex-pense of our children.'' And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to add yes-terday's Post story likewise to the record. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 The Homeland Security bill was not the right place to change existing law governing vaccines and certainly notvaccines that have absolutely nothing, absolutely nothing to dowith homeland security, and it certainly isn't the way to change ex-isting law. Rewriting public policy in the middle of the night with-out proper notice, without regular order, without hearings, real leg-islative policy should not be made this way. It is inexcusable andflies in the face of the principles of open and just government. Another part of the scandal, and I considered it a scandal, is for days we couldn't find out how this happened. At least and finallyMr. Armey finally came forward days later and claimed credit forthe inclusion of the language at the request of the White House.I would not want to claim credit for what one editorial called,''sneaky, backhanded and anonymous.'' But what I would reallylike to know and to learn from these hearings is what is Eli Lilly,this pharmaceutical company, so worried about? Why do they needthis new protection? Hopefully we will learn some of what they areworried about today from our distinguished panelists and sci-entists. Autism and the growing rates of autism among our children is a serious issue that deserves sincere deliberation and attentionfrom this Congress. I am proud to have been part of a bipartisancommitment and coalition that has worked for the past 5 years todouble the funding for the National Institutes of Health, the re-search arm for health. We worked to double it from $13.6 billionin fiscal year 1998 and when we finally get a budget in 2003, if itgoes forward as planned, it will have climbed to $27.3. The hopeis that these strong investments in biomedical research will spurscientific advances that will ultimately translate into better healthcare for the American people, including a better understanding ofautism and vaccine safety. We do not have a consensus in the sci-entific community as to the cause of autism. More research andfunding is needed to investigate this troubling health issue. I wholeheartedly support Chairman Burton's quality call for a White House conference on autism. We need continued robust re-search for the sake of our children. We need to know more. AndI congratulate your efforts on focusing on this important healthissue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of mytime. [The prepared statement of Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. My good friend down there at the other end, Mr. Tierney. Mr. T IERNEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Once again I thank you for holding hearings that are both relevant and important to ourcountry. Mr. B URTON . Before you start I want to thank you and your col- leagues from Massachusetts for being so hospitable to us when wewere up there recently. Mr. T IERNEY . We were happy to do it. That is just one of the top- ics that we dealt with recently under your leadership in dealingwith the FBI and its culture and conduct and the importance ofmaking sure that agency is in fact protecting the interest of theAmerican people and not working against them. Similarly here you've shown some great leadership in bringing this issue to the forefront of the American public's consciousness.Everywhere we've seen an increase in the number of incidents ofautism, and my community is no different than any others. We'veseen a tremendous increase, oftentimes concentrated in very par-ticular areas, inexplicably so. While that awareness has led to agreat community response, and we have many people that havebeen working on this issue trying to support the families that haveto care for people with autism, making sure that centers are estab-lished and facilities are available and people are there to work withthe families and with the children, and the children, in particularas the children get older, in dealing with the situation of what hap-pens with their future, that's not enough. Obviously we have an ob-ligation to try and find out as a government, encourage and sup-port the scientific research and try to find out what is the cause,must determine that, to educate families so that the research isavailable to deal with autism within their family and to find eithera cure or some way to prevent autism from impacting us in the ex-tent that it has. The resources to do this have to match the propor-tion of the situation. I'm not sure at all that they do. And I think, Mr. Chairman, that you're right to raise that ques- tion, where have we been on this issue, are we projecting forwardenough so that we give it the attention that it needs? Are we doingthe right kinds of studies and has our government been doing his-torically what it needs to do to address these situations and willit be equipped to move forward as we look into the future? I thinkthese are all important questions. This is obviously a growing con-cern to many communities. For those of us that won't be able to stay for the whole hearing I want to thank our witnesses for their written testimony, whichwill be reviewed and which will inform us, I'm sure, in the direc-tion we take. I want to close just again, Mr. Chairman, by thanking you for your hard work in this area. I know it's a great personal concernto you. I think that you've moved beyond your own personal con-cern to embrace the concern that it has for many people across thiscounty, and I thank you for that. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Tierney. Before you leave, at the end of my opening statement I was going to show two clips, but I'dlike for you to see them before you leave. It will just take a fewminutes. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 you to start off by showing the clip of what happens to brain tissue when it comes in contact with just a minute amountof mercury. Can you start with that one? Then I want you to showa brief tape showing what happens to a child who becomes autistic. [Tape played.]Mr. B URTON . Now that was a very low level of mercury that was introduced into that study. And we continue to inject or we havebeen continuing to inject our children with thimerosal, which doescontain mercury. I don't know how anybody who could watch thatand know that has validity could doubt that there's a very strongpossibility that has had a debilitating impact not only on childrenbut on senior citizens. Scientists believe, as was stated in thatshow, that it's a contributing factor to Alzheimer's, which hasgrown dramatically in recent years. With that I want to show you, because a lot of people don't know before I make my opening statement, I want you to see what hap-pens to a child who becomes autistic. I want you to bear in mindwhy I feel so strongly about this, because my grandson was a nor-mal child and 2 days after he got nine shots in 1 day, several ofwhich contained thimerosal, mercury, 40 some times the amountthat was tolerable in an adult, he started exactly like this child.This is what parents are going through all across this country andthey have no recourse. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund hasa 3-year statute of limitations. If they don't know within that 3-year period that their child may have been affected by these vac-cines, they're out of luck, and they have no place to go but thecourts. And the language that my colleagues talked about that wasput in the homeland security bill blocks them from ever gettingrestitution. And those people, some are selling their homes, they'respending their life savings, working day and night trying to takecare of their kids, and it's just wrong, and our government has to'fess up to this. And if the pharmaceutical companies are respon-sible, then some way they have to aid in the compensation of thesepeople, either through additional moneys going into the victims'Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund or some other way. And theVaccine Injury Compensation Fund needs to be revisited very soonso that these people have access to it. To leave them high and dryis criminal, in my opinion. Now I want you to see what these parents are going through with these kids. [Tape played.]Mr. B URTON . I could let you watch more of that but I think you get the general idea. Now my grandson and thousands of childrenacross this country were normal kids and they got vaccinated withmultiple vaccines. And mercury in the brain has a cumulative ef-fect; all scientists will tell you that it doesn't wash out easily. Itgets in the fatty tissues and it stays there so it has a cumulativeeffect. And yet we continue to get reports that say there's no sci-entific evidence that mercury causes autism. They don't say itdoesn't, they say we can't conclusively prove that mercury causesautism. They don't say it doesn't. I was on television today, on CNN, and they had a scientist who incidentally has a 9-year-old child who's autistic. She said thatthere's no scientific evidence that mercury in vaccines cause au- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr said, can you categorically say that mercury does not in any way cause autism? And she jumped all over the table tryingto say, well, you know there's no studies that show it and every-thing, but she would not say and I have yet to find any scientistwho will say that there's no doubt, no doubt, that the mercury invaccines does not contribute to autism. Now, they'll say there's noscientific evidence, there's no studies or anything that proves thatyet. But turn that around, there are no studies that disprove it ei-ther. And so they're skirting the issue. Now, the pharmaceutical companies are involved in a great deal of research, and I think that's good, and vaccines are important.They've given us the highest quality of health of any country in thehistory of mankind. And I am for vaccines, but they need to beproperly tested. We had the Rotoshield virus that affected childrenin their stomachs. And we had an advisory committee that testedthe Rotoshield vaccine and they said that it was ready to go on themarket. There were several people who dissented in that even inthat advisory committee. But they put the Rotoshield vaccine onthe market and a couple of children died, several were injured, sev-eral had to have surgery. So they took it off the market in about11 months. The guy who headed that advisory committee had a stock in a company that was making the Rotoshield virus vaccine. Shouldn'thave done it. He had a tainted point of view. But nevertheless hedid. Now, I asked the FDA how many times they do not agree withthe findings and accept the findings of the advisory committees, be-cause that's all they are, are advisory committees. Do you knowhow many times? 100 percent. 100 percent of the time they acceptthose findings and go ahead with it. So we may have some conflictsof interest here that need to be explored. Now you may say, well, that's subjective. You're not really sure about that. What about the homeland security bill? We have a classaction suit, and I'm no friend of the trial attorneys, but we havea class action lawsuit with hundreds of families that are suing be-cause they think their children are being damaged by mercury invaccines and our committee wrote most of that bill. We were thecommittee of jurisdiction, primary jurisdiction. We should havebeen notified of any change in the bill because we wrote most ofit, but what happened? The leadership stuck in at the last minuteunder the cover of darkness the amendment that we've talkedabout today. I support my leadership, I think they're great. I thinkthey've done an outstanding job. But that should never have hap-pened because it cuts off the access of a lot of families who havehad damaged children from any source of compensation for theirchild's injury, and it's just wrong and it was designed to protect thepharmaceutical industry, and that's not right. Now, you say, well, if it was designed to protect the pharma- ceutical industry and it was stuck in there, nobody really knowswho did it, you can't find anybody in that gang that got it donethat's going to own up to that, then there must be some concernthat the suit might be successful. And so they're throwing thosekids out in the cold and their parents who are mortgaging theirhomes and losing their life savings trying to take care of a childlike that so they can protect their company. Now, I want to tell VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr want to protect the pharmaceutical companies. I voted for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund, which was to put moneyout of each shot that was given to people into the fund so that ifthere was damage they could go to that fund and get restitution,get some help for their kids or whoever was damaged by the vac-cine. But it's not a nonadversarial program. We've got people whohave waited 10 years. And then they've been threatened by theJustice Department in some cases if they say anything about theproblems and the roadblocks they've run into. They'll extend thattime before they get compensation for another year or two or three,and they need the money desperately for their kids. Is that the waygovernment should operate? I think not.Now, if we have to say to the pharmaceutical companies, OK, we are going to extend the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund for alonger period of time so that the fund parents have access to it,who missed the boat, then so be it. If we have to say to the phar-maceutical companies that you're going to have to put a little bitmore money out of each vaccination that's given into the VaccineInjury Compensation Fund so these kids are protected, then so beit. If they would do that, I'd get off their back and our committee would get off their back and the Congress would get off their back. But, no, what do they do under the cover of darkness? They try to block every attempt for these parents to get restitution, and thatis wrong. It's wrong for our government to participate in that, andit's wrong for the pharmaceutical companies to participate in that.It's wrong to throw those people out in the cold who have beendamaged. And it's not just a few; it used to be one in 10,000, andnow it's one in more than 250 kids that are being damaged in thiscountry that are autistic. Now, those kids are going to grow up. They aren't going to die. It's not like a lot of diseases where they get infected and they dropdead. They're going to live to be 50, 60 years old. Now, who do youthink's going to take care of them? It's going to be us, all of us, thetaxpayers, and it's going to cost, I think, as you said, Mrs. Maloney,trillions of dollars. So we can't let the pharmaceutical companies and our govern- ment cover this mess up today, because it ain't going to go away,and it's going to cost the taxpayers trillions more if we wait aroundon it. And for our FDA and HHS and the health agencies to con-tinue to hide behind this facade that there have been studies thatconclusively prove otherwise is just wrong, too, because not one ofthem is going to tell you that there's no doubt whatsoever thatmercury in vaccine does not cause or contribute to autism; and thesame thing is true with the MMR vaccine. We need to have conclu-sive evidence, and that means, don't say we can't prove that itcauses it. Turn that argument around. We can't prove that it doesn't, so we're going to study it and we're going to find out. And you in thehealth field, you who run our health agencies in this country whoare sitting here today, you have an obligation to these kids thatyou just saw there, to make sure that these studies are complete, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr that everybody knows that we have all the facts. And you don't have that. And when you come up to testify today from HHS, I want you to tell me that you are absolutely sure 1,000 percent that the mer-cury in the vaccines has no impact whatsoever on autism. If anyof you will tell me that, I want you to prove it to me, and if youcan't, then, damn it, get on with doing another study. I have been fighting this battle for 3 years, as has my committee, and we are tired, but we're not nearly as tired as all these familiesthat are watching their kids grow up, banging on the walls andhaving chronic diarrhea and constipation and other things. Youshouldn't let that happen, and you should get to the bottom of it. Now, I know you people over at HHS and CDC don't like me much, and I really don't care. I care about these kids, and I careabout my grandson; and I'm not going to be chairman anymore,and a lot of you people think, well, he's not going to be chairmananymore so we'll have him off us. You will not have me off yourback. I'm going to be a subcommittee chairman and I'm going tomake absolutely sure that I'm going to have under my control theinvestigations of our health agencies because of this very issue.And so I'm not going to go away and neither is this committee, andwe are going to continue. And the new chairman, I'm going to talkto him when necessary about subpoenaing you back before the sub-committee to talk about this issue. So, please, for the sake of these kids, and for your own sakes if necessary, study this thing thoroughly. Study the thiomersal in thevaccines. If you want to protect the pharmaceutical companies be-cause you have been getting, indirectly or directly, money forgrants and stuff for scientific research, that's OK. I don't like it,but that's OK. Just make sure that the Vaccine Injury Compensa-tion Fund works and that the parents who have had damaged kidswill be able to go to that compensation fund and get restitutionwithout having to mortgage their homes to pay for legal fees thataren't paid until the end, because they can't do it. And there's alot of lawyers that won't even take those cases because they wantto get their money as they spend their time. So I think I have said enough. I'm just telling you, I feel so strongly about this because I've seen these mothers and these fa-thers come forward with tears in their eyes, crying, saying, we'vegot this terrible problem and we have nowhere to go, nowhere toturn; and our kids were damaged, and they changed right afterthey got these vaccines. And it ain't right, it's just not right. So I have said enough. Our first witness, and I'm sorry I didn't read all of the opening statement today. I know my staff workedreal hard on it. First panel is Dr. Baskin, Dr. Geier and Dr. Spitzer, and we'd ap- preciate it if you'd approach the witness table and stand to besworn. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Dr. Baskin, would you to start with an opening statement? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 M.D., PROFESSOR OF NEURO- LOGICAL SURGERY, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, HOUS-TON, TX; MARK GEIER, M.D., SPITZER, M.D.,M.P.H., F.R.C.P.C., EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOL-OGY, McGILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL, CANADA Dr. B ASKIN . Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the committee, col- leagues, ladies and gentlemen, my name is David Baskin. I'm aprofessor of neurosurgery and anesthesiology at Baylor College ofMedicine. I'm a neurosurgeon. I do complex spine and brain sur-gery, about 350 cases a year. I have also been involved in research, looking at ways to protect the nervous system from damage and to reverse damage, for over20 years, and have over $1 million in Federal funding, both fromNIH and BIA, as well as State funding and private funding fromfoundations, to look at a variety of issues in terms of brain damage.In fact, our group was involved in the discovery of the drug thatcould reverse paralysis in spinal cord injury, which has now be-come the standard of care. So I've been working in this area forover 20 years. I also serve on scientific advisory boards for NIH, as well as the Cure Autism Now Foundation, the largest private funder of autismresearch in this country, which funds over $7 million a year. Now, as you said, Mr. Chairman, autism is exploding. This is a recent cover of Time magazine talking about the fact that over\u2014 now, it looks like one in 150 children suffer from some form of au-tism. What is autism? It's a lifelong brain disorder with very severe problems communicating, responding to surroundings and formingrelationships. Most of these children, as you say, will grow up andwill require lifelong care and cannot live independently. Horriblefact, over one-half will never speak. Many of them will never beeven able to look at their parents and tell them they love them. It's worse than Alzheimer's disease. There's been a tremendous focus on Alzheimer's disease, but these children never had a chanceto enjoy life before they lost it. Let's look at some medical definitions. What's a preservative? I looked it up in Stedman's medical dictionary, and it says a preserv-ative is a substance added to a product for the purpose of inhibitingor destroying microorganisms. What's a poison? A poison is a substance that, when injected in a relatively small amount, causes damage to structures or disturb-ance of function. Now, while there's going to be quite a bit of debate this afternoon over dosages, make no mistake, there is the intent to put a preserv-ative in these vaccines to prevent the growth of microorganismsthat has gone awry, because the preservative that was used endedup being a poison. There is no debate in the scientific literature that mercury is a potent neurotoxin. We've known that since the late 1890's. The de-bate only comes to degree and extent and that sort of thing. So Idon't think in the course of your deliberations today you shouldconfuse that fact. We are talking about a known poison, neurotoxin, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 added to these vaccines with the initial idea that it would function as a preservative. Mercury has a long history of medical misadventures. In 1890, ethyl mercury was synthesized in London, and it soon became apopular treatment for syphilis. The saying went, ''A night withVenus and a lifetime with mercury.'' In fact, in 1927, the Nobelprize was awarded because it was felt you could improve outcomeby adding treatment with mercury. Many of these patients devel-oped serious neurological disorders, but it was thought initially thiswas due to the syphilis, when it turns out that a lot of these cases,retrospectively reviewed, had evidence of mercury toxicity. Thimerosal was placed in vaccines in the late 1930's; and guess what: Three years later Tanner first described the syndrome of au-tism\u2014never ever been described before in the medical literature.The neurotoxicity of mercury has been very well established interms of brain injuries since the 1960's, as you'll see. In 1956 and 1960, there were massive outbreaks of mercury poi- soning in Iraq, and the reason this happened was that ethyl mer-cury was used as a fungicide. The grain was treated with this fun-gicide, the idea being that you could plant this grain, it wouldgrow, the crops would flourish. But I would imagine, because ofpoverty, a lot of this grain was just taken and made right intobread and people ate it. So they ate these doses of mercury. Andthere were hundreds of cases, both in Iraq and then there was asimilar outbreak in China. A number of these cases just had really severe, horrible brain damage, but what came out of this work, there was a much moremild syndrome with developmental delays and neurodevelopmentaldisorders, problems with language, problems with communication.Some of the descriptions of these kids looked just like your video-tape. So there was a\u2014pretty early in the 1960's it was known therewas a direct relationship of the dose of mercury received and theseverity of the injury, and as early as the late 1960's, the scientificliterature said the fetal and infant brain is clearly more sensitivethan the adult brain. The brain damage in these cases was studied, and it's interesting that the type of brain damage seen was the loss of the Purkinjecells, which are cells in the cerebellum, and the loss of the corticalcolumn, which is the part of our brain that is involved in complexthought. And guess what: At the recent meeting for autism re-search at the Society for Neuroscience, this exact samehistopathology has been described in autism. There were other outbreaks elsewhere, so we've known about this scientifically for a long time. There is no debate that this isa toxin that causes brain injury. Now, there was a study trying to look at lower-dose exposures conducted in the Faroe Islands beginning in 1987, and what thisdid was it looked at 1,000 children and it followed them from birthto age 7. It tested them very specifically for neurodevelopmentaldisorders. It measured blood levels of mercury in the umbilicalcord, and it found an association between very low doses of mer-cury and neurodevelopmental disorders just like autism, and foundthat mercury here actually wasn't as predictive as the blood levels,which is the gold standard. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Protection Agency established, as a result of primarily these horrible problems in Iraq, a standard for what wasa maximum safe level of ingestion of mercury, which was 0.1microgram per kilogram per day, and they called this, ''a level ofdaily exposure that was likely to be without an appreciable risk.'' They based this on 81 children in Iraq. They looked at symptoms very much like autism\u2014problems talking, problems with mentalcognition, problems with walking; and as recently as 2000, our Na-tional Research Council reviewed this data and supported theselimits, said these are the right limits to use not only based on theIraqi experience, but also based on the Faroe Islands experience. Let's look at what the children actually received. This can be a source of debate. There are a lot of different ways to calculate thesenumbers, but what I have done here is simply taken the FDA'snumbers as they prevented them published by Leslie Ball in 2001;and if you look at the various numbers, you see that a child, by6 months, receives somewhere between one-and-a-half to threetimes the maximum safe EPA dose of mercury. If you take into account that mercury is preferentially taken up into the brain at five times the concentration, these kids are get-ting somewhere around 12 to 15 times the maximum dose, andthat is the most conservative estimate. Making lots of assumptions that many scientists wouldn't agree with, they're overdosed. Yet the last formal review by the FDA wasin 1976, and they said, ''No dangerous quantity of mercury is likelyto be received from biological products in a lifetime.'' Mind you, thisis 16 years after the experience in Iraq with all the mercury poi-soning, and also the outbreak in China. Dr. Ball in 2001 said, ''Reassessment of the risk is appropriate.'' I think that was a nice thing to say, but I think that really\u2014con-sistent with prior testimony before this committee, I think there isa concern that perhaps the FDA was asleep at the switch for dec-ades, as was stated in an internal e-mail, that it really does onlytake eighth-grade math to see that they're beyond the maximumsafe levels. The pity about this is thimerosal is not an essential component for vaccine. The argument with thimerosal is not an antivaccine ar-gument. Vaccines are wonderful. They're here to stay. They savelives. The argument is that you don't need to put a toxic poison inthem in order to deliver them. But it's worse. The incidence of autism is increasing, and we don't know why. As you said, nobody can explain this. There are many other sources of mercury exposure in the envi- ronment; so that if we're going to inject our kids with a neurotoxin,and they're already being exposed to a certain amount of mercury,this just adds insult to injury. We clearly know infants' brains are more sensitive. We know the blood brain barrier, the barrier to drugs between the blood and thebrain, is virtually gone in infants. We know there is probably atleast a five-times preferential uptake into the brain. And we know about lead. You know, lead has been around for a long time. In one of the NIH study sections that I served on,there was a proposal to study lead and juvenile delinquency rate,and the consensus was, why do we need another study to know VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr exposure in infancy can relate to juvenile delinquency rate in adults; we already know this is the case. This is acceptedscience. So the idea that a metal can cause a very specific braininjury has been around a long time. I'm going to turn my attention a moment to the article that was published by Dr. Pichichero and his colleagues in Lancet in Novem-ber 2002 since this was just referred to. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 . This was a study of 40 infants, age 6 or younger, in which they measured blood, urine and stool mercury levels. Theconclusion was that administration of that change containing mer-cury did not seem to raise blood concentrations of mercury abovethe safe values. The data are the data, and I think, as you said, Dr. Weldon, it's good to have some data, but interpretation of data is paramount.In my residence, we teach residents and we teach young doctorshow to be neurosurgeons. We spend a night a month pouring overthe medical literature and make the important distinction thatwhile the data in the papers are probably correct and true, the wayyou interpret the data, the way you look at that and come to amedical conclusion is often subject to interpretation; and I'm goingto show you and talk to you about the fact that while the data arethe data, I think the conclusions are not borne out. First of all, I was shocked when I read this study that there was no disclosure of conflict of interest. As an NIH scientist, anytimeanybody funds my research for any reason, I have to disclose theconflict of interest. Yet these authors have vaccine patents, havereceived numerous funding for studies by drug companies thatmake vaccines; and I was surprised that Lancet took it. I'm sureit's not over with. Whether or not there's a true conflict of interest,they certainly should have revealed it. The sample size, as you said, Dr. Weldon, was small. Autism oc- curs in one in 150 kids. So if a child had some different tendencyin their blood to absorb more mercury or have it remain in theblood longer or be more sensitive in their brain, if they onlychecked 40 kids, they may well not have found even one kid witha predisposition to autism. So it's a meaningless study without alarger sample size. The sample wasn't random. They didn't take kids from different portions of the population in different areas. If there's some meta-bolic difference based on race or sex or where you live or otherthings, they wouldn't have found it. They didn't even talk about thepreferential uptake of mercury into the brain, which is fivefold. But they did find a very high stool level of mercury, and one kid had 81.3 nanograms. If you again go to the very conservative FDAdata, a 50 percentile kid receives 20.7 nanograms per gram. Sosomehow the mercury went from the injection, ended up in a muchhigher level in the stool. And obviously, the mercury gets to thestool by traveling through the blood; there's no rectal administra-tion. If you put gasoline in your car that has lead in it and some-body comes by and scrapes your tail pipe and says we have a highlead level, it got there by traveling through the system. So what happened here is, we know the stool levels were high, but if you look at when they actually measured the blood levels,they said it was somewhere between 3 and 27 days later. The peakmercury levels after injection occur within hours or at least withinthe first 24 hours. So if they were drawing blood later than that, and much later than that, of course the levels weren't going to behigh. But the mercury doesn't jump from the injection to the stool;it goes through the blood. At some point it was high because it washigh in the stool. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 measure the peak levels, they can't even talk about what they did, which is the pharmacal kinetics, whichbasically means the way the drug is metabolized; and they drew abunch of fancy curves. You can't do a pharmacal kinetic study ifyou don't have the peak level. They clearly didn't have the peaklevel because they have high stool mercury, and they have lowblood mercury\u2014doesn't make sense. So they described this as a descriptive study, and that's exactly what it was. It provides some interesting information, it's a start,but the interpretation is inaccurate\u2014as what we would say in neu-rosurgery, ''The operation was a success, but the patient died.'' Let me turn to some studies that we're doing at Baylor College of Medicine. We have the opportunity to actually grow human fron-tal cortex cells in cell culture. So these are cells from the front partof the brain that grow in culture. We incubate these cells with thi-merosal at various doses, and we use a number of very sophisti-cated techniques to detect cell death and cell damage. It turns out that every cell has a program inside of it to commit suicide. The reason we have this in our bodies is, when we're ba-bies we have webs between our fingers, but when we're born, wedon't have these webs. These cells are eliminated by activating agenetic program, so there's no inflammation and there's no scar tis-sue. We basically start out with many more cells than we end up with. We kind of prune ourselves into shape, and this process iscalled apoptosis. Well, it turns out that toxic substances, includingmercury, turn on this suicide program in the brain. Here are some pictures from our cell culture experience, and you can see the arrows pointing to those little knobs sticking off thecell. These are the cells committing the suicide program and break-ing themselves into tiny little pieces with a very low dose of mer-cury. Here is a slide where you see a lot of blue cells. This is a blue dye that normal cells don't take up. In order for something to turnblue, the cell has to have holes punched in their membranes. Andguess what: At an extraordinarily low dose of thimerosal, most ofthe cells are blue. It means that this stuff grabs ahold of the mem-brane and punches holes into it, so that the dye can penetrate, notonly into the cytoplasm but into the very center of the cell, the nu-cleus, where all the DNA exists. This is a fascinating slide. The center of the cells are blue, which means there have been holes punched into the membranes so thedye gets to the center of the cell. The rest of the cell is green whichis the release of an enzyme that only gets released during the sui-cide program. So these cells are turned on to commit suicide or gointo apoptosis. We found this to be dose- and time-dependent. We found that 101 nanograms per gram is the lowest dose we've studied, and it's toxic. And we didn't even expect this to be toxic, yet if you considera five-times preferential uptake and you use FDA numbers, infantsreceive 380.5 nanograms, three times the dose that we found to betoxic to brain cells. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 we did this in adult brain cells. Remember that in- fant brain cells are much more sensitive, so there's a real cause forconcern. In addition, there was discussion that there's no scientific data or evidence. I don't agree with that. At the recent InternationalMeeting for Autism Research at the Society for Neuroscience, anumber of investigators around the world are finding similarthings. At Columbia University, there's now a model in mice who were injected with low doses of thimerosal very similar to what's givenin human vaccines. These mice develop neurological deficits thatlook like autism, and when you take their brains out and you ana-lyze them, they have the same type of brain damage. There's evidence that thimerosal not only binds to the proteins you saw in the cartoon, but also binds to sulfur groups which arepretty essential groups for the membrane. So this is probably howit punches holes in the membrane. This is work at Northwestern, and the very important work that is coming out of a number of NIH-funded centers is that if you givepatients thimerosal, you can take their lymphocytes and makethem killer lymphocytes and trigger the onset of autoimmune dis-ease, which also may be part of what's happening in terms of braindamage. So science has come a long way. We've gone from caveman clubs, and now we're at ICBM missiles, and I would be very optimisticthat in the next few years, Mr. Chairman, you're going to see a tre-mendous amount of scientific data supporting the fact that this isa horrible toxin that shouldn't ever have been in these vaccines. Well, what can you do? What can Members of Congress do to try to make this better, to do something to improve the situation? First of all, as a physician, I probably prescribe a pound of drugs a week and, you know, I always rely on the FDA. I don't gothrough and test the safety data of each drug myself; I assume it'ssafe. Somewhere along the line, the process failed. Mercury is a known neurotoxin, and you know what: It's still being given today in fluvaccines, to pregnant mothers and to children. Why? It's not nec-essary. So I think one thing you can do is compel the CDC and the FDA to do their jobs. Insist on properly managed accountability. Insiston conflict-of-interest disclosures. I live in Houston. We surelearned a lot from Enron, and I hope that we can avoid similar un-fortunate circumstances. I think you should consider this a problem very similar to Sep- tember 11th\u2014it's interesting, we talk about homeland security, it'sa severe problem\u2014it's chemical poisoning at home, and it's verysimilar. I was in a cab today, and the radio was talking about theFBI, the CIA and lack of communication that might have avoidedthe terrible problems of September 11th. Well, you know, the EPA knew this for a long time. All of these agencies had pieces of thisdata, but they don't seem to talk to each other; there doesn't seemto be any sort of coordination, very similar to the issues with home-land security. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 another thing you can do is support the NIH. The NIH has done a great job recently trying to catch up. The NIEHS par-ticularly, but some of the other institutes as well, has really puttogether first-rate scientists and first-rate programs to do this. Youcould help by proposing specific funds to be set aside by NIH. NIH has something called ''request for application,'' which means we are entertaining applications only on this subject, and then theypick the very best ones. They don't have the money to do that toooften, but if you can give them a small extra pot, that would bringthe very best research in this country along very quickly. Allow science and the press and our legal system unfettered ac- cess to the issue: This is the only way the truth is going to comeout, and particularly in science, if we couldn't read and critical-re-view each other's data, we would go nowhere. I think you have toinsist on that, and by doing that, consider reversing the relevantprovisions in the homeland security bill, as was discussed, andstand up for our Nation's children and their rights. In conclusion, Plutarch said, ''The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.'' Please do everything you can to ensurethat our Nation's most valuable resource, our children, have theirrights protected and can grow and flourish to their full potential.Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Baskin, I'm going to send your presentation to everybody I possibly can, because it was so thorough, and you're tobe congratulated for all that hard work. I just think you summedit up so well, and I'm going to make sure we send that over to theFDA and CDC to make sure they take a look at it. Dr. Geier, you're recognized.Dr. G EIER. Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Chairman and other members of this committee. Vaccines are one of the greatest triumphs of the 20th century, re- sulting in the virtual eradication of most infectious diseases. Vac-cine producers should be commended for their efforts, but one mustopenly acknowledge that, on occasion, vaccines are indeed respon-sible for adverse reactions. The U.S. Government judiciously established the Vaccine Com- pensation Act in 1986 as one of its provisions. The Vaccine AdverseEvents Reporting System data base was created. The VAERS database has been maintained by the CDC in Atlanta, GA, since 1990,and vaccines suspected of adverse reactions are to be reported tothis data base as mandated by U.S. law. The reporting of serious adverse reactions to VAERS requires written and telephonic communication by the CDC. The CDC fol-lows up serious adverse reactions 1 year later to determine wheth-er the patient has recovered, and the FDA inquires into deaths re-ported to the VAERS data base by contacting the patient's healthcare provider and physician. Despite the continuing insistence by the FDA and the CDC that the VAERS data base is subject to severe limitations, the FDA, CDC, David Geier, my son, and I analyze and publish from theVAERS data base. The VAERS data base provides a prospectiveabout vaccine adverse reactions unobtainable by any other means,as it contains almost 200,000 adverse events, following almost 50 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr more than 1 billion doses of vac- cine administered in the United States. It is biologically plausible that thimerosal, contained in vaccines, contributes to childhood neurodevelopmental delays, but there arefew epidemiological analyses that study the effects of thimerosalcontained in vaccines. We analyzed the incident rates ofneurodevelopmental delays reported to the VAERS data base fol-lowing thimerosal-containing diptheria, tetanus and acellularpercusses, called DTaP, in comparison to thimerosal-free DTaP vac-cines. The CDC provided us with a number of doses manufactured and distributed each year of each type of vaccine, manufactured by eachmanufacturer, but in so doing, we had to agree to withhold theidentities of the vaccine manufacturers because the CDC considersthis information proprietary. Thus, we are prohibited from releas-ing data on which company makes a safer vaccine, when two ormore companies make the same vaccine. We feel that it is essentialthat this information not be denied to doctors or patients. The CDC and FDA also knows the number of doses of each lot manufactured. We feel it is important that this information be re-leased so that analysis of potential so-called ''hot lots'' can be car-ried out. This slide shows that autism and mental retardation were ap- proximately six times statistically significantly more likely, andspeech disorders were two times statistically significantly morelikely following thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccines in comparisonto thimerosal-free DTaP the details of ourstudy\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . Dr. Geier, can I just interrupt you, is that pub- lished data? Dr. G EIER. That's been submitted and accepted with revision, but it's not finally accepted. So it has not been published yet, but short-ly we hope. Mr. B URTON . I don't want to interrupt you either, but I think it's very important at this point. We talked to the health agenciesabout the VAERS being made public and being made available toany researchers, completely available; and you're telling us thatyou still can't that get information? Dr. G EIER. We can\u2014well, there are a number of problems with VAERS. First of all, VAERS is maintained by CDC in Atlanta ona data base that's proprietary. So it's very difficult to access. Weget it accessed, and a computer programmer takes it off and putsit\u2014makes it available so that Microsoft Access can work on it. Thisallows everybody to work on it. My son has also figured out a system to put their\u2014I think it's seven different data bases together to make one, however, so wecan get access. But you can't just call up this site and get usefulaccess; you get some data, but it's not useful. But in addition to that, in order to interpret VAERS, you need to know the denominators, you need to know how many doses weregiven; and we've been given the information of how many doses ofeach type of vaccine were given each year. Additionally, in order to do these calculations, you need to know the number of doses produced by each vaccine manufacturer. We VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr that with the provision that we were not allowed to tell which vaccine companies are which. So we can do the study we did up there because, you notice, all we said is we compared the relative risk of one that contained thi-merosal with a similar vaccine that didn't, didn't tell you whichcompany. But it really hurts us to see\u2014when we see two or threemanufacturers of a particular vaccine where one is far worse thanthe other, that we can't publish which one is worse. And, in fact,CDC has published a paper showing, I think, a sixfold increase inserious reactions of one manufacturer versus another, and they callthem manufacturer A and manufacturer B. I think that the American public are entitled to know which manufacturer is which, so they can choose the better vaccine fortheir children. Mr. B URTON . Well, I don't want to interrupt anymore of your tes- timony, but what I'd like to do is have you give us a list of theproblems that you're having in getting this information, and we'lltry to see what we can do to lift the veil of secrecy so that you canget on with your work. Dr. G EIER. We would appreciate that very much. The doses of mercury children were receiving from thimerosal on a given day following vaccination in comparison to the EPA, AFDRand FDA limits of exposure to mercury are summarized in the nextslide, and this is similar to a slide that Dr. Baskin showed. Thisis what's in each one. This calculates the risks, the amount of the excess the children received, and the way that Dr. Baskin did it was very, shall I say,''charitable'' toward the production. Children actually receive froma ten- to a hundredfold excess of mercury from their childhood vac-cination on the days of immunization in comparison to the guide-lines. The daily dose of mercury children received was equal to orexceeded the guideline even when averaged out for 10 days follow-ing vaccination. Further details are provided in the packet that I submitted to the committee. The IOM analyzed the mercury dose children received at 6 months of life and averaged it over every day in a child's life, thatis, 180 days, showing that the dose received by the child was onlyin slight excess of the EPA limits. This type of averaging makes noscientific sense. As an example, if I were given a lethal dose of mer-cury and my dose was averaged over my more than 50 years of life,I would not have received a dose exceeding the limits, despite thefact that I would be dead. Realistically, children are receiving large doses of mercury at in- tervals that far exceed all the Federal agency guidelines and notby fivefold but by over a hundredfold. This slide summarizes the CDC's VSD data regarding the rel- ative risk of autism versus the mercury dose that the child re-ceived. When we saw this, we were very, very disturbed. Despitethe fact that our study had shown that two populations, one popu-lation had received a vaccine with thimerosal and the other didn't,were statistically different, this is more powerful data because thisis a plot of the amount of mercury that a child received versus theamount of autism, and it turns out that this plot is not linear. In VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr goes up faster and faster with increasing mercury doses from childhood vaccines. And again, the packet I submitted hasquite a bit more on these graphs. But we did\u2014each point in their analysis was barely significant, but the graph on the whole is very significant, and there's an inter-esting trick used in presenting their data. Their data had data foreach of the first two points. The third point said greater than 62.5exposure. It's kind of hard to plot greater than 62.5, and therefore,you can't do this analysis, but when we looked at it, greater than62.5 has to be 75; there's no other possibility. So we replotted it with 75. I mean, that's just the way the vac- cines are given. And when you replot it with 75, you get a very,very good curve fit, and it's statistically significant, and it fits forseveral different disorders. And it's very disturbing, because this isa kinetic study. You know, if you compare two things and one isbigger than the other, well, maybe even though the statistics showit is unlikely, maybe it was chance, but when it goes up as you goup with dose, and it goes up faster and faster as you go up withmore and more dose, this is very disturbing. Also, the relative risk at the top top is 2.5. That means that of these children, who belong to the Kaiser plans, a very large seg-ment of the autistic children were related to the thimerosal. I mean, there are two issues. One is, can thimerosal cause au- tism; and another is, does it cause a significant part? I mean,maybe it only causes 1 percent of autism. This tells you that itcauses a very significant part of the autism. Now, I'd like to go into a little bit of what you asked me in the question. You asked me about the VAERS data base, and I wantedto talk to you about the VSD data base. As described in the packet that I submitted to the committee, de- spite correspondence between myself and the CDC, originally dat-ing prior to the CDC's press release to open the VSD to the public,I have not been given access to the VSD. This has been ongoingfor more than 4 months, and my last proposal was more than 150pages long. Mr. B URTON . Let me interrupt you here just a second. Now, the VSD, we were told by our health agencies that was going to be made available to any researcher completely; and you'retelling us you're still not getting it? Dr. G EIER. Let me go through my experience. And I gave Dr. Weldon the complete documentation of all of our exchanges. It's available, but it's so difficult to get\u2014I think we're in a very good position among independent researchers to ask for it, and wehave little hope; and let me go over some of the barriers they'veput in our way. We've been doing this for 4 months. My last proposal was more than 150 pages long, and despite the fact that I've published ap-proximately 30 peer-reviewed scientific studies analyzing VAERS,I still haven't been able to move beyond the first hurdle of gainingaccess to the VSD. And I had a very simple solution to their question of what do you want to study. I simply said, well, let's do something really easy.Let's study whether VSD has the same kind of results as theVAERS. And you know my studies are valid because they have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr published by 30 different journals, such as the Annals of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology and variousother journals. So rather than going into a whole big study design,let me see if we can confirm our results with the VSD. This didn't please them, and they required that we ask every sin- gle possible question and make various predictions, and we cameup with a 150-page proposal. However, that didn't satisfy them be-cause, first of all, they seemed to put up continually additionalsteps, fees and hindrances and seemed to make the realistic possi-bility of ever gaining actual access to the VSD remote. Basically my understanding is, after we get them to agree to our study, which we have to describe every possible thing we want totest, then we have to go before each of the Kaiser boards in orderto get their permission; and CDC does not even know what Kaiserboards will require. If we go to each Kaiser board and ask that webe able to use their Kaiser data and it's approved, then my under-standing is it goes back to the CDC for approval. After the CDCapproves it, then I get limited access in a little town in Maryland.This happens to be near where I live, but anybody else would havetrouble, because they're going to give you like 5 minutes of accessa week, so you'd have to fly in here from, say, California. In addition, when you go there, we've been told that we can't take cell phones. We can't copy anything. We can't take any dataout. We're going to be searched. All of this in the name of confiden-tiality when, in confidentiality, all you have to do is what VAERSdoes, just take the names off. And as far as validity of the studies,if the studies are valid, I'm going to submit them for peer-reviewedpublication. If they're published, they're valid. I don't need them toreview the validity of the studies. Mr. B URTON . Would you ask excuse me 1 second.I think Michael Crane is here. Mr. Crane, would you raise your hand real quickly. I'd like to talk to you after this hearing is over to find out why these impedi-ments are put in front of these people. OK? [Witness sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Dr. G EIER. Finally, there's a constant mention of fee, and we've asked for the amount of the fee on several occasions, and we're toldrepeatedly there's a fee and they don't know the amount of the fee.My suspicion is no one is ever going to get that far, but we're inde-pendent and we don't have any outside support. We do this becausewe care about the children. So if they ask for $1 million fee, wehave no granting fund to pay the fee. Turning to another subject. I've been asked to comment on the Lancet article which measured mercury in blood, urine and stool,which was commented on by Dr. Baskin, in infants 3 to 28 daysfollowing thimerosal-containing vaccines in comparison to infantsreceiving thimerosal-free vaccines. The findings of low-level mer-cury in the blood is only indicative of measuring too late. If they wanted to see it, they should measure 3 to 24 hours after the shot, and it does nothing to assure that these children were notexposed to potentially damaging levels of mercury. We know, infact, these children received by injection more than 100 times the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr dose of mercury, and the mercury would be more damaging in the brain than the blood. It's almost as if they want you to read the study and think, well, I guess they didn't get any mercury. But we know they got themercury. So why is it supposed to be reassuring that they meas-ured later, and it's not in the blood; that means it could be in thebrain. So that study, to me, has no validity. It has some interestingdata, but no validity on the question of whether thimerosal causesproblems. I've also been asked to comment on the recent New England Journal of Medicine study done in Denmark, which failed to finda correlation between MMR vaccination and autism. This study at-tempted to compare children vaccinated with MMR to a comparablecontrol group of children who were not vaccinated with MMR. The author's own analysis showed that the two groups were sta- tistically different in most respects even before being vaccinated,making the results dubious. You want to have match controls. Ba-sically they adjusted them; I have no idea on which way to adjust.For example, if the control group and the vaccinated group differby how their income\u2014what their income level is, I don't knowwhether to raise it or lower it. Neither do they. So they justchanged it in such a way that it evened out the numbers. Even overlooking the weakness in the study design, the study would have only shown MMR to be statistically linked to autismif MMR caused a rather large proportion of all autism in the popu-lation being studied. This already was known not to be the case.HHS itself has published that there is a causal relationship be-tween MMR and permanent brain injury. Our study using VAERS, contained in the submitted package\u2014 this is another study we've submitted for publication\u2014shows thatMMR increases the relative risk of autism, but its contribution toautism in the whole population is relatively small since much ofthe autism seems to be linked to thimerosal which, of course, is notcontained in the MMR vaccine. So their study doesn't say that MMR didn't cause 10 percent of the autism. It just said it didn't cause 60 percent of the autism,and\u2014because you'd have to have a large percentage the way theylooked at it. In conclusion, these two recent studies do little to alleviate the fact that the scientific data indicates that thimerosal in vaccinesand from other sources, such as RhoGAM, a product containing thi-merosal, given during pregnancy to RH-negative women, appearsto cause or contribute significantly to the recent dramatic increasein the rate of autism seen in the United States. As far as RhoGAM goes, I practice as an obstetrical geneticist. I do amniocentesis. I give RhoGAM. I was not aware that RhoGAMcontained thimerosal. It no longer does, but it did for a number ofyears. The reason I wasn't aware of it is that I've never seen amultidose vial of RhoGAM. If it's ever been made, I have neverseen it in my 22 years of practicing, and yet, they put thimerosalin it as a preservative. What the heck are they preserving? And there are studies by clinicians who take care of these chil- dren, who find that a very high proportion of these children areborn to women who are RH-negative, who had RhoGAM during the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 no reason in the world\u2014if they have to put thi- merosal in single-dose vials, are they afraid that they don't knowhow to make things sterile? Are we to assume that sterility testingis not good? Ideally, vaccines should be killed, single antigen, highly purified and checked to determine if any of the epitopes they contain arecross-reactive with human lymphocytes. They should come in sin-gle-dose, sealed vials, so the preservatives are not necessary; andthey should contain enough antigenic materials so that adjuvantsare not necessary. History has written that the fall of Rome may well have been re- lated to lead poisoning from newly invented lead pipes. Let it notbe written that our great society poisons itself with mercury pre-servatives. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Geier follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 think Dr. Weldon has a quick question for you, Dr. Geier. Mr. W ELDON . I think you answered my question. Thimerosal was in single-dose RhoGAM injections? Dr. G EIER. Yes. That's the only kind of RhoGAM injection I've ever seen; and I have bought it from several companies, and they'realways single-dose. They come in a syringe, prefilled, and they con-tained, up until recently, a year or two ago, thimerosal. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. Dr. Geier, that was an excellent presentation, as well. We'll try to make sure, along with Dr. Baskin's, this gets to everybody. I'mgoing to send this to Secretary Thompson over at HHS. I hope Ican convince him to watch this whole presentation. Dr. Spitzer.Dr. S PITZER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time, I will focus on the Danish study, as re- quested. There are somewhat related matters that I will go over abit more quickly, but the main focus is on the Danish study, andthe paper was the New England Journal paper appearing on No-vember 7th, which itself focused primarily on MMR. And the hy-pothesis declared in the paper in the New England Journal wasabout a relationship and association between the vaccine and au-tism, simply expressed as that, by a Danish group, about which I'llsay a bit more in a moment. So, in evaluating the hypothesis that MMR vaccination and au- tism are associated, they came through enlightened policy of theDanish Government to link data bases of the\u2014data bases I haveon the projection here, which are, from my experience of the Sas-katchewan data base, perhaps one of the best, to look at relation-ships between disorders and risk factors, however they might beexposed, properly done. I'll emphasize that the linkage was with computerized data bases. Also, I will mention it again, they were created for otherpurposes, and they were well linked. Madsen has a good reputation in Europe. I worked in Europe for 4 years on epidemiologic studies and know their work by reputa-tion. I have not met Madsen or any of the coinvestigators. I haveno interest one way or another in terms of that team. It was sponsored and funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I'll have more to say about that. Let me read the conclusion from the abstract, which is very simi- lar to the conclusion later in discussion of the paper: ''this studyprovides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccina-tion causes autism,'' and the emphasis is mine. The category of the study, it is a cohort study which was, as a cohort study, well done, the followup being from January 1991 toDecember 1998, 8 years, and there were over 500,000 children inthe cohort, 440 having received MMR, or 82 percent; and theytranslated this to personal years because of the difference in time of followup of different children. That was appropriate to do; it wasthe right thing to do in what was a dynamic cohort\u2014that is, op-posed to fixed. You don't start with, say, 100,000 children todayand follow them together in the future. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 were introduced to the cohort as they were born, we call it a dynamic, and followed forward in time to determine wheth-er the outcome of interest, in this case, several subgroups of\u2014sev-eral manifestations of autism appeared or not during that periodof time, although the followup went on for one more year; and thenI just show here how\u2014visually how that happens. Now, this was a major strategic advance in epidemiology. You have heard me say here before words to the effect that most, if notall, of the epidemiology until now has been clearly shoddy. Peoplethink that because the discipline is in adolescents, maybe infancy,you can afford to be shoddy. In fact, you should pursue as high astandard as possible. And it's also the first epidemiological studypublished to be adequately controlled, an adequately controlled ob-servational study. An important attribute of linked national data bases, or provin- cial ones like Saskatchewan, is that there is no selection bias. Thisis especially true in Denmark where well in excess of 97 percentof the people and the children of the country, however they en-tered, by immigration or birth and so on, are there. It's not matterof representivity. They're all there. So there is no selection bias.That's very hard to accomplish in epidemiology when you don'thave this advantage. Now, unfortunately, the important strategic advance was not matched by some important, detailed methodological tactics in theexecution of the study. That vitiates the strength of the authors'conclusions, which I found unusual considering what came out inthe data, which I'll summarize in a moment, and in this presen-tation, I'll review some of the methodological problems withoutbeing exhaustive. Let me share with you that much of what I have here is as a result of conversations of colleagues, some seniors, who have writ-ten to the New England Journal. There hasn't been enough timeyet to accept the things, and I need to respect confidence. I myselfhave forfeited my letter because I think it's more important, moresocially sensitive that it be presented here, but I cannot assumethat of any colleague; and on one or two occasions that I haveasked permission, it's been denied and understandably so. Theymight get promoted. I can't. Now, the key result to be published here, which leads to public statements of reassurance from authorities not only in this country,but in Europe and elsewhere, is a relative risk of 0.92 with con-fidence interval there, which shows no significance, as it wouldn'tif there is no difference\u2014that's for autistic disorders, one of the twomajor subgroups here; and for other autistic spectrum disorders,0.83, again with that confidence interval. And unlike the CDC study that I discussed at an earlier meeting, Mr. Chairman, the power here is high. Remember, it's only 12 per-cent in Davis' study. Here, it's 80 percent to detect an authoriza-tion of 1.5, and I remind you that in OR, an observation of one shows no association, and the key results we have here with theconfidence intervals overlap 1, and there's the power which is quiteadequate. In fact, it's superior. You don't often see that high apower obtained. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 They never give it to you. You have to calculate it yourself, but that's the way it is. Now, going to some of the more detailed problems\u2014and if I went into everything I'd be here for 2 hours, Mr. Chairman; I wouldn'tbe too popular even with you. But the first thing I'd like to say andperhaps the most important point, that of the numerator, the af-fected cases here, only 13 percent were reviewed. That is very inad-equate, especially if done for validity purposes, just for validity. To fail to examine all the records among the 787 children in the numerators of the cohort, or 738 in Table 2, that are similar, andwithout using a clinical and epidemiologic and large statisticalmultidisciplinary approach, it leaves the project wide open to errorsand misclassification. They said that because it was validity and it's a psychiatric diag- nosis in Denmark, they had to use psychiatrists. Well, that's thelast reason I'd use psychiatrists. I want validation from otherhealth professionals, appropriately involved clinically and other-wise in the situation. If they say it was too much work, in a self-selected group of af- fected children in Britain, with which I have been working withProfessor Leary, among others, and so on, we did nearly 500 chil-dren, 493 children, looked at their lifetime histories with seven col-leagues, including psychologists and pediatricians and so on, inabout a month. In later collaboration, also of 62 of the involved, for reasons they became involved in laboratory study, one-third of them, 28, or 45percent, which is artificially high; but nevertheless, we could clear-ly show they were regressive; and with a bias against it, becausewe forced the situation where you waited 30 days\u2014not just 3 or 4,as can happen, but we took 30 days to be very conservative\u2014andit was in that little period we call them ''unconfirmed.'' The probable proportion in general populations\u2014we could get it in Denmark, but they didn't do it\u2014is between 10 and 15 percent. Now, my questions are, were clinical psychologists and other cli- nicians involved in the Danish exercise? Was noncaseness vali-dated, the controls? Was there a definition of zero time for anymanifestation? They talk about diagnoses, but zero time is whenyou first observe by a competent clinician the signs or symptomsrelated to the condition. It may take years for you to get the diag-nosis, especially by a psychiatrist, and the average in our studieswas about 2.2. Other British studies go up to averages of about 5.2. Regressive autism, I asked the question, but I don't think it was demarcated and whether there would be prolonged exposure toMMR when they were doing the review. Now, I'm going to make the most important point of the presen- tation, in case you need to cut me short a little bit down the line.Assume hypothetically\u2014and I'm doing everything conservative\u2014that there is a vulnerability to MMR-induced disease in a subgroupof 10 percent of the autistic cases. Mr. B URTON . Should this be a new slide? Dr. S PITZER . Sorry. So we assumed that there's 10 percent and we assume further that in the main autism group, 80 percent had been vaccinated,which is similar to the 82 percent we've seen in the paper and 95 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr of autistics, all of it being plau- sible. And I stress this is hypothetical. Now, if you did a nested case control study within these cohorts, which I'll explain in a minute, and did that design in those Danishcohorts, the odds ratio for MMR in that subgroup of 10 percentwould be 4.17, which is appreciably high for preventive or thera-peutic medicine in pharmacal epidemiology. Now, combining all the autistics, the OR becomes 0.97, so that the 90 percent mask what's happening in that 10 percent. Here I show briefly\u2014this will be distributed\u2014how the calcula- tions will be done. And I assume\u2014and I stress it's hypothetical.That's why we don't give confidence intervals. It would be con-trived. Now, is 10 percent trivial? Conservatively, very conservatively, perhaps this is half. Ten percent would represent approximately50,000 children in the United States alone, perhaps a little less,with the yearly burden of one point\u2014I'm sorry, with a lifetime bur-den, it would be of 1.25 billion for just that 10 percent. It isn't triv-ial. And as a public health doctor, I hope MMR can be ruled out. There are those that say I am biased, and I will admit it, but let me tell you that my bias as a public health doctor is a profounddesire that we can exonerate this effective vaccine, because it isone of the most effective interventions for important problems wehave. But the failure to demonstrate safety so far means I cannotrecommend it, even after the Danish study, for my own grand-children. So there is the\u2014there is the trivial figure for the 10 percent.Next slide. Two slides\u2014another slide, I'm sorry. Now, next slide.At the core of the methods problem is that the workers described a very important subgroup in the introduction of their paper butdid not examine it specifically. They did not or could not test themost relevant hypothesis as proposed by Wakefield. In other words,they were looking for a question to be appropriate for the questionthey were putting and ignoring what Wakefield and others havepublished over the last few years from clinical and laboratory andnot epidemiology. Next slide.Now, there are also analytic issues, and these are the ones that I am reticent to give too much\u2014you will see it in the literaturewithin days or, at most, weeks. Now, one strength here is thatMadsen and her colleagues used person years. That's what you doin a dynamic cohort situation. I've seen it criticized, and I don't un-derstand it because that's a strength. However, they had allocationof cases to subcohorts of exposed and nonexposed which are dif-ficult to understand. That's one of the two examples that I gave.There is an unusual distribution of ages in the cohorts to whichyou alluded to, Dr. Geier, and they have problems with measure-ment of clinical phenomena, and their censoring rules are surpris-ing or are inappropriate. These are just five or six of the statistical issues over and above that main issue of failing to protect against hiding a phenomenonin a subgroup by looking at the 90 percent, if you wish. Next slide. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr I have first is, why did Madsen and IOM do an adjustment to the subcohort that removed six autistic and a totalof 13 cases of progressive developmental disorder cases from thevaccinated subcohort and then place them in the unvaccinated one?This single adjustment reduces relative risks of autism due toMMR vaccination by 17 percent, from 1.26 to 1.09. Next slide.Why did Madsen not simply exclude all cases involving earlier, that is, nonregressive, diagnosis of autism? If they had removed allcases diagnosed before 2 years of age from both subcohorts, the rel-ative risk would have risen from 1.26 to 1.28. Next slide.Now, another problem is difficult to understand. I'm not saying they are wrong, but I still haven't quite figured out what they didand why and how they adjust it. To age cohorts coming close to theend of the study or the end of followup, we have an average incep-tion of the disease. It's about 3 years. If you only follow them fora year and a half, you are going to miss an awful lot of autisticcases among those exposed. So the censoring is difficult to under-stand, how they adjusted for it. I'm still in the process of figuringout and may well write an article on that with colleagues in therelatively near future. Next slide.Now, the classical problem of computerized data bases as they had, as we had in Saskatchewan, and I did a big study on betaagonists in Saskatchewan in\u2014almost exactly 10 years ago, pub-lished in the New England Journal, the most cited paper in the lit-erature that year. These data bases can and are useful, but therethe data are gathered for other purposes, and when you go intothose data bases, sometimes you just cannot get the data you needbecause it was never gathered or it was never archived. That mayalmost certainly be the case here, and certainly variables could notbe considered. There has been very, I would say, wise discussion of mercury and the implications a few moments ago. There was nothing about mer-cury in all of this and nothing mentioned. Next slide.I think we will skip this. This has to do with what I have from Wakefield in the literature, the fact that this is multifactorial. Itinvolves interactions between potentially enabling factors, trigger-ing factors such as mercury and MMR working in concert, sub-groups genetically. You know, I don't know much about genetics,and I don't know\u2014I don't\u2014can't appreciate well how far we havegotten there, but I really hope we never discourage the pursuit ofgenetic information because it's likely to be an interactive, multi-factorial profile which we don't understand yet. Next slide.Now, the fourth issue is research management tactics, which re- fers to some of the issues that you directly or indirectly mentionedearlier, Mr. Chairman, you and some of the colleagues. The con-cerns are about the process of funding, the interaction of sponsorswith protocol formulation and approval, compliance with protocol,the role of the investigators vis-a-vis sponsors in the actual conductof search and the input of the CDC epidemiologist in the prepara- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 report with its conclusions. Now, sponsors should stay out of it except through clear, ethical accountability patterns. Spon-sors should not be involved in the research. Was there a protocol?Next slide. Next slide, please.Was there a protocol? Who approved it? Were there any changes in the protocol? Who approved the changes? Who monitored thework in progress? Who approved the final report? Was there a sci-entific advisory board? What exactly was the role of the CD and itsprofessionals? That I don't know, and it's not in published lit-erature, and it's not been the appropriate thing, for now, for me toapproach Dr. Madsen. Next slide.Now, I would like to point very quickly to epidemiologic research priorities based on computerized data bases. The Danish one is ex-cellent, it really is, for that kind of data source. And we don't haveit in the United States. We only have it in Saskatchewan in Can-ada, maybe to a lesser extent in Quebec, a few other places, per-haps Sweden. But in Sweden the confidentiality is so high thatthey destroy your letters before they read them. As I said, heavy metals and the developing immune system, all those issues, were not touched on for reasons I said. Forgive me for going on ahead. Next slide. Next slide.Likewise, we have heard here, and earlier testimony which I heard, synergistic adverse effects upon the immune system of sus-ceptible children could not be studied here. The triggering phe-nomenon couldn't be studied in any manifestation of autism. Next slide.There is no mention of heavy metal as a likely multifactorial causal association. And it's not the fault of the investigators. I don'twant us to go away and thinking badly of Dr. Madsen and her col-leagues. They are good scientists. We don't know the pressuresthey had upon them, whether yes or no, from outside agencies. Butthis cannot be done with the Danish link data bases, as good asthey are. It just can't be done. Mr. B URTON . Doctor, sir, are you near\u2014\u2014 Dr. S PITZER . I'm almost\u20142 minutes or so. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, sir. Dr. S PITZER . Next slide. Now, it's my view and that of others that the Madsen group should replicate, extend, and perform complementary designs of therecent work. One should also explore whether it is feasible to dothe same in Saskatchewan, Canada. Next slide.The hallmark of science is replication, verification, and corrobo- ration. One study proves nothing. In any of these nationalpreventional data bases, one can do cohort studies that are exten-sions and corroborations and\u2014but the methods must be declaredfor analysis in advance. And unless the case control study goes intothis representative two subcohorts, takes all the cases as cases andtakes the probability representative sample of the controls as thecontrols, and then you have all the advantages of both cohort andcase control in one study and at about a tenth of the cost, for thatmatter. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Now, there must be total transparency, considering the things that I've heard from distinguished members from both parties ofthe committee. There must be a scientific advisory board monitor-ing all phases, especially protocol changes in progress, proposedpublications. The majority should be epidemiologists and biostat-isticians. Ethics and conflicts of interest for reasons that are self-evident and may ultimately\u2014should be under surveillance, perhapsby a community advisory board as we did in Alberta. And the main protocol should be published in advance. We should be able to critique that protocol in the peer-reviewed lit-erature. In major studies, that's what my group at McGill do andwhat many groups in Europe are doing as well, even in NorthAmerica. Next slide.A significant first step has been taken in epidemiology. It is im- perative that the whole feasible road of research be taken. Onestudy proves or disproves nothing in any field, or two, if you takethe lines, that one that you described. Thank you for your attention.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Spitzer. We appreciate your com- ments as well. [The prepared statement of Dr. think I will let Dr. Weldon start off. Doctor, would you have any questions? Mr. W ELDON . Yes, Mr. Chairman. I have a question for Dr. Geier. You said the CDC or the FDA has the data as to which manufac- turers produce which vaccines that contain thimerosal and whichones don't. And the VAERS data shows that some of them have ahigher incidence of these neurodevelopmental disorders, and\u2014butyou just can't disclose that? Is that correct? Dr. G EIER. Yeah. There are three levels of denominators. One level is, how many doses of each type of vaccine were made peryear? Which we have and can disclose, although that seems to benot generally available, but we have managed to get it. The second one is broken down by company, which we have under agreement that we not disclose which company. So we cando a study like the one I presented and compare one with and onewithout, but I couldn't say such and such a company makes a vac-cine and another company makes a vaccine, and the first companyis five times worse than the second company. And then the third level that they also have\u2014and this is all pub- lished by them if they have it, is that they have the number ofdoses per lot number. So with that information you could inves-tigate the possibility of a bad lot. I looked in my VAERS data, andI find some lots that have far more reported reactions than others,but I don't know how big the lots were. If I knew how big the lotswere, I could tell you, yes, there was a bad lot of particular vaccinemade in such and such a year or, no, there wasn't. And that infor-mation I've been unable to get with or without any agreements. Mr. W ELDON . So what you are saying is if it is an average-sized lot but there's a higher incidence of side effects\u2014\u2014 Dr. G EIER. Well, I don't know. I mean, let's say I look at two lots, and one of them has 100,000 reactions and one of them has 10,000reactions. It could be that the 100,000 was a 10 times bigger lot.If I average them, that's not valid. I have to know. And they knowexactly how many doses were in each lot. And if they release that,we could look lot by lot through the VAERS data and say, well,there was a bad lot. Boy, it had 20 times\u2014and we could do statis-tics to see whether it was just by random choice or chance orwhether it was real that a particularly bad lot was made. There has been a lot of literature on bad lots. In fact, in the 1980's the FDA used to keep a list called the ''hot lot'' list, and theyalso had trouble getting the numbers. But they have the numbersnow to do it, and they won't release these to any scientists, andthey won't allow people to discuss which vaccine company makesa worst vaccine when they're two of the same vaccine made by thesame company, and I think consumers are entitled to that kind ofinformation. It's sort of like, you know, we get an automobile crashtest and you find, gee, one car is a lot safer than the other whenit runs into a wall, but we are not going to tell you which kind of car. Well, they tell us which kind of car, but they won't tell uswhich vaccine producer. They won't allow it to be released whichvaccine producer makes a safer vaccine. And I think with our chil-dren and our lives it's critical that we have that information. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr Spitzer, I always find it very interesting to hear you speak. It's frequently a little hard to follow, though, notbeing a biostatistician or an epidemiologist, so I just want to makesure I understand you correctly. You said the Danish study, theMadsen study, is a good study. But is what I said in my introduc-tory remarks accurate, that it did not\u2014is it the case that if MMRwas causing the majority cases of autism, that the study is good,but if it's causing a percentage less than 50 percent, then the studyis not valid? Is that what you were basically saying? Dr. S PITZER . Well, what I would like to stress is that the Madsen study in a sense broke a barrier in being the first properly con-trolled epidemiological study ever done and new avenues which canbe followed and also had the advantage of an extraordinarily gooddata base with the disadvantages\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . And I understood all that. Dr. S PITZER . Now, what I'm saying is, they just didn't go far enough, first of all, with inadequate evaluation of the cases, bothin terms of a small sample and in terms of how much within eachcase was looked at. We don't have the details of that. And, second, I'm just saying they cannot rule out with the deci- siveness that they imply, they cannot rule out an association. Theycan for the totality, but they can't say there is no subgroup thatconceivably could be affected. Mr. W ELDON . So is it correct\u2014\u2014 Dr. S PITZER . And so that's\u2014it just didn't go far enough, even though it's a major advance in the study of autismepidemiologically in the last decade. Mr. W ELDON . Is it correct to read it and interpret that MMR does not cause the bulk of autism in Denmark, but it may cause\u2014itcould cause\u2014\u2014 Dr. S PITZER . You can infer that if you take them as a totality and look at them that way. It's not detectable should it be happeningin a subgroup. Mr. W ELDON . But if MMR is causing a percentage\u2014let's say a percentage well below 50 percent, then that study didn't answerthat question\u2014\u2014 Dr. S PITZER . OK. URTON . tleman yield? Mr. W ELDON . I would be happy to yield. Mr. B URTON . In layman's terms, so that everybody understands, you are saying that it could cause 10 percent, 20 percent of the au-tism cases, 30 percent. Is that right? Dr. S PITZER . When you get up to 30 percent, it's\u2014but 20 percent or below is a concern. Mr. B URTON . Well, see, that's something that a lot of us\u2014you went right over our heads with all those statistics. But you are say- ing that it's possible that 20 percent of the autistic cases could beas a result of the MMR vaccine? Dr. S PITZER . Yes, and cannot be ruled out by this study. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 the figure 10 percent to be conservative rath- er than 20, although it could be 20. But 10 percent is what we test-ed hypothetically and I'd like to speak to. Mr. B URTON . Well, 10 percent is still a considerable number of children. Mr. W ELDON . Dr. Baskin, you are a clinician, I understand. Have you looked at the research data done by a Dr. Wakefield from Eng-land on the issue of MMR and autism? Are you familiar with thatat all? Dr. B ASKIN . Yes, I'm familiar with that. I've actually met Dr. Wakefield and conversed with him. Mr. W ELDON . OK. One of the things that I have been very con- cerned about since I've been working with the chairman on thisissue, and it's about 3 years now, I think this is now the third epi-demiologic study. There were two out of England and then therewas this\u2014maybe it's the fourth one. I think there was a U.S. study,if I'm not mistaken. Dr. S PITZER . There is the Finnish study as well. Mr. W ELDON . OK. But nobody has made an attempt to duplicate a clinical study like the original Wakefield research. And can youhonestly refute Dr. Wakefield's clinical data with all these epi-demiologic studies, particularly in light of the conversation I justhad with Dr. Spitzer, that the study only\u2014the best study we've hadso far can only be used to say that MMR does not cause all autismcases in Denmark and that the study does not exclude the possibil-ity that MMR is causing a percentage of them? Dr. B ASKIN . The answer is, no, I can't refute that. While thimero- sal is my major research base as a clinician, and after conversa-tions with Dr. Wakefield, one of his great concerns is regressive au-tism, the fact the child starts out normal and then gets worse, andanother one of his great concerns is the second shot, none of thesestudies have actually looked at these subgroups in any detail. Mr. W ELDON . I have some more questions, but I would like to yield back to the chairman for the moment. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Let me start with you, Dr. Baskin, and you, Dr. Geier. Because thimerosal\u2014although MMR is a very important issue as well andimportant to me, I am interested in the thimerosal issue becauseit has been given to literally millions of people since the 1930's, andit's been given in more and more greater quantities in recent yearsbecause of the number of vaccinations involved. Do you personallybelieve from your studies that the mercury is a contributing factorto the cases of autism we have in this country? Dr. B ASKIN . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Do you think it's a large contributing factor, or do you have any percentages? I mean, I know this is a tough questionand everything, but you have done a lot of research. Dr. B ASKIN . I think it's hard to look at a percentage. I think that, as NIH is focusing on, there is probably an environment gene inter- action. In other words, a lot of children get the injection and don'tbecome autistic, and so there must be something specific or dif-ferent about the way a certain subgroup of children are able tohandle toxins which, as I alluded to earlier, is known for other tox- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 mean, that is not a foreign concept. I don't think we yet know the answer to that. I think that one of the striking things is over the years at NIH and NICHD the idea of regressive autism was not well accepted.It was sort of originally preached that you were sort of autisticfrom birth and actually there weren't that many children who haveregressive autism. But the NIH with good data and with goodscience has actually reversed its position quite a bit on that, andthis group seems to be increasing. So up to somewhere between 30and 40 percent of children in very conservative studies seem tohave this regressive autism. In other words, it doesn't seem likethey are starting out abnormal. Something happens to them, andthey backslide. So I think if you want to take a conservative estimate and you want to take those conservative numbers, because there are otherstudies that say 60, 70 percent of autism is regressive, I think thatit's a very good chance it's more likely than not that it contributesor causes autism in about 40 percent of children who are autistic. Mr. B URTON . Would you say that a child like my grandson who got nine shots in 1 day, seven of which contained thimerosal, wouldyou say that they had a greater risk of getting a neurologic\u2014creat-ing a neurological problem like autism than\u2014\u2014 Dr. B ASKIN . Yeah, absolutely. I didn't touch on that. I tried to be very conservative with my analysis. But, as you pointed out, theseEPA guidelines are a small amount per day. These kids are gettingan enormous amount all at once. And you say\u2014you could say youcould average the amount of a lethal injection over your lifetimeand say, well, you never in any 1 day got a lethal dose. The onlytrouble, you'd be dead and 6 feet under the ground. So, yes. Imean, those are the most concerning cases, children who were OK,who got worse, and whose parents can link this to a single or a setof\u2014a serial set of exposures to mercury. And that sounds like theabsolute typical case that we would be most concerned about. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Geier, I think you indicated that in some cases kids are getting 100 times the amount of mercury that would betolerable at one time. Dr. G EIER. Yes. In fact, some of those calculations are over 100 times. Mr. B URTON . So a child that got multiple vaccines in 1 day could conceivably be getting more than 100 times the amount, accordingto EPA, that's a tolerable level of mercury in one fell swoop? Dr. G EIER. Yes. And their levels are actually conservative, be- cause they meant by ingestion, not by injection. So their studieswere not usually by injection. Mr. B URTON . So the injection would be actually\u2014\u2014 Dr. G EIER. It's worse. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Worse, much more lethal, so to speak. Dr. G EIER. Yeah. I mean, there is no question that these children are overdosed. Mr. B URTON . Would either one of you take nine shots in 1 day, knowing that seven of them contained mercury, at the same time?And\u2014or would you allow that to happen to your kids or grandkids,whether they are healthy or not? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 . You know, a mercury thermometer broke in my house, and I cleared everybody out of the house and went to mylab and got these really bioresistant gloves, and cleared it up likea toxic spill. No, of course not. It's a really bad toxin.Dr. G EIER. I wouldn't. And I had a different situation. I run a laboratory that does chromosome analysis, and we had a mercuryvapor bulb break. And we were located near the NIH, and wecleared the building and had the NIH guys come in with full bodysuits to clean out the area. Dr. B ASKIN . And I think we've dramatically underestimated what's been in the literature for the entire last century, that thisis a highly toxic compound. The more we look into it, the worse itgets. Mr. B URTON . And it shouldn't be injected into human beings. Dr. B ASKIN . Absolutely not. Mr. B URTON . But one of the things\u2014one other thing I want to talk about, and this is not related to my personal problems, I hope.And that is that older people are coming down with Alzheimer's ata more rapid rate than in the past. Do you attribute that in anyway to the levels of mercury that they are ingesting, either throughtheir amalgams in their mouth or the vaccinations that they aregetting or the food that they are eating that contain mercury? Dr. B ASKIN . I think that's a less well-studied area. But this work that you described, which I was aware of, of the fact that as thesecells die from mercury they form these kind of plaques and tangleslike we see in Alzheimer's disease is very intriguing and certainlysuggests this may well be a contributing factor. Mr. B URTON . And should be studied. Dr. B ASKIN . Absolutely should be studied. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Geier. Dr. G EIER. I agree. I think it's well-studied, could be studied, but is very plausible. Mr. B URTON . I don't want to alarm everybody in the United States, but the Members of Congress have been getting flu vaccinesthat contain thimerosal for several years. And I want you to knowthat I don't think that's one of the reasons we have made bad deci-sions up here, although somebody might ask that question. Dr. Weldon, do you have any more questions of this panel?Mr. W ELDON . Yeah. I have a couple of questions for Dr. Baskin about ethyl mercury versus methyl mercury. I have had some peo-ple say that data on methyl mercury is fairly good, but we don'thave good data on ethyl mercury. I take it from your testimonythere is actually quite a bit of data on ethyl mercury and that it'sas toxic as methyl mercury. Dr. B ASKIN . There is more data, more and more data on ethyl mercury. The cells that I showed you dying in cell culture aredying from ethyl mercury. Those are human frontal brain cells.You know, there has been a debate about, well, ethyl versus meth-yl. But from a chemical point of view, most chemical compoundsthat are ethyl penetrate into cells better than methyl. Cells havea membrane on them, and the membrane is made of lipids, fats.And ethyl as a chemical compound pierces fat and penetrates fatmuch better than methyl. And so, you know, when I've began to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr of the Ph.D.s in my laboratory and discuss this, everyone said, oh, gosh, you know, we've got to adjust for ethyl be-cause it's going to be worse; the levels are going to be much higherin the cells. So, I mean, I think at best they're equal, but it's prob-ably highly likely that they are worse. And some of the results thatwe are seeing in cell culture would support that. Mr. W ELDON . Now, you said several times in your testimony that uptake in the brain is probably much higher than in other tissues.What do you base that statement on? Dr. B ASKIN . Well, the literature on methyl mercury is much bet- ter than ethyl on this issue. And if you look at the studies, thebrain is 2 percent of the body weight but took 10 percent of the ex-posure. So that's a fivefold preferential update. Mr. W ELDON . This was based on people who died? Dr. B ASKIN . Right. And also on animal studies, both. Mr. W ELDON . Animal studies? So the brain\u2014what did they do\u2014\u2014 Dr. B ASKIN . The brain seems to take five times more the expo- sure than it should. In other words, if you assume that you givemethyl mercury and it goes everywhere in the body equally\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . You should get the same level. Dr. B ASKIN [continuing]. You should get the same level every- where. But the brain takes five times as much as it should have. Mr. W ELDON . And that was based on methyl mercury? Dr. B ASKIN . Methyl mercury. Correct. Mr. W ELDON . The Lancet study, only 40 infants. You agree that's much too small a sample size to really make any conclusions? Dr. B ASKIN . Right. I mean, there are a number of problems with the Lancet studies as I mentioned. But certainly, if the disease oc-curs in one in 150 children and you only test 40, you may miss thatchild, very easily miss the child who had the problem, or at bestmaybe only catch one. Not to mention the other things that havebeen discussed by several of the panel, the most significant onebeing they drew the blood much too late. They drew the blood daysto weeks later, whereas we know the peak level of methylmercury\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . Three to 28 days. Dr. B ASKIN [continuing]. Occur within hours, within 24 hours; yet they drew the blood up to 27 days later. As a matter of fact,to me it's very worrisome. They are still finding some mercury inthe blood that far out. It should\u2014you know, you would think itmight be gone. Mr. W ELDON . Is there any\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Would the gentleman yield? Would that be the rea- son that some families see a very, very rapid change in their chil-dren shortly after these vaccinations are given in large numbers?For instance, in our family it was just a matter of a couple daysand\u2014boom. Dr. B ASKIN . Correct. All of the data on both methyl and ethyl mercury suggests that the peak level\u2014in other words, the highestlevel in the blood\u2014is either achieved within hours or at least with-in 24 hours. So that's\u2014and, again, if it gets in the blood, the bloodgoes to the brain. We know it has a preferential tendency to besucked into the brain or to cross into the brain in excess, and so VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr expect to see something fairly quickly. As a matter of fact, if somebody said 3 months later something happened, I wouldsay that's probably not related. Mr. B URTON . Can I followup with one question here? Mr. W ELDON . Sure. Mr. B URTON . In animal studies, as I understand it, the animals evidently didn't become ill for 14 days after the injection of themercury. Are you familiar with that study? Dr. B ASKIN . It depends on which study you are talking about. There's a variety of different studies. Mr. B URTON . Well, it's a rat study that was done in the 1950's by the Eli Lilly company. Are you familiar with that? Dr. B ASKIN . I'm not familiar with that particular study. But, you know, in general, remember that if you are doing studies on ratsand mice, you have to have very sensitive behavioral screens. Aslong as they are getting up and eating, I mean, they might be act-ing weirdly and you wouldn't know it. So I\u2014without knowing whatstudy you're referring to, it would be hard for me to comment onit. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Mr. W ELDON . Is there any kinetic studies on the clearance of ethyl mercury that are available that could allow you to make con-jectures as to what the peak levels might have been based on theblood levels that are available in the Lancet study? Or is that infor-mation not known? Dr. B ASKIN . It's known to a limited extent. There's a study in pre-term infants that received vaccinations. So they\u2014you know, by kind of people not thinking about it, theirweight is very small and they receive the same dose, and so it wasa very high level. And they looked at some of that data. But, frank-ly, there is not enough. I think one of the points in the Lancet study is they drew all these complicated curves saying that they knew what the phar-macokinetics were, which refers that they knew how the drug wastaken up, how it was absorbed, how it was distributed, but theynever caught a peak level. And, of course, you can't even make acomment about pharmacokinetics unless you know the peak level. So, I mean, I think the short answer is there is some\u2014some data available but not enough. Mr. W ELDON . Dr. Geier, when this issue was first brought to my attention 3 years ago, I was very disturbed about the mercuryissue. Then the CDC study that you referred to where you drewthose curves came out; and, frankly, I was somewhat relieved withthat data. Not being a scientist or an epidemiologist, I accepted itat face value. There was some initial data suggesting that some ofthe kids had language and speech development problems, and thenthey added more numbers and said that association went away. I'mvery disturbed by these curves that you drew, though. So you're saying that\u2014I just want to make sure I understand you correctly\u2014that when you plot out the data like that, you canactually do a calculation and it is statistically significant? Dr. G EIER. Yes. When you\u2014if you allow us to remove that great- er than 62 point\u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Well, I want to ask you about that. You say it's got to be 75. Is that based on the immunization tables and the knownamount of\u2014\u2014 Dr. G EIER. Yes. Mr. W ELDON [continuing]. Thimerosal in there? So they couldn't have gotten 150 or 200. It had to be 75. Dr. G EIER. Right. It had to be 75. And when you allow that point, then you have a curve-fitting program that tries to fit the bestcurve. And it tells you how well the curve fits to that, and it fitsin greater than 95 percent to a logarithmic curve. Mr. W ELDON . Not being a scientist, I can't honestly\u2014but I just know what it's like. You know, I'm going to get the CDC people inmy office after all this is over, and I'm going to say, OK, how doyou respond to all of this? And I don't think they are here today,right? They are not in the second panel, Mr. Chairman? Which I'mvery disappointed by. But I would assume they are going to saythat's not kosher, so to speak, what you did; that's not a valid sci-entific technique. Dr. G EIER. No, I think they're going to be upset that we used their intermediate data before they added all these young childrento dilute it out. And even when they diluted it out, by the way, it'sstill there. It just became more dilute. As far as, you know, doingthe curve, I think they'd have to agree that, you know, if you ana-lyze a single point and then you compare that to analysis of severalpoints as they go up, you add more likelihood that it's significant.I mean, just intuitively, what's the odds that three go up in a row?I mean, just supposing something is random, forget about even howmuch they go up or even what shape they go up, the odds of threegoing up in a row are not so good if they were from a random sub-ject. So it's obvious that to intuitively that\u2014but\u2014and as well as mathematically that when you go to a kinetic curve like that, thecurve can be significant even if each individual point is only, as Ithink they said, marginally significant. You get three marginallysignificant curves that fit like that, it becomes very significant. But maybe Dr. Spitzer, who is our epidemiologist and mathe- matician, can comment on that. Dr. S PITZER . Well, it's\u2014trying to say it in nontechnical terms\u2014 but it is a finding that's being observed by appropriate rules ofhandling the data in the main. It's usually preferable that it be de-clared in advance, and that 75 that he said, not in the course ofanalysis and so on, but that this is not likely to happen by chance,at least at the 95 percent level, or chance alone. That's the basicprinciple. It's a finding where the role of chance has been excludedto the extent of 95 percent. Mr. W ELDON . I believe I understand. I could really go on much further, but I was just reminded we actually have a second panel,and we have been at it for 2 12hours, so I will yield back. I'm sorry, Mr. Burton. Mr. B URTON . No, that's fine, Dr. Weldon. You ask more poignant questions than I, because you have that experience and back-ground. Before I recognize Congressman Green, who I believe is Dr. Baskin's Congressman\u2014is that correct? VerDate B URTON . Is he a good one? Dr. B ASKIN . He is very good. Mr. B URTON . OK. Well, I just thought I'd ask. Dr. B ASKIN . He is a good patient, too. Mr. B URTON . That's unsolicited testimony. Before I recognize him, let me just ask you one quick question here. Do you, all three of you, think that our health agencies havedone enough in the research of this very, very important issue ofthe epidemic of autism? Dr. B ASKIN . My opinion is this: I think that the NIH now is gal- vanized and is doing more. And if, as I said earlier, if more fundscould be set aside for this specific issue, they have the capabilityand the interest to do it. Mr. B URTON . Have they in the past? Dr. B ASKIN . Not in the past, no, but I think they are now. Mr. B URTON . So we have an epidemic, and up to this point they haven't been doing enough. Dr. B ASKIN . Right. I think so. I think so. But I think, to be fair to NIH, a lot of this information wasn't really made available; likeI talked about agencies not talking to each other. Mr. B URTON . What about CDC? Dr. B ASKIN . I think the CDC is not. The CDC, in my opinion, has been obstructionist. Mr. B URTON . OK. How about the FDA? Dr. B ASKIN . The FDA, as they said in their own e-mails, I think have been asleep at the switch for decades. Mr. B URTON . Asleep at the switch. OK. Dr. Geier. Dr. G EIER. I think\u2014it's Geier. Mr. B URTON . Geier. Dr. G EIER. I think that they've been asleep, and I think that we found that out when we did a midline search on thimerosal. Thereare over 1,500 articles listing problems with thimerosal. And thatdoesn't go back\u2014the midline search goes back to 1967. Actually,the problem goes back farther than that. If there are 1,500 articlesthat are implying problems with thimerosal and the FDA and CDCknew that it was in the vaccines, something should have beendone, more than just ignoring it. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Geier. Dr. Spitzer.Dr. S PITZER . Well, as I mentioned before, on this whole matter, particularly as it concerns MMR, I call myself a worried agnostic.If I, from the FDA or some of the sister major agencies around theworld, could get assurances that we have the same quality informa-tion on safety of this product as we have on efficacy or effective-ness\u2014and that is good\u2014my worry would go down a bit, or go downquite a bit. It's gone a little bit down with the Danish studies. Butthat's what I have not been able to find, Mr. Chairman, is ade-quate, scientifically admissible evidence on the safety of the prod-ucts as opposed to efficacy. Mr. B URTON . And at this point you wouldn't give your grandkids the MMR vaccine? Dr. S PITZER . Not yet. No. Not in the foreseeable future, I don't think. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr Thank you. Well, let me just end my comment here by saying that the FDA and CDC and our health agencies have anawful lot of questions that need to be answered. But the one thingthey could do to make the situation a lot better is if they get on\u2014get on with admitting there is a problem if there were 1,500 arti-cles\u2014and start really getting down to the business of studying thisthing and devoting the amount of resources that are necessary toget the job done. And I want to thank you guys very much for yourhelp. And, with that, Congressman Green, it's good to have you with us. Mr. G REEN . Mr. Chairman, I did serve on this committee three terms ago and I moved to the Energy and Commerce to deal withhealth care. It's interesting; I walked back in the office from ameeting and saw Dr. Baskin, who, one, is a great friend and greatneurosurgeon, and I'm going to ask him to sign an affidavit that,yes, a Member of Congress does have a brain. But\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Did you get a flu shot this year? Mr. G REEN . I did get a flu shot in. Mr. B URTON . Well, it has mercury in it. Mr. G REEN . OK. Mr. W ELDON . You know, he has brain cells he's growing in his lab. I was wondering if he would sell some to Members of Congress. Mr. G REEN . You know, we could use them. We could use them. But the issue\u2014because we were just responding in our office to aletter of a family with a child with autism. And on my Subcommit-tee on Health Care, that our good doctor is also on, this is an issue.And I want to thank you for holding these hearings to help us asMembers of Congress go further. But again, I just came in to sayhello to my good friend Dr. Baskin. Dr. B ASKIN . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Before you leave, let me just say that\u2014\u2014 Mr. G REEN . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Before you leave, I just want to say that we have a bill that I've talked to Congressman Bilirakis, thechairman of your subcommittee about, that would go a long way to-ward helping solve the problem with the vaccine injury compensa-tion fund, and I really would appreciate if you'd talk to him andtake a look at that bill. Mr. G REEN . OK. Glad to. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. Well, gentlemen, thank you very much. We have gone way be- yond what we normally would, but I thought it was very importantto let you really lay out the whole story. And with that, we will goto the next panel. And thank you for your service. Mr. B URTON . The next panel is, we have the FDA and the NIH, Dr. Midthun, Dr. Foote, and Dr. Portier. Would you please come tothe witness table? Please stand up so I can swear you in, please. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Dr. Midthun, do you have an opening statement? Dr. M IDTHUN . Yes, I do. Mr. B URTON . OK. You are recognized. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 MIDTHUN, M.D., DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF VACCINES RESEARCH AND REVIEW, FOOD AND DRUG AD-MINISTRATION, ROCKVILLE, MD; STEPHEN FOOTE, PH.D., DI-RECTOR, DIVISION OF NEUROSCIENCE AND BASIC BEHAV-IORAL SCIENCE, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,BETHESDA, MD, ACCOMPANIED BY CHRISTOPHER PORTIER,PH.D., DIRECTOR, ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY PRO-GRAM, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTHSCIENCES, BETHESDA, MD Dr. M IDTHUN . Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am Dr. Karen Midthun, Director, Office of Vaccine Research and Review of theCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research at FDA. Mr. Chairman, as a physician and a parent, I want to express to you, the members of this committee, and to parents and physi-cians that I appreciate the devastating effects of autism on childrenand their families. I am here to assure you that we are workingdiligently to help ensure that the vaccines we license for use in theUnited States are shown to be safe, pure, and potent. I appreciatethe opportunity to participate in this hearing on autism and to re-spond to the committee's concerns regarding a potential link be-tween vaccines and autism. The Office of Vaccines regulates the investigation and licensure of vaccines. FDA's regulatory process for licensing vaccines has fordecades served as a model for other countries. To date, the existingdata do not demonstrate a causal relationship between vaccinesand autism. Nonetheless, I want to assure this committee, the pub-lic, and especially parents, that FDA continues to take these issuesseriously. One concern that has been raised relates to the use of thimero- sal, a mercury compound, as a preservative in some vaccines. FDArecognizes and supports the goal of reducing exposure to mercuryfrom all sources. Consistent with this goal, FDA has encouragedmanufacturers to develop new vaccines without thimerosal as apreservative and to remove or reduce the thimerosal content of ex-isting licensed vaccines. As required by section 413 of the FDA Modernization Act, FDA conducted a review of the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines.Our review showed no evidence of harm caused by thimerosal usedas a preservative in vaccines except for local hypersensitivity reac-tions. Of the U.S.-recommended childhood immunization schedule,the maximum cumulative exposure to mercury from thimerosal atthe time of this review in 1999 was within acceptable limits formethyl mercury exposure set by FDA, the Agency for Toxic Sub-stances and Disease Registry, and the World Health Organization.However, during the first 6 months of life, cumulative exposure tomercury could have exceeded the more conservative limits of theEPA in some cases, depending on the specific vaccine formulationsused and the weight of the infant. Of note, all of these guidelinescontain a safety margin and are meant as starting points for eval-uation of mercury exposure, not absolute levels above which tox-icity can be expected to occur. The clinical significance of exceeding EPA's limits is not cur- rently known. Nevertheless, reducing exposure to mercury from VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr warranted and achievable in principle in the United States because it is possible to replace multi-dose vials with single-dose vials which do not require preservative. I am pleased to be able to report substantial progress in the ef- fort to reduce thimerosal exposure from vaccines. Since early lastyear, all routinely recommended licensed pediatric vaccines manu-factured for the U.S. market contain no thimerosal or contain onlytrace amounts of thimerosal in the final formulation. With thenewly formulated vaccines, the maximum cumulative exposurefrom vaccines during the first 6 months of life is now less than 3micrograms of mercury. This represents more than a 98 percent re-duction from the previous maximum cumulative exposure of 187.5micrograms of mercury from vaccines. In addition to the initiatives taken with regard to routinely rec- ommended childhood vaccines, FDA has also worked with manufac-turers to facilitate the removal or reduction of thimerosal fromother vaccines. Two of the three influenza virus vaccines are nowavailable in a formulation that contains only trace thimerosal. Themanufacturer of the third influenza virus vaccine has announcedthat it will not manufacture this vaccine after this year. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine's Immunizations Safety Review Committee focused on a potential relationship between thimerosaluse in vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. The Institute ofMedicine concluded that the evidence is inadequate to either acceptor reject a causal relationship between thimerosal exposure fromchildhood vaccines and the neurodevelopmental disorders of au-tism, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, and speech or lan-guage delay. Additional studies are needed to establish or reject a causal rela- tionship, and we concur with that. The committee believes that the effort to remove thimerosal from vaccines was a prudent measure in support of the public healthgoal to reduce mercury exposure of infants and children as muchas possible. In an effort to better characterize the potential toxicitythat could have accompanied an exposure to thimerosal from vac-cines, FDA nominated thimerosal to the National Toxicology Pro-gram for further study. The nomination was accepted by the reviewcommittee earlier this year. Reports of developmental delay following vaccination have been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, com-monly referred to as VAERS. Although VAERS reports usually can-not establish a causal relationship between a vaccine and an ad-verse outcome, further study of these reports can sometimes pro-vide important clues and suggest directions for further research.FDA takes these reports seriously and is conducting a followupstudy of VAERS reports of autism. Also, FDA is pursuing promis-ing research involving the characterization and development of ananimal model to study general biological principles for autism. By looking at ways to improve the safety of vaccines, we must keep in mind that childhood vaccines have contributed to a signifi-cant reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio,measles, and whooping cough. It is rare for American children toexperience the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable illness.Although they provide a great public health benefit, vaccines, like VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr products, are not risk free, and FDA is committed to continuing its efforts to reduce these risks whenever possible. In conclusion, FDA continues to work diligently with manufac- turers to eliminate or reduce exposure to mercury from thimerosaland vaccines. Since early last year, all routinely recommended li-censed pediatric vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market con-tain no thimerosal or contain only trace amounts of thimerosal inthe final formulation. Although no causal relationship between vac-cines and autism has been established, FDA, along with otherhealth and human services agencies, continues to pursue and sup-port research activities to increase our understanding of any poten-tial relationship between vaccines and neurodevelopment disorders. Although the prevention of disease through the use of vaccines is a tremendous public health accomplishment, there is more workto be done. I assure you that the Office of Vaccines and FDA willcontinue to make regulatory decisions and recommendations re-garding vaccines based on the best scientific evidence to protect thepublic health. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the committee's interest in this area, and look forward to continuing to work with you in the future.Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Mr. F OOTE . Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am Dr. Steve Foote, Director of the Division of Neuroscience and Basic Be-havioral Science of the National Institute of Mental Health. I amaccompanied by Dr. Christopher Portier, Director of the Environ-mental Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environ-mental Health Sciences. I am the witness representing the National Institutes of Health today because I play several roles in the coordination, planning,and oversight of autism research at NIH. For example, I serve asa scientific program staff member of the NIH Internal Autism Co-ordinating Committee, a longstanding body that serves to coordi-nate autism research NIH-wide. Also, I have played a major rolein organizing and implementing the NIH centers program calledfor in the Children's Health Act of 2000, which we have named theStudies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment, or STAART,Centers Program. Finally, I have served a leadership role in the es-tablishment and operation of the Department of Health andHuman Services' Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee thatwas created under a provision of the Children's Health Act of 2000. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about NIH's sup- port of research on autism. I am a neuroscientist who has been in-terested in the brain and its disorders throughout my career, and,like others, I have found autism to be a particularly challengingmystery. My view of this disorder has been broadened and deepened by my continuing interactions with members of the families with au-tistic children and adults. I feel their urgency. An affected childcannot wait for research before growing up. Any potential improve-ment is crucial. I would like to acknowledge the important role of families and advocacy groups in our efforts. They have not only raised the visi-bility of autism and challenged assumptions; they have pushed forand often funded I might say, accelerated and expanded researchactivities. I testified before this committee earlier this year, but now there is even more recent progress to report. The basic research on au-tism that is sorely needed is moving forward at an ever-accelerat-ing pace, as is continued genetic research and studies of the etiol-ogy of various autism spectrum symptoms, including communica-tion disorders and interpersonal difficulties. Autism biomedical re-search is rapidly expanding as the scope and level of detail of sci-entific topics under active investigation is aggressively broadened. Several weeks ago, I attended the Second Annual International Meeting for Autism Research. This meeting was an exciting forumfor this rapidly growing field. It was a meeting that just could nothave even been imagined just a few years ago in terms of its scopeand quality. Extremely important funding programs from voluntary organiza- tions and other Federal agencies, along with very substantial in-creases in NIH funding that have occurred over the past severalyears, have provided financial support underlying this growth involume and quality of research. Other driving forces have been theadvances of closely related biomedical research fields such as VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr have provided the necessary knowledge and tools for more powerful and promising insights intothe biological nature of autism. In summary, biomedical research into autism is advancing rap- idly and NIH is playing a major role in this progress. I am also pleased to report that as part of the enhanced activities in this area, NIH has made much progress in implementing theprovisions of the Children's Health Act of 2000 that focused on NIHresearch activities related to autism. In terms of the requirementfor a new centers of excellence program, NIH has issued a total ofthree requests for applications, RFAs, to implement on a fast track,the STAART Centers program. An RFA, as you know, is a clearstatement to the scientific field, setting aside funds that NIH in-vites research in a particular area. The first RFA was for develop-mental grants. Those were reviewed. We funded six of those. Thesecond RFA was for an initial round of competition for full centersupport. A number of applications were received, reviewed inMarch 2002, and two centers were funded. A second round of com-petition for full center support is in mid-cycle and the applicationsare being reviewed yesterday and today. And I was at those re-views all day yesterday and I was able to attend most of the re-views today, and they are going very well. When these successful applications from this round of competi- tion are funded during fiscal year 2003, the full network of at leastfive centers stipulated by the law will be in place. The five partici-pating NIH Institutes\u2014NIMH, the National Institute of Neuro-logical Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development, the National Institute on Deafness andOther Communication Disorders, and the National Institute of En-vironmental Health Sciences\u2014have committed up to $12 million ayear, including $8 million from NIH, to fund this network at thatlevel for over 5 years\u2014for up to 5 years. This is a commitment of$60 million minimum. Another component of the Children's Health Act was the estab- lishment of an Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, the IACC as we call it. The Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services delegated to NIH the authority to organize theIACC, and NIMH was asked to lead this effort. The IACC has beenorganized and has now had its first three semiannual meetings. Itis actively pursuing its mandate to enhance communication and ef-fective interaction among the several agencies that support or con-duct autism-related research, service, or educational activities, andit has engaged family and advocacy groups largely through thepublic members that were appointed by the Secretary. In addition to these activities, NICHD and NIDCD have competi- tively renewed their longstanding collaborative programs of excel-lence in autism. The NIH is fully committed to this important pro-gram, and will continue its support for both CPEA and STAARTprograms for several years into the future. And yet another recentenhancement of the NIH autism research portfolio, NIEHS, hasfunded two centers focused on autism research. We at the NIH are at a heightened state of awareness concerning the need for more research on autism due to the clear magnitudeof this major public health problem and due to the work of many VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr and outside this room. We have been making progress. In fiscal year 1998, NIH support for autism research to-taled about $26 million; by fiscal year 2001, which is the latestyear for which we have official numbers, the total was about $55million. To put this in perspective, the NIH commitment to autism re- search has more than doubled in these few years. In terms of the specific questions in your letter of invitation, there are a number of active and planned projects that address theconcerns you raise. NIH recently furnished you with a summary ofthe research activities sponsored by the National Institute of Al-lergy and Infectious Diseases and by NIEHS designed to addressquestions about thimerosal, ethyl and methyl mercury, and thesearch for other environmental risk factors for autism. Another question you raised was about treatments, and several institutes are sponsoring numerous projects dealing with treatmentinterventions for autism, and the STAART Centers Program in-cludes a primary emphasis on such studies. So to summarize and finish, NIH is on schedule in terms of im- plementing the letter and the spirit of all aspects of Title I of theChildren's Health Act, including a broadly based increase in autismresearch support, the initiation of a new centers of excellence pro-gram, and enhancement of genetic and other research resources,and the establishment of the Interagency Autism CoordinatingCommittee. That concludes my testimony. And Dr. Portier and I would be glad to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Foote follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you. I just have a few questions here, and then I'm going to let Dr. Weldon ask some questions. But I willhave a number of other ones that I think are relevant and impor-tant after he concludes. I believe Dr. Geier indicated that since the 1980's, there have been 1,500-plus articles written in scientific journals about theproblems with mercury and thimerosal. Why haven't the healthagencies of our government done something about it before now;1,500 articles. Dr. Midthun. Dr. M IDTHUN . The review that we did in response to FDAMA went over the literature that existed, and it was our assessmentthat certainly, as Dr. Baskin was saying, we all know that mercuryitself in larger amounts is clearly a toxicant. But our assessmentwas that the amounts that were present in the vaccines, that theredid not\u2014there was\u2014that those were safe and effective, and thatcertainly though our assessment was that whenever possible it'sgood as a precautionary measure to limit the exposure to mercuryfrom any sources, and in the United States, since we do have theability and principal to use to single-dose presentations that don'trequire a preservative, that would be the appropriate precautionarystep to take. Mr. B URTON . Why haven't we done that before now? I mean, in 1998, the FDA showed it was concerned about the neurotoxic effectof mercury from cumulative dosing. And if you look at exhibit No.3\u2014do you have that in front of you? [Exhibit VerDate Could I please see those? Mr. B URTON . Give that to them, would you please. I want to read you what\u2014this is a memo from Dr. Marianne Gruber to Dr. Carolyn Hardegree and Dr. Norman Baylor of theFDA. It's dated September 17, 1998, and it's entitled ''Point Paper,Preclinical Reproductive Toxicity Studies for Vaccines.'' And on No. C there, if you are looking at it, it says\u2014Dr. Gruber says, for investigational vaccines indicated for material immuniza-tion, the use of single-dose files should be required to avoid theneed of preservatives in multi-dose vials as are required by theCode of Federal Regulations. Of concern here is the potential neu-rotoxic effect of mercury, especially when considering cumulativedoses of this component early in infancy. All mercury-containingvaccine formulations should be evaluated in appropriate preclinicalreproductive toxicology studies that include the assessment of post-natal, behavioral, and developmental end points. Read that?Dr. M IDTHUN . I am sorry, I don't see point C on here. I am look- ing at exhibit 3, and I see A and B. Mr. B URTON . It's on page 4. Dr. M IDTHUN . Page 2\u20143. Mr. B URTON . And these some of your\u2014\u2014 Dr. M IDTHUN . I still\u2014I'm sorry, don't see point C on page 4. I see the heading, the first bold heading. Mr. B URTON . The last paragraph down at the bottom. Dr. M IDTHUN . For investigational vaccines indicated for maternal immunization. That paragraph? Mr. B URTON . Yeah. Dr. M IDTHUN . OK. Let me take a look at that, please. Mr. B URTON . All right. Dr. M IDTHUN . This is a specific reference to maternal immuniza- tions, specifically evaluating investigational vaccines to administerto pregnant women. Mr. B URTON . Right. Dr. M IDTHUN . And there, you know, the\u2014obviously, again, as a precautionary measure to limit the exposure to mercury and alsoto evaluate any vaccine that is investigational that you are tryingto evaluate for that particular use that these kinds of studiesshould be done. So this is a specific reference to vaccination ofpregnant women, for vaccines indicated for them. Mr. B URTON . So let me get this straight. There are 1,500 articles written about the problems with thimerosal and vaccines, we havehad a 40fold increase in the number of children that are autistic,You had this statement regarding pregnant women, and yet youdidn't think that there was any concern about children, infants,getting these vaccines that had thimerosal in them at that time? Dr. M IDTHUN . Again, I haven't had an opportunity to look at this whole\u2014this whole memorandum, but I think that clearly this re-lates to a time pursuant to the FDAMA\u2014FDA Modernization Act of 1997\u2014when a process was initiated to review mercury in generalin all drugs and biologics, including, of course, vaccines. Mr. B URTON . Do you think mercury is a bad thing to be putting in your body? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 I think we recognize that mercury in large amounts clearly is harmful. Mr. B URTON . How much is a large amount? Dr. M IDTHUN . You know, there are different studies that have been done to look at that. And I think that some of the studies thatcame out of the Faroe Islands indicated that perhaps loweramounts could cause problems based on subtle year developmentalobservations that were seen in that study. Although my under-standing was that some of the interpretations of that study werealso somewhat confounded by the probable exposure to PCBs. Mr. B URTON . Enough. Enough. That's enough. I just don't want to hear any more of that. Take a look at this slide that's up here,would you please. That shows the amount of money that is spenton diabetes at the top, AIDS next, and autism at the bottom. Andautism is one of the fastest growing epidemics in the country. Whyis it we're spending such a small amount on research? I know Dr.Foote says we're spending more. But even if we were spending the$55 million you're talking about we're spending $2,770,000 onAIDS and $845,000 on diabetes, not to diminish those, they're veryimportant. But one of the fastest growing, if not the fastest growing epi- demic in the country is autism. And we're spending just a minuteamount on that when we're going to have these kids with us forlife and they're damaged. Why is it more research hasn't been donebefore now? Mr. F OOTE . Well, as you know, these budget figures are the bot- tom line of a very complex set of processes. Certainly we aredoing\u2014we are engaged in a lot of activities designed to increase thenumber of investigators who are capable of constructively utilizingresearch funding to study questions about autism. And that's oneof the major hopes we have for the autism centers program is thatthese will create sites at which young people can get intensivetraining in autism-related issues. And it is our full expectation thatthen they will become qualified and highly competitive investiga-tors for NIH funds. Mr. B URTON . How many studies are currently going on? Mr. F OOTE . How many autism-related research grants\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Studies, that the Federal Government is funding, how many are going on right now that are started? Mr. F OOTE . I don't think I can speak for the entire Federal Gov- ernment, but there are five NIH institutes that fund autism re-search and it runs up into probably a few hundred grants. Mr. B URTON . When does all this start, do you know? Mr. F OOTE . Well, as I indicated in my opening remarks, autism research has been going on in some substantial degree for at leasta decade at NIH, but the exponential curves that we've been dis-cussing certainly apply to the amount of money going into autismresearch, which has increased very dramatically over the past fewyears. Mr. B URTON . Are there still vaccines in doctors' offices right now today that contain thimerosal that are being given to children? Dr. M IDTHUN . I don't believe so, no. As I mentioned, all vaccines for the routine recommended childhood immunization series start-ed 2001 have been manufactured either thimerosal free or with VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 of that thimerosal. Now, that's just the vaccines that are in the routinely recommended immunizationschedule. As I mentioned, influenza vaccines which are not part ofthat recommended schedule but were encouraged to be adminis-tered by the ACIP, although they're not yet part of the routineschedule, those are now available in a thimerosal trace formulationfor both of Evans vaccines and Aventis Pasteur vaccines. As I mentioned, Wyeth announced its intentions not to manufac- ture an influenza vaccine after this year. But the other two do offerthis trace thimerosal presentation. However\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But they still have that thimerosal in them. Dr. M IDTHUN . Yes, they still also have multi-dose vials that do contain\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Why they go to single-dose vials? Dr. M IDTHUN . I know that they are considering the feasibility of\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Why don't you tell them to do that? Dr. M IDTHUN . We consider these vaccines, which also contain thi- merosal as a preservative to be safe and effective. However, we doconsider that it's important to have vaccines\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Did you hear any of the testimony earlier from those people that were testifying, those scientists and doctors? Dr. M IDTHUN . Yes, I did. Mr. B URTON . Did you see the study from Canada there that showed the damage that's done when a very minute amount ofmercury is given, put in proximity to brain cells. Dr. M IDTHUN . I think it's hard to extrapolate that data to what actually happens in a clinical situation. Mr. B URTON . You know, every study that's been done, Doctor, that you guys put forth showing that there's no correlation betweenthimerosal and autism doesn't say categorically that thimerosaldoesn't cause autism. They never say that. Can you are tell meright now categorically without any doubt whatsoever that mercuryin vaccines does not cause autism? Dr. M IDTHUN . I think what I'd have to say is what the Institute of Medicine concluded is that the body of evidence neither\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I want you to give me a yes or no. Can you tell me, can you say right now just flat out, just say can you tell me with-out any doubt whatsoever that the mercury in vaccines does notcause neurological problems or autism? Dr. M IDTHUN . We can neither accept nor reject a causal relation- ship. Mr. B URTON . So what you're saying is you cannot tell me that, you cannot say categorically, can you? Dr. M IDTHUN . We don't know one way or the other. Mr. B URTON . So why are you keeping something in there if you don't know one way or the other when you know that there's anepidemic of autism? If there's an epidemic of something, why doyou keep it in there when you're not sure? Because every study I'veseen flatly says you're not sure. You say there's\u2014you can't say yeaor nay. Dr. M IDTHUN . I think you have to consider the benefit that vac- cines confer. And there's a definite benefit from influenza vaccineand having an adequate supply of vaccine is very important. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr that then. Single-shot vials, does that need thimerosal? Dr. M IDTHUN . No, they don't, but\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Why do we have single shot vials? Dr. M IDTHUN . There are a lot of manufacturing issues associated with switching over. You need much more filling capacity for thelines. You need a lot more other kinds of things that need to beintroduced, so although it can be done and both Evans and AventisPasteur have started to introduce that, it is not something that atpresent they have the capacity to do in entirety. Mr. B URTON . Let me ask you this: Do these pharmaceutical com- panies that produce these vaccines had, in the past, the ability toproduce, and have they produced single-shot vials? Dr. M IDTHUN . Yes, they do. Because that's how Evans and Aventis Pasteur is doing it to right now. Mr. B URTON . How about all of the pharmaceutical companies? Do all of the pharmaceutical companies pretty much have the abilityto produce single-shot vials? Dr. M IDTHUN . You know, I couldn't speak to that categorically. I don't know. But I do know certainly in the case of Adventis Pas-teur and Evans they do have the ability because they are doingthat. Mr. B URTON . Then why hasn't the FDA, to be on the safe side, knowing that we're having one in over 250, and in some cases, onein 150 children becoming autistic, and there's a growing body ofevidence that thimerosal and mercury is causing that, whywouldn't you go down the cautious road instead of coming up withthese additional studies that say well, we're not sure, we can't sayyea or nay, why not go to single-shot vials? Dr. M IDTHUN . Because we believe that the multi-dose vials con- tinue to be safe and effective and that they speak to having enoughsupply of influenza vaccine, which serves a very importantpublic\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me end up by saying this. I'm a student. I stud- ied at the Cincinnati Bible Seminary. I don't like to quote scripturevery often, but there's none so blind as those that will not see. Youjust sit there and you keep saying over and over and over againthat you think that there's not a real danger for having this mer-cury in these vaccines. There's been 1,500-plus articles written say-ing that there is a problem. We've got scientists from all over theworld coming in here. You saw a demonstration from a Canadian tape showing the im- pact of a minute amount of mercury in brain cells. And yet you con-tinue to say well, we don't think that a very small amount of mer-cury\u2014but you don't know because there's no study that you've putout, not one that says categorically that mercury in vaccines doesnot cause neurological problems. You can't tell me that today.You've hedged all over that issue. You guys continue to keep com-ing up here and making excuses. And I don't know why. Why notjust get it out of there? Dr. Weldon.Mr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of our witnesses in this panel for being here, and I didn't get an op-portunity to thank the previous panel. Dr. Midthun, as I under- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 said, thimerosal is in multi-dose vials of the influenza vaccine for a variety of reasons. We do cur-rently recommend that children at risk receive the flu vaccine in-jection, is that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . That's correct. Mr. W ELDON . So though it is the case that thimerosal has been removed from all of the standard pediatric inoculations like MMRand DTPA, that some children may be getting thimerosal from themulti-dose vials that are still out there on the market, is that cor-rect? Dr. M IDTHUN . That's possible although I know that Aventis Pas- teur, in speaking with them, they've tried very hard to target thetrace thimerosal to the pediatric population, yes. Mr. W ELDON . Well, I would recommend to the FDA that you issue a recommendation that the single dose thimerosal free influ-enza vaccine be the vaccine used in the pediatric population. Mr. B URTON . Would the gentleman yield? Mr. W ELDON . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Because of the huge rise in Alzheimers and because they're putting thimerosal in the vaccines for flu for adults as well,and all the Members of Congress that get those shots are gettingthem, I wish you would amend that to take it out of all flu vac-cines. Mr. W ELDON . Well, Mr. Chairman I was going to get to that issue. What exactly is the problem, could you just explain it a little more detail, you know, if I were to offer an amendment on theLabor HHS appropriation bill, mandating that all thimerosal be re-moved from the market in the United States by a date certain, let'ssay July 2003 or December 31st, what is the problem with gettingrid of this substance? Dr. M IDTHUN . That is something that you know the manufactur- ers, you know, one would you have to say to them exactly\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . Manufacturing process? Dr. M IDTHUN . It is that one has to remove the thimerosal from the product but then an even bigger issue is that you then haveto fill multi-dose vials. And to fill multi-dose vials takes a lot morefilling lung capacity than to fill multi-dose vials. So you have tohave an infrastructure in place to be able to set that up. And Imean\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . So your concern is that such a mandate would re- sult, if I understand your testimony correctly, in a possible short-age of available vaccine on the market. Dr. M IDTHUN . That's correct. I believe that is the case. Mr. W ELDON . OK. Dr. M IDTHUN . I don't believe that a transition can be made that quickly without creating quite a shortage. Let me just mention oneother issue, and we've all been aware of vaccine shortages overthese last couple of years is that Wyeth did announce that they are leaving the influenza vaccine market. So the market which pre-viously had four manufacturers back in 2000, Parke Davis left thatyear, that had us down to three manufacturers and that was thefirst year where we experienced the influenza shortage. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr year we had somewhat of a delay there. Availability of the three remaining manufacturers worked very hard to makeup for the shortfall of the fourth one who left. This year we'll bedown to two. So I have concerns that taking that kind of a step,I don't believe it could be accomplished in that kind of a timeframewithout leaving a vaccine shortage. I think one must consider thebenefit that the vaccine conveys in terms of disease preventionagainst these other issues. Mr. B URTON . Would the gentleman yield again? I'm sorry. The implication of your answer is that because of the problems with thi-merosal and so forth, that's why they're not producing the flu vac-cine, influenza vaccine again. Dr. M IDTHUN . No. No. I do not know that. All I know\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Isn't it true they are going to single-shot vials for measles; is that right? They're going to a nasal flu vaccine instead,is that not correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . There is a license application in for a live attenu- ated nasally administered influenza vaccine. That vaccine\u2014and Ican disclose that because that is public knowledge\u2014that vaccine isbeing developed by Metamune. Mr. B URTON . Will that contain thimerosal? Dr. M IDTHUN . No, that's a live, attenuated vaccine. That does not contain thimerosal. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Mr. W ELDON . I understand there is, under development, a nasal measles vaccine as well, is that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . You know, I don't know exactly what's been pub- licly disclosed here in open session. I can neither acknowledge ordeny the existence of an IND. So I don't know what's been publiclydisclosed in terms of any measles vaccines that might be under in-vestigation or new drug application development. Mr. W ELDON . OK. Mr. Foote, you know, I often wish I was Bill Gates and could just fund some research, I was originally made aware of Dr. Wakefield'swork about 3 years ago when one of my constituents came in myoffice and contended that his child was well, developing normallywith appropriate speech and eye contact, and then got the MMRand then proceeded to go down the tubes and got a second MMRyears later and got even worse. And, you know, Dr. Wakefield's re-search was not expensive. You know, we throw billions of dollarsaround this town. What's the delay in getting this research done?And you know, we had a hearing back I think in July this fellowKreigsman came in and on his own he has scoped all these kidsand he's seen all the same exact findings that Dr. Wakefield hasand he was real excited I've been talking to this guy, he's beenbiopsying all of these he's got all these little specimens and theIRP, Atlantic center hospital doesn't want to do the pathology onthese things. They're just\u2014I don't know if they're afraid or what,but you know, can't you find some way to just answer the doggone question so I don't to keep asking the same question year in yearout. Am I going to be here in the 112th Congress asking NIH toanswer me the question is Dr. Wake field a crack pot or is he onto something with the MMR? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 So, after that hearing which I was either a witness or I was accompanying, I've already been up here a couple of timesthis year so I can't remember exactly which one that was I initi-ated a conversation with Dr. Kriegsman. I gave Dr. Kriegsman mybusiness card, I told him to contact me because NIH would be in-terested in receiving a grant application in this area, especiallyfrom someone who it seemed had pilot data, and in his case, I be-lieve a group of control subjects, material from control subjectswhich was\u2014which would be critical to a well-designed study of theWakefield kind of phenomenon. So I did indeed have some phone conversations with him. We dis- cussed this IRB issue. He was just at the point of interacting fur-ther with, I think\u2014I think there was\u2014there's some question in mymind about where exactly the IRB was located. I think this waspart of the problem. But he explained some of these problems tome. I gave him whatever advice I could. I made clear that shouldhe be able to resolve those difficulties, we would be very interestedin receiving an application. When I attended, the meeting annual meeting of the Autism So- ciety of America\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . Go ahead, I'm sorry. Mr. F OOTE . I was going to make one more quick point which is, when I attended the meeting of the annual meeting of the AutismSociety of America in Indianapolis, I had a meeting with Dr. Wake-field and with some of his colleagues and so on. I made clear tothem that I was willing to be a contact point within NIH for Dr.Wakefield or anybody else who was interested in submitting agrant application to\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . You know I'm not really interested in a grant to Dr. Wakefield. I would like somebody else to try to duplicate hiswork. And I think you could duplicate his work for $250,000 orless. And why can't we get that done? Mr. F OOTE . All I'm telling you is when I meet somebody who\u2014 there were others\u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . You're saying if somebody applies, you'll look very favorably. Mr. F OOTE . I'll go further than that. I will help them figure out what the most effective\u2014that is my job, I do it every day\u2014whatthe most effective way is to approach NIH for getting funding forthat research. Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask a question. Dr. Kriegsman, now you've talked to him several times you said. Mr. F OOTE . I talked to him, I think, twice on the phone about these. Mr. B URTON . You told him what now? Mr. F OOTE . I told him NIH, I would help him interface with NIH in terms of what kind of grant application to prepare, what kindsof review committees to institute\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . What else did he have to do before you could help him? Mr. F OOTE . He told me that his problem was very similar to what Dr. Weldon indicated, it sounds like Dr. Weldon had somecontact with him afterwards, also that he was having trouble withhis institutional review for human subject studies. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 his hospital or his\u2014\u2014 Mr. F OOTE . At his hospital or whatever IRP was responsible. Mr. B URTON . Assuming that's the case and you realized the grav- ity of this situation, why doesn't our health agencies try to assisthim in getting past that barrier? I mean, you know, it seems to meyou say OK, if you can get past this barrier, and you know full wellthat there's a recalcitrance on the part of the Board of Governorsof a hospital or health institution, it seems to me you would say,hey, this is significant enough that we really ought to help this guyinstead of just saying when you get past that, give us a call. Can'tyou do something like that? Can't you guys initiate some help forsome of these people? Mr. F OOTE . We have in terms of human subjects, animal sub- jects, ethical issues and so on, the model that is in place is thatthe grantee institutions assume responsibility for those issues. AndNIH tries not to mandate or micromanage those issues at granteeinstitutions. Mr. B URTON . So if a person\u2014\u2014 Mr. F OOTE . There is a limit on me intruding or anybody else in- truding into those types of considerations. Mr. B URTON . Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say we were going to have, in some part of the country, let's say major outbreakof smallpox. And let's say that we had an institution where a doc-tor or scientist had some kind of an answer to the problem. Andhe said he was running into because of insurance purposes or someother legal reason his board of directors from being able to gettheir support for this IRB. So you would say what let the epidemicspread or what would you do? Mr. F OOTE . Well, I would offer an alternative. Mr. B URTON . What's the alternative you're offering him? Mr. F OOTE . He never called me back? Mr. B URTON . Well, I'm telling you he's going to call you back, and I hope. Mr. F OOTE . That's just fine. This is what program staff at NIH do is help investigators in face with our organization. Mr. B URTON . Does he know that you would help him find an al- ternative? Mr. F OOTE . I think I had, including at the hearing here, I think I had three or four very cordial conversations with him and encour-aged him. Mr. W ELDON . I just want to clarify with Dr. Foote exactly what's going on. He's done the endoscopies, he's biopsied the kids, he's gotthe specimens, he wanted to do duplicate the work that Dr.O'Leary did looking for the presence of measles virus RNA in thelymph follicles of these kids, and that's the nature of the pathophysiologic conjecture that they're engaged in, and the IRB Atlanticcell said no, we don't want to go there, we don't want to mess withthis. I just want to make it very, very clear. My area of concern is this: Is when you leave all these questions out there unanswered,it creates a lot of uncertainty. And the British have not handledthis very well and they still continue not to handle it very well.And that we just have an open dialog and just absolutely pursuethe data, it's in the best interest of the program in making sure VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 Apr continue to get vaccinated. And I don't know what it will take to get the answers to this question, but I'm certainly ready towork with you. Mr. Chairman, I got to go apologize. I'd love to linger.Mr. B URTON . God bless you, my son, go in peace. But let me just say to Dr. Foote, you will be getting a call from him in the nextcouple of days, I promise you that. And I probably will be on thephone with you in a conference call. Thanks, Dr. Weldon. I have to put on my specs here because vanity prohibits me from wearing them all the time like Cyrano de Bergerac, you have toread about him. Here is an e-mail, and this e-mail is from who?See, I want to read to you an e-mail we got yesterday from a fatherof an autistic child. Ray Gallup's son, he's 17, he's vaccine injuredand an autistic child as a result. 17 years old. Our family is living in hell. With our 17-year-old son Eric, who is 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. Now, imagine 6 feet tall 150 pounds like that boy you saw on televisionor on the monitor a while ago. He attacked Helen, Julie my daughter, and myself.He head butted Julie and bit my wife on the head. Eric bit one of my fingers. This isn't the first time and it's getting worse. We have to help and I'm afraid for the safety of our family and our son. Eric was like he was 6 foot 5 and 300pounds on Sunday when he had his tantrum. I held him down but he tried to bite me and kick and scratch me. I was so exhausted I couldn't breathe and I thoughtI would have a heart attack. When we closed the doors to lock ourselves from Eric\u2014lock ourselves from Eric\u2014he kicked on the door breaking some of the wood. I don't know what to do any more short of calling the police. We're at our wit's ends. This is our lot in life. We're trusting the medical profession that vaccines aresafe. We're paying a bitter price for that trust. It is hard to have any holiday feel-ings when we see what has happened to our son and our family. Again, I'm sorry I couldn't attend but we are under siege. You know, Dr. Midthun, and Dr. Foote, and Dr. Portier, when you hear those stories, doesn't it bother you a little bit and youkeep telling us you come up here week after week, month aftermonth, year after year saying, well, mercury doesn't cause that.But when we read your reports it doesn't say that. It doesn't tellus anything. It says well, we're not sure. So you take the positionsince there's no scientific evidence for sure that the mercury iscausing it, that we should go ahead and leave it in there or havebeen leaving it in there. But you don't take the other side, which is the side that errs on the side of safety. Let's go to these pharmaceutical companies andsay OK, we know it's going to cost a little more for single-shotvials, but we want you to do it. We want to recall, recall all of thevaccines that contain mercury because it is a toxic substance, andwe don't know all the answers. And until we do know all the an-swers, we want to err on the side of safety so we don't have any-more 6 foot 5 kids beating the heck out of their parents, bitingtheir father, kicking in doors and injuring the mother and sister.But that's going to happen more and more. You know my grandson, who's autistic, is going to be 6 foot 10 according to the doctors. My father was 6 foot 8, his father\u2014hisgrandfather on the other side was about 6 foot 8. So he's going tobe a tall kid. Can you imagine when he's 16 years old trying to con-trol him if he goes out of control? What are we going to do? Whatare all these families going to do? And yet we don't have a vaccineinjury compensation fund that's responsive to these people. Thelanguage that was put in the homeland security bill blocks an ave- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 the courts. And these families continue to fight this hardship with their own money because they have no place to go,and you continue to put, you continue to let this substance inthere. I just cannot understand it. I just don't understand it. I have one question for you, Dr. Portier, and then we'll submit some questions for the records that I hope you'll answer for me. Dr.Portier, does the study recently published in The Lancet identifythe effects of mercury on infants who are vaccinated with thimero-sal? Does the study recently published in The Lancet identify the ef- fects of mercury on infants who are vaccinated with thimerosal? Dr. P ORTIER . No. Mr. B URTON . It does not. Are you familiar with the CDC's vac- cine safety data project evaluating thimerosal containing vaccinesin children that found a weak signal between the receipt of thesevaccines and neurological developmental delays and the attentiondeficit disorder? Dr. P ORTIER . Not familiar enough with the study to give you any intelligent comment. Mr. B URTON . Has the NIEHS and the NIH conducted any further analysis of the VSD data base? Dr. P ORTIER . No, we have not, to my knowledge. Mr. B URTON . Has the NIEHS evaluated why some children seem to hold on to mercury in their brains and their bodies? Or whysome hol onto heavy metals rather than flush it from their bodies?If not, why not? Dr. P ORTIER . That is one of the issues specifically for mercury and that's being looked at at our centers program. That's part ofthe research agenda of the National Toxicology Program and forother metals, that is certainly part of our research agenda. Mr. B URTON . OK. Well, thank you. I think I'm going to submit questions to you. One more thing, and this is very important. Ihope you will join with me as health professionals in urging thePresident to have a White House conference on autism which willbring parents in, scientists who have differing points of view aswell as people from our health agencies in to discuss the problemswith autism, what people go through, what the causes are and soon and so forth. This is such an epidemic, gone from 1 in 10,000to more than 1 in 250 that it's something that we can't hide any-more. I'd like for to you join me in asking the White House to make this a real focal point by having this conference on autism. And Iguess you can't probably give me an answer until you talk to yoursuperiors, but I'm making that official request, an official request.I hope you'll do that and get back to us. Let me conclude by saying we will continue on with this subject. You have gotten mercury out of a lot of the vaccines. I berated youa lot in the past and a little bit today because it's still in some. Butwe have moved in the right direction. It's a shame that it has taken this long to get it out as much as we have. But I can tellyou there's going to be a lot more Congressmen very concernedabout there because we're start together tell all of them that whenthey get their flu shot, they're getting mercury in them. And that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:47 growing body of evidence that mercury in vaccines may be a major cause of Alzheimers. And when I tell my colleagues that, there's going to be more and more of them wanting to raise Cain about this. And I know youdon't want to have to deal with you know another 200 Dan Bur-tons, my God, that would be something even I wouldn't want todeal with. So I hope that you'll take this to heart and I hope wedon't have to have too many more hearings like this, but we willif we don't see some real change and see some studies on this. With that we'll submit some questions to you for the record. I hope you'll answer them. Thank you for being here. We stand ad-journed. [Whereupon, at 5:02 p.m., the committee was adjourned.][The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay, additional in- formation submitted for the hearing record, and a complete set ofexhibits follow:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
