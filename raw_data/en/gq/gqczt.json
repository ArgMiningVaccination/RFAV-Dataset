This NNS is a tool for all sectors related to nutrition and food security (NF S) and is to be used over a ten -year timeframe up until 2025. The National Plan of Action on Nutrition (NPAN) is to run for a five -year period and emphasizes the same kinds of implementation - using a multi -sectoral convergent approach with common focus points, common goals, and common timeframes while boosting resources and increasing support from development partners and the relevant stakeholders to the greatest extent possible to reduce all forms of malnutrition among women, children and disadvantaged gr oups, to achieve success, and meet the set targets. This NNS shows the necessity for and sincere efforts made by the government towards nutrition and I am absolutely confident that all the relevant sectors, development partners, and stakeholders will prov ide support for the adoption of this strategy to bring about positive changes with respect to nutrition in the Lao PDR. Vientiane Capital, 28 December 2015 Deputy Prime Minister in Charge of Social and Cultural Affairs Chair of the National Nutrition Co mmittee [SEAL OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE LAO PDR AND SIGNATURE] Phankham VIPHAVANH iv Foreword Under the leadership of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP), the government of the Lao PDR has laid out the National Nutrition Polic y (NNP) to promote nutrition with a focus on reducing undernutrition at a basic level among - for example - women and children and disadvantaged groups and to specify directions for nutrition to be included in the National Socio -Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) while working alongside the implementation of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The timeframe for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has now reached its final period but reducing malnutrition remains one of three ch allenging targets and will not be achieved in the Lao PDR in accordance with the MDGs. The challenges which have yet to be overcome and other problems of the world have been included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This National Nutrition Stra tegy and Plan of Action (NNSPA) has been created with the aim of achieving SDG 2 - \"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\" and also to contribute towards achieving the targets of the 8th Five-Year NSED P of the government of the Lao PDR (GoL). This 2016 -2025 National Nutrition Strategy and 2016 -2020 Plan of Action has been amended based on a full analysis of the nutrition situation in the Lao PDR and focuses on the immediate, underlying, and basic caus es and on a multi -sectoral convergent approach with common focus points, common goals, and common timeframes while also seeking to raise support from our development partners and other relevant stakeholders so that malnutrition, especially among women and children and disadvantaged groups, may be reduced in the Lao PDR. I, on behalf of the health sector and as the main person in charge of improving this strategy, wish to express my profound gratitude to the Chair of the National Nutrition Committee (NNC) a nd the leaders of the relevant sectors, whose guidance and leadership have resulted in the high level of responsibility being applied to the amendment of this strategy. I wish to offer my praise and gratitude to the NNC Secretariat, the various sectors inv olved, our development partners, both domestic and international, and all of you who have made sacrifices and given up your valuable time to contribute to making this NNS a great success. It is my fervent hope that this NNS will be of benefit to implement ation and be adopted into the work of each stakeholder in practice within their respective scopes of responsibility with a focus on resolving nutrition problems in the Lao PDR so that results are achieved in real terms. Furthermore, if any of you have any additional opinions on this strategy, we would be pleased to hear all that you have to say.

Global Nutrition Report 2014: Actions and Accountability to Accelerate the World's Progress on Nut rition . Washington, DC. viii Brief Summary Despite impressive gains in economic growth over the past decade, the Lao PDR (LPDR) has one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in Southeast Asia. According to the most recent data, approximately 44%1 of children under the age of five years (CU 5s) suffer from chronic malnutrition and stunting1. There has nevertheless been a small amount of progress just as there has been with other Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators. This undernutrition threatens lives and nati onal socio -economic development and is associated with reduced school enrolment, poses a challenge to the attainment of education targets, and has an impact on development, whic h is set to lead to a future productivity deficit of more than 20%2. Child malnutrition (including fetal malnutrition caused by maternal malnutrition) was the cause of 45% of global child deaths in 20113. The promotion of nutrition is therefore an urgent p riority for development in the LPDR. Reduction of malnutrition is one of three challenging MDG targets and is seriously off track i n the L PDR. As we are all aware, the MDG timeframe is in its final stages and unmet and ongoing challenges worldwide have be en encapsulated in 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that build on the foundation laid by the MDGs4. This National Nutrition Strategy and Plan of Action ( NNSPA ) first and foremost seeks to achieve SDG 2 \"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture ,\" and contributes directly to several others. It is increasingly clear that SDG 2 - as well as various other SDGs - will not be achieved without decisive and integrated action among all stakeholders in the LPDR. In order to respond to this high level of malnutrition, the Government of the LPDR (GoL) promulgated the first National Nutrition Policy (NNP) in December 20085. Based on this policy , the 2010 -2015 NNSPA was formulated and promulgated by the GoL6. Although the first NNSPA covered what was needed in detail and in full , its implementation was difficult due to the absence of coordination mechanisms and its adoption and monitoring within the various sectors . Another major limitation on the implementation of this NNSPA resulted from limited budget s to support direct nutrition interventions and promote indirect nutrition interventions . Limited and declining direct assistance for nutrition interventions , mainly implemented by the health sector, was another fa ctor explaining the low coverage of these important interventions for nutrition, especially interventions associated with the first 1,000 days of life, something which is important for the world to approve as interventions to promote the Scaling Up Nutriti on (SUN) movement . To begin to remedy this, the National Nutrition Committee (NNC) was created on 31 July 2013 with the mandate to provide the necessary overall leadership and guidance for the coordination of the NNSPA for the relevant sectors at all level s in order that the targets may be achieved . This 2016 -2020 National Nutrition Strategy (NNS) builds on the above mentioned experiences and opportunities and receives important commitment and participation from many domestic sectors and development partne rs along with international interest and support while also reflecting the GoL policy for long -term strategic time frames . This NNSPA is therefore presented as a guideline for all sectors associated ix with nutrition and food security (NFS) with a 10 year hor izon to 2025 in the LPDR. It forms the basis for implementing food security and nutrition interventions and is to operate in association with the National Socio -Economic Development Strategy (NSEDS) to 2020. This national nutrition strategy6 has a 5 year h orizon and aims to contribute to the adoption of the 8th 5-year National Socio -Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) and has been improved and put together based on comprehensive analysis into malnutrition in the LPDR, which places strong emphasis on the immed iate, underlying , and basic causes. Strategic direction s and objectives - To tackle the immediate causes at the level of the individual and focus on achieving sufficient food consumption and safety, emphasizing the first 1,000 days of life and reducing the prevalence of diseases cause d by contaminated food and indirectly transmitted infectious diseases which impair the body's ability to absorb food consumed; and - To tackle the underlying causes (mostly at household and community levels), which requires impr ovements to the safety and diversity of food consumed so that people may have access to food at all times and locations, and moreover, to focus on improving maternal and child health (MCH) practices , clean water [systems and/or practices], and sanitation a nd [on providing] healthy environments and access to health services. The strategies aimed at tackling the fundamental causes (mostly at institutional and national level) have been specified to comprise capacity building at institutional level and improv ing coordination, human resource development, the quantitative and qualitative improvement of information, promotion for investment into nutrition interventions , and increased food security. These strategies also emphasize the socio - culturally embedded causes of malnutrition and specify interventions which relate to many areas and the creation of broader national strategies in order to focus on ensuring rights and equality concerning access to nutritional natural resources. These strategies also explain the necessary and relate d policies of each sector which affects malnutrition. The NNS includes broad, deep, and complete content aimed at supporting the attainment of the GoL socio -economic development targets and the SDGs. This amended strategy embodies a multi -sectoral convergent approach designed to accelerate the reduction of maternal and child malnutrition and to prevent the advancing trend towards overnutrition. The main goal of this multi -sectoral convergent approach is to reduce CU 5 chronic malnutrit ion (stunting) from 44% to 25% in 2025. The NNS is also consistent with the global nutrition targets and SDGs in that it aims to reduce the prevalence of underweight children, sudden malnutrition (wasting ), and anemia, to prevent overnutrition, and t o prom ote breastfeeding (Table 1). Attaining the strategy's objectives will require management and administration systems, coordination mechanisms, and cooperation, communication, collaboration, and partnershi p between many relevant sectors along with developme nt partners, including donors, international bodies, and the private sector so as to achieve x efficiency and effectiveness at all levels. One of these national strategies is to promote community -based nutrition (CBN) and food security and to increase the le vel of support from the GoL and development partners, including the private sector, social organizations, and other bodies. This strategy emphasizes multi -sectoral unity with common efforts, goals, and timeframes with 22 common priority interventions to be implemented in areas with high malnutrition rates and numbers , areas of food insecurity, poor localities, and GoL priority focus points with a focus on tackling nutrition problems rapidly and in a sustainable manner through the involvement of multiple sec tors while improving existing NFS services and interventions nationwide. Mobilizing support from development partners and the relevant stakeholders also requires focus on expanding resources and increasing the support of development partners to the extent possible in order to succeed and achieve these benefits together. This NNS has been approved by all the relevant ministries and the main development partners and demonstrates the necessity of the sincere efforts being made by the GoL in the implementatio n and adoption of the NNP and its firm commitment towards the implementation of this strategy so that it leads to improvements in NFS in the Lao PDR. 1 Part 1 Preamble The current CU 5 malnutrition profile in the LPDR is dominat ed by under nutrition as measured by the rates of chronic malnutrition, underweight children , micronutrient deficiencies and low -birth weight s1, the rates of chronic malnutrition or stunting being particularly high . Child malnutrition (including fetal malnu trition caused by maternal malnutrition) was the cause of 45% of global child deaths in 20113. It is estimated that in the L PDR, 17,300 CU 5s die annually , the deaths of whom 6,01615 (40%) are related to malnutrition. Malnutrition is responsible for the dis abilities of 50% of disabled children under the age of four years worldwide7. Chronic malnutrition (stunting) is closely related to low education levels and incomes when reaching adulthood. Malnutrition leads to increased expenses owing to the fact that i t results in frequent sickness. Moreover, it leads to lower future national revenues. In the LPDR , malnutrition costs the country an estimated 197 million US dollars annually, approximately 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP)8. 73% of these losses, equal to 142 million US dollars come as a result of malnutrition during the first 1,000 days of life while a third, equal to 38 million US dollars, are related to maternal nutritional status and the role s mothers play in looking after their children. Good nutrit ion is central to promoting the health of the multiethnic people so they may contribute to national construction and development and sustainable development on a global level. GoL response to malnutrition In response to the problem of malnutrition in the LPDR , in 2008, the GoL approved the first NNP (248/PM). The policy had a comprehensive and solid framework which acted as a direction for the specification for the 2010 -2015 NNSPA and its official promulgation by the GoL9. In April 2011, Laos joined a num ber of countries to form the global SUN movement . In 2012, the GoL set up the National N utrition Center , which operated under the Ministry of Health (MOH) , and in 2013, established the National Nutrition Committee (NNC) (73/PM) , which formed parts of the i mportant efforts being made by the GoL to tackle nutrition problems. NSPA implementation was met with a number of challenges owing to a lack of effective multi -sectoral coordination mechanisms along with disjointed implementation, a failure to move in a united direction, a lack of focus points, and the fact that a number of important interventions were never implemented due to the constraints in the GoL budget and support allocated by development partners . In 2013, the first MDG Report found that there were severe challenges to overcome so the GoL and development partners increased their emphasis and support for nutrition interventions . The NNS to 2025 consists of five parts - Part 1: Preamble, which gives an overall explanation of nutrition and the NNS; Part 2: Nutrition and Food Situation, which explains the importance of the problems arising from and main causes of malnutrition in the Lao PDR; Part 3: Vision, Mission, Overa ll Goal, and Guiding Principles, which explains the NFS targets; Part 4: NNS Fra mework and Priority Areas for Solutions to Nutrition, which specifies concrete focus points to tackle the immediate, underlying , and basic causes of malnutrition; and Part 5, which 2 gives a general presentation on the mobilization of funding, resource alloc ation, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) . 3 Part 2 Nutrition and Food Situation in the Lao PDR 2.1 Current status Despite the ongoing and rapid growth of the national economy, the problem s of malnutrition, especially among the vulnerable CU 5 group and of food insecurity continue to pose a monumental challenge to national development. Over the past two years, although GDP per capita has almost tripled and poverty halved , malnutrition rates have reduced only slightly and progress is slow. In the Lao PDR, chronic malnutrition affects 3 78,388 CU 5s, accounting for 44%, one of the highest rates in Southeast Asia. Micronutrient deficiency rates are also high with 41% of CU 5s and 59% of children under the age of two years suffering from anemia, the latter figure being especially high. One in three women of reproductive age (WRA) nationwide are affected by anemia, which constitutes a severe public health problem. Although the underweight malnutrition ra te among CU 5s fell from 32% in 2006 to 27% in 2012, the sudden malnutrition ( wasting ) rate stood still at 6% . Moreover, the chronic and underweight malnutrition rates of the 6 -24-month age group are markedly higher than those of other age groups. Malnutrit ion continues to have an impact o n other vulnerable groups, including WRA, pregnant women, and women who breastfeed, and this is related to infant and child care. Decisive actions must therefore take place for these vulnerable groups, especially during the first 1,000 days of life, in order to reduce malnutrition rates in the Lao PDR . In addition to the problem of malnutrition, there is an increasing trend of overnutrition. In 2013, it was found that 25.6% of persons aged 18 -64 years were overweight, of whom 7.3% were obese w omen and 28.7% were overweight, compared to 14.3% of WRA in 2006. Moreover, there is evidence which points to a rising trend of overnutrition in the CU 5 group , which leads to a risk of obesity and communicable diseases. While overweight levels may still be low, in order to meet the global target in the new era, it is important to prevent an increase in overweight children. Factors concerning malnutrition mostly relate to household poverty, mothers with low education levels, and ethnic gro ups residing in remo te areas with no access to clean water, sanitation, environment and health services. Malnutrition is also associated with beliefs, customs, and traditions which can lead to incorrect nutritional practices. Despite the progress made with the reduction of iodine deficiency (ID) , challenges remain to our becoming an ID -free country, something which this strategy aims to achieve in 2020. Currently, 89% of households consume iodized salt10 but the quality of the iodized salt still often fails to meet standards. Despite expansions in the coverage of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) , the distribution of deworming tablets to children aged 12 -59 months, and the handing out of iron supplements to WRAs and pregnant women, there are still challenges t o achieving full coverage and challenges concerning the quality of services. 4 2.2 Causes of malnutrition and food insecurity 2.2.1 Immediate causes The NNP is based on the 1990 UNICEF conceptual framework, which specifies the main causes for malnutrition in children at three levels - immediate, underlying, and basic. Figure 1 - Causes of malnutrition in the Lao PDR The quantity and quality of nutrients [being consumed ] are insufficient for bodily needs . Diseases caused by contamin ated food and infectious diseases impair the body's ability to absorb food consumed . The factors leading to food intake which is insufficient in terms of quantity and quality include poor and incorrect infant and child feeding practices - the rate of breas tfeeding in the first hour of life remains low (39%) , the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is low (40%) , and many children fail to consume sufficient and diverse food at each meal. The practice of food restrictions and taboos for br eastfeeding women affects health and nutrition. Food restrictions and taboos deprive both mother and child of sufficient and diverse food intake. Food intake lacks variety and is mostly based on rice (which accounts for 67% of food consumed) and the consum ption of fats, meat, vegetables, and fruits is extremely low. Some households are unable to ensure food security and have extremely low intakes of protein and micronutrients. Their intake of micronutrients is insufficient, leading to micronutrient deficien cies, such as iron deficiency anemia (IDA) , vitamin A deficiency (VAD) , and vitamin B1 deficiency, besides others. A. Immediate Causes 1. Inadequate nutrient intake 2. Food - water- vector -borne and infectious diseases B. Underlying Causes 6. Poor environmental hygiene 5. Poor mother and child care practices 4. Lack of access to food 3. Food unavailability Household food insecurity 7. Poor access to health services C. Basic Causes (Institutional and Resource -Based ) 11. Limitation s to investment into nutrition interventions 10. Limitations concerning information on nutrition on nutrition 9. Insufficient human resources 8. Limitations to coordination D. Basic Causes (Social and Economic) Access to fundamental resources and services for households is insufficient in terms of quantity and quality (land, water, energy, markets , education, employment, income, technology, information, etc.). 5 The natio nal average caloric intake is sufficient and this is one of the indicators for sufficient food intake in terms of quantity but ther e are disparities between different areas and seasons. In addition, high micronutrient deficiency rates indicate insuf ficient quality of food intake, especially a lack of variety of foods consumed at each meal to ensure the intake of all necessary micronut rients (such as vitamins and minerals). Food consumption data indicates an excess nationwide average daily caloric intake but the intake of 23% of the population falls below recommended daily intake (RDI) standards11. The major problem is the lack of diver sity in the nutritional values of food consumed . Food consumption in Laos is mostly based on rice. On average, 73% of caloric intake comes from carbohydrates, 12% from meat, and 15% from fats. This survey showed that the consumption of fats, oils, and frui ts was also low12. Food consumed lacks animal protein. The survey also showed that infant and young child feeding (IYCF) in the poorest households is extremely low (16%) and in the 6 -23- month age group1, consumption of all food groups (acceptable foods) is extremely low at just 5%. There is clear evidence for the relationship between infectious diseases and malnutrition in the LPDR . Diarrhea, malaria, and parasitic infections require close attention . Historically, malaria is one of the causes of morbidity a nd mortality and has been implicated in anemia. In recent years though, progress has been achieved with reductions in malarial cases and deaths but preventive methods must be continued . Incidence of diarrhea was recorded at 10% and it was also found that d iarrh ea peaks at 12 -23 months , which coincides with the weaning period1. Especially during this period, feeding with safe food and clean water is of great importance in avoiding food- and waterborne diseases. Nearly 54% of children aged 24-59 months have intestinal parasitic infections and this constitutes a public health problem. Also , acute respiratory infections (ARI), measles/rubella and dengue fever as well as several vaccine preventable diseases reduce children's appetites and impair absorption making them more prone to malnutrition. 2.2.2 Underlying causes The availability of adequate food strongly influences the NFS status. The most significant difficulty concerning the availability of food in Laos is the low level of domestic production of food. The largest source of food was the household's own food production, 82% of total value of food consumed came from households ' own food production while the national average of households' own food production was just 45%. This food produced by households is m ainly food which provides calories (rice) while oth er foods which households lack are purchased. The low level production is mainly due to insufficient productivity in high risk agricultural sector s. The main causes of these problems include the small size of land holdings - with some 50% of the farming households owning less than one hectare of land - and the prevalent absence of secure land tenure . Production mostly relies exclusively upon rainfall during the wet season and there is little dry season prod uction. There is a high risk from natural disasters owing to climate change , including flooding, landslides , drought, and so forth. There is little effective facilitation to support production, such as fertilizers, seeds, preparation, and equipment. Agro -processing and modern food and seed storage equipment remains limited. There is a shortage of suitable infrastructure for the distribution of agricultural produce and a lack of a service 6 framework. Limited knowledge decrease s productivity and increase s food security risks. In addition, the LPDR is becoming more and more inter -linked with regional and global economies and is importing foods from overseas so the impact external crises or disasters have on food availability in the L PDR is unavoidable. Access to a variety of foods is essential to good health and nutrition and there are many important components. In the LPDR, from a physical perspective, infrastructure, such as roads, transportation, and markets, is limited, and such infrastructure plays an essent ial role in ensuring food is available at all locations and times it is needed. There are also limitations to processing systems and seasonal food preservation techniques to allow consumers access to all kinds of foods throughout all seasons so as to resol ve the problem of food insecurity. In certain remote areas, access to natural resources, the use of non -timber forest products (NTFPs) , the promotion of household cultivation, and the provision of a wide variety of traditional seeds are of great nutritiona l value and come at a low cost but there remain constraints and these are unsustainable. Poor mother and child care practices also represent an underlying cause of all forms of malnutrition. Mothers mostly lack knowledge concerning suitable food intakes, especially when pregnant and postpartum . Women still have extremely low food intakes at household level. Food restrictions and taboos are frequently practiced by women across all ethnic groups , especially during pregnancy and postpartum, which has a negativ e impact on the nutritional status of both mother and child. Burdens and workloads placed on women affect the health of both them and their child. There is a huge disparity in f amily planning (FP) in rural areas and certain ethnic groups and most mothers l ack knowledge about how to look after their children correctly and suitably. There is evidence which shows that there is a close link between sanitation and chronic malnutrition (stunting) . A lack of environmental hygiene, such as the use of contaminated w ater, poor sanitation, and incorrect hygiene practices, including difficulties in access to public health services, represents an underlying cause of malnutrition. Although the LPDR has made progress in improving access to safe water (72%) , the rate of def ecation remains high in poor sectors of the public, reaching 80% and 45% in rural sectors of the public13. The unsuitable disposal of child feces remains a significant problem with only 17% of caregivers following the recommendations correctly. A 2005 -2006 survey showed that despite improvements to access to clean water sources, approximately 60% of households were using water which had been contaminated with animal feces - both from natural and household water sources. This also relates to unsafe water sto rage practices. Hand washing after toilet use was also not widely practiced with only around 21% of rural households practicing it. Most women do not wash their hands before preparing food or feeding their child. Moreover, there is a clear disparity betwee n rural and urban areas with respect to toilet use which is consistent with sanitary principles. 2.2.3 Basic causes The basic causes of malnutrition in the LPDR are rooted in a number of systemic factors. Food security and nutrition objectives are included and clearly visible in the 8th NSEDP (2016 -2020). The basic causes are causes at institutional and national level and include infrastructure th rough which support may be provided, legislation, organizations, coordination, human resource development, infor mation systems, gender roles, surveillance, M&E , and investment into NFS. Although progress is 7 currently being made in many areas, there remain constraints in terms of human resources, organization and implementation, and monitoring within the various sectors. One of the main constraints is insufficient budgets to provide support for direct and indirect nutrition interventions . Certain important interventions are not being implemented due to limitations in the GoL budgets and the allocation of support from development partners. There is a declining trend in funding from donors to assist directly with interventions aimed at solving the problem of malnutrition. Mechanisms for inter -sector coordination remain unsystematic and not as effective as they should be. Implementation is disjointed, there is a failure to move in a united direction, and there is a lack of focus points. Access to basic resources and services for households, such as land, water sources, energy, markets, education, employment, incomes, techn ology, information, and so forth is insufficient in terms of both quantity and quality. There is therefore a need for capacity building among organizations and personnel, for improved legislation, and for coordination and coherent and unified implementatio n through the participation of multiple sectors, development partners, and foreign stakeholders with a focus on improving the nutritional status and health of all people. 8 Part 3 Vision, Mission, Overall Goal, and Guiding P rinciples 3.1 Vision The NNSPA adopts the vision specified in the 8th Five-Year NSEDP (2016 -2020) : A prosperous country, with a healthy population, free from food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty. 3.2 Mission Establish effective overall mechanisms through policies, strategies, programs and interventions . Arrange priorities, ensure coordination, and implement plans through multi -sectoral unity and M&E in order to achieve good NFS in the Lao PDR. 3.3 Overall goal To reduce malnutrition rates among women and children and improve the nutritional status of the multiethnic people so that they may be healthy and have a high quality of living and thus contribute to the preservation and development of the nation so that it is elevated from its status as a least developed country (LDC) in 2020 and attains its strategic targets in 2025; Table 1: Indicators for the overall goal Indicator 2012 baseline data (%) 2015 baseline data (%) 2020 targets (%) 2025 targets (%) Malnutrition rates from data gathered CU 5 chronic malnutritio n rate (above or below World Health Organization (WHO) standards) 44 42b 34 25 CU 5 sudden malnutrition rate (wasting) (WHO standards) 6 6 5 5 CU 5 underweight rate (WHO standards) 27 22 17 12 CU 5 anemia rate (hemoglobin<11g/dL) 41 40 30 20 WRA anemia rate (hemoglobin<12g/dL) 36a 30 23 15 Low birth weight (LBW) 15 11 8 CU 5 overweight rate 2 2 2 2 Breastfeeding rate 40 40 50 60 ID rate among school -age-children (SAC) 27c 17 10 Support and promotion for the implementation of th is NNS will help to attain the targets of the 8th Five-Year NSEDP (2016 -2020) and especially, help to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) an d the child mortality rate (CMR ) and contribute to the eradication of poverty. The relevant indicators are lis ted below: 9 Health Infant mortality rate (IMR)e Sources: a: (MICS3 -NNS) b: 2011/12 Lao Social Indicator Survey (LSIS) ; Remark: Anthropometric data (chronic malnutrition, wasting, underweight, and body mass index (BMI) ) will be available in 2015 from the 2015 National EPI Surv ey Anthropometry Tag -on survey so these statistics and targets may need to be revised at the end of 2015 . c: 2014 School Survey on Iodine d: 2013 WHO MMR estimates 3.4 Guiding principles The NNS to 2025 is based on four principles, which are aligned with National Nutrition Policy (NNP) and the 8th Five-Year NSEDP and are also in line with the national socio -economic development goals aimed at achieving the outstanding MDGs and moving towards the successful fulfillment of the SDGs . 3.4.1 Define a realistic strategy This NNS shall aim to address the problems of the nation and of the multiethnic people. The steps specified in this strategy shall enable the achievement of the targets set and be implemented in such a way that nutrition interventions are improve d during each period. 3.4.2 Support effective management Ensure transparency in implementation, assessment, and reporting on the outcomes achieved . Specify strategies which are clear, concrete, and measurable and which can be inspected , monitor progress, and specify a clear framework of responsibilities . Achieve multi -sectoral harmony and unity through the use of common priorities, focus points, targets, and schedules for planning, implementation, and M&E . Build CBN systems and increase support from the Go L, domestic and external development partners, the public, and the private sector. 10 3.4.3 Achieve measurable outcomes for each period - Short -term outcomes shall be measured during 2016 -2018. - Medium -term outcomes shall be measured during 2016 -2020. - Long -term outcomes and guaranteed sustainability shall be measured during 2016 -2025. 3.4.4 Ensure efficient and effective implementation The interventions aimed at solving NFS problems will be implemented using investment which is low but maximizes impacts for the multiethnic people, prioritising vulnerable groups, especially children in their first 1,000 days of life from conception through to the age of two years and continuing this emphasis until they reach the age of five years and are enrolled into schools. These interventions shall also place strong emphasis on WRA, pregnant , postpartum , and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and persons suffering from infectious diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, HIV/AIDS, and other such diseases. Geographically, focus shall b e placed on groups residing in remote areas high up in the mountains where there is high child malnutrition rates while in urban areas, focus shall be placed on groups with low education, areas to which people have recently been relocated, and persons affected by natural disasters, placing them in an emergency situation or having a long -term impact . 3.4.5 Gender roles This NNS shall promote gender roles, placing emphasis on women's access to health services, to NFS information, and to food. Women and girls shall receive an education and training and be enabled to earn an income and participate in household and community decision making on an equal basis with men. 11 Part 4 Core Strategies and Priority Areas of Intervention This strategy s ets out 4 strategic directions, 11 strategic objectives (SOs), and 29 interventions , of which 22 fall under Priority 1. It is a ten -year strategic implementation framework aimed at reducing maternal and child malnutrition rates while also improving the nut ritional status and food security of the multiethnic people and attaining these strategic targets for 2025. Figure 2: Strategic framework Strategic Direction 2: Address underlying causes SO5: Improve MCH practices SO6: Improve clean water [systems and practices], sanitation, and environments SO4: Improve access to nutrit ious food SO3: Produce food for consumption SO7: Improve access to health & nutrition services Strategic Direction 3: Address basic causes SO10: Increase the quantity and quality of information SO11: Increase investments in nutrition interventions SO9: Develop human resources SO8: Improve institutions and coordination NNS Strategic Direction 1: Address immediate causes Strategic Direction 4: Linkages SO 1: Improve nutrient intake SO 2: Prevent food- and waterborne and infectious diseases Relevant policies and strategies ( examples ): MNCH and immunization Communicable and non - communicable disease control Gender roles Land allocation improvement Energy and mines Water resources and the environment Climate change - natural disasters Telecommunic ation and transportation systems Human rights Poverty reduction 12 The NNS specifies three periods: 1) the Short -Term Period, during which focus shall be placed on implementing the high priority interventions which will yield the greatest benefits and which shall cover the first three years, allowing for the achievement of outcomes and the paving of long-term foundations; 2) the Medium - Term Period , during which focus shall be placed on the implementation of interventions which lead on from the Short -Term Period by strengthening the important management structure and which shall cover the first five years; and 3) the Long -Term Period, during which f ocus shall be placed on interventions which lead on from the Medium -Term Period by continuing to strengthen the management structure and NFS services , which shall produce long -term outcomes over the ten -year period and guarantee sustainability. This strate gy is comprehensive and composed of Priority 1 and Priority 2 interventions . The Priority 1 interventions specified focus on using investment which is low but maximizes short -term impacts, which shall lay the foundations for solving the problem of malnutri tion and food insecurity in high risk areas and for ensuring these solutions are sustainable. There are 22 Priority 1 interventions and these aim to address the issue of nutrition directly and indirectly. Of these, 10 fall under the health sector, 4 under the agriculture sector, 4 under the education sector, and 4 are multi - sectoral. The vast majority of these nutrition interventions fall within SOs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of Strategic Directions 1 -3. The remaining interventions are Priority 2.

This Strategic Direction is composed of 2 SOs: SO1: Improve nutrient intake . SO2: Prevent water -, -, and vector -borne diseases . SO1: Improve nutrient intake This SO focuse s on food intake which is sufficient in terms of both variety and quantity in order to prevent and solve the problem of malnutrition in CU 5s, pregnant , postpartum, and breastfeeding women, and WRA. Interventions necessary to achiev ing this SO comprise the supplementing of food and micronutrient s, the provision of food in schools, micronutrient fortification, the promotion of [exclusive] breastfeeding, infant and child care, and the prevention and treatment of CU 5 malnutrition. SO2: Prevent water -, food -, and vector -borne diseases This SO aims to prevent and reduce water -, food -, and vector -borne diseases , including infectious diseases, such as ARI, diarrhea, measles, parasitic diseases, HIV/AIDS, and symptoms associated with diseases which can lead to injury and/or death. The interventions necessary to achieving this SO comprise deworming, improving food quality and safety, promoting immunization, preventing and controlling diarrhea, preventing malaria and dengue fever , and preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis related malnutrition . 4.2 Strategic Direction 2: Address underlying causes This Strategic Direction concerns food security and aims to bring about the availability of sufficient nutritious food as a means of solving the problem of food insecurity at household and community level, to improve environments, and to improve the quality of health services . This Strategic Direction involves increasing the production of a variety of foods in households and schools, access to food, the provision of food in schools, mother and child interventions, and improving clean water [systems and practices], sanitation, and environments while improving access to health services. This Strategic Direction is composed of 5 SOs: SO3: Produce food so that it is avai lable for consumption. SO4: Improve access to nutritious food. SO5: Improve mother and child care practices. SO6: Improve clean water [systems and practices], sanitation, and environments. SO7: Improve access to health services. 15 4.2.1 SO3: Produce food so that it is available for consumption The problem of malnutrition mostly arises in remote rural areas and is due to low agricultural yields and the high risk of natural disasters owing to climate change. This SO specifies interventions aimed at expanding an d focusing on the agricultural production of a diverse range of nutritious and safe foods for households, communities, and schools and providing the necessary equipment and infrastructure to facilitate agricultural production. 4.2.2 SO4: Improve access to nutritious food This SO is composed of food access interventions which require the involvement of multiple sectors, such as road construction, transportation, service connections, and markets, but must focus on safe food storage and processing in order to ensure food is available for consumption all year round, which is a means of promoting activities which generate incomes through the cultivation of crops, NTFPs, and traditional foods in order that households may build an income with the main emphasis being placed on women. 4.2.3 SO5: Improve mother and child care practices This SO is composed of interventions aimed at providing education on health and nutrition in order to bring about a change in practices using the mass media , networks and mass organizati ons, such as the Lao Women's Union, FP services, and other networks , and publicity campaigns focused on mobilizing communities to take responsibility for interventions on NFS, safe foods, and sanitation with a focus on giving them the courage to pass on wh at they kno w and promote correct practices in order to reduce the prevalence of beliefs, traditions, and customs which influence incorrect nutritional practices, such as food restrictions and taboos and so forth. It also focuses on the specific health care needs of WRA, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and infant, child, student, and youth care. 4.2.4 SO6: Improve clean water [systems and practices], sanitation, and environments This SO is composed of interventions which focus on providing clean water syst ems, toilets, sanitation, household water treatment (HWT) , and environmental hygiene in order to enhance the capacities of communities to use, manage, and maintain [these systems and practices] at household, community, school, and health care facility levels. It also aims to promote environmental health impact assessments (HIAs) and adjustments to cope with climate change. It focuses on facilitating and supporting the adoption and implementation of legislation which relates to environmental hygiene in both the State and private sectors so as to ensure the protection of environments and the effects they have on health, which in turn have repercussions on NFS. 4.2.5 SO7: Improve access to health services This SO focuses on improving access to health and nutrit ion services by integrating nutrition services into MNCH services to form a regular comprehensive service at fixed and mobile health service facilities in communities and on promoting village health volunteers (VHVs) , birth assistants, village LWU units, v illage doctors, and 16 village health committees (VHCs) to take responsibility for the implementation of NFS interventions in their communities through the adoption of the policy for free birth a ssistance and free CU 5 medical treatment. 4.3 Strategic Directio n 3: Address basic causes This Strategic Direction is focused on improving institutions and human resources in order to ensure that NFS interventions go ahead smoothly, systematically, consistently, and in a sustainable manner through increased cooperation and coordination between sectors at each level and to ensure that the NNS is adopted into the budget plans of each sector for each period. It also aims to improve nutrition, health education, food security and safety systems , strengthen institutions and h uman resour ces, improve M&E and information systems in terms of both quality and quantity , and encourage domestic and external development partners and the private sector to support NNS implementation and invest more in NFS interventions. Strategic Directi on 4 is composed of 4 SOs: SO8: Improve institutions and coordination. SO9: Improve human capacities SO10: Increase the quantity and quality of information SO11: Increase investments in nutrition 4.3.1 SO8: Improve institutions and coordination This SO emp hasizes the development and improvement of policies, legislation, and working frameworks which relate to NFS with a focus on increasing management for the strengthening of institutions with respect to NFS, improving the nutrition network at each level and health education so that education on nutrition may be provided and food quality analyses strengthened. It also aims to raise the capacity of the agricultural technical service network in order to meet the needs of communities with regard to seed producti on and rearing of livestock so as to ensure sustainable improvements to NFS systems at each level ; and aims to improve coordination mechanisms in multiple sectors at each level from central through to local levels so that [the interventions] go ahead smoot hly and consistently through the use of discussions, planning, reporting, and information exchanges. 4.3.2 SO9: Improve human capacities This SO is focused on domestic and overseas short - and long -term capacity building for personnel (managers, specialists , and community networks in the relevant sectors) at all levels in the management and implementation of the NFS interventions and on integrating topics on nutrition into nursing and bachelor's and master's degree curricula and other programs at the Univers ity of Health Sciences (UHS) and public health management school It also aims to review and develop the integration of topics on nutrition, sanitation, household cultivation, livestock raising, and other such topics into the curricula of the ordinary educa tion system, teaching training institutes, and non-formal education (NFE). 17 4.3.3 SO10: Improve the quantity and quality of information This SO aims to improve NFS information systems, nutrition surveillance systems, and scientific research for the M&E of the outcomes of NFS implementation with a focus on ensuring its integration into the indicators used in the strategies, planning, and targets of each sector by improving vertical monitoring and reporting mechanisms within each relevant sector and the hor izontal coordination of nutrition committees at each level. It also aims to build a master plan for joint NFS education, research, and assessment , the arrangement of priorities, M&E, and surveillance for use in the improvement of policies, strategies, prog rams, planning, and projects for each period. 4.3.4 SO11: Increase investments in nutrition This SO emphasizes support and increased investment into NFS and food safety interventions and the integration of NFS into the five -year plans of each sector and th e 8th Five-Year NSEDP (2016 -2020) . It also aims to prioritize investment into NFS areas, such as the promotion of micronutrient fortification and clean domestic and external agriculture, including that of business people, the private sector, markets and so forth. It also aims to promote private sector participation and support for NFS interventions. 4.4 Strategic Direction 4: Linkages This Strategic Direction emphasizes ensuring linkages with other stakeholders who affect the NFS interventions indirectly. The detailed plans and budgets shall be specified in the programs of the relevant sectors for each period. This Strategic Direction comprises land allocation improvement, energy and mines, water resources and the environment , climate change - natural disast ers, telecommunications and transportation systems, human rights, gender roles, and poverty reduction. It also emphasizes MNC H and immunization, the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), the control of non -communicable diseases, such as diabet es and cardiovascular diseases and of communicable diseases, including diarrhea, malaria, dengue fever, ARI, tuberculosis, and the prevention of mother -to-child transmission (PMCT) and HIV/AIDS as specified in SO2. 18 Part 5 Capital Mobilizat ion, Implementation, and M&E 5.1 Capital Mobilization This NNS is in harmony and consistent with the directions of the GoL . In order for it to succeed, an estimated budget of 411,352,576 US dollars will be required from 2016 until 2020. The GoL is fully co mmitted to solving the vast problems and challenges connected with nutrition and shall approve the most generous GoL budgets possible for this issue. The GoL will, however, need and request domestic and external assistance in the form of resources focused on ensuring united support to be used transparently and accountably in order that the strategic targets for nutrition may be achieved as efficiently and effectively as possible. 5.2 Implementation 5.2.1 Management structure The NNS represents a direction t o be adopted for the implementation of the NFS interventions under NNC guidance and aims to improve coordination mechanisms between multiple stakeholders so that [the strategy] may proceed smoothly at all levels and there may be more cooperation from domes tic and external development partners. A) High level leadership The GoL has made decisive efforts to solving the problem of nutrition by setting up the NNC on 31 July 2013 pursuant to Prime Minister's Decision 73/PM . This committee is presided over by thre e Deputy Prime Ministers - the Minister of Health, the Minister of Planning and Investment, and the Minis ter of Agriculture and Forestry - and composed of deputy ministers and the deputy leaders of the relevant equivalent organizations. The NNC Secretariat was also established to take a leadership role for the committee and is headed by the Deputy Minister of Health with three Deputy Heads - the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the Deputy Minister of Education and Sports, and the Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment. This committee is responsible for reporting and deciding on high level decisions and policies, specifying the main strategies, and ensuring the performance of the obligations of each stakeholder participating in NFS affairs. B) National level coordination mechanisms The coordination mechanisms for NNS implementation were developed by the NNC Secretariat Office (SS O), which is located within the MOH in the Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion (DHHP) , with the National Nutri tion Center acting as the central hub for coordination. Technical nutrition teams have been set up from multiple relevant domestic sectors and foreign stakeholders. The main team has representatives from five ministries - the MOH, the Ministry of Agricultu re and Forestry (MOFA) , the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) , the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) , and the National Committee for Rural Development and Poverty Eradication and this team has the duties of research and consultation, providin g directions for solving problems relating to nutrition, coordination between 19 the various sectors and stakeholders, including domestic and international development partners, such as SUN, monitoring implementation progress, and resolving technical NFS prob lems . C) Provincial and district level coordination Secretariats to Provincial Nutrition Committees (PNCs) have been set up headed by the Directors of the Provincial Health Departments (PHDs) so that they may facilitate multi -sectoral coordination within t heir provinces and provide the necessary leadership and support to their districts. Offices for these Secretariats have been set up within the PHDs and act as a hub for coordination, planning, and reporting on the NFS interventions vertically and horizonta lly at provincial level. D) Coordination with development partners External development partners, donors, the United Nations (UN) , and non - governmental organizations (NGOs) have the obligation to support t he GoL with NNS implementation. Development partner s provide support in improving the multi - sectoral coordination framework in order to facilitate increased NFS support and assistance for vulnerable communities, households, and individuals so that they may gain access and optimal benefits consistently with GoL policies. 5.2.2 Implementation methods This strategy is focused on the various interventions specified in the National Nutrition Plan of Action, which ensures that the various sectors integrate these into their planning for each period. It also ensure s the focused implementation of the Priority 1 interventions and quantitatively and qualitatively improves the implementation of existing interventions by evaluating the outcomes yielded during three periods: the Short -Term Period (2016 -2018); the Medium -Term Period (2016 - 2020); and the Long -Term Period (2016 -2025). In order to achieve the outcomes for each period, implementation must take place as follows: 1) Multi-sectoral strategic methods and planning must be applied and include common priorities targets, and schedules for the implementation of the 29 interventions with urgent focus being placed on the 22 priority interventions in areas of high malnutrition rates, areas of food insecurity, poor localities, and those of GoL focus with emphasis placed on the rapid and sustainable reduction of chronic malnutrition. 2) The quality of existing NFS service provision must be improved nationwide. 3) It must be ensured that the NNS is incorporated as a component of the 8th Five-Year NSEDP (2016 -2020) and the NNSPA into the annual work plans (AWPs) of the relevant sectors in order to focus on sustainability and ensure that the support of development partners proceeds in accordance with the NNSPA. 20 4) Coordination mechanisms for planning, implementation, management and M&E must be improved at each level within the various sectors and between sectors and development partners. 5) The use of domestic human resources must be promoted for the management and implementation of the nutrition interventions in order to raise the capacities o f these human resources to achieve sustainability. 6) Local communities must be strengthened through active participation including taking of responsibility in planning , playing a role in deciding on solutions to problems and implementing the NFE intervention s using initiatives taken by village committees and LWU units with regular provincial and district level oversight. 7) Cultural values and traditional customs which boost the consumption of nutritious foods and their processing must be preserved. 8) The environm ent must be protected in order to avoid negative impacts which could affect NFS interventions in the long -term. 5.3 M&E In order to ensure the assessment and measurement of the impact of the implementation of the interventions specified for each period eff iciently and effectively, there must be surveillance systems, progress monitoring, scientific research, surveys, and information reporting and management systems along with the development and implementation of united multi -sectoral plans which cover the m ain NNS indicators and targets. Capacity building must also take place for persons participating in data collection, analysis, reporting, and information dissemination with a focus placed on ensuring accuracy, clarity, and keeping the data up to date so that this data may act as a reference for policy formation and mobilizing funding from central level government and donors. This strategy has been approved by all the relevant ministries and development partners and there is a strong belief that its implemen tation shall result in positive changes concerning NFS in the LPDR. 21 References 1.
