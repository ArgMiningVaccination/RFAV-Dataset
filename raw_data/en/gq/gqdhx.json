Children's Minnesota's pediatric integrative medicine program works with medical staff throughout the hospitals and other clinics to address all three. The program is the longest-running pediatric clinical integrative medicine program in North America. The integrative medicine program combines the best of complementary and conventional medical therapies to develop holistic solutions for children with chronic illness, acute and chronic pain, side effects from medical treatments, and emotional challenges such as depression and anxiety. Our approach is not meant to replace traditional treatments, but rather to enhance them. We see patients in both of our hospitals and in our Kiran Stordalen and Horst Rechelbacher Pediatric Pain, Palliative and Integrative Medicine Clinic. The best of both worlds What truly sets the integrative medicine clinic apart is the fact that we're staffed with advanced practice nurses and physicians with conventional medical training. But that's not all. Our team has received special training in techniques and therapies such as: - Aromatherapy - Biofeedback - Clinical hypnosis - Herbs and supplements - Reflexology - Healing touch - And more In other words, we have a thorough understanding of traditional medicine, integrative medicine, and ways to interweave both to create comprehensive, safe and effective treatment plans to help kids heal.
