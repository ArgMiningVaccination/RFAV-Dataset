Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report3Staff and Stakeholders, It is truly an honor and a privilege to be selected by Governor JB Pritzker to serve as Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections. In my brief time here, I have toured most of the facilities and met a great deal of the workforce and offender population. During my transition, I have witnessed the agency face the difficulties of budget constraints, staff shortages and tragic losses of IDOC family members. I quickly recognized and appreciated our staff's professionalism and dedication to safeguarding our agency during tough times. We are on a Journey to Excellence and we must have a culture where everyone is valued. There is a powerful common theme that resonates between staff, union leadership, the offender population, and our community stakeholders - people want us to be successful in our mission. Union leadership and families want us to operate our facilities safely and securely. Offenders want us to promote positive change through education and vocational programming to increase their employability upon release. The community wants us to return people better than when they were first incarcerated. Staff is eager to carry out the mission. As expected with any transition, there comes change. My initial priorities include developing a new organizational structure that promotes our mission, establishing our agency's values and ensuring decisions and policy development are data-informed and measurable. Our guiding principles; Operate our facilities and par ole units safely and securely. Invest in our staf f development and wellness to promote a healthy and professional workforce. Str eamline our efforts to improve offender cognitive, education, job readiness, and higher education programming. Cr eate meaningful reentry pathways for offenders returning to society through collaborative partnerships with other State agencies and community partners. Sustain fiscal r esponsibility with our budget and capital projects to ensure our population is provided with quality healthcare, adequate living conditions, and afforded daily quality of life essentials. I am very excited about our opportunities moving forward. Our agency will lead the discussion on criminal justice reform and reentry and what works. I am looking forward to the opportunity to meet our challenges head-on with a dedicated and compassionate team that has overcome far more challenges in the past than what lies ahead.

The Office of Staff Development and Training is excited to move into Fiscal Year 2020 with the introduction of a multitude of new and innovative training opportunities and curricula. In the enhanced effort to maintain transparency, professionalism and accountability, the agency implemented a new learning management system of One Net on July 1. This innovative technology brings with it the capability to provide interactive webinar training and the ability to better track and report all staff training. One Net is utilized with other State Agencies, which allows the Department the opportunity to network and participate in other interagency trainings. The rollout of Fiscal Year 2020 brings with it an exciting lineup of additional advanced specialized trainings including Rehabilitation, Safety Management and Care for Transgender People in a Correctional Setting, Incident Command System for Corrections, Use of Social Media and Addressing and Reducing Disparate Treatment and Impact. These relevant topics bring the agency focus of responsibility and professionalism to the forefront in relation to awareness of personal accountability for staff. The agency is also proud to announce the development and utilization of the newly formed De-escalation Response Teams within each facility site. These specialized teams were developed as an additional layer in the use of force continuum. As the agency continues to evolve, it will be the continued mission of the Office of Staff Development and Training to offer advanced levels of leadership training and continuing educational opportunities for staff advancement in the effort to support the agency expectation of professionalism, accountability and transparency. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report8 Correctional Officer of the Year The 2019 IDOC Correctional Officer of the Year is Terri Liefer of Menard Correctional Center.

She is cordial, dependable and always willing to lend a hand to assist her peers. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report11 Volunteer of the Year The 2019 Volunteer of the Year is Minister Fannie Morrison of Fox Valley Adult Transition Center. Minister Morrison is no stranger to IDOC. After retiring from Stateville Correctional Center, she felt called to work with incarcerated women and began volunteering at Fox Valley ATC. For the last 14 years, this individual has conducted bible study and religious mentoring sessions twice per month. She is dedicated, enthusiastic and serves as an inspiration and an advocate for the residents. Over the years, she has impacted the lives of hundreds of women at Fox Valley ATC. When she is not facilitating sessions, Minister Morrison collaborates with local agencies to secure donations for residents- items such as clothing, shoes, school supplies, and even furniture for women when they parole. Over the last 14 years, she has secured more than $25,000 worth of donations. She also generously donates gift bags for all the residents every Christmas and Mother's Day. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report12 Office of Constituent Services The Illinois Department of Corrections Office of Constituent Services is focused on its two-part mission to manage effective communication between concerned communities and the Illinois Department of Corrections and helping to encourage better outcomes for men and women being released from IDOC supervision. The Department answered more than 3,000 citizen inquiries in FY2019 and acted as the facilitating partner for multiple Summits of Hope throughout the State of Illinois. The Office of Constituent Services directly answered or redirected more than 3,000 inquiries to the appropriate staff at the Illinois Department of Corrections in FY2019. Inquiries were submitted through multiple media channels including: United States Postal Service, the IDOC website, telecom services, public meetings, and direct contact with community stakeholders. The Illinois Department of Corrections sponsored eight Summit of Hope events in FY2019. The events are aimed at giving returning citizens access to regional assistance resources and resource providers thereby lessening the odds that they recidivate upon returning to the community at large. The Summits were hosted by IDOC's Office of Constituent Services with the support of the Illinois Department of Corrections Parole Division and in partnership with the Illinois Department of Public Health Ryan White Program. The Summit of Hope is an expo style event with various resources and resource providers acting as vendors encouraging parolees to take advantage of free services, including receiving State of Illinois identification, health screenings and services, information on housing, food, clothing, job training, financial literacy, banking services, child support, assistance programs for utilities, transportation and veterans support services. During each Summit event, a volunteer guides each attendee through all services and exhibits to help with both the parolee's comprehension of the information and services available and to build meaningful connections to help reintroduce returning citizens to the community. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report13 Office of Performance Based Standards The Office of Performance Based Standards is comprised of a Manager, three Regional Coordinators and an Executive I. The office annually reviews policies and procedures at all correctional facilities and adult transition centers. The Regional Coordinators oversee approximately ten experienced correctional professionals assigned to the unit for one week. During the assigned week, the Regional Coordinators organize, monitor and implement the review process of selected Departmental Rules, Administrative Directives and Institutional Policies. Performance Based Reviews were conducted at each correctional center and adult transition centers for FY19. There was a less than 1% reduction in overall scores from the previous year, which is still very positive considering new subject matters were introduced. There was an overall increase of 9% in scores within the maximum-security facilities. All the Adult Transition Centers scored 90% or higher with the Peoria Adult Transition Center having the largest increase in score with an increase of 30%. Taylorville Correctional Center, Peoria Adult Transition Center, and North Lawndale Adult Transition Center received the Meritorious Review Recognition (MRR) award. This award indicates an excellent compliance tally of 93% or higher of all subjects that are reviewed during the review week. This reflects on the positive work of all three facilities throughout the year and how the administration and Facility Review Control Officers work together to achieve such high standards. During the past year, the Office of Performance Based Standards has provided ongoing training to newly appointed external and facility review team members. The Statewide Performance Based Review Team is comprised of security and non-security staff who have displayed professionalism at their facilities and have been recommended by their wardens. The team was increased by 67 staff members, which includes 43 non-security and 24 security staff. Currently, there are 269 trained team members. In FY 2020, the Office of Performance Based Standards will be implementing a new system for reporting non-compliant and compliant issues. This next year, as a result of a Rapid Results project, Performance Based Review reports and the required Corrective Action Plans completed by the facilities will be combined into one report. This change will assist in saving paper and in providing a more accurate and thorough report. Additionally, for FY20, the review week will be reduced by one day resulting in a redeployment of man hours which will assist in a more positive usage of team members' work hours. Along with these changes, all reports will now be added to the SharePoint system which will allow Executive staff and Administrative staff to review reports from around the state and share information.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report14 Illinois Correctional Industries In fiscal year 2019, ICI's program employed more than 1,100 male and female offender workers giving them the opportunity to learn new skills and develop important work habits. ICI has assigned a total of 82,353 days of Program Sentence Credit time to the Department of Corrections to be awarded. The ICI programs and the awarded Program Sentence Credit time helped these offenders not only gain valuable experience but saved Illinois more than $1.8 million in FY19. As workforce and businesses needs change, Correctional Industries continually strives to improve its programs to meet those demands. The U.S. Department of Labor apprenticeship programs allow ICI program participants to earn vocational certificates as a Baker, Office Manager/Admin Services, Cabinetmaker, Furniture Finisher, Furniture Upholsterer, Machine Set-up Operator, Machinist, Metal Fabricator, Meat Butcher, Graphic Designer and Animal Trainer and gain valuable work experience. ICI also had 70 offender workers complete the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Compliant Forklift Certification in FY19. Partnerships remain a key component to ICI meeting its mission of enhancing public safety and providing vocational training to offenders to assist them in successfully reentry into society. Customers, vendors, and the continued production efforts by our professional staff makes it possible for ICI to continue to fulfill its mandate to produce the highest quality products, at the most affordable price possible, and at no cost to the taxpayers of Illinois.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report15 Investigations and Intelligence Investigations Unit Operating as a branch within the Investigations and Intelligence Division, the Investigations Unit is charged with monitoring the integrity of the Illinois Department of Corrections by addressing, combating and preventing misconduct. The Unit serves as the central repository for policy complaints that are beyond the scope of institutional investigations for criminal complaints. It investigates allegations of misconduct against all departmental employees and offenders. Members of the Unit often work in conjunction with Illinois State Police, Division of Internal Investigation (DII), to conduct impartial investigations to determine validity of allegations and provide a basis for criminal prosecution and/or corrective administrative action. The Unit may provide assistance or conduct its own investigation into complaints referred by the Office of Executive Inspector General (OEIG). The nature of OEIG complaints may include, but are not limited to, incidents of possible misconduct, malfeasance or violations of laws, rules or regulations by any officer, employee or appointee. The Unit also reports all data incidents involving federal tax information to the IRS Office of Safeguards and Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies (TIGTA) and cooperates with TIGTA and Office of Safeguards investigators, providing data and access as needed to determine the facts and circumstances of the incident. In conjunction with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services and DII, the Unit also conducts administrative and criminal investigations for the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) relating to staff and/or youth. The Unit is provided complete, unfettered access to all department documents, facilities, staff, records and any other relevant information regarding complaints and special independent investigations. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, strict confidentiality is maintained by all subordinate staff. All reports generated by the Unit are reviewed by supervisory staff and subsequently forwarded to the Chief of Investigations and Intelligence for final review and approval. During FY2019, the Unit conducted 416 investigations (including cases and inquiries). In FY2019, the Unit, DII and OEIG collectively opened 36 cases. Investigators also obtained 16 arrests/indictments, resulting from investigations conducted by the Unit. The Unit presented 51 cases for prosecution, 18 of which were accepted. There were 5 convictions in FY2019. In addition, the Unit assisted the Department's Office of Staff Development and Training in the execution of a 40-hour Institutional Investigator curriculum as well as Security Threat Group (STG) training for in-service and pre-service classes. The attendees included facility investigators, intelligence staff and internal affairs support staff. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report16 Central Intelligence Unit The Central Intelligence Unit (CIU) operates as a branch of the Investigations and Intelligence Division and is under the supervision of the Director. To eradicate gang activity from the Department, the state legislature authorized and mandated the agency to develop an Intelligence Unit. In compliance with House Bill 4124, the Department established the Central Intelligence Unit (CIU) in 1999. The Department defines a Security Threat Group (STG) as: \"Individuals or groups of individuals both within and outside the department, who pose a threat or potential threat to the safety of the public, staff and offenders, and to the security and orderly management of a correctional facility.\" The Department recognizes that the activities of these criminal enterprises pose a direct threat to the public safety and would undermine public confidence in IDOC to carry out its mission for the citizens of the State of Illinois. One of the CIU's key tasks is to identify an offender's STG affiliation and rank. This information is used to effectively manage the offender population, determine accountability for the commission of crimes inside an institution and diffuse potential violent retaliatory incidents. The IDOC maintains a proactive anti-STG program, both within its institutions and on the streets. Since the formation of the CIU and the subsequent formation of the institutional intelligence units, the number of gang- related incidents within the department has declined dramatically. The CIU routinely identifies and tracks STG members and leaders, monitors incoming and outgoing offender mail, reviews and pre-approves offender job assignments, conducts intake and exit interviews, performs master file reviews, monitors offender telephone conversations, conducts cell and common area searches and conducts covert investigations of staff and offender/parolee misconduct. The CIU also maintains a beneficial and productive working relationship with outside law enforcement from the local to national level. The CIU fields requests from law enforcement agencies that includes providing information on offenders, arranging offender interviews and assisting in investigations of outside criminal acts. Another task is IDOC participation in Police Parole Compliance Checks (PPCCs), which are operations targeting paroled offenders (either single or mass numbers) to ensure they are complying with terms of their parole. Targeted offenders are transported to a pre-determined secure location where they are tested for drug use, interviewed by parole agents, CIU officers and outside law enforcement officials. The parolee's host site is also searched for contraband. Depending on the gravity of any potential parolee agreement violation, an offender may either be released with modified parole restrictions, returned to IDOC to complete their original sentence or receive new charges with subsequent transport to the local county jail. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report17 During PPCCs in FY2019, 233 parolees were targeted; 73 were drug tested and interviewed; 69 tested positive for drug usage; 24 were in possession of narcotics (netting 1,563.03 grams of marijuana, 393.35 grams of heroin, 815.88 grams of crack/cocaine and 2.1 gram of methamphetamine); 23 were in possession of weapons or ammunition; 27 were in possession of drug paraphernalia and 6 were in possession of stolen property. There was a total of $18,841 in cash recovered. There were also 6 warrants issued, resulting in the filing of 16 new charges. There were 2 offenders returned to IDOC and 9 were returned to their host site. The CIU also works with the Parole Division to serve Orders of Protection (OOP) to both incarcerated offenders and parolees in order to assist outside law enforcement agencies. During FY2019, the CIU served 92 OOP . The CIU also notifies affected law enforcement agencies whenever a convicted sex offender is discharged from IDOC custody. There were 464 notifications made during FY2019. The CIU additionally participates in Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN). PSN is a nationwide commitment coordinated by the U.S. Attorney's Office to reduce gun crime in America by networking existing local programs that target gun crime and providing those programs with additional tools necessary to be successful. Parolees with a firearm conviction in their criminal history, who are paroled in the Chicago Police Department's Districts 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 15, are required to attend the PSN forums. A total of 78 parolees/probationers attended 3 PSN forums in FY2019. The PSN Enhanced Parole Compliance Initiative targets parolees with firearm convictions in the above districts for compliance checks. The CIU also assisted the Department's Office of Staff Development and Training in the execution of a 40-hour Institutional Investigator curriculum as well as STG training for in-service and pre-service classes during FY2019. The Chief of Investigations and Intelligence also trained local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the capabilities of the CIU and on specific STG-related issues, along with several conferences throughout the country for the Department of Homeland Security. Intelligence agents are currently assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) taskforces and the Chicago Police Fusion Center (CPIC). Fugitive Apprehension agents are assigned to the U.S. Marshals Great Lakes Regional Fugitive Task Force and Intelligence staff is being integrated into the Illinois State Police Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center (STIC) to provide better communications throughout the state. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report18 Office of Inmate Issues/Administrative Review Board Since the ability to fill chairperson positions with \"special skills\" and a full support staff, the Administrative Review Board (ARB) has continued to answer offenders' grievances within a 30-day timeframe. In FY19, the ARB received 19,622 grievances. All grievances that receive a review by the ARB are receipted. A copy of the receipt is sent to the offender notifying him or her that their grievance has been received and will be reviewed. This procedure stems from a grievance receipt process that was implemented statewide on November 1, 2018. An Executive I within the unit strictly reviews all facility revocations/restorations of time submissions. In FY19, the ARB received 5,559 facility submissions for revocations and/or restorations. The ARB reviews these submissions to ensure the ticket was written correctly, the hearing was conducted properly, discipline is in line with prior discipline and/or the offense, and if SMI, the proper mental health review was conducted. The ARB conducts approximately 30 Protective Custody hearings a month for IDOC's maximum- security facilities. In addition, the ARB reviews and makes a determination on any Offender who is removed from IDOC's Impact Incarceration Program. Due to the number of subpoenas the ARB receives from various legal entities, a full-time position was established to respond to the requests. In FY19, the ARB received 1,115 requests with the ARB supplying a total of 114,055 pages of documents. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report19 Programs and Support Services Office of Adult Education and Vocational Services It is the mission of the Office of Adult Education and Vocational Service (OAEVS) to enhance the quality and scope of education for offenders within the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) consistent with age, commitments, and sentence by ensuring that the state and federal resources are appropriately used in aiding committed persons to restore themselves to constructive and law-abiding lives in the community. The Office of Adult Education and Vocational Services (OAEVS) aims to enhance the quality and scope of education for offenders within the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) by ensuring that state and federal resources are appropriately used in aiding committed persons to restore themselves and become constructive, law-abiding citizens upon release. OAEVS continues to provide quality educational opportunities to the offender population with the goal of increasing academic achievement. Education has proven to be vital to reducing recidivism and creating opportunities for offenders to better themselves. OAEVS staff will continue to work hard in assisting offenders in achieving their educational goals. Since January 1, 1987, all offenders committed to IDOC for two or more years, except those serving life sentences, take the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine their academic level. In Fiscal Year 2019, 12,685 offenders were tested at intake with 6,549 offenders scoring below the sixth-grade level. Offenders are also eligible for Earned Program Service Credit (EPSC). In FY2019, the OAEVS awarded 587,074 days. This is an increase of 303,151 days above FY18. Library services are available throughout IDOC. Libraries offer a variety of recreational reading materials such as books, magazines and newspapers. Offenders have a constitutional right to access the court system. Law libraries are maintained and contain Federal and State of Illinois Constitutions, statutes and court decisions. Resource materials help offenders research the law and prepare legal documents exercising their constitutional right of access to state and federal courts. Adult Basic Education (ABE) is a critical component in the education programming of OAEVS. ABE is mandatory for all offenders scoring below 6.0 on the TABE test. Mandatory ABE students must attend a minimum of 90 days of instruction. The ABE core curriculum provides instruction in basic reading, writing, mathematics and life skills. The program is designed to provide students with a base of skills and knowledge that will prepare them for additional academic/vocational instruction and subsequent employment. High School Equivalency (HSE), formally known as GED, is available to all offenders who score a 9.0 or higher on a TABE test. This level was changed to 8.0 in January 2019 due to the new TABE test. In FY16, OAEVS implemented computer-based instruction and testing of HSE at all facilities. The number of offenders completing their HSE went from 346 in FY16 to 660 in FY17 to 723 in FY18 to 735 in FY19. Offenders continue to succeed at a rate of 93% which is #1 in the nation.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report20 Post-secondary educational programming continues to be vital in the rehabilitation of offenders. College- level coursework was offered in vocational areas such as Auto Body, Auto Mechanics, Barbering, Career Tech, Construction Occupations, Commercial Custodial, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Horticulture, Manufacturing Skills, Nail Tech, Restaurant Management, Warehousing and Welding. These programs educate offenders in practical vocational applications allowing the hands-on training that can be carried on to the workforce upon release. College academic courses were offered that allowed students the opportunity to pursue an associate degree. Research has indicated that the higher the level of education achievement, the lower the percentage of offender recidivism. OAEVS encourages all offenders to participate in a degree earning program, with the goal of preparing them for employment upon release. The OAEVS continues to work with major colleges towards implementing 4-year degree programs. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report21 OAEVS Services ADULT BASIC EDUCATION Focuses on impr oving skills in reading, writing, and math.

Incr ease program diversity.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report22 Academic Services The number of offenders being tested has remained stable over the past four years with those scoring below a 6.0 Grade Level (GL) increasing by 14.6% over the same period of time. An increase of 1,494 in FY19 can be attributed to the new Test of Adult Basic Education that is aligned to the College and Career Readiness Standards, which took effect in January 2018 and was implemented for a full fiscal year in 2019 Adult Basic Education (ABE) consists of offenders enrolled in mandatory school (scoring less than a 6.0 GL on the TABE and attending school for 90 days), voluntary school, English as a Second Language (ESL), special education, AEFL and Advanced ABE (voluntary school for student with a grade level equivalent between 6.0 & 8.5). In FY19, there were 1,839 who achieved above a 6.0 GL in mandatory school.Year Offenders Tested at Intake Offenders Scoring Below a 6.0 of Students FY19 Annual Report23 Offender must have a 8.0 GL or above on the TABE to enroll in the Adult Secondary Education Program (ASE). To be a completer, students must complete the US Constitution Test, pass the i-Pathways curriculum with a 75%, score a 145 or higher on the Pre-GED test and then pass the GED test with a 145 or higher in Math, Science, Social Studies and Reasoning through Language Arts. The numbers of completers was low in FY16 due to it being the first year of implementing the online version of the GED. Education continues to be a positive motivator for offenders. The wait list has increased 97.62% since FY 2016, 63.59% since FY 2017 and 31.80% from FY 2018. The increase can be attributed to two factors: (1) the amount of educators decreased due primarily to a lack of funds (no budget in FY 2016 and FY 2017) and the department is still recovering, and (2) a new law that took effect on January 1, 2018 which allows for more offenders to earn program sentence credit. The education program continues to be the top producer of \"good time\" within the IDOC.

In FY 2018, 15,980 students participated in EPSC with OAEVS awarding days. FY saw 22,010 participate EPSC contracts (increase of 37.73%) and OAEVS awarding 587,074 (increase of 106.77%). The number of days awarded has increased 265.39% since 2016, 207.66% from FY 2017 and 106.77% from FY 2018. Students participated in the following classes: Auto Body, Auto Technology, Barbering, Construction Occupations, Construction Management, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Custodial Maintenance, Horticulture, Horticulture Management, Manufacturing Skills, Remedial Bridge, Restaurant Management, Warehousing and Welding. In FY 2019, 48.8% of the students completed courses. The number of participants and completers increased due to previously unfilled educator positions caused by budgetary issues being filled in FY 2019. 2019 2018 2017 2016 Number EPSC Credit FY19 Annual Report25 Career Technology is a 20-day class for offenders which focuses on resume writing, interview skills and financial literacy. The decrease in participants from FY 2016 to FY 2018 can be attributed to budgetary issues causing educator positions to go unfilled. FY 2019 saw the percentage of completers reach a 4-year high. The number of participants is a cumulative total, meaning one student could take all classes offered at a facility. FY 2016 to FY 2018 saw declining number because of the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) reimbursement rates declining along with lingering effects of the budget crisis which effected hiring of staff. FY 2019 saw participants and completers increase due to more classes being offered at various facilities.Year Participants 151 2017 7,603 288 8,343 Year DegreeIllinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report26 The fluctuation of certificates from year to year is attributed to the budget, filling of instructional posi - tions, starting new programs, and when courses were completed (i.e. at the end of a fiscal year). FY 2019 achieved a 3 year high with 2,198 certificates. Staffing has fluctuated over the past few years due to fiscal concerns. FY 2017 saw a hiring freeze. With a budget in place, vocational staff were able to be hired. Additionally, programs returned to Centralia, Lincoln, Logan and Decatur. *Amended from FY 2018 Annual Report.Program 2017 2018 2019 Auto Body 41 47 33 Auto Tech 137 175 132 Construction Occupations 466 420 507 Construction Management 0 0 8 Cosmetology 19 9 0 Culinary Arts 434 382 431 Custodial Maint. 420 332 403 Horticulture 283 308 450 Horticulture Manage 0 0 4 Manufacturing Skills 0 0 7 Restaurant Mgmt. 76 0 45 Warehousing 145 195 93 Welding 64 98 85Certificate by Program 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total Sites 18* 18* 20* 25 Total Instructors Hired 8 0 25 66 Total Instructors Separated from College 10 11 12 25 Total Instructors End of Fiscal Year 78* 67* 80* 153Vocational StaffingIllinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report27 Staffing continues to be an issue due to budgetary concerns and allotted head count.

The CTE grant is $894,450 and provides equipment and supplies for vocational programs. Perkins grant is a Federal grant for $228,000 which provides supplies, equipment, and staff development for vocational education. The AEFL grant of $893,910 focuses on adult education literacy and supports partial salaries, benefits, staff development and supplies for 13 educators. Office of Mental Health & Addiction and Recovery Management Services The mission of the IDOC Office of Mental Health Management (OMHM) is to assist incarcerated individuals affected by Mental Illness and Serious Emotional Disturbance to decrease needless suffering, better manage their illness, and achieve personal goals to reach and maintain their highest level of functioning. The Department strives to deliver services in a respectful, responsive and efficient manner with sensitivity to Diversity of Culture, Language, Ethnicity, Gender and Sexual Identity. In collaboration with additional Support Services and Operations within the agency's facilities, the office seeks to maximize the resources available and attend to concerns for the safety and well-being of individuals. Services and support are designed to provide meaningful assistance to the individual in acquiring and maintaining those mental, emotional and social skills, which enable the offender to function most effectively with the demands of his or her own person or environment. The Office of Mental Health Management (OMHM) also continues to improve the mental health services delivery system through the implementation of a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) program aimed at systematic, ongoing, objective monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of mental health offender care. This program will allow the department to accurately and effectively monitor itself through both internal and external processes. It will also provide a space that welcomes and nurtures innovation and consumer feedback. Additionally, the department has made significant progress on the construction of a new 200-bed inpatient facility on the Joliet Treatment Center grounds. This level of care represents the highest level of mental health care available in the department. The OMHM has expanded professional development opportunities for mental health and psychiatric staff by sponsoring continuing educational trainings, the development of a psychiatric newsletter, increased case consultation/presentation, and policy and procedural trainings, all with focus on improving the care provided within IDOC and furthering the professional development of our staff. The OMHM continues to work in concert with the Office of Health Services (OHS), as both divisions recognize the important contributions that both physical health and mental health have on the overall well-being of patients we provide care for. The OMHM will also maintain existing partnerships with other State of Illinois agencies and entities such as the Department of Human Services, the Department of Mental Health, the University of Illinois and Southern Illinois University systems while strengthening relationships with national partners like the American Correctional Association (ACA), the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA), Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report30 the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Association of Correctional Mental Health Administrators (ACMHA). Fostering these partnerships will facilitate our effort to increase productivity, eliminate waste, and further the goals of our respective missions. The mission of the Addiction & Recovery Management Services Unit (ARMSU) is to formulate consistent guidelines for the development and implementation of addiction recovery management programs and the continuum of care within the Department; to coordinate the screening, assessment, and referral of offenders needing and/or requesting addictions recovery services; to monitor care and standards of substance abuse treatment provided to offenders; to serve as a resource for the Agency and provide consultative services and training to agency staff and community providers around addiction issues. In FY19, treatment ranged from intensive wrap around services (i.e. Sheridan Correctional Center and Southwestern Correctional Center) to low intensity Level 1 substance abuse treatment (i.e. Dixon Springs and DuQuoin IIP ,). Partnerships include DASA, TASC, the CSACs in Central Illinois and Southern Illinois, PFI, and IAODAPCA. IDOC has contracts with multiple substance abuse treatment providers throughout the state (i.e. GEO Group, WestCare Foundation and Comprehensive Connections) as well as many community providers. Current highlights of the ARMSU include the distribution of NARCAN (Naloxone) to agency parole agents, oversight of the Sheridan Therapeutic Community Substance Use Disorder treatment facility, Southwestern Therapeutic Community Substance Use Disorder facility and Methamphetamine program, the Logan Correctional Center Dual Diagnosis program and the Multi-Agency Medication Assistance Treatment (MAT) Community initiative funded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This program is coordinated by the Office of Substance Use Prevention and Recovery of The Illinois Department of Human Services in concert with ARMSU, Sheridan Correctional Center and IDOC Parole. Fifty offenders committed from Cook County were selected to participate in this program. Each offender received six to nine months of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Substance use Disorder specific programming and Medication Assisted Treatment induction prior to release onto mandatory statutory release (MSR), with intensive case management and wrap-around services to include housing, education/job training, and employment.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report31 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) In accordance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) which was passed with unanimous support from both parties in Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003, the Department maintains a strict zero tolerance policy for sexual abuse, staff sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. The Department provides strict guidelines for the prevention, detection, response, investigation, and tracking of all allegations. All offender allegations of sexual abuse and sexual harassment are taken seriously, investigated, and when applicable, referred for prosecution. While incarcerated within the Illinois Department of Corrections, offender safety is paramount; and that safety includes the right to be free from sexual abuse, harassment and retaliation.The Department has placed substantial emphasis on offender education. Ensuring all offenders know how to report an allegation of abuse and knowing those reports may be made confidentially and without fear of retaliation, is critical. All offenders are provided with information regarding the Department's Zero Tolerance policy at intake. PREA information is provided to each offender throughout their incarceration through the placement of over 3,000 bilingual permanent signs, information offered on the facility's dedicated TV channel, the facility's Offender Handbook, printed brochures, and even more creative ways like painted murals throughout some facilities. The Department also continues to work very closely with the John Howard Association, an offender advocacy group based out of Chicago, to ensure offenders have a confidential third-party reporting mechanism to make a report directly to someone completely outside the Department's jurisdiction. During this time period, PREA audits were conducted at nine correctional centers and one adult transition center to conclude the Department's second 3-year audit cycle. The audits were each conducted by outside contractors certified by the US Department of Justice. All ten facilities audited were found to be in full compliance with the PREA Standards. The Department will continue to audit one-third of our facilities each year of the three-year audit cycle to ensure the Department maintains full compliance with the PREA Standards. Training and policy will continue to be reviewed and updated as necessary to provide the most up to date knowledge and best practices to the employees of the Department. Annual training will continue to be provided to all employees, volunteers and contractors who have contact with offenders to ensure all staff is prepared to respond to an allegation of sexual abuse as well as preventing incidents of sexual abuse. The Department will continue to take all allegations of sexual abuse and harassment seriously throughout our agency. Our Department's commitment to maintaining a zero-tolerance approach to sexual abuse and sexual harassment will continue to be demonstrated through our full compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report32 Operations Transfer Coordinator's Office The Transfer Coordinator's Office (TCO) is responsible for coordinating the movement of and determining the appropriate placement of all adult offenders within the Illinois Department of Corrections. Since the office was established over 30 years ago, the Department has expanded to its present level of 28 adult facilities, 4 reception and classification centers, adult transitional centers and Impact Incarceration Programs. To efficiently coordinate offender placement and movement, the office has also expanded to its present staffing level of Transfer Coordinator Manager, Assistant Managers, Assignment Coordinators and support staff. The movement of offenders involves statewide coordination of the Central Transportation Unit by the TCO. During Fiscal Year 2019, a total of 38,801 offenders moved via the Central Transportation Unit. This averages out to 746 offenders per week. In addition, the movement of correctional officer cadets to and from the Training Academy for their Pre-Service Security Training is also handled through the CTU. In fiscal year 2019, 11,600 correctional officer cadets were transported. This is an average of 223 cadets per week. Prior to the movement of offenders, initial and subsequent security and placement designations of each offender must be completed. This process is overseen by the TCO. The TCO determines the initial placement. There is an imperative need to keep the population flowing out of the Reception & Classification Units in order to facilitate the continual delivery of offenders from the county jails. During FY19 the TCO approved placements for 20,098 offenders from R & C facilities. The TCO also determines subsequent placement and movement for offenders throughout their incarceration. A review of each offender's General Office file is completed to determine appropriate placement, balancing between offender needs and the protection and safety of the public. Approved offenders are then prioritized based on bed space availability and urgency for the transfer. Factors such as discipline, enemy or safety issues, warrants or detainers, programming, writ housing, changes in security and medical or mental health conditions are considered when determining priorities. Offenders' special needs are also considered in placement decisions. This would include but is not limited to offenders with ADA issues, substance abuse treatment needs, Security Threat Group issues, medical or mental health needs, protective custody or special management needs, those offenders classified as Sexually Dangerous Persons (SDP) or Sexually Violent Person (SVP) and those offenders considered as extreme escape risks. During FY19 the TCO processed 17,438 transfer requests and 3,534 offender security reclassifications. The TCO also screens and coordinates offender placement within the Impact Incarceration Program, Adult Transitional Centers and Electronic Detention. During FY19, TCO processed 2,798 ATC requests and 267 ED reviews. The TCO serves as the liaison and coordinator of the Interstate Corrections Compact and is responsible for coordinating the transfer of offenders on an international level in cooperation with the Department of Justice.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report33 Additionally, the TCO was responsible for overseeing the awarding of Supplemental Sentence Credits on behalf of the Chief Public Safety Officer to eligible offenders. Correspondence and calls from offenders, their families, concerned citizens, attorneys, law enforcement, government officials and agencies, IDOC administrators and legal staff are received and acknowledged daily. Other duties include compiling reports, completing special projects, and maintaining special population profiles. As the preceding summary reflects, the responsibilities of the Transfer Coordinator's Office extend far beyond the scope of transferring offenders throughout the State of Illinois. Operations Center The Operations Center is a multifaceted area within IDOC. The center, which provides 24-hour assistance and availability, serves as the statewide command post serving the needs for both adult and juvenile offenders within IDOC and the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. The Operations Center provides continuous Law Enforcement Agencies Data System/ National Crime Information Center (LEADS/NCIC) communication, access and maintenance of parole warrants and related information to field staff. In addition, it tracks all mass high-risk institution and parole transports of offenders, providing another layer of safety and efficiency. The center is also responsible for dissemination of local and federal criminal history data to appropriate IDOC agents, offices and local law enforcement agencies. In addition, the Operations Center handles a large volume of phone calls daily and serves as an instrumental liaison for IDOC to law enforcement agencies and the public. Food Services The Food Services Department of the Illinois Department of Corrections functions as a cohesive part of the agency's operational and logistical support capabilities, preparing more than 100,000 offender meals per day, including many religious and therapeutic diets. Daily operations of the individual dietary departments are overseen by the Food Service Program Manager. They utilize the procurement processes to ensure cost effective and efficient productivity. They have the responsibility to ensure adherence to the Illinois Department of Public Health standards regarding food service safety and sanitation within their respective units. Following a 5-week cycle menu, the Correctional Food Service Supervisors oversee offender dietary workers preparing and serving healthy and nutritious meals to their facility's population. Dietary workers learn meal preparation techniques in accordance with the best industry practices. They also perform the food safety and sanitation functions, ensuring the health and welfare of those at their institution. There are several sustainability initiatives operating within Food Services related to recycling and reduction of waste, as well as incorporating programing opportunities for offenders. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report34 Many facilities have robust gardening operations focused on providing healthy and nutritious fresh foods for utilization in meal preparation, teaching life skills to offenders, as well as creating donations to support local community food pantries. Jail and Detention Standards The mission of the Jail and Detention Standards Unit is to monitor compliance with Illinois County Jail Standards, Illinois Municipal Jail and Lockup Standards and the Federal Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act. The purpose of monitoring is to develop standardized practices in detention facilities that enhance the health and safety of the public, detention staff and detainees. In addition, the office provides assistance and services to facilitate the development of those practices. State statute established the unit and directs that the office may inspect all county jails on an annual basis. There are 92 county jails in 102 counties in Illinois. Municipal lockups are inspected upon request of the chief of police. In FY2019, 10 municipal inspections were completed. Jail and Detention Standards has the authority to refer facilities in serious noncompliance to the Illinois Attorney General for remediation. This authority has recommended further review of specific substandard facilities. The unit also stimulated new facility construction throughout Illinois. Staff members monitor approximately 1,100 municipal police departments and 92 county jails for compliance with federal secure juvenile detention requirements. In FY2019, there were 485 juvenile monitoring inspections completed by the unit. The Jail and Detention Standards Unit provides an adequate system of monitoring jails, lockups and non-secure facilities to ensure that delinquent minors are being held in accordance with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention policies and procedures. The potential to detain non-offenders and status offenders requires a specialized monitoring system. The criminal justice specialists annually visit law enforcement facilities to determine which facilities detain youths and which do not. Those who do not detain youths are considered No Hold facilities and only need to be visited every three years rather than annually. Criminal justice specialists conduct on-site inspections of county jails and municipal lockups for compliance with standards. All 92 county jails were inspected in 2019. Staff members conduct follow-ups on unusual occurrences and provide consultations regarding detention operations, renovations, new construction and staffing recommendations. There were 12 county jail unusual occurrence investigations conducted in FY2019. In the capacity of ombudsmen, unit staff responds to citizen and detainee complaints relating to detention operations, civil rights and legal responsibilities. The unit responded to 66 detainee complaint letters and provided 225 technical assistance requests to jails in FY2019. The unit collects monthly detainee population statistics from county jails and quarterly from municipal lockups. A database is maintained for this information, which is ultimately sent to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority on an annual basis. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report35 Staff Wellness As the face of corrections changes, IDOC is taking significant steps to address the needs of employees working in its facilities, as well as the offenders in its custody. Employees face numerous challenges, both professional and personal, as it relates to the environments in which they work. According to the National Institute of Corrections, a correctional employee working in a prison facility for twenty years has an average life expectancy of only 59 years (2008). Chronic health conditions from stress, hypervigilance, shift work, and exposure to violence all contribute to the physical and mental decline of those working with the prison populations. IDOC's Staff Wellness Response Teams (SWRT) address the mental and emotional needs of staff. A highly trained team assists facilities following critical incidents and offers peer support through confidential referrals to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and AFSCME's Personal Support Program (PSP). From Corrections Fatigue to Fulfillment (CF2F), a program developed by Dr. Caterina Spinaris, founding director of Desert Waters Correctional Outreach, is offered to all IDOC staff. The 10-hour course uses evidence and data to explain the psychological dynamics behind the negativity of the corrections workplace and its costly consequences. CF2F analyzes the causes and signs of corrections fatigue and provides strategies for professional fulfillment and self-care. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report36 Facility Highlights BIG MUDDY RIVER CORRECTIONAL CENTER In the last year, Big Muddy River Correctional Center has had hundreds of offenders participate in various programs, including Thinking for a Change, Inside-Out Dads, Start Now, the Re-Entry Summit, Substance Abuse Treatment and Education. Over one hundred offenders completed Adult Basic Education and several received a General Education Diploma. The Sex Offender Program at Big Muddy River Correctional Center continues to be an active, unique and respected program which provides treatment and support to offenders enrolled in the volunteer Sex Offender Program and the Sexually Dangerous Persons Program. Lake Land College administers vocational programs at the facility offering subjects such as Automotive Technology, Horticulture, Career Technology, Construction Occupations, and Commercial Cooking. 175 Vocational Certificates were awarded during FY2019. Automotive Technology repaired 60 vehicles. Culinary Arts prepared various luncheons, including the fall and spring Re-Entry Summits and Chapel Volunteer Banquet. The Construction Program donated 10 doghouses to two local no-kill animal shelters. The Horticulture Program continues to grow plants for the annual plant sale and various state agencies, including the Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the DuQuoin State Fair. Chaplaincy Services has made many successful events happen within Big Muddy River. Six events were organized during February for Black History Month, including a concert by Gideon's Tour with prison fellowship and a talent show. A donation of a Sukkah temporary structure was made for Jewish offenders to celebrate during Sukkoth. The facility hosted a successful Angel Tree program this year. Several new chapel programs were implemented. On June 3, 2019, 110 volunteer offenders were divided into four groups to begin bagging sand for local communities in need. During the efforts, the men filled approximately 60,000 bags of sand. Big Muddy River has placed more recycling receptacles in the offices for plastic and paper. The facility has a baler for which we compact recyclable materials such as tin cans, wood pallets and cardboard. Starting April 2019, plastic was added to this list of recyclables. This addition has not only increased recycling efforts, but the facility went from three pulls per week to two pulls resulting in a cost savings of approximately $32,543.00 in trash pickup for the facility. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report37 Recycling for FY19 (July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019) Car dboard 76 bales = 38 tons Cans 56 bales = 16.8 tons WVO (waste veg. oil) 8 totes = 2,000 gallons Motor Oil 225 gallons Car Batteries 25 W ooden Pallets 1,482 pallets Plastic 2 bales = 0.8 ton Total estimated value of recycled materials = $11,980.00 Big Muddy River completed replacing 92 1100-Watt High Pressure Sodium Bulbs in the high mast lights with 300-Watt LED fixtures. The lighting project initially cost $53,878, but a lighting incentive rebate brought the cost down to $20,758. The lights require about 20 labor hours less each year in addition to saving about $19,000 in wattage use. The project will pay for itself in 13 months. Big Muddy River Correctional Center and its entire staff in the Operations and Programs divisions are committed to continually operating in a cost-effective manner while providing for the successful re-entry of offenders and maintaining public safety and overall facility security. CENTRALIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER Centralia Correctional Center had a successful FY19 starting new programs and services for offenders while implementing cost saving measures and operating under budget. The facility continues to make strides to meet or exceed the expectations of PREA requirements, as well as the Rasho and Holmes lawsuits. Centralia Correctional Center was chosen as Facility of the Year for the Storybook Project. The Storybook Project allows offenders to be recorded while reading a book. The book/recording is then sent to the offender's children. The Centralia Correctional Vet Zone conducted numerous services throughout the year, including a Memorial Day service in the Chapel to honor those who have passed while serving our county. Vet Zone Director Susan Walker coordinated with the choir and art programs to have them showcased as well. There were several pieces of art done by our offender population on display and the choir sang and led the Pledge of Allegiance. The service was attended by the local media, staff and offenders. A few members of the Vet Zone shared their personal experiences while serving in the military during the ceremony. Also, Counselor Walker was contacted by Veterans Affairs asking assistance on how to revamp their \"suits\" program which supports incarcerated veterans once released. We were successful in pointing them in the right direction, and the VA is once again entering facilities to assist incarcerated veterans' transition once released. The VA can assist in housing, technical training and assistance to accomplish goals set by the Prisoner Review Board, such as treatment and counseling. Clinical Services has a 3rd Start Now class, as well as the Inside Out Dads program. These programs allow offenders to earn good time while they gain the skills they need to successfully re-enter society. Clinical Services continues to provide standard services, including cognitive behavioral therapy, Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report38 substance abuse and re-entry programming. We have increased our staffing levels specializing in mental health treatment. Mental Health staff have greatly impacted group therapy and individual contact opportunities for offenders with mental health concerns. We hold a Re-Entry Summit twice a year, as well as perform a Re-Entry Simulation, to assist in reducing recidivism by building a foundation to bridge the gap between incarcerated offenders, community service providers, employers, policy experts and governmental agencies. The summits address the roadblocks offenders face with employment, housing and other issues once released, and they are taught ways to overcome the obstacles. Chaplaincy includes a variety of programs serving diverse religions. Leisure Time Services continues to have new and updated activities for all skill levels of exercise. The Art Program has grown steadily. Vocational programming returned to the facility this year through the local community college and includes Commercial Cooking, Career Technology, and Custodial Maintenance. We anticipate adding other courses in the future. Working in conjunction with the Academic School, offenders who have completed GED coursework can further develop needed skills for a successful return home, as well as earn good time days. Domestic Violence Month and Black History Month were recognized with events and guest speakers. The facility continues to seek out programs which will have a positive impact on offenders. In April of 2019, the facility implemented its plan to house the offender population by assignment/ grade, which is an attempt to increase the overall safety and security of the institution, as well as make our environment better for staff and offenders. Centralia Correctional Center believes that celling offenders by assignment will provide a more conducive learning environment for vocational and academic students and a more controlled environment for offenders with job assignments. Centralia Correctional Industries processed more than 97 tons of recycling materials which consisted of 59 tons of cardboard, 10 tons of plastic, 16 tons of tin, and 12 tons of paper. This allowed the facility to reduce costs associated with waste disposal. The facility garden produced more than 25,000 pounds of produce, which was used to reduce costs associated with offender and staff meals. Through the programming of 37 offenders, Centralia Industries was able to recommend 11,506 days of Program Sentence Credits. Centralia was able to obtain Capital Development funding during FY19 to have our entire facility wiring checked for proper grounding. DANVILLE CORRECTIONAL CENTER Danville Correctional Center's staff has embraced the attitude of cultural change by actively engaging in efforts to raise funds for Special Olympics through Polar Plunge. Danville's staff most recently donated over $3000 in cash assistance and school supplies to students at Meade Park School and 450 pounds of vegetables to the Danville Food Pantry. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report39 Danville Correctional Center continues to focus on altering the culture of corrections. The Building Block program launched in February of 2018 with a focus on creating a better offender by offering programming on the wing and fostering as a sense of community between the offenders. This program has resulted in a positive change in the attitudes of both offenders and staff. Offender behavior improved drastically. Danville Correctional Center has expanded to four Building Block wings, each with their own unique programming. The Building Block has become a pilot program that multiple facilities are utilizing. This year, Danville Correctional Center started an Employee Birthday Breakfast which has had an overwhelming response from staff. Danville Correctional Center always strives to enhance staff morale and occasionally has food vending trucks set up for staff to purchase items. A comfort dog named Bethany from a local church visits the facility monthly and interacts with staff and offenders. Danville Correctional Center's Sustainability Committee continues to reduce the facility's operating expenses and carbon footprint. Danville Correctional Center expanded the amount of acreage dedicated toward gardening and increased focus on producing compost from carbon waste. Additionally, Danville Correctional Center continues to replace low efficiency lighting with high efficiency lighting LED lighting resulting in considerable electric utilities savings. Volunteer programs are thriving at Danville Correctional Center; The Education Justice Project will enter its 11th year with a mission to build a model college-in-prison program that demonstrates the positive impacts of higher education upon incarcerated individuals. The Divine Hope Reformed Bible Seminary is in its 8th year as a dedicated prison seminary that operates within the Danville Correctional Center. DECATUR CORRECTIONAL CENTER Moms and Babies Program The Moms and Babies Program was implemented at Decatur Correctional Center in March 2007. Expectant mothers begin prenatal education in preparation for their delivery. Prenatal medical care is provided by an outside doctor who come to the facility. The mothers complete caregiver and CPR classes. After the delivery, the baby and mother return to the institution and stay in a specially designed room. They participate in postnatal programming and Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC) pre-release programming. Moms & Babies gives incarcerated mothers the opportunity to bond with their newborn babies in a Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report40 setting that nurtures physical and emotional health. The facility's E-Wing is set up to provide a warm atmosphere and includes an Infant Development Center which meets DCFS standards for space and equipment. By providing this program, the Illinois Department of Corrections continues to be in the forefront of gender-responsive programming. During FY19, five women participated in the Moms and Babies Program. Shakespeare Corrected Now in its 8th year, Shakespeare Corrected presented 'The Two Gentlemen of Verona' April 24-28, 2019. The Decatur Correctional Center had the honor of hosting Governor JB Pritzker and the First Lady for the presentation on Wednesday, April 24, 2019. The First Lady was able to meet with the offenders who participated in the play prior to their performance. Shakespeare Corrected's mission is to bring undergraduate students together with incarcerated and disadvantaged populations to collaborate and create a theatrical experience intended to inspire transformation and redemption in students, participants and their families. Currently 47 offenders participate in this program. The nine-month program culminates in a series of performances of a full-scale Shakespeare play for audiences of friends, family and other offenders. Decatur Correctional Center TACT TeamThe state TACT Challenge was held at the Taylorville Correctional Center on June 4, 2019. Decatur Correctional Center received second place. Art TherapyVolunteers from Millikin University provided offenders the opportunity to develop life skills while participating in a creative art. College Vocational Programs Lake Land College joined the Decatur Correctional Center in January 2019. Lake Land College offers four vocational classes at Decatur Correctional Center.

Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report42 Dixon Correctional Center partnered with outside vendors to install several facility-wide technological upgrades designed to increase offenders' opportunities to communicate with loved ones outside of the facility. This initiative started with the installation of video visit equipment in every housing unit. This service is now in use and allows an offender to have video and audio communication with any of his approved visitors without the need of the visitor physically traveling to the facility. The same equipment will allow offenders to send and receive e-mail messages to approved recipients whenever they please to expedite written communication. More recently, the same vendors have provided tablet PCs for purchase by the offenders. These devices also allow offenders to e-mail their loved ones as well as stream music and play games in their cells.

The Rapid Results Team now consists of eight trained staff members. A collaborative effort with the City of East Moline allowed nuisance potholes throughout the facility to be filled, patched and repaired by the city with their equipment and labor totaling $5,720 in savings. Additionally, the Illinois Department of Transportation performed clean-up of debris and large brush from the range road, including tree grinding, for a savings of $1,760. The enhancement will provide better safety and security as well as less wear and tear on the facility's vehicle Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report43 fleet. East Moline Correctional Center's Business Office began purchasing bus tickets two weeks in advance for offenders leaving the facility on mandatory supervised release, resulting in a savings of $8,000-$10,000 annually. Smaller projects have also been implemented such as adding deep fryer inserts in Dietary to preserve oil and reduce build up. Dietary also began a meal tray accountability tracking program to ensure all trays sent out of Dietary are returned. Rapid Results is a high priority effort at the facility and will continue to be in the future. East Moline Correctional Center is becoming more energy efficient with an LED Perimeter Lighting Project. East Moline Correctional Center was approved to undergo a perimeter lighting upgrade project to address inefficient lighting and continuous lighting repairs. The existing lighting was High Intensity Discharge (HID) and High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) fixtures. The perimeter lighting project will replace the existing inefficient lighting with LED fixtures to obtain energy reduction and savings, as well as the reduction in time and materials necessary for continuous repairs. The facility began planning the project in March 2019 with a $46,500 budget. On May 31, 2019, installation of the LED conversion project was initiated with the assistance of many staff from the Maintenance Department. On July 26, 2019, the installation of 140 new LED perimeter light fixtures was completed. With the completion of the installation, East Moline Correctional Center then submitted an application for the Commercial Energy Advantage Rebate Program through MidAmerican Energy, the electricity utility provider in the area. With the assistance of MidAmerican Energy Representative Derick Hofer, the application was approved. Post-installation rebates are expected to exceed $10,000.00 and have assisted in Post-Implementation cost recovery. Utility savings of $3,657 are expected, as well as reduced maintenance and repair time and/or materials. East Moline Correctional Center had a number of other improvements and repairs completed by the maintenance department in FY19. A warming shack was constructed to allow officers to view line movement while not being subjected to the elements. Also, a major leak in a large water line in the powerhouse was repaired and additional valves were added to prevent the unnecessary shutting off of the water during times when water heater repairs are needed. Additionally, one of the booster pumps that supplies water to the water tower was removed and the motor and pump were both rebuilt. All of our operational elevators have been made compliant and passed inspection by the State Fire Marshal during the previous fiscal year as well. Also, on multiple occasions, the perimeter fence was damaged by falling tree limbs. Although a contractor was required for repair in one instance, multiple repairs were made in house. A holding area was built on first floor of the Administration building for the purpose of securing offenders. A substantial amount of roof repairs was completed to prevent leaks. Additional offender phones were added in many areas including the yard. Leisure Time Services (LTS) increased activity participation for the fifth consecutive year.

Every employee received a card from coworkers with a kind word expressing their gratitude for their services at ETC. Additionally, the facility initiated the busted board program which highlights staff who are \"busted\" or \"caught\" doing a good deed. Nominated employees are typically staff who go above and beyond the call of duty. The Mental Health Department and Multidisciplinary Team have developed a steady flow in terms of treatment planning, developing behavior plans and incorporating security staff in the planning and implementation process. Multidisciplinary Team meetings are held daily to ensure all aspects of patient care is discussed and decisions are made as a team. Collectively, the team continues to make adjustments to provide coverage during periods of low staffing levels. Key members of the team routinely inquire about resources, donations to the facility and ideas for improving quality of services. Several staff members have voluntarily taken on additional duties and assignments to ensure continued success in the areas of operations and programming. Overall, in 2019, the employees at the treatment center have embraced the direction of the facility and are finding ways to make a positive contribution. They continue to improve their level of awareness, range of flexibility, knowledge and level of professionalism. Many of them have become members of notable committees such as the Special Olympics, Staff Wellness Response Team, Screening and Recruitment, and De-escalation Response Team. In terms of training efforts, this year marks the first time the facility has been able to independently roll out cycle training utilizing supervisors who are assigned to Elgin Treatment Center, which is a major accomplishment for newly established facilities.

Graham Vets has created its own Newsletter and raised donations for a flagpole and surrounding memorial site at the facility; members began raising and lowering the Colors on September 11, 2016. An electronic bugle has been added that is played during the raising and lowering of the American and Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report50 P .O.W. flags. Members received their own Housing Unit in February of 2017, which can hold up to 98 veterans. The Mental Health Department at Graham C.C. also maintains a weekly veterans PTD/TBI support group, facilitated by a degreed and certified Mental Health staff, serving both combat and non-combat related traumas. As of FY2019, numbers reflect a very impressive 19.5% recidivism rate. Over 73% of members each year do NOT have Inmate Disciplinary Reports (IDR) written against them, with most going multiple years without an IDR. Additionally, many parolee ex-veteran offenders successfully obtain good respectful jobs resulting in promotions to supervisory rolls within the communities.

HILL CORRECTIONAL CENTERHill Correctional Center partnered with WCIC radio station to bring Unspoken, a well-known Christian contemporary band, to the facility for a live concert event for the offenders and Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report51 staff. The concert was available to all interested offenders and was an enormous success. This group of gentlemen not only entertained the offenders with the music, but also captured their attention with true-life stories of how they turned their own lives around. Hill introduced both the A-Grade Incentive Program and the C-Grade Disciplinary Wing in the Spring of 2019. The A-Grade Incentive Program was created to recognize and express appreciation for the 1500+ offenders who consistently strive to maintain positive adjustment. All offenders in A-grade status were provided with the opportunity to participate in the program and select one of the following choices as reward and a \"thank you\" from the facility: one-time commissary double shop, 1 free photograph, 1 extra hour of gym or yard, a job assignment, 1 extra visit, 1 extended visit, or a cell move. The program was wildly successful and greatly appreciated. On the flipside, the C-Grade Disciplinary Wing was implemented at the same time. All general population offenders that are C-Grade status are housed together in Housing Unit 4-C wing and remain there until the C-grade disciplinary sanctions end. The offenders on the wing go to Commissary, Gym, Yard and Dietary together. Because C-Grade offenders are provided with no privileges, housing the offenders together provides us the ability to better enforce the disciplinary sanctions of no telephone access, no audio/visual privileges and restricted commissary. Over 40 offenders have participated in the new Entrepreneurship Program offered by Western Illinois University. The class offers educational instruction and material to offenders within 1 year of release who aspire to start their own business. This program assists offenders with applying for loans from lending agencies, interview exposure, filing for permits, grants and licenses. The facility continues to flourish with Rapid Results projects such as the decreasing paper usage by eliminating unnecessary or duplicate reports, combining inventory and supervisor logbooks. Most notable for FY19 was the implementation of bulk juice in the offender Dietary which will save the facility over $22,000 a year. This program was shared with Operations and will hopefully be implemented statewide for an even greater savings. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report52 The gardening project was expanded to 30,000 square feet in FY19. The garden provided a variety of fresh fruits, herbs and vegetables for offenders, staff and donations to area churches, community centers and food pantries. Hill Correctional Center donated more than 10,000 pounds of produce and 3,000 ears of corn. All the items needed for the facility garden were contributed by IDOC facilities, Hill staff members and a local nursery. The facility continues to distribute the \"Hill Happenings\" newsletter which highlights and celebrates the facility staff and the good things they do both at work and within the community.

The program began with 15 students who are scheduled to complete in the summer of 2020. The course is a 10-month program which will provide the gentlemen with the skills and experience necessary to gain employment as an automotive mechanic and/or continued education in the automotive technology field. Overall, this year for Lake Land College was a success. General/Law Library facilitated offender patrons with notary signatures, legal copies, Electronic E-filing to the Central and Southern courts, on-site segregation requests, Key Cites and case law requests. The following programs were offered and conducted by Clinical Services staff in FY19: Thinking for a Change, Start Now, Lifestyle Redirection, TRAC 1 (Trained Reformed and Capable), Substance Abuse Education, Anger Management, Inside Out Dads, Dave Ramsey's Financial Management Course, Hot Topics, Parole School, Substance Abuse Intervention, Etiquette, Man to Man Mentorship, Employee Readiness and Aunt Mary's Storybook Program, finished the GRI (Graduated Reentry Initiative) program.

Special meals are provided to offenders during special events, holidays and religious observances. Adapted menus are also offered for observances such as Black History Month and Hispanic Heritage Month. Correctional Industries at Hill played an instrumental role in the move for all IDOC dietary departments to convert to a soy free menu which will save money on production and reduce lawsuits filed against the department. Hill ICI supplies milk, juice Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report53 and meat products for the state. The \"Go Green\" initiative continues to be a high priority; ICI and Hill recycled cardboard, tin, pallets, drums and waste oil earning $15,714 revenue dollars in FY19.

Staff members from Hill participate in numerous charitable events to raise money for Special Olympics Illinois, the American Cancer Society, Suicide Prevention, St. Jude, and the YMCA Solutions Program which serves local at-risk youth by teaching positive values. ILLINOIS RIVER CORRECTIONAL CENTER Illinois River Correctional Center has operated efficiently throughout the 2019 Calendar year, minimalizing major incidents with attention to safety and security of the institution. Sanitation and maintenance of the facility remains a focal point of daily operations, resulting in the facility being presented as clean and well-organized. Staff members have been utilized as Correctional Trainee Screeners and Facility Auditors, as well as serving in Statewide and Regional capacities in the areas of NeMat, Investigations and Intelligence, Special Operations TRT and providing training in those areas at Concordia Court or regional settings. Illinois River's tactical staff has also assisted on several Tactical Team callouts throughout the year. In December 2018, the R6 Building was transformed into a Max Seg Unit with the capability of housing 50 offenders. Clinical Programs are offered to these offenders on a regular basis. Clinical Services also started a new Re-Entry Program to combat recidivism. The facility hosted its first graduation on October 2, 2019. Employee morale has increased throughout the year with a notable display of willingness of employees to assist fellow staff members in need. The Illinois River Correctional Center Health Care Unit was once again recognized by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, upon recommendation of its Accreditation and Standards Committee, to have met all the requirements of accreditation under NCCHC's for Health Services. A Heath Care Unit was established in the R6 Max Seg wing for treatment of Max Seg patients. The facility health care unit maintains a full infirmary with high acuity and maintain operational crisis level staffing. The future health care unit goals include implementing a hospice program, increasing maintaining staffing levels, increasing staff education with frequent in-services and improving teamwork and morale. In December of 2018, the staff at Illinois River Correctional Center opened a new housing unit for Max Segregation offenders. At that time, a level-up program was created and implemented. This program was designed to prevent ongoing negative behavior from offenders while housed in segregation, along with preventing staff assigned from being overwhelmed with responding to the behavioral issues. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report54 All staff assigned to the unit are involved in the overall planning and fundamental concepts of the incentive-based level system. The overall goal is to motivate and reinforce positive behavior, to reduce the amount of time offenders spend in segregation, to prevent mental decompensation and to successfully transition offenders from segregation to general population. The staff at Illinois River have created a level system with four levels, (three, two, one and C Wing; which is considered the honor wing). This program provides the offenders the opportunity to enhance and demonstrate their readiness to return to general population and/ or community through their increased participation in programming and their decreased number of disciplinary tickets. Although this seemed to work for a small percentage of offenders, we discovered that it was not enough to motivate all. Some valuable lessons have been learned while implementing this program. One was that we seem to expect the offenders to demonstrate positive behavior and we try to use that as a factor in deciding whether they progress through the level system and whether they are ready to return to general population; however, we did not have a mechanism in place to track and document positive behavior. We were still lacking in setting clear behavioral expectations that could be recognized and affirmed. In September 2019, the team introduced a new program in addition to the level-up system. R6 Motivational Incentive Points Program (MIP)The MIP program is two-part; the first part is done with the offender's willingness to come to class. The class roster has six expectations that will never change; it is consistent regardless of who is instructing. The offenders can earn up to six points per class. Once the offender has earned a set number of points, they can redeem the points toward a seg cut or C grade cut. The second part includes the Behavior Rubrik which is a list of expectations along with positive and negative behaviors that will allow the offender to earn additional points. These points are tangible, and the offender will be responsible for keeping track of them himself. He will be allowed to collect these points and use them to redeem an incentive (extra yard, a radio for 30 days, extra tray of food). This section of the program focuses very heavily on redirecting negative behavior and placing responsibility on the offender to initiate his own positive change. Offenders will have status hearings, so they are aware of how they are progressing through the program. The final step in this program is the Consequence Ladder which clearly defines the consequences that will happen if the offender chooses to use negative behavior. We are far from perfection, but we are very proud of the team's effort to keep striving toward positive change. Class participation is at an all-time high. We are experiencing more pro- social behavior as well as an overall change in mind-set. This program has given staff Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report55 a positive way of managing and reinforcing behaviors in a way that is engaging and meaningful. Illinois River Re-Entry Program-Phase I Illinois River's Re-Entry participants have successfully completed Phase 1 of the four-phase program. This initiative was handed down to Illinois River to focus on the offenders at the greatest risk for recidivism. For the first phase, offender mentors were required to have a staff recommendation, complete an application and if selected for interview, were given a scored interview. The highest scoring offenders were then chosen to go through the training to be certified as mentors. Once certified, these mentors then went on to provide participating offenders with peer-led programming to include Anger Management, Conflict Resolution, Criminal Thinking, Mindfulness, Change & Success, Effective Communication, Relationship Skills, Self-Management, Leadership Skills and Life Skills. Offenders will move on to Phase 2 and attend staff led Cognitive Behavioral Change programs to include, Building Change, Start Now, Inside Out Dads, Drug Awareness, and Drug Education. Phase three will focus on vocational programming and skill building. Phase 4 is reconnecting to community in preparation for Mandatory Supervised Release. Leisure Time ServicesThe Leisure Time Services (LTS) department at Illinois River Correctional Center had a busy fiscal year.

The facility has raised more than $20,000 this past year for Special Olympics and was recognized as the top fundraising facility for all of IDOC. The Business Office worked to dispose of stored documents that have been stored well past the required record retention guidelines. This effort created valuable space in the warehouse and improved cleanliness while reducing fire hazards. The dry storage space was increased by 40 slots in the warehouse after sending out 18 skids of paper recycling and 22 skids of electronics. This space allowed the facility to rotate dry storage stock, decreasing loss due to products timing out. The clothing department found a way to recycle old pillows and mattresses saving the Department approximately $4,200. Mattresses are recycled by taking two old mattresses and combining them into one with a new cover. The old mattresses that cannot be used for mattress recycling have been cut into four pieces and made into pillows. The clothing closet continues to be utilized by offenders through donations from multiple organizations. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report86 The Dietary Department continued to get trucks from \"Woody\" at Hands of Hope. With the trucks from Hands of Hope, the facility was able to save $21,142. The facility garden that Lake Land Horticulture students assisted with accounted for $4,039.99 in food savings. The facility was able to make several donations of vegetables, cucumbers, and tomatoes to the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy.

There was an increase in staffing which resulted in an increase in overall performance in the areas of mental health, nursing, and the medical clinics. This has improved the timeliness of offenders being seen and the implementation of group therapy. This included the facility adding a group room for offenders in restrictive housing. The clinic nurse has shown outstanding commitment in setting up educational clinics and classes with offenders. Her dedication and accuracy in reporting has made a significant improvement in the facility's clinic backlog. The previous two years this was an external audit finding for the facility and now there is no longer a backlog. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report87 The maintenance department, in coordination with GTL, pulled fiber and installed video visitation units and messaging kiosks on every housing unit wing, including Health Care. This also included the installation of kiosks in the Library for offenders to research law cases and access legal documents. Another project was replacing the facility's exterior and interior lighting with LED lighting, which has become antiquated and labor intensive. The lighting is in constant need of repair and/or replacement. The degradation of the lighting has led to a decrease in visibility which hampers the safety and security of the facility. In addition to increasing visibility, the project resulted in a cost savings for the facility this past fiscal year of $59,702. The LED lighting was acquired through a grant program, which resulted in no additional cost to the facility. Clinical Services continues to improve its programming choices for offenders by offering an increased number of behavior modification classes.

North Lawndale Adult Transition Center The North Lawndale Adult Transition Center is a 200-bed facility. The facility was completed in the spring of 2000 and celebrated its official opening that summer. It now houses 200 incarcerated men and confirms the Safer Foundation's belief in the value of providing transition support to individuals with a criminal record in their own community with the support of that community prior to release. North Lawndale allows selected participants the opportunity to transition to community and employment prior to release in order to improve the likelihood that upon release, they will become productive, law-abiding members of the community. All residents receive financial management skills and are encouraged to engage in pro-social interactions with their peers and families. This increases their chance for post-release success. This year in order to enhance it's reentry services, North Lawndale ATC has engaged in an evidence based practice (EBP) assessessment to evaluate and refine the way the facility does business. The major changes being focused on this fiscal year are based on three key areas:Enhancing Service Model Upgrading Client Service TechnologyEmpowering staff These changes will enable North Lawndale ATC to better serve residents and deepen its impact.Over the past year, evidence based practices (EBP) has been used to analyze and rebuild a number of Safer Foundation processes and procedures resulting in an enhanced operating model. The major changes feature exciting initiatives like rapid employment for residents, providing tailored services via peronalized goal setting and career planning, and weighed assessments to connect residents to the right services and the right employment opportunity. A new initiative is moving to new technology systems that will improve operational efficiency. Salesforce is a cloud based tool that is assessible 24/7. It will enable the facility to create a customized case management system allowing staff to drive efficiency and productivity. Utilizing this system, staff will be able to spend more time servicing the residents, reports and dashboards can be built in real time, staff will have a clearer and more complete view of their resident's progress.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report91 In addition to Salesforce with its focus on case nanagement, in an effort to reduce paper and enhance resident accountability, North Lawndale ATC has moved to SecurManage.

Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report92 Parole The Parole Division aims to promote public safety through offender supervision utilizing reentry resources and community partnerships and graduated sanctions. The Parole Division continues to shift emphasis on building case management capacity related to increased use of the sanction matrix by examining gaps in service and areas where additional resources are needed. The needs of returning offenders have been incorporated into focusing on housing options for offenders with mental health issues, options for those seeking employment opportunities and establishing networks to ensure offenders have the medical care they need to remain healthy. This division is dedicated to identifying offenders with compliance issues and target supervision and resources to those with a high risk to return to IDOC. Day Reporting Centers IDOC utilizes Day Reporting Centers (DRC) that serve as resource centers and re-entry hubs for persons under parole supervision in high-impact regions throughout the state. The DRC focuses on offenders who are vulnerable to drugs, crime, gangs, violence, unemployment, poverty and family dissolution. These centers include a highly structured program that offers an alternative sanction for non-violent parole violators. The agency's parole efforts also support the Sheridan Drug Prison and the Reentry Program at Sheridan Correctional Center as well as the Substance Abuse Treatment and Reentry Program at Southwestern Illinois Correctional Center. These are two prison-based therapeutic communities dedicated to providing drug treatment and re-entry services for drug related offenses. Violence Reduction Collaborations The Parole Division continues to be an active partner with the City of Chicago's Violence Reduction Strategy (VRS). In cooperation with the Chicago Police Department, the Parole Division joins members from the local community, the U.S. Attorney's Office, Cook County State's Attorney Office, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and numerous other agencies in key police districts throughout the Chicago area to combat violence in partnership. Gang members in these areas are targeted and called in to a meeting with all partners present. At these meetings, offenders are put on notice to stop the violence in the community. Gangs are informed that future homicides or shooting incidents that can be tied to a particular gang faction will result in a response from the entire partnership and gang affiliates and networks will be targeted by law enforcement actions. IDOC also spearheads individual and large-scale compliance checks on parolees throughout the state. Compliance checks involve searching host sites, drug testing and addressing general compliance issues as well as the needs of the offender. Criminal charges are pursued for all parolees who possess firearms or ammunition.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report93 Parole Reentry Group The mission of the Parole Reentry Group (PRG) is to aid in the reduction of offender recidivism and to foster public safety. The PRG is within the Parole Division and is fully dedicated to housing and re-entry. The PRG develops, monitors and coordinates community resources and provides supportive services necessary to enhance an offender's successful reentry back into the community to become crime free law-abiding members of society. Sex Offender Supervision Unit In order to ensure continuity of supervision and maintain contact standards, the Parole Division trained additional staff in specialized sex offender supervision courses. Close supervision of sex offenders requires the application of enhanced tracking systems and specialized agent training as well as unique surveillance and monitoring techniques. The Sex Offender Supervision Unit has smaller caseloads and provides closer supervision and more frequent surveillance. In addition to traditional surveillance, offenders are monitored electronically through radio frequency or GPS systems; most offenders are prohibited from possessing electronics that can access the Internet and social media. Sex offenders are also subject to intense scrutiny in terms of locations where they can work and reside and are also prohibited from participating in events that attract children. One example of unique supervision conditions and surveillance opportunities related to sex offenders is through Operation Safe Spirits. The operation is designed to make contact and check all paroled sex offenders on Halloween night, and in some cases, the days leading up to or following Halloween. Because the rules of release prohibit sex offenders from participating in Halloween activities, the offenders are not allowed to have their porch lights on, are not allowed to pass out candy to trick-or- treaters and are not allowed to dress up in costume. In addition, local police departments and sheriff offices assist with this operation by providing backup for house checks and providing shelter for offenders who are removed from communities during trick-or-treat times.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report94 Offense Class Number % Murder 21.7% Violation 5,334 13.6% Sexual Assualt / Rape 4,811 12.2% Assault / / Force / Harm

ED.) 39,306 40,032 1Historical intra-institution comparisons are affected by how the functional use of the institution has changed over time (i.e., security level is different, population may have housed juveniles or a different gender, primary role of the facility regarding program ser vices has been altered, etc.) 2Expenditures among satellite facilities cannot be extracted from parent facilities as administrative, dietary, medical, staffing, service costs, etc. are shared. Also, the expenditures here only include correctional facilities; some expenditures such as parole, general office, and shared services, etc. are not included. The FY18 GRF total expenditures for the Department of Corrections were $1,163,003,607.85. 3Per capita costs are calculated as expenditures divided by average daily population (ADP). For the same reasons listed in footnote #1, the historical intra- and inter-institution comparisons are affected. Further, per capita costs are a function of economies of scale which further limits an objective comparison between correctional sites; especially higher security level sites or sites with a small number of inma tes. 4Elgin Treatment Center is a mental health inpatient treatment facility that opened on April 2, 2018; it's parent facility is Joliet Treatment Center. 5Joliet Treatment Center is a multi-disciplinary treatment facility that opened on October 6, 2017. 6Murphysboro Life Skills Re-Entry Center opened on April 16, 2018; it's parent facility is Pinckneyville Correctional Center.Facility CharacteristicsIllinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report102 Number of Correctional Facilities on June 30, 2019 by Type Correctional Facilities Number Correctional Centers (excludes ATC, IIP , Reentry & Mental Health 25 Reception and Classification Centers 4 Medium Security Units 8 Minimum Security Units 13 Multi-Level Security Units 5 Work Camps 4 Impact Incarceration Programs (IIP) 2 Life Skills reentry Centers 2 Mental Health Treatment Centers 2 Adult Transition Centers 4 Prison Population on June 30, 2019 Type of Sentence Number Determinate Day-for-Day 23,396 Determinate Truth-in-Sentencing 13,960 Impact Incarceration Program 55 Sexually Dangerous Persons 168 Life without Parole 1,629 Life with Parole 6 Death 0 Indeterminate 92 Total 39,306 Prison Population on June 30, 2019 End-of-Fiscal Year Population 39,306 FY19 Average Daily Prison Population Average Daily Population 40,032 Fiscal Year 2019 Admissions Type of Admission Number % Direct from Court or Discharged and Recommitted 14,346 64.2% New 22,363 100.0% Fiscal Year 2019 Exits Total Exits 23,977 Average Length of Stay (in years) Prison Stay Including Jail Court Admissions 1.9 2.8 New Sentence Violators 2.2 2.9 Technical Violators 0.6 3.9 Total 1.5 3.1Statistics for FY19Illinois Department of Corrections | FY19 Annual Report103 Average Time (in Days) Awarded per Exit Days Supplemental Sentence Credit* 0.3 Earned Discretionary Sentence Credit* Program Sentence Credit** 5.4 Earned Program Sentence Credit**GED 0.2 Pre-trial Sentence Credit 0.3 Total 6.2 Parole Population on June 30, 2019 End-of-Fiscal Year Population 26,649 FY19 Average Daily Parole Population Average Daily Population 23,122 *Per statute 730ILCS 5/3-6-3) enacted on January 1, 2018 Supplemental Sentence Credit (SSC) changed to Earned Discretionary Sentence Credit (EDSC).
