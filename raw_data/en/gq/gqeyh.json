The benefits of meditation take many forms in its subtlety and extend into many areas of your life. Experts agree on the following benefits to meditation: - Stress reduction. The benefits of meditation because it reduces stress are huge! I would go as far to say that this is the primary benefit of meditating. It reaches into all areas of life. Meditation helps us notice and appreciate the small things, like a butterfly fluttering by, the colorful trees in fall, or a subtle smile. These mindful traits adds quality to our lives and help harmful stress fall away. - Reduces anxiety and depression. Through meditating, we learn how to read our emotions and notice the thoughts in our minds. The attention we give to what's going on inside helps us connect with ourselves and others. By understanding and adapting to what we might need for self-care, boundaries and/ or change, we can improve our quality of life. - Improves our sense of calm and joy. When we are children, we breathe better, laugh louder and longer, and connect easier. The days last longer because we notice each moment in joy and appreciation. Meditation helps us remember these simple feelings of innocent wonder. Thus, it improves our ability to see and seek out joy in our daily lives. Other benefits include: improved brain function and memory, normalized blood pressure, improved concentration, and reduced aging. Final Thoughts Meditation is not complex at all - it's a practice anyone can do. It creates a shift in mindset, and allows you to take a step back from your emotions. You'll learn to see thoughts and feelings as they are - without acting upon them. It's hard to describe though. You almost have to experience it for yourself to truly grasp it. In essence, meditation is a tool which you use to reconnect to yourself, to help you feel better in your day to day life. Meditation is good for the soul, well-being and overall health. Taking the time to practice meditating means that we can draw upon the skills learned, when we need it the most. Being able to focus within, breathe deeply, and stay calm in stressful moments are just a few examples. Using essential oils for meditation adds an extra layer of health benefits to your daily practice.
