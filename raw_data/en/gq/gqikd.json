The cause of autism are complex and it is unlikely that there is a single cause, but rather a set of triggers involving biological/medical, psychological and behavioral factors. There appears to be a genetic link.

Causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder No one knows exactly what causes Autism spectrum disorder, but scientists think that both genetic and environmental factors might play a role. While autism was once erroneously believed to arise from stresses in a child's psychological environment, modern medical evidence suggests that irregularities in the development of the brain and central nervous system give rise to the syndrome of autism. Causes of this development are diverse and may include chemical exposure, viral and genetic factors. Many other factors are considered important. In regressive autism (child develops normally till about 1.5 year age and then regresses, loses speech and eye contact), role of MMR vaccination is highly debated. There have been cases where courts have awarded compensation for vaccine injury in autism cases. Metabolic disorders are also considered important in some cases. For eg, many cases with autism are known to have problems with copper metabolism. Food allergies also play an important role. Many autism patients improve on a gluten free diet or casein free diet. This has given rise to the notion that autism may be related to food allergies. Epigenetics. There is an increasing amount of research that the autistic changes may be precepitated due to epigenetic changes, induced either by physical, mental, chemical (exposure to pesticides, preservatives, food colours, pollutants etc), biological (infections) or nutritional stress (deficiency) during pregnancy or vaccination after that. Since autism is a 'syndrome', different causes may be applicable in different cases.
