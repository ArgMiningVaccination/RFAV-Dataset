[Learn 4 essential strategies to surpass monumental campaign goals ](/research/philanthropy-leadership-council/resources/posters/2017/surpass-monumental-campaign-goals) For the study, researchers focused on the largest four crowdfunding sites that allowed medical crowdfunding: The researchers then searched for terms related to five previously selected treatments determined to be unproven and potentially dangerous: Overall, the researchers identified 1,059 campaigns that raised money for the five unproven and potentially dangerous treatments. The overwhelming majority of campaigns in the study\u201498%\u2014were hosted on GoFundMe. In total, the campaigns aimed to collect over $27 million. However, they raised roughly $6.78 million\u2014 about 25% of that goal.

Valorie Crooks, a health geographer at Simon Fraser University, said that this type of crowdfunding \"is facilitating the normalization of experimental therapies.\" Heidi Hagberg, a spokesperson for GoFundMe, said the company \"always encourage[s] people to fully research whatever it is they are raising money for and to be absolutely transparent on their GoFundMe page, so donors can make an informed decision on what they're donating to.\" She added that it is \"up to the GoFundMe community to decide which campaigns to\" (Thielking, 10/23).
