Alternative Dentistry Holistic Therapy (Yoga) Accupuncture Homeopathy Herbal Therapy Traditional Ethnic System Yoga for Dental Care The practice of yoga in the Indian subcontinent was documented as early as 3000 BC.The word 'yoga' is derived from 0051 Advances in Dentistry & Oral Health How to cite this article: Rohma S, Yogesh G, Kamal G, Akriti D, Sakshi S . Application of Alternative Medicine in Dentistry: An Overview. Adv & Oral Health. 2018; 9(1): 555754. DOI: 10.19080/ADOH.2018.09.55575 4Sanskrit word yuz, which is often interpreted as meaning 'to unite'. Yoga focuses on body, breathing and mind. This is accomplished by Asanas (exercise postures), pranayama (breathing techniques) and meditation. Yoga prevents the impairment of cellular immunity seen in stress. Yoga involves mind body relaxation techniques and cushions the changes related to stress. Since yoga involves mind body relaxation techniques (pranayama and meditation) along with mild to moderate physical exercise (Asanas), yoga may optimize the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines [2,5]. Yoga a) Sirhasana helps in stimulates the blood flow to pituitary gland for strengthen the bones and teeth to prevent periodontal problems. b) Shitali & Shitkar Pranayama in these teeth is occluded during breathing to intermittent force on teeth and correction of alignment of teeth. c) Sarvangasana helps in stimulate the thyroid gland to increase the blood circulation in the mouth for prevention of dental disorders. d) Bhujangasana posture is so therapeutic for practicing dental surgeons, as it tones up the whole spine. Thus, yoga is helpful in prevention of dental diseases and maintenance of good oral hygiene. Accupuncture: Is many years old Chinese way of treatment in which needles are inserted in specific areas of the body. Several studies have been conducted which shows that acupuncture can help in reducing postoperative pain and anxiety. Other dental conditions in which accupuncture can be of use are Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and Xerostomia. Also offers alternative treatment options in dentistry. Some of the conditions in which it is found to be effective are Tooth Pain, Gingivitis, Dry Socket, Halitosis, Dental Trauma, Abscess, and Mouth Ulcers Etc. Herbal Therapy: Many plants/ herbs have the ability to provide anti-inflammatory, analgesic effect. E.g. Herbs like Echinacea, Aloe vera, Chamomile, Peppermint, Eucalyptus etc. They can provide relief in pain and canker sores.Traditional Ethnic System: An effective all natural solution for dental health comes in the form of an ancient ayurvedic practice called OIL-PULLING. It may sound strange but it can in fact become a very therapeutic, meditative practice. The idea is that the toxins are drawn out into the oil providing a deep cleaning and general detox. The practice can be performed as the usual oral hygiene routine [1,6]. Limitations It is usually based on religion, tradition, belief in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, and errors in reasoning. It typically lacks any scientific validation, and their effectiveness is either unproved or disproved. Treatments are not part of the conventional or science-based healthcare system. Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed. Might show some side effects when combined with conventional treatments. Treatments are of long duration [5]. Conclusion Although there are lot of benefits and significance in healthcare, Alternative Medicine cannot be substituted completely for a conventional scientific procedures and treatments. Nonetheless, it can always be used as an adjunct to conventional medical procedures. References 1. Sobel DS (2000) The Cost-effectiveness of Mind-body Medicine Inter - ventions.
