UNC-Chapel Hill leaders [announced Monday](https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/2021/10/25/covid-19-update-federal-vaccine-requirement-for-employees/) a vaccine requirement for University employees following guidance issued by the [Safe Federal Workers Task Force](https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Draft%20contractor%20guidance%20doc_20210922.pdf) related to [President Biden's Executive Order 14042](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/). The University receives $160 million in federal contract funding, and federal contractors are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no later than Dec. 8. The federal vaccine requirement applies to all employees who are working on or in connection with a federal contract or who work in the same location as employees working on a federal contract. The requirement applies to full-time, part-time and temporary employees, as well as those working remotely or under flexible work arrangements. Postdoctoral scholars and graduate assistants are also subject to the requirement. Subject to further federal guidance, however, the federal vaccine requirement does not apply broadly to all categories of student workers. At this time, 92.6% of School of Medicine employees are vaccinated. \"Our collective goal in the School of Medicine has been and will continue to be to protect the health and safety of our faculty, staff, students and patients,\" UNC School of Medicine Dean Wesley Burks, MD, said. \"Getting as many people as possible vaccinated is the best way to achieve that goal and to protect the health and safety of our community. We will continue to share details about this vaccination requirement in the coming days and weeks.\" Vaccination Deadlines Under federal guidance, individuals are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after completing either a second dose in a two-dose series or one dose of a single-dose vaccine. To be fully vaccinated by the Dec. 8 federal deadline, employees should complete their vaccination according to the following schedules: - For Moderna, you should receive your first dose by Oct. 27 and your second dose by Nov. 24. - For Pfizer, you should receive your first dose by Nov. 3 and your second dose by Nov. 24. - For Johnson & Johnson you should receive one dose by Nov. 24. Employee Resources The COVID-19 vaccine is free and readily available in our community. Faculty and staff can receive the vaccine at the [Campus Health Pharmacy in the Student Stores,](https://covidvax.unc.edu/) in central campus. Appointments are preferred but walk-ins are welcome. In addition, the [Carolina Together website](https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/unc-chapel-hill-covid-19-vaccine/) has information about [vaccine sites](https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/unc-chapel-hill-covid-19-vaccine/) statewide, including UNC Health locations. University policy allows employees up to eight hours in one day paid work time for vaccinations occurring within regular work hours, with their supervisor's permission. Employees are also entitled to paid leave for adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations on the day or the day after the vaccine is received.
