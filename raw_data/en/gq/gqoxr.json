Q. National Prescribing Service (NPS) data show that in Australia, the proportion of cases where bacterial infections have been found to be resistant to antibiotics has jumped from 10 per cent in 2000 to 25 per cent in 2010. Do you agree that bacteria resistant antibiotics are increasing across the country? A. Basically, the more you use antibiotics, the higher the risk that you are going to have antibiotic resistant bacteria, and one of the problems is that we use antibiotics too liberally and they are often prescribed when people don't need them because it's a viral infection, which antibiotics are not active against - it's only bacteria that they are active against. So, if a person has a viral infection like a cold, or influenza, or something like that, and are given an antibiotic, the antibiotic is not going to affect the virus which is causing the disease, but it does encourage bacteria that are resistant to become established. And also, we use antibiotics too widely. We need to use them effectively, very precisely when they are needed, and this may mean that we might need to do more pathological testing where we need samples and actually test them before we prescribe an antibiotic. Is it possible that a person may become resistant just to one type of antibiotic - the antibiotic that they took the most? It's not the person that becomes resistant, it's the bacteria. But yes, of course it is. The bacteria would become resistant to that specific antibiotic more than others, and there are antibiotics to which they don't become resistant to as readily. NPS warns that by 2030, there may not be effective treatments for illnesses ranging from tonsillitis to pneumonia. What do you think? I do agree that eventually there will be bacteria which are resistant to all current antibiotics. We are not far from that scenario. There are already bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics. So when an antibiotic is no longer effective in treating an infection, what can doctors do? Do they try different antibiotics? They isolate the bacteria and they test it in the laboratory to find which antibiotics can be used. These may not be the most effective antibiotics but they are the only ones that they can use and they have to use that. Also, if we stop taking antibiotics as directed, we allow the more resistant bacteria to grow up and multiply. Why is that? When you have been given a prescription you need to finish the course as prescribed by the doctor to make sure that you kill all the bacteria that are causing an infection, so you should always finish the prescribed antibiotic. NPS data show there's already bacteria-resistant antibiotics in some Australian communities. Are aware of any of them? Oh yes. We have actually done quite a bit of work on that, and we have found that there's antibiotic resistant bacteria in some communities. Our group was one of the leading groups in the world to demonstrate that they do occur in communities, and one of the things we would like to do is to get funding and go out there to see what has been happening since we did that initial work. So that we know what's happening in communities that are not regularly in touch with a hospital system. Initially antibiotic resistant bacteria were regarded as being in hospitals and weren't a problem for communities. We now see antibiotic resistant bacteria out there in the community and that's a real concern. So is there a concern that we may not be able to treat some diseases in any way? The more we use antibiotics, the more we become susceptible to these strains of bacteria becoming resistant. There's no two ways about it. What's important is that we use antibiotics very judiciously and carefully so that we don't use them unnecessarily just to please a patient that wants to go out with a script for something. It may mean that it may be a bit more expensive and we need to do laboratory testing. It's quite a worrying scenario... It's quite a worrying scenario... Unfortunately there has been too much compliance about it over the years. Many years ago I gave a talk about antibiotic resistance at one of the big hospitals in Perth and someone said to me after my talk, 'if this is a real problem, why are we not seeing the problem?' He doesn't say that anymore. Thirty years later he realises that it's a problem. When antibiotics don't work anymore, is there any other cure for diseases like infections and so on? The other thing is whether we could make a vaccine against all these bacteria. Some of the bacteria that we deal with, we don't have vaccines for. In the future we could be making vaccines for bacteria like the ones that cause Diphtheria and tetanus, but at the moment we can't do that yet. "}
