Miller, MD, MA Hartford, Connecticut Background. Practicing family physicians often find family systems theory and the biopsvchosocial model attractive, but have difficulties applying them in a busy office practice. Methods. Two family physicians in a four-person group practice were identified as \"exemplars\" at managing daily office practice. A collaborative, qualitative methodology was used to explore their strategy. A series o f scmistruc- tured key informant interviews with the two physicians and the head nurse identified themes later clarified us\u00ad ing ethnosciencc interviewing techniques. The resultant clinical encounter typology and decision-making taxon\u00ad omy were evaluated using participant observation and key informant review. The final results were compared with the literature on physician-patient relationships. Results. Three clinical encounter types were identified. \"Routines\" were simple, single, and brief visits inwhich a contractual stvie and the biomedical model were used. \"Ceremonies\" were linked rituals that in\u00ad voked a covcnantal stv ie. \"Dramas\" were a series o f vis\u00ad its concerning situations o f conflict and emotion and included psychosocial problems. The family was often convened for dramas. Determination o f the presenting concern, the trigger for coming, the patient request, the illness prototype, and the type of communication allowed recognition o f the clinical encounter type. Conclusions. Identifying a clinical encounter as a rou\u00ad tine, ceremony, or drama may help family physicians integrate family systems concepts into their busy office practices. These findings have numerous implications for future research, clinical practice, and teaching. Key words.

After completing family practice residency, a colleague and I joined a small eastern Pennsylvania town's only two family physicians and formed a four-person family prac\u00ad tice group that cared for 12,000 patients. We were en\u00ad ergized and eager to create a model o f family-oriented, biopsvchosocial primary health care. Hopes were high. We two younger physicians had a vision o f a new type of practice, while the two older physicians had experience, one with 20 and the other with 30 years o f solo practice. One year into practice, my visionary music became discordant because o f three dissonant sounds. I struggled to maintain a high-volume rhythm, but I kept slipping into a web o f complexity, ambiguity, and family intrigue. A second dissonance was the unnerving frequency with which I found myself being paternalistic; I felt guilty and yet sensed that sometimes being paternalistic just might Submitted revised, October 1, 1991.

The third cause o f dissonance was the patients who bristled with resistance whenever I tried to implement my understanding o f the biopsycho- social model. Meanwhile, the two older family physicians were enjoying the group practice. They were embracing many o f the new ideas contributed by my younger col\u00ad league and myself, yet maintaining a high-volume pace, being no more paternalistic, and encountering less resis\u00ad tance than I was. I was frustrated and perplexed. At a monthly practice meeting I asked, \"How can this be?\" Following a brief exchange o f questions and clarifica\u00ad tions, one o f the older physicians suddenly blurted, \"You mean you always think family? That will never work. You can only be superdoc some o f the time.\" I refined my original question \"How can this be?\" into a research question: \"How do the two older family physicians or\u00ad ganize and manage their dailv clinical encounters so that they can anticipate 'surprise' and 'difficult' encounters, know which physician-patient relationship style to use, and know when to be family-oriented?\" Arising from the dilemmas and conflicts created by moving from the idc- The Journal o f Family Practice, Vol. 34 , No. 3, 1992 2 8 9 Clinical EncountersM iller alizcd expectations o f residency to the realities o f private practice, this question led to the design and implemen\u00ad tation o f an exploratory field study. This article is a report o f what I learned about the different kinds or types o f clinical encounters recognized by the two older family physicians. The distinguishing features o f each type are characterized, and the process by which each type was identified is delineated. In summary, both a clinical encounter typology and its associated decision-making tree or taxonomy are presented. Methods The goal o f the research was to reach a collaborative understanding o f the two older, more experienced family physicians' perceptual scheme for the clinical encounter.1 The research objectives were to identify what was per\u00ad ceived as important, to describe what was going on, and to explore what possible patterns existed with the hope o f discovering an implementablc typology or decision-mak\u00ad ing taxonomy or both. It was anticipated that the con\u00ad cepts discovered would have relevance and transferabil\u00ad ity, with contextual modifications, to other primary' care sites. There was no intent to generalize to a population beyond the immediate study site. Given these goals and objectives, qualitative or field methods rooted in natural\u00ad istic (constructivist) inquiry2 as a guiding paradigm were selected as the most appropriate research framework. The overall research design was sequential in struc\u00ad ture and iterative in process. Scmistructurcd key infor\u00ad mant interviews o f the two older family physicians were the predominant initial mode o f inquiry.3 These in-depth discussions were designed to elicit and identify the con\u00ad cepts and factors used by the two physicians in organiz\u00ad ing and managing their patient encounters. The follow\u00ad ing three open-ended questions, which were derived directly from the research question, were asked: (1) how do you think about (plan, organize) your day in the office? (2) how do you know what is going to happen in a given patient encounter? and (3) when do you \"think family\"? Analysis o f the information obtained during these first interviews indicated that both physicians were scan\u00ad ning their patient schedules each morning and noting where they anticipated \"problems\" or \"bottlenecks\" and where they expected \"smooth sailing\" and \"breathing room\" for making telephone calls, seeing emergency call-in patients, or catching up on paperwork. This in\u00ad formation was then shared by the physicians with the head nurse, who had the responsibility o f screening all telephone calls and deciding who saw which call-in pa\u00ad tients and when. The analysis also revealed that the twoolder family physicians distinguished between types of visits, types o f patients, and ty pes o f problems. The next cycle o f key informant interviews included the head nurse and focused on eliciting the attributes that characterized the various types of visits, patients, and problems. An cthnoscicncc-typc interview strategy'4-5 was used since the aim was to establish the informants tax\u00ad onomies. Category questions (eg, contrast questions is the difference between visits that arc 'schedule- busters' and those that are 'always the same'?\"), and special incident questions (eg, \"Are there any exceptions to your rules about when to convene the family?\") pre\u00ad dominated in these interviews. Because I was a member o f the practice (an insider), I had continuous access to all o f the physicians and staff (actors) and could observe most o f the activities and encounters that took place. As a result, during the same time frame as the key informant interviews with my colleagues, a scries o f brief, informal, unstructured inter\u00ad views6 were conducted with the same two physicians and the head nurse. These \"conversations\" were cither planned or spontaneous. The planned interviews oc\u00ad curred in the morning and at noon when the two older family physicians reviewed their schedules. Category, contrast, and special incident questions (described above) were the major focus. The head nurse was asked similar questions throughout the day as she was making schedule decisions for call-in patients. The spontaneous questioning happened whenever one o f the two physi\u00ad cians and I were waiting together between patient visits. During these moments, the questions centered on the previous and upcoming clinical encounters. Because they were obtained closer to the time o f actual decision\u00ad making and collected over time, these data were a useful credibility' check on the information obtained from the key informant interviews and on my evolving under\u00ad standing. Several additional key informant interviews with the same persons were conducted as further under\u00ad standing o f the research question developed. All the data were recorded in the form o f field notes. The interviews were not taped. Most o f the field notes were jotted immediately following the interview. Prelim\u00ad inary' analysis occurred concurrent with data collection.7 I reviewed my field notes weekly, and any new analytic constructs or more refined questions were discussed at the next interview session. As a result, the developing understanding was both my own and that o f the research participants. We were not seeking the \"true\" or \"real\" wav to manage clinical encounters; we were searching for a pragmatic, jointly created way to make our family practice better. The styTe o f analysis I employed is often referred to as heuristic .8 2 9 0 The Journal o f Family Practice, Vol. 34, N o. 3, 1992 Clinical Encounters Miller The initial informant interviews occurred durintr the first 2 weeks o f the study period, and analysis o f these interview notes took 2 additional weeks. The next series o f key informant interviews and the concurrent unstruc\u00ad tured interviews were conducted over 3 months, after which an initial typology o f encounters and a related decision-making taxonomy were constructed. During the next phase o f the research, I imple\u00ad mented the typology and taxonomy. Over the next 4 months, as a self-reflective participant-observer (empha\u00ad sis on participant),9 I began to employ and modify the typology and taxonomy as I managed and organized my daily encounters. All modifications were reviewed with the three other research participants. At the end o f 4 months, I was experiencing fewer surprises, and I was anticipating more o f the difficult encounters. Conse\u00ad quently, family practice became fun again! The last phases o f this exploratory research were the literature review and the writing o f the manuscript. The literature review was delayed until after the field research was completed in an attempt to minimize theoretical bias during the discovert' phase o f the study. Results Clinical Encounter Typology O f the three types o f encounter, routine, drama, and ceremony, routine encounters were the most common. Ro u t i n e s Referred to as \"simple,\" \"easy,\" \"just another cold,\" or \"our bread and butter\" (Table 1), routine encounters were visits for relatively simple, single, straightforward \"body problems\" for which the physicians believed they had readily available solutions. What distinguished these encounters was the rapid use o f a presumed mutually acceptable biomedical protocol applied in prescriptive fashion to an everyday primary care problem; these clin\u00ad ical encounters involved the habitual performance o f an ordinary, established procedure. Examples o f routines included patients presenting with minor acute infections or minor trauma, uncomplicated requests for a driver's examination or insurance physical, or a need for reassur\u00ad ance that their mild cough was not the lung cancer that killed a close friend's father. Fortunately, for busy family physicians, routines arc the most common encounter. As a result o f this study, I learned to recognize routines for what they arc and to keep them simple.Table 1.

The head nurse, a college English literature major, revealed the label for these \"complicated\" encounters when she noted, \"You [referring to the two younger, less experienced family physicians] are always trying to make a drama out o f every visit.\" Dramas were those clinical encounters occurring over time and involving conflict(s) or intense emotion or both. Dramas were theatrical, as performance, setting, and audience were important characteristics. Dramas al\u00ad ways required multiple visits and flexibility and usually involved the family. Genograms were helpful; stories were told; and poetic license was in order. Examples encountered included the new diagnosis o f hypertension, the presentation o f chronic fatigue or chronic low back pain, and the evaluation o f temper tantrums in a family experiencing divorce. These situations required the clar\u00ad ification o f central themes and conflicts, all o f which built to a dramatic climax and ended, it was hoped, in a therapeutic denouement. Learning to recognize a drama The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 34, No. 3, 1992 291 Clinical Encounters Miller early helped reduce the \"by the way\" statements at the end o f visits and taught me the value o f multiple visits over time. I no longer needed to \"solve the problem\" during one encounter. Ce r e m o n i e s The first visit in a drama was often unplanned (by the physician) and scheduled as a brief visit. These opening scenes o f a drama were called \"schedule busters\" or \"hidden time bombs,\" and the physician's goal was to \"buy time\" and allow the drama to \"get started.\" The physicians claimed to accomplish this by following four steps. They suggested that (1) the patient must know that the physician believes him or her, (2) the phvsician must address what most frightens the patient, (3) the physician should \"for heaven's sake always put a stetho\u00ad scope on him,\" and (4) the physician should give the patient hope and something to do until the next visit. These encounters were usually quite ceremonial. A tran\u00ad sition ceremony was thus used when a new drama emerged in a brief visit. The purpose o f this ceremony was to provide a transitional explanation, to lessen anxiety, to begin reconnecting the patient to his or her \"family,\" and to protect the patient from further harm until a longer visit, often with family present, could be arranged. Another, also protocol-driven, category o f visits was referred to as \"always the same.\" \"Every visit with that patient is just like the one before and the one before that.\" These maintenance ceremonies occurred after a drama had been concluded and the achieved functional state was being maintained. This category had two vari\u00ad ations. Some o f these encounters were \"friendly.\" These patients had established chronic disease diagnoses and the physician was comfortable with the management plans. The physicians looked forward to these visits; they were opportunities for exchanging \"fish stories\" and \"town gossip.\" Other maintenance ceremonies, however, were seen as \"hopeless.\" These patients were often de\u00ad picted as \"exasperating\" and \"lonely.\" They also had chronic problems, but the physicians were often uncom\u00ad fortable with aspects o f the management, which some\u00ad times included vitamin B 1 2 injections or \"pain shots.\" Maintenance ceremonies were often simple and involved set clinical protocols such as prenatal and well-child vis\u00ad its. What distinguished them from routines was their repetitive, ceremonialized character. Both \"schedule busters\" (transition ceremonies) and \"always the same\" (maintenance ceremonies) encounters shared the quality o f having a prescribed, repetitive for\u00ad mat. It was to highlight this quality that both o f these encounters were labeled ceremonies. Ceremonies were those clinical encounters involving linked rituals or pat-Table 2.

The initial examination What is my \"gut feeling\"? Intuition Is the patient a \"straight talker\"? Communication style terned, repeated processes in time with prescribed formal behavior having reference to shared symbols and to be\u00ad liefs in mythical powers. Ceremonies were routines per\u00ad formed with elaborate pomp. The physician sometimes invoked the convenantal and parental image o f priest. Examples included the placebo use o f B 1 2 injections, the use o f a ritualized examination format, and repetitive 10-minute dialogues with a stable somatizing patient. When physicians used biomedically unproven treatments such as antibiotics for probable viral illness or anticholin\u00ad ergics for irritable bowel syndrome, ceremony was oc\u00ad curring. Ceremony posed the most ethical concerns. Ef\u00ad ficacious ceremony seemed to require shared cultural themes. Continuity of care allowed the sharing o f illness experience and thus sowed the breeding ground for efficacious ceremony. The Decision-making Taxonomy The physician-patient transaction type was usually deter\u00ad mined within the first 5 minutes o f a visit. The classifi\u00ad cation was based on answers to seven categories o f ques\u00ad tions. Eliciting the presenting concern, determining both \"why they are here now\" and \"what they want,\" match\u00ad ing this story to the initial examination (\"eyeballing them\"), realizing \"your gut feelings\" based on \"all those past times together,\" and recognizing \"how straight they talk\" were how the physicians claimed to make their decisions (Table 2). Seven reasons for coming to a physician were identi\u00ad fied by the physicians and are similar to those discussed by McWhinncy1 0 and Zola.1 1 The reasons identified were (1) (intolerable anxiety), (5) \"can't 292The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 34, No. 3, 1992 Clinical EncountersMiller cope\" (problem o f living), (6) \"they made me\" (sanction\u00ad ing), and (7) \"can't take it anymore,\" \"the pain, the pain\" (intolerable pain). The reason for coming was elicited bv asking why the patient came with the partieular present\u00ad ing concern at this time and \"What worries [or frightens] vou the most about [that]?\" Six patient requests is,\" \"a label\" (medical information), (4) \"what to advice), (5) \"bread and it\" (biomedical treatment), form\" fulfillment). These expecta\u00ad tions were identified by asking, \"What do vou hope I can do for that?\" or \"How can I help you?\" The first five of these patient requests are consistent with those proposed by Like and Zyzanski.1 2 While eliciting the patient's story, the physicians were \"eyeballing them,\" doing an initial examination. They were noting the patient's appearance, expressive\u00ad ness, and demeanor, and evaluating how closclv it fit the story being told. \"Gut feeling\" or intuition referred to the physician's sixth sense developed from past experiences with the patient (\"all those past times together\") both as a patient and as a fellow citizen in the community. (All physicians in this study lived near the office.) This sixth sense also derived from past experiences with other patients who shared similar characteristics with the patient o f immedi\u00ad ate concern. This intuition, often based on shared experi\u00ad ence, was the primary means by which the two older family physicians claimed to enact the biopsychosocial model. Finally, the physicians made a determination as to the patient's communication style. They simply wanted to know \"how straight the patient talks.\" In other words, is what the patient says what the patient means? This is similar to McWhinncv's distinction between direct and indirect communication.1 3 On the basis o f the easily obtained information discussed above, the type o f clinical encounter was de\u00ad termined. If the presenting concern was simple, single, and recent (within the last 2 weeks), and if the actual reason for coming was anything other than sick-role legitimation or a problem o f living, and if the patient's expectation was a \"label,\" \"what to do,\" \"completed form,\" or \"fix it,\" if all o f these parts o f the story' fit with the physician's initial examination and intuition, and if the patient was a \"straight talker,\" then the encounter was probably a routine. If, on the other hand, there was a new diagnosis of chronic disease, or there was no readily identifiable dis\u00ad ease, or the patient's visit was triggered by a problem o fliving or sick-role legitimation, or the patient's request was for psychosocial assistance, or if in the case o f any of the above, the examination or \"gut feeling\" did not match, or if the patient was not communicating directly, then the encounter was most likelv a drama. New dramas in a limited time slot were transition ceremonies. All other encounters, cspcciallv those with frequent attend- ers, were generally maintenance ceremonies. Two cases o f irritable bowel syndrome illustrate this decision-mak\u00ad ing taxononw. T w o Ca s e H i s t o r i e s A.G. was a 24-year-old, single, third-vear graduate stu\u00ad dent with known, well-controlled irritable bowel syn\u00ad drome who presented because o f her concern about 1 week o f persistent runnv diarrhea, nausea, and crampy abdominal pain. The symptoms were not relieved bv her usual treatments. She was \"scared\" that this might be an ulcer, w'as a \"straight talker,\" and \"gut feeling,\" based on past expe\u00ad rience with this patient, and a brief examination revealing a healthv-appearing, anxious young woman with normal vital signs and no weight change, w'crc consistent with her presenting issues. Her concerns were simple, single, and recent. This w'as a routine encounter, and the bio\u00ad medical model was invoked. Further brief history re\u00ad vealed a viral illness 2 weeks earlier that triggered her irritable bowel symptoms. A brief normal examination supported this diagnosis. Irritable bowel management was reviewed, and A.G. was reassured. Her symptoms diminished over the next w'cck. B.H. was a 33-year-old steel company executive who presented with a 3-month history o f early morning wa\u00ad ter)' diarrhea associated with nausea and crampy abdom\u00ad inal pain. He wanted to know what was on be\u00ad cause \"I can't cope\" and \"I can't take it examination revealed a depressed affect, a phys\u00ad ically robust appearance, and normal weight and vital signs. He appeared to be a \"straight talker,\" but the physician's \"gut feeling\" suggested that the presenting concern was only the tip o f an iceberg. This encounter was thus a new drama. Unfortunately, the physician had only 15 minutes for this visit, so a transition ceremony was performed. The physician ritualistically did an ab\u00ad dominal and rectal examination and stool hcmoccult, and then drew serum for a complete blood count and sedi\u00ad mentation rate. B.H. was asked to keep a stool diary and was rescheduled for an extended visit in 1 week. Over the next few months, irritable bowel syndrome was diag\u00ad nosed, brief family therapy was conducted because o f revealed marital difficulties, and lifestyle modifications were recommended. His symptoms improved, but he The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 34, No. 3, 1992 293 Clinical Encounters Miller terminated family therapy prematurely. The drama was temporarily over. Six months after terminating family therapy, B.H. returned complaining o f increased abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. He wanted to know if he was doing the right things and if he was correct about this being his irritable bowel again. Everything seemed consistent with his assessment. This was a maintenance ceremony. A ritualistic abdominal and stool examination were per\u00ad formed, and the findings o f good health were empha\u00ad sized. His self-care activities were approved with a minor dietary alteration suggested. He was reminded to stay alert to marital conflict. B.H .'s symptoms lessened. The Literature: A SynthesisJ How do the typology and taxonomy identified and de\u00ad scribed above relate to the literature on the physician- patient relationship, family medicine clinical method, strategies for implementing the biopsychosocial model, and the ritual process? Several remarkable connections were evident. Stuart and Lieberman1 4 propose a patient care ap\u00ad proach, based on the biopsychosocial model, that re\u00ad quires asking four questions early in the encounter. These arc: What is going on? How do you feel about it? What troubles you the most? How are you handling it? With the exception o f the last one, the questions are similar to those used to determine the type o f clinical encounter. There are also close parallels between the taxonomy discovered in this study and the patient-centered clinical method.1 5 1 7 John Coulchan,1 8 examining the practice o f chiropractic medicine, elucidated four steps required for healing: acceptance, explanation, action, and plan. These four steps correspond to the four steps used in a transi\u00ad tion ceremony. This study suggests that family systems thinking be applied when a drama occurs. This application corre\u00ad sponds closely to what the literature suggests are useful and appropriate occasions for convening the family.1 9 Dramas include perplexing diagnostic problems, poor treatment adherence, failure to respond to treatment, emotionally charged encounters, and new chronic diag\u00ad noses. These may be times for expanding the context and for involving families in care. Routines may not be the time to involve the family or to do genograms. One o f the original research concerns was to deter\u00ad mine when to use a particular relationship style. There remains much debate in the literature about what style is ideal.20- 21 The physicians in this study choose a relation\u00ad ship style according to the type o f encounter. They use contractual or mutuality styles for routines.22 Ceremonyoften evokes a shamanic image o f the physician and thus a style o f interaction that can be described as parental; the relationship is bound by covenant.23 This sty le should not be confused with paternalism. In recent years, the paternalistic (male-dominant) role has been harshly and justifiable criticized. Much o f this criticism, however, fails to recognize the many inherent imbalances and nuances o f the physician-patient relationship. It the the encounter is a ceremony, a \"shamanic\" or parental role bound by covenant may actually promote healing and increase control and independence for the pa\u00ad tient.25-29 Dramas, on the other hand, necessitate the use o f ever-changing models o f the physician-patient rela\u00ad tionship, according to the physicians interviewed in this study. A search o f the literature revealed that other re\u00ad searchers had developed similar analyses o f clinical en\u00ad counters. Marshall Marinker,27 combining his personal clinical and teaching experience with the theoretical work o f Morris,28 proposed three types o f consultations: rou\u00ad tines, rituals, and dramas. Routines refer to common problems where the situation and the patient are familiar to the general practitioner. Rituals are cases o f \"repeat prescriptions\"29 and are based on some past unexplained encounter. Dramas refer to those encounters in which there is a novel situation, the outcome is in doubt, or the outcome is especially important and there is no familiar pattern. Although my research concurs with the routine and drama depicted bv Marinker and Morris, my under\u00ad standing o f ceremony presented here expands and builds on their ritual category. Ritual occurs in all three clinical encounter types. A ritual is any formal, repeated act with both expressive and creative functions, performed in a special place, and achieved through manipulation o f symbols. Ceremonies, on the other hand, are a prescribed series o f rituals linked for a specific purpose. The literature on ritual process offers both hopes and warnings. We are reminded that the clinical encounter is a ritual space where the ordinary world o f the physician meets the extraordinary, intensi\u00ad fied experience o f the patient.30 We are warned about the risks o f excessive routinization3 1 and the role o f ritual as a reinforcer o f cultural norms and beliefs.32 La Barre33 eloquently describes how ceremonies can be a hvpnotic substitute for reality such that we see only our reflected expectations and risk being exploitative o f our patients.34 Victor Turner,35 however, hopes that ritual, as drama, can be transforming if its participants suspend judgment, maintain ambiguity (\"liminality\"), are playful, and step outside the usual hierarchy (communitas). We must be careful with ritual or risk the patient being transformed 294 The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 34, No. 3, 1992 Clinical Encounters Miller into our image and not to one o f his or her own creation. While studying the rules and ritual process in my prac\u00ad tice, I was reminded o f Coffman's observation, \"We all act better than we know how.\"36 Discussion The tvpology and taxonomy presented in this study were based on careful scrutiny o f the perceived management styles o f two veteran family physicians within a particular office setting. This is both the study's strength and its weakness. The study tells us nothing about the patient's perspective nor does it offer evidence about the efficacy of the proposed typology and taxonomy relative to patients. This study did promote the efficiency and satisfaction ot the physicians and head nurse in the familv practice studied, and provided us with a better understanding o f some o f the day-to-day decision-making processes con\u00ad cerning clinical encounters. The typology and taxonomy were management and physician focused. It is very pos\u00ad sible that a disease focus, an illness focus, a patient focus, a family focus, or a community focus would produce a somewhat different pattern o f results. These possibilities should be explored in the future. Four specific strategies were employed to ensure the trustworthiness o f the research process. The first strategy used triangulation o f methods.37 Initial formulations were developed from key informant interviews and then checked and revised on the basis o f informal and cthno- scientific interviews. These results were then imple\u00ad mented and evaluated using participant observation. A second strategy involved triangulation o f research partic\u00ad ipants.38 The revealed perceptions o f the two family physicians were compared and contrasted with each other and with those o f the head nurse. The research participants were continuously engaged in review ot my evolving understanding o f their management approach to clinical encounters. This iterative review or partici\u00ad pants' checking39 greatly strengthens the likelihood that what is reported is what the research participants actually meant. The fourth trustworthiness strategy was to report sufficient details about the study and its results so that the reader can evaluate the context o f the reported findings.40 Others should be able to repeat this study in another setting and determine the gcncralizablc and the context- dependent qualities o f the typology and taxonomy de\u00ad scribed. In the future, at least three additional techniques could be used to further enhance trustworthiness. A research analyst from outside the practice would be a valuable antidote to premature closure, cue blindness, and the unconscious biases by which a lone participatingfield researcher is often trapped. The use ot pile-sort techniques41 could also increase objectivity. Finally, in\u00ad terview's should be taped and transcribed to reduce the possibility o f lost information and enhance the ability ot others to audit the data. Future research prospects are varied and exciting. Do other familv practice and primary care settings con\u00ad firm these findings? What is the frequency ot the three encounter types in different practice settings? I suspect many residence training sites have significantly more dramas and fewer routines than suburban private prac\u00ad tices. How do patients understand and manage clinical encounters? Do patients have their own typology'? It so, how are the two typologies negotiated and used? Are they ever used as defense mechanisms or as agenda setters as warned by Balint42 and Stein43? How does culture influence the typology' and taxonomy presented? Does implementation o f the proposed typology and taxonomy improve patient satisfaction and clinical outcome? What is appropriate ceremony? What are the ethics of cere\u00ad mony? What are the rituals that family physicians cur\u00ad rently employ, how do they work, when and how do they fail, and what do they mean to different groups o f pa\u00ad tients? What are the different ways to stage a drama? How do our dramatic scripts and rituals limit our aware\u00ad ness? How is the discourse in each of these encounters different and the same? How do the encounter types relate and change over time? What is the importance ot shared experiences? The possibilities for more practiee- based research are exhilarating. This research evolved out o f dilemmas and conflicts created by residency-derived expectations that did not fit the reality o f private practice. The findings in this study resolved many o f these conflicts for the participants. The typology and taxonomy presented describe expectations concerning the clinical encounter that are realistic and teachable. I am now a teacher o f family medicine and have already witnessed the increase o f resident satisfac\u00ad tion with patient care as a result ot learning the strategy' discussed in this article. The pedagogical implications of this study also require refinement and evaluation. Family systems theory and the biopsychosocial model may sometimes help but can occasionally over\u00ad whelm family practice physicians. The typology of clini\u00ad cal encounters and the elicitation taxonomy offered here suggest a framework for facilitating implementation of these exciting visions. What began as a quest for under\u00ad standing my' clinical practice is now shared with my community o f peers. The mysteries and surprises of clin\u00ad ical reality will always be there to remind us of how limited our frameworks are. Try the typology and taxon\u00ad omy, expand the questions, share your self.
