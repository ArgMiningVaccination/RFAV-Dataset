PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity ? What is the answer to the question? Dietary patterns: Children Limited evidence suggests that dietary patterns consumed by children or adolescents that are lower in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low -fat dairy while being higher in added sugars, refined grains, fried potatoes, and processed meats are associated with higher fat -mass index and BMI later in adolescence. Dietary patterns: Adults The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee reviewed recently published evidence using a systematic evidence scan and determined that the conclusion drawn by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee generally reflects the current state of science: Moderate evidence indicates dietary patterns emphasizing vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; seafood and legumes; moderate in dairy products (particularly low and non- fat dairy) and alcohol; lower in meats (including red and processed meats), and low in sugar -sweetened foods and beverages, and refined grains are associated with favorable outcomes related to body weight, (including lower BMI, waist circum ference, or percent body fat) or risk of obesity. Components of the dietary patterns associated with these favorable outcomes include higher intakes of unsaturated fats and lower intakes of saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium. Diets based on macronutr ient distribution: Children No evidence is available to determine a relationship between diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed during childhood and growth, size, body composition, and risk of overweight/obesity. Diets based on macronutrient distribution: Adults Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between macronutrient distributions with proportions of energy falling outside of the AMDR for at least one macronutrient due to methodological limitations and inconsistent results. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 10 How was this question answer ed? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Patterns Subcommittee conducted a systematic review and a systematic evidence scan to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein , whether or not the foods/food groups consumed were provided. What is the population of interest? Children and adults, ages 2 years and older What evidence was found? This review i dentified 88 articles that met inclusion criteria . Twelve articles examined dietary patterns consumed by children or adolescents and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overwei ght or obesity. o Dietary patterns that were lower in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low - fat dairy, and higher in added sugars, refined grains, fried potatoes, and processed meat were related to hi gher body fat mass and body mass index (BMI). o The 2020 Committee determined the strength of this evidence was limited. Fifty-four articles examined dietary patterns consumed by adults and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesit y. o The 2020 Committee determined these articles were generally consistent with those from an existing NESR systematic review. Therefore, the 2020 Committee carried forward the conclusion from the 2015 Committee. No articles met inclusion criteria that examined diets based on macronut rient distribution consumed by children or adolescents and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity. o The 2020 Committee could not draw conclusions because there were no studies. Thirty -one articles examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by adults and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity . o Many limitations in the study design and conduct of included articles were identified. This includes a lack of accounting for key confounders or possible changes in dietary intake over follow -up. o The 2020 Committee could not draw conclusions because the included studies had several limit ations. How up -to-date is this systematic review? 11 This review searched for s tudies from January , 2000 to October , 2019; and updated existing systematic review s that included evidence from January 2000 to January 2014 . 12 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Patterns Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question wit h support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity ? Conclusion statement s and grades Dietary patterns: Children Limited evidence suggests that dietary patterns consumed by children or adolescents that are lower in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low -fat dairy while being higher in added sugars, refined grains, fried potatoes, and processed meats are associated with higher fat -mass index and BMI later in adolescence. ( Grade: Limited ) Dietary patterns: Adults The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee reviewed newly published evidence using a systematic evidence scan and determined that the conclusion drawn by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee generally reflec ts the current state of science. Moderate evidence indicates dietary patterns emphasizing vegetables, fruit s, and whole grains; seafood and legumes; moderate in dairy products (particularly low and non- fat dairy) and alcohol; lower in meats (including red and processed meats), and low in sugar -sweetened foods and beverages, and refined grains are associated wit h favorable outcomes related to body weight, (including lower BMI, waist circumference, or percent body fat) or risk of obesity. Components of the dietary patterns associated with these favorable outcomes include higher intakes of unsaturated fats and lower intakes of saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium. (2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Grade: Moderate) Diets based on macronutrient distribution: Children No evidence is available to determine a relationship between diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed during childhood and growth, size, body composition, and risk of overweight/obesity. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Diets Based on macronutrient distribution: Adults Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between macronutrient distributions with proportions of energy falling outside of the AMDR for at least one macronutrient and growth, size, body composition, and risk of overweight/obesity, due to methodological limitations and inconsistent results. (Grade: Grade not assignable) 13 Methods Two literature searches were conducted using 3 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of dietary patterns consumed and the outcomes of type 2 diabetes. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre- determined criteria Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee qualitativel y synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and graded the strength of evidence using pre- established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Dietary patterns were defi ned as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of differe nt foods, drinks, and nutrients in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were considered to be those with at least one macronutrient proportion outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR ) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein, whether or not the foods/food groups consumed were provided. Studies examining energy -restricted diets that induce weight loss or treat overweight and obesity for the purposes of treating additional or other medical conditions were excluded. Summary of the evidence Eighty -eight articles were identified that met inclusion criteria and examined the relationship between dietar y patterns and/or diets based on macronutrient proportion and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity. Twelve articles from prospective cohort studies were identified that examined dietary patterns consumed by children and grow th, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity, met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2014 and October 2019. o Dietary patterns were assessed using a variety of methods including factor/cluster analysis, indices or scores, latent class analysis, and reduced rank regression o Outcome measures varied across studies and included incidence of overweight/obesity, fat mas s, lean mass, body mass index (BMI), central adiposity, and weight/height. o Despite variability in methods, dietary patterns in childhood or adolescence that generally reflect poorer diet quality tended to associate with higher fat - mass index and BMI later in adolescence. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations. o Across the body of evidence, the direction of significant findings were mixed with relatively small and inconsistent magnitude. o Most of the studies asses sed diet once at baseline with methods that were not necessarily valid, reliable, or applicable in children. 14 Fifty-four articles examined dietary patterns consumed by adults and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity . The 2020 Committee determined with a systematic evidence scan that the recently published evidence was generally consistent with the body of evidence from the existing review, and a full systematic review update was not needed at this time. Therefore, the conclusion statement and grade from the existing review were carried forward. No studies identified met inclusion criteria that examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by children or adolescents and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity. Thirty -one articles examined diets based on macronutrient distribution consumed by adults and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity, met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2000 and October 2019 o Twenty -two articles came from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nine articles came from prospective cohort studies o When describing and categorizing studies included in this review, the Committee did not label the diets examined as \"low\" or \"high,\" because no standard definition is currently available for , for example, \"low- carbohydrate\" or \"high- fat\" diets. Instead, the Committee focused on whether, and the extent to which, the proportions of the macronutrients were below or above the AMDR. o Most of the articles examined distributions in which the proporti on of energy from carbohydrate was below the AMDR; f at was above the AMDR; and protein was within the AMDR in at least one of the exposure groups compared. o Foods or food groups consumed as part of the diet were not reported consistently. o Results across st udies were inconsistent, with the majority of studies reporting no significant association between diets based on macronutrient distribution and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity. o Some studies reported diets based on macr onutrient distributions w ith proportions of energy from carbohydrate and/or fat within or close to AMDRs compared to those that were outside AMDRs significantly associated with favorable fat -mass, BMI, waist circumference, and/or change in weight. Notably, these results were closely linked to better quality of the diet where reported, typically consisting of vegetables, fruit, whole- grains, vegetable oils, nuts, pulses, and/or lean meat or fish o Numerous limitations that prevent adequate assessment across this body of evidence were identified: Several studies did not directly test the difference in macronutrient proportions in the context of various dietary patterns during energy balance. Although statistically significant relationships were reported, the gradient between macronutrient distributions was relatively narrow within studies (e.g., 45.3% vs. 43.8% carbohydrate) and between studies Due to the variety of methods used to estimate macronutrient intake 15 and adjust intake for total energy, the confidence in the reported proportions of energy falling outside the AMDR is low. Several studies reported to be examining one particular macronutrient of interest, such as \"high- protein\" or \"low -carbohydrate\" intake, but the proportion for that nutrient was within the AMDR. 16 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity ?

When describing and categor izing studies included in this review , the Committee did not label the diets examined as \"low\" or \"high,\" because no universally accepted, standard definition is currently available, for example, for \"low -carbohydrate\" or \"high- fat\" diets. Instead, the Commi ttee focused on whether, and the extent to which, the proportions of the macronutrients were below or above the AMDR. o Studies examining energy -restricted diets that induce weight loss or treat overweight and obesity for the purposes of treating additional or other medical conditions were excluded.

Description of the evidence Dietary patterns: C hildren Population/participant characteristics The 12 studies examining dietary patterns in children that are included in this systematic review were conducted in the following countries: Australia3 Portugal4 The Netherlands8 United Kingdom1,2,9,11 United States6,7 One multi -country study from Italy, Estonia, Cyprus, Belgium, Sweden, Hungary, Germany, and Spain was included in 3 articles .5,10,12 Multiple articles from the same study were included, but reported unique data on dietary patterns, outcomes, and ages of participants examined. Data from the following cohorts were represented in the evidence: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort2,11 Generation R Study8 Generation XXI4 Growing Up Today Study 27 Identification and prevention of Dietary - and lifestyle- induced health EFfects In Children and infantS ( IDEFICS) study5,12 Project EAT6 Southampton Women's Survey9 20 West ern Australian Pregnancy Cohort3 Sample size in the included articles ranged from 1,018 to 10,918 p articipants. Studies included participants who were healthy and/or at risk of chronic disease, or diagnosed with a chronic disease. Studies enrolled both boys and girls in relatively equal amounts. P articipants with missing data were excluded from analyses in all studies , and those with diseases that influence diet were typically excluded. Intervention/exposure Dietar y patterns were assessed at a mean age of participants, ranging from 2 to 15 years, using a variety of methods. Five studies examined adherence to dietary patterns using 5 different indices or scores ,3,6-8,12 and Five studies used factor/cluster analysis2,5,9-11 One study each used latent class analysis ,4 or reduced rank regression.1 Dietary intake was assessed using a variety of methods in which the validity and reliability were inconsistent or unknown, or only validated in adults. Most studies assessed diet once at baseline. T hree articles reported diet assessments at each age/timepoint examined. Outcome assessment Included studies examined outcomes over follow- up at a range of ages between 4y to 25y. Growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity outcomes were reported as follows : Overweight/obesity incidence10 Fat-mass, fat -mass index (FMI), FMI z -score ( FMIz), or change in % fat mass1,4,5,8,11 ,12 Lean mass or fat- free mass, including fat-free mass index (FFMI)5,8,11 Body mass index (B MI) or BMI- z-score2-10,12 Central adiposity or waist circumference3-5,12 Absolute or change in (excess) weight and/or height6,8 Dietary pat terns: A dults Fifty-four articles met incl usion criteria, were published between January 2013 and October 2019, and examined dietary patterns in adults and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity.13-60 61 62-66 Diets based on macronutrient distribution: C hildren No studies identified that met inclusion criteria examined diets based on macronutrient proportion in children. Diets based on macronutrient distribution: A dults Population/participant characteristics Studies were conducted in the Australia23,24,70,82 73,85,87 countries within Europe,74,78 or Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland.79 Studies enroll ed primarily healthy, adult s or older adults . Primary results were included from the Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea (PREDIMED) randomized- controlled trial (RCT) , which enrolled adults at high- risk for cardiovascular disease across multiple sites.14,76 Multiple articles reported results from the same established cohorts , e.g., Framingham Heart Study Offspring, and reported different macronutrient distributions, dietary patterns, and/or outcomes. Intervention/exposure Dietary intake was measured with various approaches including picture- plate waste, food records, 24- h recall s, validated FFQ, or diet history. Most of the included articles came from RCTs that confirmed dietary compliance with 3- 4-day food records at baseline, and during follow -up. In the observational studies, diet assessment was primarily assessed once at baseline using validated methods or every 2y during follow - up. Diets based on macronutrient distribution varied across studies, with some studies intentionally examining varied levels of specifi c macronutrient proportions while other studies focused on adherence to different dietary patterns such as a \"Mediterranean\" diet, published dietary guidelines, regional dietary patterns, or specific markers of diet quality. Twenty -two trials randomized participants to consume specific diets compared to control groups. A mong the nine observational studies, se veral examined categories of total protein intake or adherence scores for a particular dietary pattern, where the macronutrient proportions of intake that were reported fell outside the AMDR. Among the macronutrient distributions reported , the proportions of energy falling outside of the AMDR were as follows: Carbohydrate below the AMDR ranged between 25.3% and 44.9% Carbohydrate above the AMDR ranged between 66% and 77.5% Fat above the AMDR ranged between 35.2% and 47% Fat below the AMDR ranged between 9.9% and 19.3% Protein was above the AMDR in one study at 43.5% The majority of studies examined macronutrient distributions i n which the proportion of energy from carbohydrate was below the AMDR, and fat above the AMDR, in at least one of the exposure groups compared.14,23,24 ,28,33,37,55 ,61,67-72,74 -80,82 -87 Few studies examined macronutrient distributions in which the proportion of energy from carbohydrate was above t he AMDR,41,81,88 with the proportion from fat either below, 22 above, or within the AMDR. Only one study examined macronutrient distributions within the AMDR for carbohydrate and protein, and above the AMDR for fat only.73 Outcome assessment Outcomes were measured using standardized methods by trained staff across most studies. Included studies primarily utilized dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) and/or bio- electrical impedance analysis (BIA) to assess body composition, calibrated stadiom eters to obtain height, calibrated scales to obtain weight, and tape to measure waist circumference. Few studies used self -reported anthropometric data82,84,86 or provided limited information on outcome assessment methods .61,81,83 Included studies examined outcomes over follow- up ranging in the RCT's from 12wk to 2y, and in observational studies between 2y and 20y . The following growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity outcomes were reported: Overweight and/or obesity incidence , range of follow -up 12wk to 7y68,82,84-86 Fat-m ass and/or lean or fat -free ,41,67-72, B ody 37,55, 67 ,69-75, 77-79, 81,83,84,87,88 Evidence synthesis Results reported in the studies included in this systematic review are summarized below by evidence that examined dietary patterns in children ( Table 1), dietary patterns in adults, and diets based on macronutrient distributions in adults (Table 2). Dietary patterns: C hildren Summa ry of r esults Index/score analysis Mediterranean related indices/scores Two studies reporting adherence to \"Mediterranean\" style indices in children were significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Martin -Calvo et al7 reported increased KidMed adherence scores were significantly associated with lower BMI after 7y follow -up. Tognon et al12 reported increased Mediterranean diet score adherence was significantly associated with lower gains in BMIz, waist -circumference, and waist- hip-ratio, and lower % fat -mass after 2y follow -up, but no significant asso ciation with absolute waist circumference. Country -specific indices Chan She Ping- Delfos et al3 reported increased adherence to the Australian Dietary Guideline Index for Children and Adolescents (DGI -CA) was significantly associated with higher BMI, but lower waist -hip-ratio at 17y follow -up. Other indices/scores Two studies examined the relationship between dietary patterns in children using diet quality indices. 23 Hu et al6 reported increased a Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS) adherence scores were significantly associated with lower BMI and reduced excess weight gain at age 25y. Nguyen et al8 reported that increased Diet Quality Score adherence scores at age 8y were significantly associated with higher fat -free mass , BMI, and absolute weight and height at 10y. In stratification analyses, results for BMI and weight/height were only significant in girls. No significant association was observed between Diet Quality Score adherence scores at age 8y and % body fat at age 10y. Reduced rank regression Ambro sini et al 1 used reduced rank regression with predictor variables: % E from free sugars, %E from fat, dietary energy density (energy/g food consumed), dietary fiber density) to examine two dietary patterns at age 7y, \"DP1\" and \"DP2\". Greater adherence to DP1 (higher in confectionery and chocolate, cakes and biscuits, sugar - sweetened beverages , low- fiber bread, and lower in fruit, vegetables, high- fiber bread, cereals) was significan tly associated with higher FMIz, but not excess adiposity, at age 15y. No significant association was reported for adherence to DP2, which was higher in sugar -sweetened beverages, fruit juices, ready -to-eat breakfast cereals, and lower in whole milk, mar garines and oils, cheese, crisps, and FMIz or excess adiposity at 15y. Factor/cluster/latent class analysis Pala et al 10 examined the following di etary patterns identified by factor/cluster analysis: \"Snacking\" [characterized by street savory pastries, chocolate bars], \"Sweet\" [characterized by chocolate spreads, sweets/candy, fried meat, soft drinks], \"Vegetables and Wholemeal\" [characterized milk], \"Protein and Water\" [characterized by fish, meat, water]. Increased adherence to the \"Vegetables and Wholemeal\" [characterized by vegetables, fruits, wholemeal cereal products, unsweetened milk] was significantly associated with reduced risk of overweight or obesity after 2y f/u (~age 4- 12y). However, there was no significant association between any of the patterns and change in BMI after 2y f/u (~age 4- 12y) Okubo et al 9 reported adherence to the \"Prudent\" dietary pattern score [characterized by fish and shellfish, vegetables (salad, green, root other), other fruits] was significantly associated with lower fat -mass at age 6y, but not significant ly associated with BMI at age 6y. Smith et al 11 reported increased adherence to the \"Health Aware\" dietary pattern, characterized by fruits and vegetables, high -fiber bread, pasta, cheese, and fish, lower loadings for chips (French fries), crisps (potato and corn snacks), processed meat, fizzy (carbonated) drinks] was si gnificantly associated with lower fat -mass and lean mass gain at 11y in girls (valid and under -reporting), and boys (under -reporting). Adher ence to the \"Packed Lunch\" dietary pattern, with higher loadings for low -fiber bread, margarine, cheese, cold meats, salty flavorings such as yeast extract, diet squash (dilutable soft drink), was significantly associated with lower fat -mass and lean mass gain at 11y in girls (valid and under -reporting), and under -reporting boys. 24 Adherence to the \"Traditional\" dietary pattern, with higher loadings for meat, roast potatoes, vegetables, batter and pastry products, low energy -density sauces (e.g. gravy, desserts) was not significantly associated with fat -mass or lean mass. Bull and Northstone2 reported that the \"Processed\" or the \"Packed Lunch\" vs. \"Healthy\" dietary patterns at age 7y were significantly associated with higher BMI at 17 y f/u. However, the \"Traditional\" vs. Healthy dietary patterns at age 7y were not significantly associated wit h BMI at 17 y f/u. None of the dietary patterns at age 10y or 13y were associated with BMI at 17y follow -up. Several key confounders were not adjusted for in analyses, including race/ethnicity, physical activity, and anthropometry. Durao et al 4 found that increased adherence to the energy -dense foods (EDF) pattern, characterized by sweets, soft drinks , salty pastry, processed meat , was significantly associated with higher FMI, BMIz, and waist -to-hip-ratio at 7y in girls, but associations were not significant in boys. There were no significant associations between consumption of either the \"Snacking\", or \"Healthier\" dietary patterns and FMI, BMIz, or waist -hip-ratio at 7y in girls or boys. Fernandez -Alvira et al 5 reported that consistent cons umption of the \"Processed\" dietary pattern (baseline to follow -up), or changing to a \"Processed- Sweet\" combination dietary pattern was significantly associated with higher FMI -z, BMIz, and waist -circumference z -score (WC -z) follow -up. onsumption of the \"Processed\" or \"Sweet\" compared to \"Healthy\" dietary pattern consumption at baseline was significantly associated with higher FMI -z, BMIz, and WC -z at follow- up. There were also many non- significant associations reported, such as those between \"Processed\" or \"Sweet\" compared to \"Healthy\" dietary pattern consumption at baseline and change in FFMIz at follow -up. Overall, five studies reported increased adherence to indices or scores that emphasize vegetables, fruits, \"high- fiber\" or \"wholegrai n\" bread, or wholemeal cereals were significantly associated with reduced risk of overweight/obesity10, lower BMI or reduced- gain in BMI ,6,7,12 or lower fat mass .9 Associations with BMI were not significant in two of these studies .6,9 However, the studies also reported significantly lower gain in excess weight6, waist circumference , and waist -hip-ratio (WHR) .12 Three studies reported dietary patterns characterized by sweets and refined grai ns (confectionary, biscuits, cakes, pastri es), sugar -sweetened beverages , processed meats, and/or salty snacks were significantly associated with higher fat -mass index, BMIz, WHR and/or waist circumference- et al,4 the results were sex-specific (significant in girls but not boys). Additional non- significant associations were reported in these studies when examining different dietary patterns (e.g., \"Healthy\" vs.\"Processed\"), or other outcomes (e.g., excess adiposity) . Assessment of the e vidence 1F3Fiv iv A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Comm ittee. 20 20. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 25 This systematic review update included 12 articles that examined dietary patterns in children and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity , met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 201 4 and October 2019. Dietary patterns and outcome measures were assessed using a variety of approaches across studies. Despite variability in methods, dietary patterns in childhood or adolescence that generally reflect poorer diet quality tended to associate with higher fat-mass index and BMI later in adolescence. As outlined and described below, the body of evidence examining dietary patterns in children and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity was assessed for the following elements used when grading the strength of evidence. Risk of bias: There were a number of potential risks of bias, or limitations, across the body of evidence that make interpretation of results difficult ( Table 4). Most studies adjusted for a number of potential confounders, but did not account for all key confounders, such as race/ethnicity. Note that alcohol and smoking are listed on the anal ytic framework but were not treated as key confounders in the evidence with children or adolescence. Diet assessment methods varied in validity and reliability. Most studies assessed dietary patterns once at baseline, though a few assessed at each age/time- point to account for change in dietary intake over follow -up. However, many used methods that were not necessarily valid, reliable, or applicable in children. Therefore, tho se studies are at higher risk of bias due to classification of exposure and departure from intended exposure Consistency : All 12 articles came from observational studies that used different approaches to assess dietary patterns , with about half each using indices/scores or factor analysis. Among those using indices/scores, each used a different indice/score to assess adherence to different dietary patterns. Multiple approaches to examine dietary patterns were used that varied between studies. Several studies examined dietary patterns that emphasize vegetables, fruits, \"high -fiber\" o r \"wholegrai n\" bread, or wholemeal cereals. Several of the dietary patterns emphasized intake of fish and shellfish, legumes and nuts, reduced- fat or low -fat dairy, and olive oil, but these elements were less consistent across the body of evidence. Whereas , other studies examined dietary patterns characterized by sweets and refined grains (confectionary, biscuits, cakes, pastries), sugar -sweetened beverages, processed meats, and/or salty snacks . Across the dietary patterns examined in children, there was also variation in the level of specificity within included components e.g., \"unsweetened milk\" vs. \"dairy\" vs. \"reduced- or low -fat dairy\". Across the body of evidence, the direction of findings w as relatively split depending on the dietary pattern examined or weight status/ body composition outcome reported. Effect sizes were relatively small across the body of evidence (e.g., 0.04- SD increase in FMI, or - 0.04 decrease in BMI) . Directness : The populations, intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest in the included studies are directly related to the systematic review question. Precision: Most of the studies did not report power analyses or sample size calculations, but had relatively large analytic sample sizes. 26 Generalizability: The study participants, interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the body of evidence are applicable to the U.S. population. Dietary patterns: A dults The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic evidence scan to identify and examine new evidence published since a review done by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2F4Fv Results across the recently published body of evidence were generally consistent with the conclusion from the 2015 Committee , showing that dietary patterns of higher diet quality were typically associated with favorable weight status outcomes . Across the studies, the r esults for the Mediterranean and DASH dietary patterns showed the most consistent significant effects towards healthier w eight status. Few studies showed no significant association, in particular those examining Nordic dietary patterns and weight status outcomes. The populations, intervention, comparators, and outcomes of interest are directly related to the systematic review question. The m agnitude of effect across the body of evidence i s relatively small for body weight, BMI, and waist circumference. The evidence is primarily from prospective cohort studies, and the number of RCTs within t his newly published set of evidence is limited. Across these studies, there was insufficient evidence to determine a relationship between dietary patterns in adults and other measures of body composition and/or distribution, such as visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous fat, and ectopic fat . The study participants, interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the body of evidence are applicable to the U.S. populat ion. The existing conclusion statement from the 2015 Committee noted that the included evidence reported favorable outcomes related to body weight with overall dietary patterns that may include moderate alcoholic beverage intake in adults. However, f or the newly published evidence, inclusion of moderate alcohol intake within an overall dietary pattern may not necessarily be recommended, particularly with regards to prevention of co- morb id conditions that may be exacerbated with alcoholic beverage intake e.g. hypertension, cancer, etc. Studies that examine overall dietary patterns in adults often vary in how alcohol intake is measured, the thresholds applied for amounts of alcohol consumed, and scoring procedures of alcohol as a component (e.g., a posit ive component, positive in moderation, or negative component). Due to this inconsistency, the inclusion and specification of alcoholic beverages within dietary patterns warrants further investigation. The 2020 Committee determined that the conclusion drawn by the 2015 Committee still reflects the current state of science on dietary patterns in adults and risk of type 2 v Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.

Therefore, a full systematic review was not conducted at this time, and the 2015 Committee's conclusion statement and grade were carried forward. The 2015 Committee concluded that : Moderate evidence indicates dietary patterns emphasizing vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; seafood and legumes; moderate in dairy products (particularly low and non- fat dairy) and alcohol; lower in m eats (including red and processed meats), and low in sugar -sweetened foods and beverages, and refined grains are associated with favorable outcomes related to body weight, including lower BMI, waist circumference, or percent body fat, or risk of obesity. C omponents of the dietary patterns associated with these favorable outcomes include higher intakes of unsaturated fats and lower intakes of saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium . Diets based on macronutrient distribution: Children No studies identified t hat met inclusion criteria examined diets based on macronutrient proportion in children. Diets based on macronutrient distribution: Adults Summary of r esults Thirty -one studies examined diets based on m acronutrient distributions with proportions of energy falling outside of the AMDR for at least one macronutrient and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity outcomes. The 31 article s included 22 articles from RCTs (Table 2) and 9 articles from prospective cohort studies (Table 3). Results across the body of evidence were mixed, depending on various factors including study design, the macronutrient distribution examined, and/or the outcome reported. Significant associations were reported in 1 4 of the 31 included articles . 23,28 ,41,55,61,72 -75,81,83- 85,87 However, t he majority of these studies also reported null, or mixed associations depending on the intervention/exposure group and/or specific outcome ex amined. No significant associations between diets based on macronutrient distribution and all outcomes were reported in 17 of the 31 included articles . 14,24 ,33,37,67- 71,76- 80,82,86,88 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Most of the RCTs did not show significantly meaningful differences between diet groups compared based on v ariations in macronutrient intakes and body size or composition outcomes. A number of these studies did report si gnificant results , but the relationship between the macronutrient distribution and outcomes were indirect and limited by several methodological considerations . Due et al 72 examined the effects of a \"low-fat\" diet within AMDRs for all macronutrients (23.6% Fat) and a \"high monounsaturated (MUFA) fat\" diet consisting of carbohydrate below and fat above the AMDR with >20% from MUFA . Results supported significantly decreased fat mass in participants following either diet relative to a control diet at 32.1% f at. Gardner et al33 tested 'low -fat' compared to 'low -carbohydrate' diets without energy restriction on weight change in participants with BMI between 28 and 40 kg/m2, 28 reporting no clinically meaningful differences in % body fat, BMI, or waist circumference after 12mo. Howard et al 73 tested diets at varied levels of reduced fat intake within the AMDR compared to control diets with fat intake above the AMDR from th e Women's Health Initiative , reporting lower BMI, waist circumference and body weight after 1 year, but ultimately no significant differences between groups at the end of 6 y follow -up. Kahleova et al41 examined the eff ect of a \"l ow-fat vegan\" diet based on different macronutrient distribution with fat below the AMDR at 17.5% energy, compared to fat intake within the AMDR. Participants consuming the \"Low -fat vegan\" diet had significantly lower lean m ass, fat mass, and BM I at 16 weeks. Notably, the duration of follow- up in this study was relative short. Turner -McGrievy et al61 tested the effects of plant -based based dietary patterns on weight loss without energy restriction and observed significant weight loss in all groups after 6mo. T hose assigned to consume a \"Vegan\" diet lost the most weight compared to either \"Semi -vegetarian\", \"Pesco- vegetarian\", or \"Omnivore\" diets. It should be noted that the study was not powered to detect differences between the \"Vegan\" compared to \"Vegetarian\" groups. Paineau et al75 compared reduced fat intake within the AMDR at 32.4% and reduced fat intake with reduced sugar intake to a control diet with fat intake above the AMDR at 35.6% fat. Reducing fat within the AMDR wi th reduced sugar intake was significantly associated with lower fat mass and BMI at 8mo follow -up, but no significant differences were observed in the group that only reduced fat within the AMDR compared to the control group. It should be noted that partic ipants were parents, with their children concomitantly enrolled in the intervention to improve weight and other health outcomes in the family. Wan et al 81 assessed \"low\", \"moderate\", and \"high\" levels of fat and carbohydrate intake, with the proportion of fat above the AMDR at 40% in the \"high- fat\" distribution, and proportion of carbohydrate slightly above the AMDR at 66% of energy in the \"high- carbohydrate\". All other proportions, including \"low -fat\" were within the AMDR. L ower - fat intake within the AMDR and carbohydrate near or within the AMDR at 66% or 56% energy were significantly associated with lower fat mass, BMI, waist circumference, or weight at 6 mo follow- up. Larsen et al74 reported significant weight regain in previously weight -reduced participants assigned to the \" low protein, high glycemic index \" diet within AMDRs for a ll macronutrients . Individuals in the high protein groups , with either high or low glycemic index levels, had 0.93 kg less weight regain. In the \"high- protein\" groups' mean intake from protein was within the AMDR at 21.7% -22.6% of energy and intake from carbohydrate was modestly below the AMDR at 43.0% -44.7% of energy. Reidlinger et al55 reported smaller waist circumference and lower weight after 12 weeks in the \"dietary guidelines \" diet group compared to a control diet , which had a distribution with proportions of carbohydrate below the AMDR and Fat above the AMDR. While this trial had some small differences between intervention groups in all macronutrient s, the overriding difference between arms could be the quality of intake with the \"dietary guidelines\" group consuming more whole grains and reducing sugar 29 and salt intake. Daly et al23 enrolled all older women engaged in resistance training to determine the effects of consuming lean red meat compared to pasta/rice, with carbohydrate intake below the AMDR in bo th intervention groups at 41% and 42%. Results showed a significant impact on lean mass in those consuming lean red meat . All remaining RCTs included in the body of evidence reported no significant effects between diet groups and reported outcomes, including risk of overweight or obesity, lean mass, fat mass, BMI, waist circumference or wai st-to-hip ratio, or body weight. 14,24,67- 71,76 -80 Several of these studies specifically examined the effects of \"Mediterranean\" diets on weight and body composition outcomes .14,24,76,80 None of the studies examining \"Mediterranean\" diets reported significant effects between groups on weight , BMI, % body fat, fat -free mass, truncal fat -mass, waist circumference over follow- up ranging between 4mo and 3y. The macr onutrient distribution for the \"Mediterranean\" patterns examined in those studies had proportions of carbohydrate slightly below and fat slightly above the AMDR, but because the trials were testing the different dietary patterns, there was often minor contrast between macronutrient distributions in the groups compared. I n some cases, both intervention and control groups had proportions sim ilarly outside of the AMDR in the same direction (e.g., 37.8% carbohydrate, 38.8% fat, 19.4% protein vs. 40.3% carbohydrate, 35.6% fat, 19.2% protein). In other studies, the contrast was substantial (e.g., 37.0% carbohydrate, 47.0% fat, 13.8% protein vs. 6 9.0% carbohydrate, 14.0% fat, 14.0% protein), yet there were no significant effects detected. Observational studies Five observational studies reported significant results and all examined proportions of carbohydrate below and fat above the AMDR. Beunza et al 84 reported that high Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), with proportions of carbohydrate and fat within the AMDR, were significantly associated with lower weight gain over follow -up (at 4y) compared to \"low MDS\" scores with carbohydrate slightly below and fat above the AMDR. Ericson et al28 reported that higher consumption of the \"health- conscious\" dietary pattern, with proportions of carbohydrate slightly below and fat above the AMDR, were significantly associated with greater weight change over 10 y in men, but when diet was examined continuously, results were not significant. There were no other significant associations in men or women when examining other dietary patterns. Quatromoni et al 87 reported higher adherence to the diet quality index (DQI), with proportions of energy within compared to outside the AMDR, was significantly associated with reduced weight gain during 8 y follow -up in men or women. In the study by Ankarfeldt et al, 83 results from the MONICA cohort reported a 5% substitution of protein for carbohydrate was associated with a small but statistically significant weight change of 123.4 g/year over 5 years. However, overall, substituting 5% of energy from protein for either carbohydrate or fat did not result in significant weight change. There were no significant associations reported in the other cohorts examined in that study . Bujnowski et al85 reported greater weight gain over 7 years in men with higher total - and animal -protein intake, but no significant association when examining 30 macronutrient distribution based on vegetable- protein intake. The remaining studies reported no significant associations between diets based on macronutrient distribution compared, with most examining intake of carbohydrate below the AMDR.37,82, 86,88 In most, the lowest proportion of carbohydrate was associated with the poorest diet quality , if foods or food groups consumed in the diet were reported. Determining the influence of macronutrient intake among these results is challenging. Although results show that macronutrient distributions of higher diet quality were generally associated with less weight gain over time, the range of carbohydrate intake was commonly not varied within or across studies, and the proximity to the AMDR limits were generally very clos e (e.g., 66% carbohydrate). For example, two of the studies reporting significant results compared diets with macronutrient distributions where all levels of carbohydrate intake compared were below the AMDR, and all levels of fat intake compared were above the AMDR. In addition, the primary focus was protein intake in several of the observational studies , but all proportions of protein were within the AMDR and carbohydrate and fat were varied outside the AMDR . 37,85,88 Assessment of the evidence 3F5Fvi This systematic review update included 31 articles that examined examined diets based on macronutrient distribution and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity, met inclusion criteria, and were published between January 2000 and October 2019. Most of the articles examined macronutrient di stributions in which the proportion of energy from carbohydrate was below the AMDR; Fat was above the AMDR; and protein was within the AMDR in at least one of the exposure groups compared. From a study design perspective, most of the clinical trials had control or comparator exposures that featured a different dietary pattern, either prescribed as a study intervention or as usual intake. The observational studies used derived food patterns or index scores as comparators, generally comparing poorer quality diets to higher quality alternatives. Therefore, across study designs, the comparisons were primarily of different dietary patterns and food groups that resulted in differing macronutrient proportions rather than comparing a different distribution of macronutrients within the same pattern of food intake. As a function of these study designs, the differences in macronutrient proportions between intervention arms were either limited in magnitude, of a similar direction relative to the AMDR (e.g., all below or above the AMDR), only modestly different from the AMDR, or only relevant for a limited subset of the study population. Sever al included articles were primary or secondary analyses from the PREDIMED trial, which was subject to randomization issues establis hed after publication of the initial study. However, the vi A deta iled description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - reviews Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidel ines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Servic e, Washington, DC. 31 republished results confirmed the initial findings , even after accounting for participants that were subject to protocol deviation. Multiple databases were used to obtain publications from a large, comprehensive search. Although several studies were from large prospective cohorts, studies with smaller sample sizes were also included and reported both significant and non- significant results . Therefore, this risk of publication bias is low. As outlined and described below, the body of evidence examining diets based on macronutrient distribution and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity was assessed for the following elements used when grading the strength of evidence. Risk of bias: There were a number of potential risks of bias, or limitations, across the body of evidence that make interpretation of results difficult ( Table 5 and Table 6). While studies adjusted for most potential confounders, they did not adjust for all key confounders, such as race/ethnicity, alcohol intake, and/or physical activity. Most of the observational studies and several RCT's used self -reported methods that varied to obtain dietary intake, derive macronutrient intake, and/or assess diet adherence. Most studies selected participants that were free of chronic disease or other conditions at baseline, and are therefore at a higher risk of selection bias. It is likely that the reported results are reflective of generally healthier populations . Several studies did not assess the impact of missing data, either due to lost to follow- up or criteria used when selecting subjects into the analyses. Although several studies reported using standardized methods to collect or calculate anthropometric measures, several studies are at higher risk of bias due to the use of self-reported data or providing limited information on outcome assessment methods. Consistency: Study design varied in the body of evidence, with 22 articles from RCTs and 9 articles from prospective cohort studies. Results across studies were inconsistent in direction and magnitude. There was some evidence to suggest that diets based on macronutrient distributions within or closer to the AMDR compared to those that were outside the AMDR ( below or above) are associated with favorable weight status outcomes, such as fat -mass, BMI, waist circumference, and/or change in weight, typically if the diet was reflective of higher quality. Among the m acronutrient distributions within the AMDR that suggested favorable outcomes, several were comprised of vegetables, fruit, whole- grains, vegetable oils, nuts, pulses and/or lean meat or fish. However, the foods/food groups were inconsistently reported. Proportions of energy associated with these results v aried for carbohydrate below the AMDR between 30.9% and 44.9%, for carbohydrate above the AMDR be tween 66% and 69.6%, and for fat above the AMDR between 35.6% and 41%. Although statistically significant relationships were reported, the gradient between macronutrient distributions was relatively narrow within studies and between studies (e.g., 45.3% vs. 43.8% carbohydrate) . Several studies compared sufficiently distinct proportions between groups, whereas other proportions were much closer in proximity relative to one another, or to the actual AMDR cut-off (e.g., 44.9% vs. 45%) . Studies varied in terms of the distribution of macronutrients that were examined and the methods used to estimate nutrient intakes, derive the 32 proportion of energy from macronutrients, and/or apply substitution modelling (e.g., multivariate -nutrient density methods). Directness: Several studies reported the intent to directly examine different diets based on macronutrient distribution and the outcome of interest. However, for this review, an important limitation to highlight is that many of the studies were not designed to intentionally examine macronutrient proportions outside of the AMDR. Additionally, most of the studies assessed different dietary patterns as the primary comparators rather than using a common dietary pattern and adjusting macronutrient proportions within that dietary context. Due to the variety of methods used to estimate macronutrient intake and adjust intake for total energy, the confidence in the estimated proportions falling outside the AMDR is low. The gradient between proportions compared within macronutrients varied and in some cases, may not have been large enough to distinguish differences i n the outcomes between intervention or exposure groups compared. Several studies reported to be examining \"high\" or \"low\" levels of one particular macronutrient of interest, but the proportion for that nutrient was typically within the AMDR . Due to these issues, directness across the body of evidence could not be adequately assessed. Precision: Of the 22 RCTs , all demonstrated adequate power but had generally smaller sample sizes and in some cases, a very small sample size (n=16) . Two were insufficiently powered to detect differences either in the outcome of interest or between some exposure groups. The assessment of variance within these studies was relatively narrow, but sever al indicate wider variance in results. Observational studies did not report sample size or power calculations but did have large analytic sample sizes, ranging from n=1,107 to n=20,487. Generalizability: The study participants, interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes examined in the body of evidence are applicable to the U.S. population. Results across studies may be less generalizable due to differences between countries in terms of national recommendations and macronutrient distributions compared. For example, several of the macronutrient distributions compared were from populations that consume high amounts of rice with carbohydrate well above the AMDR and fat well below the AMDR, which is not typical of diets in the United States. Research recommendations In order to better assess the relationship between dietary patterns and/or diets based on macronutrient distribution and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity , future research may: 1. Determine the impact that dietary patterns , independent of adiposity and/or weight -loss, may have on risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and/or obesity. 2. Conduct well -designed, sufficiently powered, randomized controlled trials , including controlled feeding studies that examine the relationship between 33 dietary patterns and growth, size, body composition, and risk of overweight or obesity ; particularly lacking are studies that examine dietary patterns in children and adolescents. 3. Identify dietary patterns in childhood that may confer benefit to health outcomes including favorable growth and/or cardiometabolic health f actors, over the lifecourse. 4. Develop a standardized definition for what on macronutrient distribution. 5. Examine the relationship between diets based on macronutrient distributions that test proportions of energy from carbohydrate below 25%, within the context of specific dietary patterns, to determine if and what relationship may exist between macronutrient -based dietary patte rns and the prevention of obesity or avoidance of excess weight gain . These types of studies need to adequately control for the quality of food intake. 6. Examine additional body fat distribution outcomes and in particular, ectopic fat. 7. Explore the role that macronutrient quality may have in the relationship between \"low- carbohydrate\" diets and the prevention of obesity (i.e. effect modification), within the context of a constant dietary pattern. 8. Assess information regarding diet at more than one time- point, preferably during the course of follow -up and with more objective measures from improved technologies , to facilitate understanding the relationship between dietary patterns over time and risk of overweight/obesity. 9. Differentiate specif ic foods and food groups, in particular, the types and amounts, relevant biomarkers, and repeated measures to facilitate both preventive strategies and overall outcomes 10. Include continual updating of systematic reviews that examine the relationship between dietary patterns and growth, size, body composition, and risk of overweight/obesity to incorporate the rapidly emerging and overwhelming volume of literature on this topic, particularly in recent years . 34 Included articles 1.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.) 68 METHODOLOGY The NESR team used its rigorous, protocol -driven methodology to support the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee in updating and using an existing systematic review and conducting a new systematic review for the question: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity ?. NESR's systematic review methodology involves: Developing a protocol, Searching for and selecting studies, Extracting data from and assessing the risk of bias of each included study, Synthesizing the evidence, Developing conclusion statement s, Grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement s, and Recommending future research. A detailed descripti on of t he methodology used in answeri ng this systematic review q uesti on is available the NESR w -guidelines -advisory -committee - systematic- reviews , and can be found in 2020 Dietary G uidelines A dvisory C ommittee Report, P art C : Methodology. xxiii This sys tematic r eview w as peer reviewed by Fede ral sci entists, and information 7F22F about t he peer r eview pr ocess can also be found in the C ommittee's R eport, P art C : Methodology.

The results of t wo electronic database searches , after removal of duplicates, were combined for efficiency and screened by two NESR analysts independently using a step- wise process by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full -texts to de termine which articles met the inclusion criteria (Table 7) for each systematic review question depicted in the flow chart . Refer to Table 8 for the rationale for exclusion for each excluded full -text article. A manual search was done to find articles that were not identified when searching the electronic databases; all manually identified articles are also screened to determine whether they meet criteria for inclusion. 83 Figure 2: Flow chart of literature search and screening results 12F27Fxxviii xxviii The flow chart depicts the combined raw search totals from the electronic databases that were searched from both searches that included a total of 102,073 raw results, which were comprised of 63,384 raw results from the first search strategy and 38,689 raw results from the second search strategy as described in the Electronic databases section. That section also provides the date range searched. Search results were combined for efficiency . Results were screened toget her in sc reening software by two analysts independently . Due to topical overlap, both of the searches were designed to comprehensively identify relevant literature in this systematic review question as well as two additional systematic reviews quest ions to avoid screening the same results multiple times. 84 Excluded articles The table below lists the articles excluded after full -text screening from two literature searches for this systematic review question, as well as two additional systematic review questions.
