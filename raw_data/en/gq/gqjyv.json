Natural plant products have shown promising results as anti-cancer agents. Their effectiveness is reported as decreased toxicity in usage, along with safety and less recurrent resistances compared with hormonal targeting anti-cancer agents. Methods: A literature search was conducted for all English-language literature published prior to June 2020. The search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy included keywords such as breast cancer, herbs, anti-cancer biologically active components, clinical research, chemotherapy drugs amongst others. Results: The literature provides documented evidence of the chemo-preventative and chemotherapeutic properties of Ginseng, garlic (Allium sativum), Black cohosh (Actaea racemose), Tumeric (Curcuma longa), Camellia sinenis (green tea), Echinacea, Arctium (burdock), Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) and Black Cumin (Nigella sativa). Conclusions: The nine herbs displayed anti-cancer properties and their outcomes and mechanisms of action include inhibition of cell proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis as well as modulation of key intracellular pathways. However, more clinical trials and cohort human studies should be conducted to provide key evidence of their medical benefits.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-08-14", "cleaned_text": "Medicinal Herbs Used in Traditional Management of Breast Cancer: Mechanisms of Action [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines7080047](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines7080047) [Biological Efficacy is a very heterogeneous disease with variation in histological grade, proliferative index (Ki67), immunohistochemistry and clinical presentation [ [3](#B3-medicines-07-00047)]. The Ki67 and the Bloom-Richardson scoring system are useful in the prediction of the levels of tumor aggression, even though the same histological subtypes have different presentations in different age groups, marked by different fertility related factors, which could also affect the proliferation and management of the disease. These include fertility damage, sexual dysfunction and menopausal symptoms [ [4](#B4-medicines-07-00047)]. [5](#B5-medicines-07-00047), [6](#B6-medicines-07-00047), [7](#B7-medicines-07-00047)]. The stage of breast cancer is also predictive of survival and depends on the size of the primary breast tumor, axillary lymph node involvement as well as distant metastasis [ [8](#B8-medicines-07-00047)]. Such heterogeneity in presentation and treatment outcomes has led to a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach that involves the use of natural plant product, so as to enhance survivability. These multimodal approaches are still dependent on early detection and disease diagnosis [ [9](#B9-medicines-07-00047)]. [10](#B10-medicines-07-00047), [11](#B11-medicines-07-00047)]. Such uses are due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, coupled with their immunomodulatory properties, and abilities to induce anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on these cancer cells. This is done in a manner to present a chemo-preventative property, which can be prophylactic and therapeutic, and are safe for long term usage [ [12](#B12-medicines-07-00047)]. [13](#B13-medicines-07-00047)]. Bioactive compounds like phytoestrogens (non-steroidal phenolic compounds with structural similarities comparable with steroids like oestrogen), and isoflavinoids can act as endocrine disrupters for hormonal disorders, which are often the basis for the presentation of these cancer outcomes. These plant flavonoids are reported to possess estrogenic and or anti-estrogenic properties, which are also chemo-preventative properties [ [14](#B14-medicines-07-00047), [15](#B15-medicines-07-00047)]. They are able to inhibit oestrogen receptor dependent (cell growth and proliferations) and independent (generation of free radicals and genotoxic agents) associations and possess the ability to induce oxidative stress and cancer induction through oestrogen receptor signaling [ [16](#B16-medicines-07-00047)]. 2. Ginseng 2.1. Different Types of Ginseng and its Preparation [17](#B17-medicines-07-00047)]. The species of plants that comprise ginseng are Panax japonicus (Asian ginseng), Panax quinquefolius L. (American ginseng) and Panax ginseng [ [18](#B18-medicines-07-00047)]. Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Korean or Asian ginseng) is the most frequently used species and is cultivated in Korea and China, while Panax quinquefolius was grown originally in Canada and the United States of America [ [19](#B19-medicines-07-00047)]. In the last two decades, ginseng has become recognized as one of the most frequently used alternative and complementary herbal medicines in the West, and significant research has been conducted on Panax ginseng C.A. steroidal saponins and are regarded as being different based on the location, type and number of their sugar moieties such as xylose. [23](#B23-medicines-07-00047), [24](#B24-medicines-07-00047)]. [25](#B25-medicines-07-00047)]. The root of ginseng mainly of Rg1, Re, Rd, Rc, Rb3 and Rb1 that account for greater than 70% of the total content [ [26](#B26-medicines-07-00047)]. The pharmacology and mechanism of action of ginsenosides vary due to their different chemical structures and in purified forms, those that are commonly investigated particularly for their anti-cancer activities are Rb1, Rg1, Rg3 and Rh1 and Rh2 [ [27](#B27-medicines-07-00047)]. In ginsenosides, ginseng consists of acidic and neutral water-soluble polysaccharides present in 15% of the root [ [28](#B28-medicines-07-00047)]. 2.2. The in Vitro Anti-Tumor Effects of the Bioactve Compounds of Ginseng [29](#B29-medicines-07-00047)]. Lee et al. [ [30](#B30-medicines-07-00047)] investigated the inhibitory effect of Rh2 on the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro by using MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line. They reported that Rh2 retarded the proliferation of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line in a dose-dependent manner by inducing changes in hypo-methylated genes involved in tumorigenesis with the upregulation of ST3GAL4, C1orf198 and CLINT1 [ [30](#B30-medicines-07-00047)]. A similar mechanism by which Rh2 exerts in anti-cancer activity involves the suppression of C3orf67-AS1, a novel noncoding ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). Similar results were reported in an earlier study where Rh2 inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line by increasing the protein expression of p21 and decreasing protein levels of cyclin D, resulting in lower phosphorylation of pRb and down-regulation of cyclin/Cdk complex kinase activity [ [33](#B33-medicines-07-00047)]. Furthermore, the mechanism by which Rh2 exerts its anti-cancer activity involves inhibiting the manufacture of inflammatory cytokines such interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- through obstructing the nuclear factor (NF)-B signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). Two recent studies reported that Rg3 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells by the deregulation of the tumor-related genes NOX4 and KDM5A by modification of the epigenetic methylation levels [ [47](#B47-medicines-07-00047)], and through phospho-proteomic analysis, Rg3 regulated a number of central inhibitors of nuclear factor-B signaling, cell division and protein synthesis [ [48](#B48-medicines-07-00047)]. [49](#B49-medicines-07-00047)]. In another study Rg3 induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line by blocking NF-B signaling via the inactivation of Akt and ERK kinases, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell cycle progression [ [50](#B50-medicines-07-00047)]. Rg3 in inducing apoptosis destabilizes the mutant tumor suppressor protein p53 which can extend the activation of the transcription factor NF-B [ [50](#B50-medicines-07-00047)]. [51](#B51-medicines-07-00047)]. In a study by Chen et al. 20(S)-Rg3 reduced the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [ [52](#B52-medicines-07-00047)]. The CXCR4 receptor expressed by breast cancer cells and its ligand CXCL12, has a critical role in the metastasis. By decreasing the expression of CXCR4, Rg3 decreases metastasis to bones, lungs and lymph nodes [ [52](#B52-medicines-07-00047), [53](#B53-medicines-07-00047)]. 2.3. Effects of Ginseng in Combination with Anti-Cancer Drugs [54](#B54-medicines-07-00047), [55](#B55-medicines-07-00047)]. The co-administration of 20(s)-ginsenoside Rg3 orally and paclitaxel enhanced the relative bioavailability of paclitaxel and reduce the growth rate of the breast tumor in nude mice with MCF-7 xenograft [ [54](#B54-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). In a novel fluoropyrimidine carbamate, fluorouracil (5-FU), and Rg3 exhibited less toxicity caused by capecitabine, decreased susceptibility to drug resistance and enhanced better survival in mice with breast cancer [ [55](#B55-medicines-07-00047)]. Rg3 enhanced the antiangiogenic effects of capecitabine by decreasing microvasculature density and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a mice model [ [55](#B55-medicines-07-00047)]. 2.4. Clinical Studies with Ginseng [68](#B68-medicines-07-00047)]. In a study of 1,455 primary breast cancer patients enrolled in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, ginseng use post-cancer diagnosis was positively associated with improved quality of life, with the strongest effects in the social and psychological wellbeing domains [ [69](#B69-medicines-07-00047)]. However, a later study of 4,149 women with primary breast cancer, who participated in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, where ginseng use was assessed at 6- and 36- periods, showed no improved quality of life among the breast cancer survivors particularly in the physical, social and psychological domains [ [70](#B70-medicines-07-00047)]. The authors explained the variability in response to the design of the study and the different doses of ginseng used among breast cancer survivors. 3. Garlic (Allium Sativum) 3.1. The Bioactive Compounds of Garlic [71](#B71-medicines-07-00047)]. Garlic has a high content of sulfur containing compounds which has been observed when fresh or crushed. These compounds include amino acid and the major bioactive compound found in raw garlic homogenate or in aqueous extracts of garlic is converted to allicin by the enzyme alliinase. Allicin is an oily, slightly yellow organosulfur compound that contributes to the unique odor of garlic. When formed from Alliin, it is unstable and due to it being self-reactive, is quickly changed into a stable organosulfur compound such as diallyl disulfide [ [73](#B73-medicines-07-00047)]. Garlic also consists of compounds of steroidal and phenolic constituents, such as carbohydrates, fiber, proteins and trace elements like selenium [ [74](#B74-medicines-07-00047)]. Allyl sulfur compounds present in garlic are lipid soluble and include S-allylmercaptocysteine, diallyl trisulfide and diallyl disulfide [ [75](#B75-medicines-07-00047)]. 3.2. In Vitro and in Vivo Studies of the Active Compounds of Ginseng and Their Anti-Cancer Effect [76](#B76-medicines-07-00047)]. Further, preclinical investigations provide convincing evidence that garlic and its organosulfur compounds inhibit carcinogen-induced tumors in various organs [ [77](#B77-medicines-07-00047), [78](#B78-medicines-07-00047)]. Over the last few decades, there have been numerous studies conducted in vitro and in vivo that have proposed possible anti-tumor effects of the bioactive constituents of garlic, mainly the allylsulfide derivatives in different preparations. Garlic derivatives such as S-allylcysteine (SAC) and S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) have been described to moderate a number of molecular mechanisms in the initiation of cancer formation such as scavenging of free radicals, angiogenesis, DNA adduct formation, cell proliferation mutagenesis [ [79](#B79-medicines-07-00047)]. [80](#B80-medicines-07-00047), [81](#B81-medicines-07-00047)]. The mechanism of action includes the induction of apoptosis, the regulation of cell-cycle arrest and stimulation of enzymes that are involved in the detoxification of carcinogens [ [82](#B82-medicines-07-00047)]. Diallyl disulfide was reported to synergize the outcome of the breast cancer suppressor eicosapentaenoic acid and antagonize the effects of the breast cancer enhancer linoleic acid, in breast cancer cell lines in culture [ [81](#B81-medicines-07-00047)]. [82](#B82-medicines-07-00047), [83](#B83-medicines-07-00047), [84](#B84-medicines-07-00047), [85](#B85-medicines-07-00047)]. In a recent study that examined the anti-tumor efficacy of diallyl disulfide, the garlic derivative was found to impede the growth of breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro using animal models [ [37](#B37-medicines-07-00047)]. The mechanism of action of diallyl disulfide involves the induction of apoptosis through the expression, upregulating the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and NQO1, and inhibiting the oxidative an anti-tumor protein [ [37](#B37-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). Similarly, in an earlier study, diallyl trisulfide was reported to suppress the growth of non-tumorigenic MCF-12a mammary epithelial cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis that was associated with the upregulation of p53 protein expression and increased pro-apoptotic Bax protein [ [86](#B86-medicines-07-00047)]. Garlic rich in selenium was found to be more potent than organosulfur analogues in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells in culture [ [81](#B81-medicines-07-00047)]. 3.3. Clinical Studies with Garlic [87](#B87-medicines-07-00047), [88](#B88-medicines-07-00047)]. However, there are fewer reports of the association between breast cancer and garlic intake. In a recent study of population-based, case-control study of 314 primary breast cancer cases, where dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, there was an inverse association between breast cancer and high consumption of garlic (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30-0.87) and moderate (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35-1.01) [ [89](#B89-medicines-07-00047)]. The authors suggest that high garlic consumption is protective against breast cancer in the Puerto Rican population [ [89](#B89-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 3](#medicines-07-00047-t003)). [90](#B90-medicines-07-00047)]. A meta-analysis of Swiss and Italian case-control studies which investigated the frequency of garlic use and cancer at different sites showed an odds ratio of 0.90 for breast cancer [ [91](#B91-medicines-07-00047)]. [92](#B92-medicines-07-00047)]. 4. Black Cohosh racemosa) Black Cohosh cohosh root consists of more than 42 triterpene glycosides, 11 phenolic acids, and more than 70 The triterpene glycosides such as actein, well as phenylpropanoids such as phenylpropanoid isoferulic acid are the major secondary compounds and biologically active components of black cohosh [ [99](#B99-medicines-07-00047), [100](#B100-medicines-07-00047)]. The alkaloids, tannins and flavonoids in the rhizome are regarded as possibly biologically active compounds [ [101](#B101-medicines-07-00047)]. Chemical research described approximately 15 polyphenolic components including fukiic acid, piscidic acid, caffeic acid and their derivatives [ [102](#B102-medicines-07-00047)]. Studies have also identified an isoflavone, formononetin, in black cohosh [ [103](#B103-medicines-07-00047)]. Remifemin, an extract of the rhizome is commercially formulated and along with other varieties of black cohosh though not standardized are available in the United States [ [104](#B104-medicines-07-00047)]. 4.2. Clinical Studies with Black Cohosh [105](#B105-medicines-07-00047)]. Hot flashes are unexpected surges of sweats and hot skin due to decreased ovarian function as a consequence of breast cancer therapy or natural menopause. They arise less often in females experiencing perimenopause than menopause and there is evidence in the literature that among nonprescription therapies, black cohosh is a commonly used supplement to alleviate hot flashes [ [106](#B106-medicines-07-00047)]. Studies have reported that extracts from black cohosh lessens hot flashes as well as anxiety, insomnia and other peri-menopausal symptoms in patients with primary breast cancer [ [107](#B107-medicines-07-00047), [108](#B108-medicines-07-00047)]. The biological activity of black cohosh is due to the presence of various phytochemicals such as isoflavones which are estrogen-like substances and polyphenols [ [109](#B109-medicines-07-00047)]. [110](#B110-medicines-07-00047)]. In addition to the estrogenic mechanism, it is proposed that black cohosh may act through a serotonergic mechanism that involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ [111](#B111-medicines-07-00047)]. There are also other proposed actions of black cohosh via other tissue-dependent mechanisms including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and dopaminergic signaling where there is obstruction proliferation [ [112](#B112-medicines-07-00047)]. [56](#B56-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 3](#medicines-07-00047-t003)). [113](#B113-medicines-07-00047)]. A second prospective trial that investigated the effect of Remifemin (one capsule of 20 mg daily for 4 weeks) on hot flashes in 21 postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer demonstrated a significant 56% decline in hot-flash score (95% CI: 40-71%) and mean number of hot flashes per day from a baseline value of 8.3 to 4.2 at the end of the study [ [114](#B114-medicines-07-00047)]. [115](#B115-medicines-07-00047)]. In the second study of 89 breast cancer patients who had finished their treatment with tamoxifen, over a 60-day period post-treatment, there were decreases in the intensity and number of hot flashes. However, there were no statistically significant differences between those treated with black cohosh and placebo [ [116](#B116-medicines-07-00047)]. 5. Tumeric Curcuminoids are natural polyphenol compounds and three types namely diferuloylmethane (curcumin I), desmetoxicurcumin (curcumin II) and bisdemetoxicurcumin (Curcumin III). The primary curcuminoid is diferuloylmethane that has the highest concentration (77%) and gives turmeric its yellow color [ [118](#B118-medicines-07-00047)]. Tumeric also contains sugars, resins, proteins as well as three main volatile oils (zingiberene, tumerone and atlatone) which possess pharmacological activity [ [119](#B119-medicines-07-00047)]. Curcumin is recognized as non-toxic and safe. Its therapeutic benefits are due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [ [120](#B120-medicines-07-00047)]. However, the major concern with curcumin is its poor bioavailability due to low intestinal absorption coupled with rapid metabolism and elimination. The bioavailability of curcumin could be improved by developing innovative derivatives which block its metabolic pathway [ [121](#B121-medicines-07-00047)]. 5.2. In Vitro Studies of the Anti-Cancer Effects of Curcumin [122](#B122-medicines-07-00047)]. These include: inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis, initiation of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, upregulation of TIMP 1 and 4 expression, suppression of FABP5/PPAR/ pathway, inactivation of Akt/mTOR pathway and EGFR/PEGFR signaling pathway [ [122](#B122-medicines-07-00047)]. The molecular targets in the cell signal pathway that are modulated by curcumin by Liu et al., curcumin exerts its anti-tumor activity by the inhibition of cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and BT-483 breast cancer cells, and invasion via downregulation of NF-B, transcription of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-1 and cyclin D, a cell cycle regulatory protein [ [38](#B38-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). An in vitro study using MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated that curcumin dose-dependently impedes the metastatic progression In a recent study, curcumin prohibited human GH triggered invasion and metastasis in T47D human breast cancer cells via downregulation of NF-B signaling and miR-182-96-183 cluster expression [ [126](#B126-medicines-07-00047)]. In a similar study using MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, curcumin prohibited human GH triggered invasion and metastasis via suppression of NF-B signaling, modulating cell survival and activating polyamine metabolism [ [127](#B127-medicines-07-00047)]. [39](#B39-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). In addition to the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in 30-40% of breast cancer cases and there is evidence of metastasis, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance [ [128](#B128-medicines-07-00047)]. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, curcumin dose-dependently reduced the expression of Akt protein as well as activate autophagy and suppressed the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [ [129](#B129-medicines-07-00047)]. [130](#B130-medicines-07-00047)]. Curcumin exerted autophagy and induced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by downregulating the Bcl-2 signaling cascade and blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [ [131](#B131-medicines-07-00047)]. Moreover, it is suggested that curcumin has good prospects for treating HER-2-overexpressed breast cancer. In the BT-474 xenograft breast cancer model, it suppresses [ [132](#B132-medicines-07-00047)]. [133](#B133-medicines-07-00047)]. It has been demonstrated that the anti-cancer effect of curcumin involves significant suppression of growth and apoptosis induction of MCF-7 breast cancer cells via the reduction of miR-21. The key molecular mechanism involved in the anti-cancer efficacy of curcumin is the inhibition of the miR-21/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway [ [134](#B134-medicines-07-00047)]. In another study using the MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, curcumin reversed the proliferative effects bisphenol A (BPA) by downregulating oncogenic miR-19b and miR-19a and downstream targets such as p53, p-Akt, PTEN and p-MDM2, and multiplying cell nuclear antigen [ [135](#B135-medicines-07-00047)]. The study also suggests that curcumin reversed the breast cancer progression by BPA by regulating the miR-19/PTEN/Akt/p53 pathway [ [135](#B135-medicines-07-00047)]. Furthermore, the incubation of curcumin with MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vitro resulted in the downregulation of the apoptosis suppressor gene Bcl-2 by increased expression of miR-16 and miR-15 [ [136](#B136-medicines-07-00047)]. Interestingly, the putative anti-tumor actions of curcumin involve its interaction with a tumor-suppressive miRNAs and miR-19b and miR-19a that are downregulated. These effects lead to the induction of apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of tumorigenesis and metastasis [ [137](#B137-medicines-07-00047)]. 5.3. Effects of Curcumin in Combination with Anti-Cancer Drugs [138](#B138-medicines-07-00047)]. The mechanism of action of the paclitaxel-curcumin combination involved a reduction in the expression of the regulatory protein Bcl-2 and decreased in the EGFR signaling blockade [ [138](#B138-medicines-07-00047)]. Similarly, paclitaxel and curcumin in corroborating their apoptotic effect decreased breast carcinogenesis by downregulating the of Rho-A, p53, c-Ha-Ras and Bcl-2 in [57](#B57-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). In an earlier metabolomic study conducted by Bayet-Robert and Morvan, curcumin alone or in association with docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug induces metabolic properties such as glucose utilization, lipid and glutathione metabolism in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells [ [139](#B139-medicines-07-00047)]. [140](#B140-medicines-07-00047)]. The therapeutic efficacy of 5-FU is reduced due to resistance in breast cancer cells caused by overexpression of TS. Curcumin administration was found to sensitize MCF-7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to 5-FU via reduction in the expression of TS thereby factor-B [ [58](#B58-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). Moreover, curcumin increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to cisplatin, a potent antineoplastic drug by decreasing the expression of Flap endonuclease 1, a structure-specific nuclease that stimulates DNA replication and repair [ [141](#B141-medicines-07-00047)]. [142](#B142-medicines-07-00047)]. It also restores tamoxifen sensitivity via inhibition of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in antiestrogen-resistant MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9 breast cancer cell lines [ [143](#B143-medicines-07-00047)]. Finally, studies have reported a synergistic association of curcumin with other therapeutic agents such as carnosol, resveratrol, silibinin, Camellia Sinenis (Green Tea) 6.1. The Bioactive Compounds of Green Tea [146](#B146-medicines-07-00047)]. Green tea consists of bioactive polyphenols, and extracts in powder or liquid forms differ in the proportion of 45.0-90.0% polyphenols and 0.4-10.0% caffeine. The polyphenols and phenolic acids [ [147](#B147-medicines-07-00047)]. Catechins are a main class of flavonoids in the leaves of green tea and comprise 30-42% of the full dry weight of green tea. The catechins include epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), epicatechin respectively [ [148](#B148-medicines-07-00047)]. The catechins present in the highest quantities are epigallocatechin-3-gallate, which accounts for 50-70% of the total quantity and is the most effective biologically active component of the leaves of green tea [ [149](#B149-medicines-07-00047)]. [150](#B150-medicines-07-00047)]. In addition to polyphenols, green tea consists of amino acids such as aspartic acids, tryptophan, serine, threonine; carbohydrates such as fructose, cellulose, glucose and sucrose; minerals and trace elements such as magnesium, calcium, iron, selenium and aluminum; vitamins (E, C and alkaloids theophylline, theobromide and [151](#B151-medicines-07-00047)]. [152](#B152-medicines-07-00047)]. In addition, clinical trials and epidemiological studies demonstrated that green tea may reduce the risk of many chronic non-communicable diseases [ [153](#B153-medicines-07-00047)]. The efficacy of green tea has been attributed to epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) [ [154](#B154-medicines-07-00047)]. 6.2. In Vivo and Clinical Studies of the Anti-Cancer Effects of Green Tea [93](#B93-medicines-07-00047), [94](#B94-medicines-07-00047), [155](#B155-medicines-07-00047)]. A number of studies evaluated whether green tea consumption or its constituents could be effective in reducing breast cancer risk [ [94](#B94-medicines-07-00047), [155](#B155-medicines-07-00047), [156](#B156-medicines-07-00047)]. In the sister study, utilizing data of 45,744 United States and Puerto Rica females, drinking five cups or more green tea per week may be related to a reduction in breast cancer risk [ [156](#B156-medicines-07-00047)]. Similarly in a case-control study of 1009 female patients with primary breast cancer and their 1009 age-matched controls in Southeast Asia, consistent consumption of dried green tea leaves offers protection against breast cancer (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.78; p < 0.01 annum) [ [93](#B93-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 3](#medicines-07-00047-t003)). Moreover, in a study of 472 female breast cancer patients with stage I, II and III breast cancer, the consumption of five or more cups per day gave a relative risk of recurrence of 0.564 (95% CI: 0.35-0.91) and prior use before diagnosis was significantly associated with better prognosis of stage I and II [ [94](#B94-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 3](#medicines-07-00047-t003)). In addition, in a recent observational study of 1,551 breast cancer patients, better progression-free and survival was seen in those who regularly consumed green tea (HR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11-0.84) particularly those females with normal lipids [ [155](#B155-medicines-07-00047)]. [157](#B157-medicines-07-00047)]. In addition, a prospective study of 1,268 incident cases of breast cancer with a follow-up of 12 years, green tea consumption of 4 cups/day was not related to breast cancer risk among African American women [ [158](#B158-medicines-07-00047)]. [159](#B159-medicines-07-00047)]. Similarly, a meta-analysis 163,810 breast cancer patients in eight cohort studies and five case-control studies showed an inverse statistically significant relationship between breast cancer risk and green tea consumption (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92, p = 0.0001; [ [160](#B160-medicines-07-00047)]. [161](#B161-medicines-07-00047)]; no significant relationship between consumption of cups of green tea/day and developing breast cancer in cohort studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.71-1.10, p > 0.05) [ [162](#B162-medicines-07-00047)] and the analysis of nine case-control studies, four cohort studies revealed that green tea consumption may not reduce breast cancer risk (overall OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, p = 0.031) [ [163](#B163-medicines-07-00047)]. [164](#B164-medicines-07-00047), [165](#B165-medicines-07-00047)]. In a cohort prospective study conducted in China of 353 breast cancer cases and 701 matched nested controls, urinary tea polyphenols (4-methyl-epigallocatechin, epicatechin and epigallocatechin) and their well as flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin were determined by mass spectrometry. The majority of the patients regularly consumed at least one cup of green tea, and they reported an inverse relationship between breast cancer risk and urinary concentration of epicatechin (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.88) for the intermediate excretion range [ [164](#B164-medicines-07-00047)]. In another prospective cohort study of 144 patients with breast cancer and 288 matched controls, plasma concentrations of tea catechins such as epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and EGCG were determined. There was no overall statistically significant relationship between breast cancer risk and the plasma levels of the tea catechins [ [165](#B165-medicines-07-00047)]. [166](#B166-medicines-07-00047)]. In a cross-sectional study of 3,315 breast cancer patients, those who daily consume green tea (particularly postmenopausal women) demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mammographic density percentage (19.5%) than non-tea users (21.7%; p < 0.05) after correction for numerous possible confounders [ [167](#B167-medicines-07-00047)]. In a latter study that was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial, 1,075 healthy postmenopausal women were supplemented daily with four decaffeinated green tea capsules (1315 mg total catechins of which 843 mg is epigallocatechin-3-gallate) for 12 months. There was a significant reduction in the change percent mammographic density (PMD) by 4.40% compared with 1.02% PMD elevation for pre-menopausal women, but not for their postmenopausal counterparts [ [168](#B168-medicines-07-00047)]. The authors suggested that further exploration of the possible chemo-preventative effect of the consumption of green tea on the risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal women is merited [ [168](#B168-medicines-07-00047)]. [169](#B169-medicines-07-00047)]. In a case-control study of 589 incident cases and 563 population-based controls conducted among Asian-American women, Wu et al. observed that the consumption of green tea was significantly related to decreased breast cancer risk (adjusted OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29-0.77) among those who possess low activity COMT allele compared with nondrinkers. Conversely, no relationship was observed between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk among those who possess high activity COMT allele compared with nondrinkers (adjusted OR = addition, a population-based study of 3454 incident breast cancer cases and 3474 controls (aged 20-74 years) conducted in a Chinese population showed that the COMT rs4680 genotypes did not have any altering effect on the relationship between breast cancer risk and green tea consumption [ [171](#B171-medicines-07-00047)]. The association between regular green tea intake and reduced breast cancer risk is weak (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.98) compared with nondrinkers [ [171](#B171-medicines-07-00047)]. Therefore, additional studies are warranted to resolve these varying findings. 6.3. Effects of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate in Combination with Anti-Cancer Drugs [59](#B59-medicines-07-00047), [172](#B172-medicines-07-00047), [173](#B173-medicines-07-00047)]. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine is a demethylating agent that improves the susceptibility of breast cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. The combination of EGCG and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines caused significant inhibition of cell proliferation compared to individual treatment and decreased toxicity of the demethylating agent [ [172](#B172-medicines-07-00047)]. Similarly, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with EGCG and quercetin, as well as tamoxifen resulted in reduced cell proliferation [ [59](#B59-medicines-07-00047)]. Another in vivo study reported that the combination of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and EGCG inhibits growth and proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines via the modulating of the expression of miR-221/222 and tumor suppressors, PTEN and p27 [ [173](#B173-medicines-07-00047)]. Moreover, the combination of EGCG and sunitinib in MCF-7, H460, and H1975 breast cancer cell lines resulted in greater shrinkage of tumor than with the drug alone via suppression of the IRS/MAPK signaling pathway, induced by EGCG [ [174](#B174-medicines-07-00047)]. Together, the findings of a synergistic relationship of EGCG with anti-cancer agents reported in these studies represent a promising approach for the treatment of breast cancer. 7. Echinacea 7.1. Species of Echinacea and Their Bioactive Compounds [175](#B175-medicines-07-00047)]. There are nine species of Echinacea, three of which are commonly used as phyto-therapeutic products. These are Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea pallida. The roots and rhizomes of the three species and the flowering parts of Echinacea purpurea are used for medicinal purposes that are present in 80% of the commercial products of Echinacea [ [176](#B176-medicines-07-00047)]. High-pressure liquid chromatography has been used to identify and isolate the chemical constituents of Echinacea. The components that have been recognized are caffeic acid, chicoric acid, cynarin, purpurea contain chicoric acid, caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid. On the other hand, the root of Echinacea pallida contains chicoric acid, caftaric acid and echinacoside [ [159](#B159-medicines-07-00047)]. Furthermore, the aerial and of [177](#B177-medicines-07-00047)]. Echinacea is a common herbal supplement that is rich in flavonoids, extensively used for its therapeutic properties including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune-stimulant properties [ [178](#B178-medicines-07-00047)]. 7.2. In Vitro and Clinical Studies of Echinacea and Drug-Herbal Interaction [179](#B179-medicines-07-00047)]. There are few studies that have examined the usage of Echinacea among patients with breast cancer [ [180](#B180-medicines-07-00047), [181](#B181-medicines-07-00047)]. Ma et al. reported that herbal remedies including Echinacea, ginko biloba and herbal teas were associated with worse physical component scores for health-related quality of life among breast cancer survivors [ [180](#B180-medicines-07-00047)]. The Black Women's Health Study documented the increased use of herbs such as Echinacea among breast cancer survivors and the possible interaction with adjuvant therapies such as anastrazole and tamoxifen [ [181](#B181-medicines-07-00047)]. [40](#B40-medicines-07-00047)] a constituent of the root of Echinacea Pallida decreased proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cell line [ [182](#B182-medicines-07-00047)]. [183](#B183-medicines-07-00047)]. Doxorubicin is an anti-cancer drug that is used for the management of metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer. It is expansively metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4, and Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea Pallida may decrease its efficacy, reduce the plasma levels and possibly cause an under-treatment for patients receiving this anti-cancer drug [ [184](#B184-medicines-07-00047)]. Huntimer and colleagues reported that constituents of the roots of Echinacea angustifolia (ethyl acetate fraction and chicoric acid) and doxorubicin increased cell growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and could interfere with the efficacy of the anti-cancer drug [ [185](#B185-medicines-07-00047)]. An in vitro study involving the treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with hexane fractions of Echinacea purpurea reported a reduction in proliferation, and cynarin from the roots of Echinacea angustifolia also showed anti-proliferative activity. The authors also posited that cynarin enhanced the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin against MCF-7 breast cancer cells [ [60](#B60-medicines-07-00047)]. Based on the potential for Echinacea-doxorubicin interaction, it is suggested that the former should be monitored more closely. There is also a report of a safe dose of an extract of Echinacea purpurea that did not interact with docetaxel as well as a recommended schedule proposed by Goey and colleagues [ [60](#B60-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table Burdock [186](#B186-medicines-07-00047)]. There are 18 documented species of Arctium of which three are quite common particularly in central Europe. They are Arctium lappa (greater burdock), Arctium burdock) [188](#B188-medicines-07-00047)]; its leaves are used as an anti-inflammatory agent in traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal disorders in Brazil [ [189](#B189-medicines-07-00047)]. Both fruits and roots are used to treat diabetes mellitus in Asian countries [ [190](#B190-medicines-07-00047)]. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends the roots of Arctium tomentosum and of Arctium lappa as adjunct therapy for seborrheic skin conditions and urinary tract infections [ [191](#B191-medicines-07-00047)]. [192](#B192-medicines-07-00047)]. Lignans are the biologically active components of the Arctium genus and include mainly arctigenin, a dietary phytoestrogen and arctiin its glycoside present in fruits, leaves, seeds and roots Arctium tomentosum and Arctium lappa [ their glycosides. Flavonoids such as isoquercetin and rutin, which are the two main constituents, and minor ones including quercimeritrin, quercetin, quercitrin, astragalin and quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, have been reported to be present in leaves, fruits, seeds and roots of Arctium lappa [ [194](#B194-medicines-07-00047), [195](#B195-medicines-07-00047)]. Arctigenin is widely used in traditional medicine and numerous studies have reported the therapeutic potential of this compound as an immune modulator, anti-inflammatory and antitumor agent [ [196](#B196-medicines-07-00047), [197](#B197-medicines-07-00047)]. There has been significant interest in the antitumor activity of arctigenin, particularly in in vitro studies using several human cancer cell lines such as the lung, stomach, intestine, ovaries and breast [ [41](#B41-medicines-07-00047), [198](#B198-medicines-07-00047), [199](#B199-medicines-07-00047)]. 8.2. In Vitro Studies of the Antitumor Activities of Arctium Lappa [197](#B197-medicines-07-00047)]. The mechanism of action of arctigenin was the downregulation of the expression of matrix metallo-proteinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9 which has a role in metastasis, as well as heparanase expression [ [197](#B197-medicines-07-00047)]. In an earlier study, arctigenin from Arctium lappa inhibited cell growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism of apoptosis involves activation of the ROS/p38 MAPK pathway which subsequently induce mitochondrial another exerted anti-metastatic effects on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines by inhibiting the NF-B, signaling pathways, contain chlorogenic acid, quercetin, caffeic acid and arctigenin compounds exhibited anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells [ [200](#B200-medicines-07-00047)]. 8.3. Effects of Arctium Lappa in Combination with Anti-Cancer Drugs [61](#B61-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). In another study, arctigenin decreased the proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of triple-negative breast cancer cells via downregulation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) particularly STAT3 [ [201](#B201-medicines-07-00047)]. It is noteworthy that arctigenin augmented the cytotoxicity induced by taxotere on triple-negative breast cancer cells [ [201](#B201-medicines-07-00047)]. 9. Flaxseed The Bioactive Compounds of Flaxseed [202](#B202-medicines-07-00047)]. Flaxseed is a main plant source of essential fatty acids and its physico-composition includes: lignans, minerals such as magnesium, phosphorous and such as globulins (linin and conlinin) and glutelin present in ratios of 80% to 20%, insoluble (cellulose and lignin) and soluble (mucilage gums) dietary fibers, and soluble polysaccharides and vitamins (A, C and E) [ [203](#B203-medicines-07-00047)]. [204](#B204-medicines-07-00047)]. Flaxseed has dietary characteristics and its oil consists of lipids such as -linolenic acid (-3 fatty acid) the main acids (39.00-60.42%) stearic and palmate (9%) [ [206](#B206-medicines-07-00047)]. The possible health benefits of flaxseed include nutrition due to the high content of -linolenic acid, richness in both insoluble and soluble fibers, and lignans which have both estrogenic and antioxidant properties [ [207](#B207-medicines-07-00047)]. 9.2. Experimental In Vitro Studies of the Antitumor Activities of Flaxseed [208](#B208-medicines-07-00047)]. Experimental studies have investigated the anti-tumorigenic effect of flaxseed and some of these involved animals, where mice were injected with breast tumor cells. Chen et al. investigated the effects of dietary flaxseed on the growth of human breast tumor, and possible mechanism(s) of action using athymic mice inoculated with human estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7). There were significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induced apoptosis via reduced mRNA expressions of cyclin D1, [ [43](#B43-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). Earlier, the same research group reported a 45% reduction in tumor growth rate in a nude mice model injected with MDA-MB-435 treated with 10% flaxseed. [209](#B209-medicines-07-00047)]. and ex-induced growth in mice inoculated with MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The in vivo findings were confirmed in vitro as flaxseed and its lignans inhibited the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor, which is an effective potent stimulator of angiogenesis [ [210](#B210-medicines-07-00047)]. Conversely, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a lignin present in flaxseed, did not reduce breast tumor growth nor induce apoptosis in athymic mice [ [211](#B211-medicines-07-00047)]. 9.3. Effects of Flaxseed in Combination with Anti-Cancer Drugs [212](#B212-medicines-07-00047)]. The side effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes and many patients with breast cancer use phytoestrogen-rich foods such as flaxseed and soy to diminish the symptoms and also to enhance the effect of the drug [ [213](#B213-medicines-07-00047)]. There are studies that have investigated whether flaxseed augments or interferes with the effect of tamoxifen. In an in vivo study conducted by Chen et al. with athymic mice inoculated with MCF-7 breast cancer cells and implanted with an E2 pellet, flaxseed inhibited the growth of the tumor size by 74%, while both tamoxifen and flaxseed caused tumor regression by over 53%. It was observed that flaxseed at both high and low E2 levels augment the tumor-inhibited effects of tamoxifen [ [62](#B62-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). In another study by the same research group, long-term treatment of athymic mice with combined tamoxifen and 10% flaxseed reduced the tumor size by 55%, due to the induction of apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. The mechanisms of action involves the downregulation of the expressions of estrogen receptor alpha, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and cyclin D1, as well as signal transduction pathways [ [214](#B214-medicines-07-00047)]. There was a similar finding by Saggar et al., where secoisolariciresinol diglucoside and flaxseed oil decreased the growth of tamoxifen-treated tumors via decreasing the expressions of genes and proteins involved in the estrogen receptor- and growth factor-mediated signaling pathways [ [215](#B215-medicines-07-00047)]. Further, flaxseed oil enhanced the reducing effects of trastuzumab on HER2-overexpressing tumor (BT-474) growth via lowering the phosphorylated/total phosphorylated expression MAPK and Akt proteins [ [63](#B63-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). 9.4. Clinical Studies ( [Table trial of postmenopausal women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, dietary flaxseed reduced tumor growth. This was concomitant with the downregulation of c-erbB2 expression and reduced Ki-67 labeling index, a marker of tumor cell proliferation [ [96](#B96-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 3](#medicines-07-00047-t003)). Conversely, isoflavones or lignans from flaxseed did not significantly reduce breast cancer risk of breast cancer cases in the Ontario Cancer Registry [ [216](#B216-medicines-07-00047)]. [217](#B217-medicines-07-00047)]. Another meta-analysis of 21 studies (11 prospective cohort studies and 10 case-control studies) reported an association between high lignin intake and reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women [ [218](#B218-medicines-07-00047)]. Similarly, in three separate meta-analyses, high levels of lignan or enterolignan intake significantly lower the risk of breast cancer [ [219](#B219-medicines-07-00047)]. [220](#B220-medicines-07-00047)]. In a population-based case-control study of 3024 3420 controls, dietary phytoestrogen intake (isoflavones and lignans) during adolescence was concomitant with decreased breast cancer risk [ [221](#B221-medicines-07-00047)]. In an earlier conducted prospective cohort study of 58,049 postmenopausal French women followed for 7.7 years, those with total lignan intake (pinoresinol, lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol, and matairesinol) greater than 1395 micrograms/day had a significant reduction on breast cancer risk. It is noted that the favorable effects of the lignans were limited to breast cancer cases who were progesterone receptor-positive and ER+ [ [222](#B222-medicines-07-00047)]. Additionally, postmenopausal breast cancer patients with high levels of enterolactone had significantly reduced the risk of death, particularly those who were estrogen receptor-negative [ [223](#B223-medicines-07-00047)]. Conversely, a prospective cohort study suggests that high levels of enterolactone may not protect women from developing breast cancer [ [224](#B224-medicines-07-00047)]. Therefore, randomized control trials are needed to fully establish the association between flaxseed and its components, and breast cancer risk. 10. Black Cumin (Nigella sativa) 10.1. The Bioactive Compounds of Nigella sativa [225](#B225-medicines-07-00047)]. Numerous active ingredients in Nigella sativa are present in the seeds. The seeds of Nigella sativa comprise fats (28.5%), proteins (8.4%) [ [226](#B226-medicines-07-00047), [227](#B227-medicines-07-00047)]. In examining the fat components in the seeds of Nigella sativa, oils constitutes 32-40% of the total composition, unsaturated fatty acid such as linoleic acid is present in high concentrations (50-60%). Other unsaturated fatty acids include (3%) and oleic acid (20%) and the notable presence of saturated fatty acids such as stearic and palmitic stearic acids that comprise approximately 30 per cent [ [228](#B228-medicines-07-00047), [229](#B229-medicines-07-00047)]. There are over 100 bioactive compounds present in the seeds of Nigella sativa; four pharmacologically significant [ [229](#B229-medicines-07-00047)]. [230](#B230-medicines-07-00047)]. Thymoquinone being the main component of the essential oil in the seeds of Nigella sativa, along the seeds are utilized for medicinal purposes and possesses antidiabetic, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, hepato-protective, Thymoquinone's Anti-Cancer Effects In Vitro and In Vivo Animal Models [233](#B233-medicines-07-00047)]. There are a number of studies that have shown that thymoquinone inhibits tumorigenesis via a number of molecular mechanisms, and there is evidence that in in vitro applications, it induces apoptosis in several breast cancer cell lines [ [234](#B234-medicines-07-00047), [235](#B235-medicines-07-00047)]. Thymoquinone has been shown to [44](#B44-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). Rajput et al. [ [44](#B44-medicines-07-00047)] investigated its mechanism of action relating to PI3K/Akt signaling and downstream targets with subsequent apoptosis in cancer cells. Thymoquinone induces apoptosis in T-47D and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells by promoting G(1) phase arrest via translation upregulation of Bcl-xL [44](#B44-medicines-07-00047)] study, thymoquinone induces apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line through the upregulation of the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 in a time-dependent manner [ [45](#B45-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). Similarly, another study that investigated the efficacy of long-term in vitro treatment with thymoquinone showed sustained inhibition of proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines due to S phase and G2 phase arrest [ [236](#B236-medicines-07-00047)]. There is also evidence that methanolic extract of Nigella sativa (at doses of 2.5-5 g/mL) suppresses the proliferation of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells via the induction of apoptosis [ [237](#B237-medicines-07-00047)]. Methanolic extract of Nigella sativa seeds also induced apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via both the caspase and p53 pathways [ [238](#B238-medicines-07-00047)]. Notably, the mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of thymoquinone on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells involves the modulation of the PPAR- activation pathway. Thymoquinone elevates PPAR- activity and downregulates the expression of genes for survivin, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [ [239](#B239-medicines-07-00047)]. [240](#B240-medicines-07-00047)]. There are studies that have investigated the potential of thymoquinone from Nigella sativa to suppress tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer in in vitro and animal models [ [241](#B241-medicines-07-00047), [242](#B242-medicines-07-00047)]. Shanmugam et al. investigated the possible effect of thymoquinone from the seeds of Nigella sativa on the regulation and expression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells [ [46](#B46-medicines-07-00047)]. Thymoquinone downregulated the expressions of CXCR4 in breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, demonstrating its anti-metastatic effect [ [46](#B46-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 1](#medicines-07-00047-t001)). In an earlier study, seed extracts from Nigella sativa injected into the tumor site of DBA2/P815 (H2d) mouse decrease tumor volume, inhibited the development of liver metastasis and improved survival [ [243](#B243-medicines-07-00047)]. Likewise, thymoquinone treatment inhibited the development and metastasis of cell-derived xenograft tumors in mice via reduced activity and mRNA expression of the transcription factor TWIST1. This resulted in reduced migration and invasion of breast cancer cells [ [244](#B244-medicines-07-00047)]. Interestingly, supercritical carbon dioxide extracts of the seeds of Nigella sativa exhibited anti-metastatic and pro-apoptotic properties by inhibiting migration and invasion of estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) sub-cytotoxic concentrations [ [245](#B245-medicines-07-00047)]. In a recent study involving MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, thymoquinone treatment induced the expression of tristetraprolin, a tumor suppressor gene. This resulted in inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, and metastasis via activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and resulting destabilization of MUC4 mRNA [ [246](#B246-medicines-07-00047)]. [247](#B247-medicines-07-00047), [248](#B248-medicines-07-00047)]. Linjawi et al. investigated the effects of the oil of black cumin seed (Nigella sativa) and thymoquinone on serum tumor markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde as well as and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in DMBA-induced breast cancer in female rats [ [249](#B249-medicines-07-00047)]. Black cumin seed (Nigella sativa) and thymoquinone exercised a protective effect as they reduced the breast carcinogens and decreased the gene expressions of Id-1, Brac2, Bra1 and p53 mutations [ [249](#B249-medicines-07-00047)]. In another study, in vivo administration of thymoquinone (20 and 100 mg/kg) significantly decreased the progression of MDA-MB-231 tumors and inhibited the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) in an orthotopic tumor mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer [ [250](#B250-medicines-07-00047)]. [251](#B251-medicines-07-00047)]. The anti-cancer activities of thymoquinone in BALB/c mice were enhanced by its encapsulation in a nanostructured lipid carrier [ [252](#B252-medicines-07-00047)]. In addition to its anti-cancer properties, thymoquinone significantly demonstrates hepato-protective effects. Thymoquinone inhibited tamoxifen-induced hepatic damage in female rats with less glutathione depletion and lipid peroxide accumulation [ [253](#B253-medicines-07-00047)]. 10.3. Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of Thymoquinone and Its Combination with Other Chemotherapeutic Drugs [254](#B254-medicines-07-00047)]. However, its use is limited due to its low bioavailability and hydrophobic properties as it has poor aqueous solubility [ [255](#B255-medicines-07-00047)]. Studies that has examined its pharmacokinetic properties reported that it is slowly absorbed in the body and rapidly eliminated [ [256](#B256-medicines-07-00047), [257](#B257-medicines-07-00047)]. The delivery of thymoquinone is enhanced by the use of nanoparticles known as nanostructured lipid carriers which bring about improved drug reactivity [ [258](#B258-medicines-07-00047), [259](#B259-medicines-07-00047)]. Bhattacharya et al. produced a thymoquinone-encapsulated nanoparticle utilizing hydrophilic biodegradable polymers such as polyethyleneglycol aimed Polyethyleneglycol-thymoquinone-encapsulated nanoparticle (PEG4000-TQ-Nps) induced and reduced migration of breast cancer cells in vivo via disruption of cytoskeletal actin polymerization caused by the increased expression of miR-34a downregulation of Rac1 expression [ [259](#B259-medicines-07-00047)]. Similarly, lipid carrier (TQ-NLC) exhibited anti-proliferative activity towards MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. TQ-NLC caused cell shrinkage with an increase in apoptotic cell population and cell cycle arrest of the MDA-MB-231 cell line [ [260](#B260-medicines-07-00047)]. Notably, TQ-NLC along with thymoquinone inhibited lung metastasis in 4T1 tumor-bearing female BALB/c mice by downregulating the expression of MMP-2 and activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in the cancer tumor cells [ [261](#B261-medicines-07-00047)]. In another study that utilized nanogel-based nanoparticle to improve the efficacy of thymoquinone, nanothymoquinone was more effective than the parent drug in inhibiting the proliferation of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner [ [262](#B262-medicines-07-00047)]. Ultrasonic nano-emulsion formulation of the essential oil of Nigella sativa also exhibits anti-cancer activity as it induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells [ [263](#B263-medicines-07-00047)]. Other studies have reported that biogenic platinum nanoparticles made using black cumin seed (Nigella sativa L.) extract were cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 breast cells [ [264](#B264-medicines-07-00047)] and silver nanoparticles made from an aqueous seed extract of Nigella sativa induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by altering the expression of apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bax and an inflammatory marker such as COX-2 [ [265](#B265-medicines-07-00047)]. [64](#B64-medicines-07-00047)]. Thymoquinone and tamoxifen exerted a synergistic effect as they both decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in both cell lines [ [64](#B64-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). Doxorubicin is another chemotherapy drug whose anti-tumor activity is enhanced by its combination with thymoquinone in cancer cell lines [ [64](#B64-medicines-07-00047), [251](#B251-medicines-07-00047)]. In a study by Arafa et al. thymoquinone induced apoptosis in doxorubicin-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/DOX cells by the upregulation of PTEN which inhibited Akt phosphorylation [ [65](#B65-medicines-07-00047)]. There are subsequent increased cellular levels of p21 and p53 proteins, induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and ultimately programmed cancer cell death [ [65](#B65-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 2](#medicines-07-00047-t002)). In another study, thymoquinone improved the anti-cancer properties of doxorubicin in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line as there was a significant increase in the inhibition of cancer cells and apoptosis. There were overall increases in selectivity, efficacy and decreased drug resistance with the use of equimolar amounts of thymoquinone and doxorubicin [ [266](#B266-medicines-07-00047)]. Moreover, seed extracts of Nigella sativa enhanced the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and the addition of the latter to lipid nano-emulsions of Nigella sativa beneficially impact the bioactivity of both drugs [ [267](#B267-medicines-07-00047)]. [268](#B268-medicines-07-00047)]. akalar et al. examined antitumor activity of thymoquinone and paclitaxel in a triple-negative breast cancer cell line and also in a mouse model [ [269](#B269-medicines-07-00047)]. The combination of thymoquinone and paclitaxel inhibited cancer growth in the cell culture and induced apoptosis with the upregulation of tumor suppressor genes such as Brca1, p21 and Hic1. The mechanism of action of the combined drugs also involves the downregulation of pro-apoptotic factors such as caspase-12 and caspase-7, resulting in decreased Akt and phosphorylated p65 [ [269](#B269-medicines-07-00047)]. In a recent study that examined the chemo-modulatory effect of thymoquinone on paclitaxel using MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells, there was decreased resistance to paclitaxel when both drugs were used in combination and increased percentage of apoptotic cell death particularly in using MCF-7 [ [66](#B66-medicines-07-00047)]. Furthermore, both drugs induced autophagy in MCF-7, and reduced breast cancer-associated stem cell clone (CD44+/CD24-cell) in both T47D and MCF-7 cancer cells [ [66](#B66-medicines-07-00047)]. [270](#B270-medicines-07-00047)]. Khan et al. examined the synergistic effect of thymoquinone alone and in combination with cyclophosphamide on the growth of Her2- MDA-231 and Her2+ SKBR-3 breast cancer lines. The combination of thymoquinone and cyclophosphamide significantly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in the G1 phase, upregulated PTEN and downregulated the phosphorylation of thymoquinone and ferulic acid from Ferula asafetida in combination significantly decreased the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells [ [271](#B271-medicines-07-00047)]. A combination of thymoquinone and piperine from black pepper (Piper longum) acts synergistically to reduce tumor size, inhibit angiogenesis and induced apoptosis in mouse epithelial breast cancer cell line (EMT6/P) [ [272](#B272-medicines-07-00047)]. 10.4. Clinical Studies Using [273](#B273-medicines-07-00047)]. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, Nigella sativa 5% gel significantly reduced the severity of acute radiation dermatitis and delays the onset of moist desquamation [ [97](#B97-medicines-07-00047)] ( [Table 3](#medicines-07-00047-t003)). The high lipophilicity, poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its use in humans [ [274](#B274-medicines-07-00047)]. 11.
