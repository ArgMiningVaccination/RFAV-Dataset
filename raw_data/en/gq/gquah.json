As a development bank with a longterm lending horizon, AFD is particularly interested in better understanding the determinants of countries' long term economic, social, and political trajectory. AFD has thus developed a programme on \"Institutions, Governance, and Longterm Growth\" dealing with the five following dimensions: (i) Measu ring institutions and discussing the meaning of such measures, notably through the Institutional Profiles Database; (ii) Testing the econometric relationship between institutional measures and long term growth; (iii) Exploring through a series of country case studies the historical relationship between processes of economic accumulation, forms of political organisation, and social cohesion; (i v) Discussing conceptual frameworks for making sense of the interaction between political, social and economic forces in the process of development; (v) Developing methodologies for political economy analyses. The MGSoG/UNU Merit team is involved in the five dimensions with a particular focus on the first two. Its primary objective is to explore the I nstitutional Profiles Database jointly developed by AFD and the French Ministry of the Economy since 2001. Institutional Profiles Database is unique by its scope (about 350 elementary questions pertaining to all institutional dimensions covering 148 countries in 2012), its entirely free access, and its ambition to incorporate the mo st recent theoretical advances in the field of political economy. The present series intends to convey the results of our ongoing research, and in so doing to reflect the wealth of issues that can be fruitfully addressed from an \"institutionalist\" perspective. We hope that readers will find these papers st imulating and useful to develop their own understanding and research.

The impacts of State Capacity and Bureaucratic Autonomy on development goals\u0003 Luciana Cingolaniy Kaj Thomssonz Denis de Crombrugghex October 22, 2013 Abstract The notion of state capacity has attracted renewed interest over the last few years, in particular in the study of violent con ict. Yet, state capacity is conceived di erently depending on whether the interest lies in the state's power to discourage violent con ict, in its ability to administer e\u000eciently, or simply in its capacity to foster economic development. In this article, we examine the links between state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy, and discuss the conditions under which these converge or di er. Using panel data over 1990-2010 and a novel indicator of bureaucratic autonomy, we then estimate the separate e ect of state capacity and bureaucratic auton- omy on two of the MDGs indicators: child mortality and the prevalence of tuberculosis. The evidence suggests that a) bureaucratic autonomy has a stronger impact than commonly used measures of state capacity; and b) \u0003We are grateful to Nicolas Meisel, and J\u007f org Faust for insightful comments and suggestions, as well as participants at the SASE general conference held in Milan, June 2013; the D\u0013 eveloppement, Institutions & Mondialisation conference in Paris, June 2013 and the ECPR general conference in Bordeaux, September 2013. yMaastricht Graduate School of Governance - UNU-Merit.

Keywords: state capacity - institutions - bureaucracies - millennium development goals - child mortality - tuberculosis JEL codes: I38 D73 O43 O50 1 Introduction In the ongoing debate over the role of institutions in development, state capacity has emerged as a suggested catalyst of desirable social and economic outcomes. In this scholarly discussion, state capacity is portrayed as a potential source of strength that can fundamentally shape the implementation and nal impact of policies, regardless of their ideological content and design. Our aim here is to build on this burgeoning literature and enhance it by analyzing the relationship between state capacity and the autonomy of the public bureaucracy. The development of the state capacity concept has been shaped by the work of scholars from a wide array of disciplines and methodological approaches, seeking to understand both the e ects of state capacity as well as its determinants. Un- fortunately, the concept is poorly de ned and has been stretched to a point where di erent scholars ll it with di erent meanings1. As will be carefully explained later, an overview of the literature shows that scholars may implicitly or explicitly refer to at least four di erent dimensions of capacity: coercive, administrative, s- cal and/or legal capacity. In addition, normative and positive questions are often con ated. Furthermore, within the realm of normative questions, the view of the appropriate role of a (strong) state typically di ers between studies of developed and developing countries. The following observation by Daron Acemoglu aptly captures some of this tension: \\While much research in political economy points out the bene- ts of `limited government', political scientists have long empha- sized the problems created in many less-developed nations by `weak 1See Hendrix (2010), Hanson and Sigman (2011) and Cingolani (2013) for a systematic anal- ysis on the di erent dimensions and conceptualizations of state capacity. 2states', which lack the power to tax and regulate the economy and to withstand the political and social challenges from non-state actors\" (Acemoglu 2005: 1199). One of the key areas of contention and confusion around the state capacity concept concerns the role of \\Weberian\" bureaucratic attributes. These attributes are given central and almost de ning roles in some of the research on state capacity, while they receive essentially no attention in other parts of the literature. In the rst group we nd in uential work by scholars such as Evans (1995), Geddes (1996) and Evans and Rauch (1999), who focus on the organizational form of the state and view capacity as the consequence of e\u000ecient policy delegation to autonomous and professional bureaucratic bodies. In the second group, we nd an eclectic group of scholars, including historians (Centeno 2002), political scientists (Fearon 2005) and economists (Dincecco and Prado 2012), who link state capacity to war and the state's capacity to centralize power and control the territory. In this paper we aim to clear up some of this confusion by deepening our under- standing of the relationship between bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity, with the ultimate goal of better understanding the role of autonomy and capacity in achieving fundamental social goals. More speci cally, we aim to make the fol- lowing contributions: rst, to explore how traditional theories about bureaucracies t within the more recent work on state capacity; second, to present a novel and objective indicator of bureaucratic autonomy that is comparable across time and space; and third, to estimate the impacts of both state capacity - in its multi- ple interpretations - and bureaucratic autonomy on (social) developmental goals. Along the way, we also survey the state capacity concept and show its versatility and multidimensionality. The section that follows contains a historical overview of the di erent strands of the state capacity literature as well as the di erent measurements and de nitions of the concept, with particular emphasis on the importance given to bureaucratic autonomy. In the third section, we empirically assess the associations between bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity, using several of the most commonly employed measures of state capacity. We show that the link between the two is non- trivial and nonlinear, and that it seems to be dependent on the political context, which justi es the inclusion of both in empirical analyses of the determinants of development goals. The fourth section contains the key empirical contributions of the paper. There, we examine the e ects of both state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy on two policy indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals: child mortality rates and tuberculosis prevalence. We focus on these indicators because we view them as indisputable social goals that (essentially) everyone, across di erent regime types and ideological leanings, agrees with. We also nd 3it plausible, ex ante, that the capacity of the state, for instance to distribute development aid e ectively, could have a signi cant impact on the success rate of these goals. When we analyze the development of these indicators between 1990 and 2010, we nd that bureaucratic autonomy has a stronger impact than state capacity, and that both bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity play a more important role for these indicators than traditional macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth. The fth and nal section contains preliminary conclusions and points that merit further discussion and analysis. 2 State capacities: a conceptual overview of the literature Although the literature on state capacity gained special momentum over the recent years, its theoretical roots date back to the `statist' movement of the seventies and eighties within political sociology, followed by salient works by Theda Skocpol, Charles Tilly, Peter Evans, Dieter Rueschemeyer, Alfred Stepan, among others. This movement responds to both previous marxist and pluralist approaches who postulated, from di erent paradigms, that the state apparatus was a political arena occupied by a myriad of societal actors with direct personal interests. Statism, in contrast, argues that under certain conditions the state can represent a credible autonomous actor and be independent from social classes and particularistic in- terests. Two traditions stem from this movement, a rst one granting special attention to the bureaucracy and power delegation, following largely the Weberian tradition; and a second one, which tends to overlook the organizational speci ci- ties of the state in favor of outcomes mostly related to the control of violence and scal performance. 2.1 The focus on administrative and relational capacity In 1979 Theda Skocpol published States and Social Revolutions, a comparative historical account of the mechanisms by which the state's organizational struc- tures a ected the nature and outcomes of social revolutions in China, Russia and France. She dedicates much of the volume to show how the lack of full control of the state apparatus by the aristocratic class is key in creating the void by which opportunities for social revolutions emerge and trigger fundamental changes in the state later on. Along similar conceptual lines, Evans, Skocpol and Rueschemeyer's Bringing the State Back in (1985) gathers essays that place bureaucracies as inde- pendent entities at the center of the scene. The book explores the importance of 4autonomic power in the pursuit of di erent policy goals, such as sectorial indus- trial development, the management of economic crises, trade policy and con ict resolution. The volumes by Michael Mann (1986, 1993) The Sources of Social Power are com- monly regarded as an illuminating exploration of the complexity surrounding the power of the state. Here, a distinction is made between despotic and infrastruc- tural power. While the rst refers to the state's capacity to impose legislation, the second looks at the actual operational capacity of the state within society, and the extent to which decisions at the political level can be implemented throughout the territory. The notion of infrastructural power permeated throughout the lit- erature and led to numerous debates, in particular geared towards granting more importance to the street-level bureaucracy (see, for example, Soifer 2008 or Vom Hau and Soifer 2008). Taking on a relational approach, Joel Migdal (1988) seeks to better assess the relationship between the strength of the state vis-\u0012 a-vis that of the society. He considers that a strong society negatively a ects states' capabilities to \\achieve the kinds of changes in society that their leaders sought through state planning, policies and actions\" (: 4). He allows for a broad set of dimensions of state capacity, such as the ability to \\penetrate society, regulate social relationships, extract resources and appropriate or use resources in determined ways\" (: 4). The reason why this inverse relationship exists, he contends, is because the state is only one of many organizations seeking to in uence people's lives, and the competition is higher as more societal organizations emerge with a similar purpose. Focusing on Latin American countries, Barbara Geddes asks in The Politician's Dilemma (1996) which are the factors that determine politicians' decisions to appoint public managers on the basis of meritocratic principles in contrast to par- tisan concerns. She de nes state capacity as the implementation power of the state, a task that falls inherently under the bureaucracy. This implementation power relies on countries' chances to build an insulated bureaucracy, which in turn depends on the advancements towards merit-oriented administrative reforms. In order to answer the initial question, she introduces the notion of the politi- cian's dilemma: a president faces a tradeo between appointing competent state managers who increase the chances of fostering growth and development, and ap- pointing partisan managers to reassure their own support. Which path will be taken depends on a series of conditions: the leader's career incentives, the leader's position within the party, party discipline, party's age and the distribution of parliamentary seats. InEmbedded Autonomy (1995) Peter Evans analyzes the ways in which states' 5transformative capacity has the power to shape structural change and promote industrial growth in newly-industrializing countries (NICs). The question is not de ned in terms of how much the state intervenes, but in which ways so that modern economies are able to t the global division of labor. Evans argues that the range of actions a government can take depends on the di erent kinds of state structures in place, or the degree of embedded autonomy, a combination of internal bureaucratic coherence within agencies and external connectedness with indus- trial sectors. Depending on the level of embedded autonomy, in turn, states come to be either predatory, intermediate or developmental, a classi cation extensively explored in Evans (1989), and further expanded in discussions about the develop- mental and rentier state (e. g. Karl 1997; Moore 1998, Kohli 2004, Whit eld and Therkildsen 2011). In line with Evans, Linda Weiss (1998) explores the transformative capacity of states against the backdrop of globalization. Similarly, she contends that the level of state intervention is not informative of its power, whereas transformative capacity is. The latter is conceived as \\the ability [of the state] to coordinate industrial change to meet the changing context of international competition\" (: 7). Weiss studies the somewhat contradictory relationship between transformative and distributive capacity, through ve case studies: Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, and Germany. She nds that transformative capacity dominated the emerging economies of Taiwan and South Korea, whereas distributive capacity remained at the core of the Swedish economy. Distributive capacity granted high density to state-society relations, but hindered innovation within the industrial sector. The remaining two countries, Germany and Japan constitute two examples of a combination of both capacities. Weiss emphazises the persistence of the state's centrality in the economy, challenging mainstream views about the demise of the state in a growing globalized world. In an important e ort to collect comparable and systematic data on bureaucratic professionalism, Evans and Rauch (1999) design and build the Weberian State Dataset, a dataset made of surveys examining bureaucratic features such as meri- tocratic recruitment, salary arrangements and career paths in 35 developing (semi- industrialized) countries, with cross-sectional data representing the period 1970- 1990. Their ndings show strong associations between `Weberianness' and eco- nomic growth. Also, Rauch and Evans (2000) nd signi cant associations between bureaucratic `Weberianness' and state e ectiveness, measured with a number of di erent sources of data. More recently, the interest in state capacity understood from the perspective of professionalized bureaucracies can perhaps be observed in the work of B\u007f ack and Hadenius (2008) assessing the relationship between state capacity and democ- 6racy, or the scholarship coming from the QoG survey on public administration, which seeks to measure to which extent administrations are impersonal in the implementation of their policies (Dahlstr\u007f om, Lapuente and Teorell 2010, among others). 2.2 Other notions of state capacity: coercive, scal and legal capacity The work of Charles Tilly on the origins of state formation (1975) started a long and fertile stream of literature highlighting the importance of war episodes in taxation and the subsequent centralization of coercive capacity in the hands of national states. This collection of essays shows the variations in state formation processes in Western Europe as a function of warmaking and the search for central- ized strategies to raise government revenue. This historical account is completed and complemented in Coercion, Capital and European States, AD 990-1992 (Tilly 1992). Following the tradition of Charles Tilly, Margaret Levi (1989) grants attention to the state's capability to provide collective goods by raising revenue. While in Tilly's work this depended on the episodes of external con ict, Levi looks at internal political conditions, and in particular, to the insecurity of leaders' mandate duration, the transaction costs associated with revenue raising, and the ruler's overall bargaining power. Methodologically, she chooses a set of case studies, selected according to di erent levels of state development and the exposure to some sort of historical change. The importance of state capacity in development also acquired particular rele- vance in the con ict literature, this time not focusing on emerging or developed economies, but on failed or weak states and their lack of coercive capacity. Engaged in a debate with Collier and Hoe\u000fer (2004), Fearon (2005) shows that among the factors that facilitate guerrilla warfare and insurgency are low nancial, organi- zational, and political state capacities (: 75). DeRouen and Sobek (2004) nd a similar result, although they di erentiate between army's strength and state capacity. More recently, there has been a proliferation of the economic literature interested in explaining leaders' investments in state capacity, that progressively promoted the convergence between the interest in scal capacity building and con ict. The work of Acemoglu, Ticchi and Vindigni (2006), for example, seeks to under- stand how ine\u000ecient states arise and persist in the framework of a game-theoretic 7analysis. Their understanding of state e\u000eciency involves the abilities of a cen- tral authority to monitor bureaucrats, which is, in turn, dependent on previous investments in this capacity. Besley and Persson (2007, 2008, 2009) do extensive work on the determinants of state capacity. In their framework, capacity building is seen as an investment made by incumbents as a function of future levels of social valuation for public goods, with a format of investments under uncertainty. In Besley and Persson (2008) they analyze how self-interested incumbents decide to use part of the gov- ernment's revenue to invest in scal capacities that enable higher tax extraction from society in the future. Raising public revenue is key to provide a higher level (or a better quality) of public goods, in this case exempli ed by defense against external threats. They show theoretically how two types of exogenous con icts, internal insurgency and external war, a ect the value that societies grant to public goods, and as a consequence, the relevance of investing in scal capacities. The model predicts that the expectation of future external con ict will raise today's investments in scal capacity, and all sectors of society will be taxed equally, so as to optimize revenue raising. In contrast, the expectation of future internal con ict has the opposite e ect: as all scal capacity is destroyed when internal con ict occurs, the value of public goods decreases, incumbents favor their own group in society with redistribution, and no public goods are provided. In an extended model, Besley and Persson (2007, 2009) also analyze investments in legal capacity as an endogenous policy decision. Legal capacity is understood as the capacity to protect and enforce property rights, a market-supporting institution. Apart from conditioning investments on internal and external con ict, they also show that other political factors can change the value of public goods, such as the level of inclusiveness of institutions (capturing political polarization), the level of political stability, and whether the political regime resembles that of a utilitarian planner or a politically-controlled one. Several ndings arise from their model: investments in legal and scal capacity are complementary; wealthier countries choose higher levels of both types of capacity; greater political stability raises investments in state capacity; a more representative political system (meaning, closer to the utilitarian planner ideal) also raises investments in both capacities; and nally, the higher the wealth of the ruling group, the higher the investments in legal capacity, and the lower in scal capacity. Besley and Persson (2011) add a new component to their previous works: the rein- forcing relationship between low state capacity and violence. Here, state capacity is de ned as the \\institutional capability of the state to carry out various policies that deliver bene ts and services to households and rms\" (Besley and Persson 2011: 6). The volume argues that a process of `clusterization' occurs, where low 8income, low state capacity and high violence take place at the same time. The conclusions suggest that stable politics, along with consensual institutions and a higher demand for public goods are more conducive to greater investments in state capacities. Dincecco and Katz (2012) present robust empirical evidence showing strong as- sociations between extractive and productive state capacity and GDP per capita over a four-century period in 11 European nations. Dincecco and Prado (2012) con rm the e ects of scal capacity on economic performance by instrumenting scal capacity with war casualties from 1816 to 1913 in various world regions. 2.3 State capacity: attributes in common This brief historical overview shows only some of the most popular works un- raveling both the causes and e ects of state capacity, allowing a wide array of conceptual lenses. The dimensions of state capacity that have attracted the great- est attention are perhaps the coercive power of the state as an essential feature to maintain territorial unity in the context of con ict; the bureaucratic or adminis- trative capacities to provide a stable provision of public goods through a somewhat autonomous bureaucracy; and the extractive or scal capacity of states in order to both centralize coercive power and to provide other socially-desirable public goods. A set of state capacity measurements is listed in the Appendix 6.1. This list is an extract from Cingolani (2013) and presents references to the articles or volumes where the issue of state capacity is directly or indirectly tackled, as well as the chosen measurement in each case and the dimension of capacity authors emphazise the most. One observation that can be made on the basis of this succint review is that most de nitions of state capacity refer to some kind of policy execution potential. Because this execution potential can come from di erent sources, the literature has not always assumed a particular organizational structure of the state. That is, execution potential can certainly come from having a professional and insulated bureaucracy, but (at least in the short term), it can also be attributed to high government revenue or strong leadership, which may or may not be associated with the rst. 93 Bureaucratic Autonomy and State Capacity: an empirical assessment of the association The theoretical exploration shows that state capacity encompasses multiple dimen- sions, and that certain strands of literature assume that bureaucratic autonomy is a component of state capacity, while others do not. As it becomes interesting to further unravel this relationship, this section goes one step forward by addressing the question: what is the empirical association between bureaucratic autonomy and the various measures of state capacity that scholars have presented? For this purpose, we will present correlations between a number of proxies of state capacity used in di erent works, and our proposed measure of bureaucratic autonomy, pooling historical data from between as early as 1960 and as late as 2010. Regarding the rst, we replicate some of the most popular measures of state capac- ity used in the literature (see the list in section 6.1 in the Appendix). Regarding bureaucratic autonomy, our proposed original measure is explained in the next subsection. Although the notion of bureaucratic autonomy involves substantial complexity in itself, the way it is conceived here follows the Weberian and Wilso- nian traditions of relative separation between politics and administration2, and is broadly de ned as the de facto non-alignment of political cycles and the cycles of autonomous bureaucracies. However relevant, bureaucratic autonomy from pri- vate interest groups is not considered at this point. We describe both bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity measures in Table 1. 2See for example, Weber (1978 Vol. II); Wilson (1897 in Arthur 1966); Goodnow 2003. 10Table 1: Bureaucratic Autonomy and State Capacity: Data description V ariable Description Source Countries (Years) Mean St. Dev Min Max Bureaucratic Autonom yMeasures the level of politicization of bureaucratic appointments, based on data from central banks.Own compilation based on of CorruptionExperts of corruption in both the private and public sectors.International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)143 (1984-2010) 2.14 1.18 0 4 Control of CorruptionLevels of corruption based on data from TIHeritage Foundation and TI163 (1994-2006) 40.26 26.43 0 100 CPI Corruption Perception Index from expert assessmentsTransparency International181 (1995-2010) 4.31 2.27 0.4 10 Property Rights Measures the legal protection of property rights, risk of expropriation and contract complianceHeritage Foundation 163 (1994-2006) 50.61 23.81 10 90 Rule of Law Measures levels of compliance with the lawWorld Bank Governance Indicators194 (1996-2009) -0.75 0.99 -2.68 2.12 Contract Intensive MoneyProportion of the money supply held in the banking system (M2-M1/M2)World Development Indicators (WDI)179 (1960-2010) 0.474 (1990-2010) 25.35 10.72 0.334 65.26 Income Tax II Taxes on income, pro ts and capital gains as share of total taxesWorld Development Indicators146 (1990-2010) 34.11 16.81 0.575 100 Income Tax Taxes on income, pro ts and capital gains as share of total revenueWorld Development (WDI)145 (1990-2010) 21.92 12.76 0.013 66.715 Fiscal Capacity I1 Development Indicators (WDI)138 (1990-2010) 0.878 0.130 0.353 1.162 Fiscal Capacity II1 - (Share of income tax + Share of trade tax)World Development Indicators (WDI)136 (1990-2010) 0.67 0.162 0.227 0.983 Fiscal IIIShare of government revenueWorld Development Indicators (WDI)141 (1990-2010) 0.057 0.043 0.0005 0.28 Fiscal 0.074 0.0008 ExportsSum of food, fuel, agricultural and ores exports as share of total merchandise exportsWorld Development (1962-2010) 60.76 37.28 (WDI)181 (1960-2010) 22.743 0.183 Capacity: Data description (cont.)

A number of projects have systematically studied national bureaucracies. As men- tioned earlier, one of the rst is the Weberianness Survey by the University of Cal- ifornia San Diego (Evans and Rauch 1999). This survey comprised 35 emerging economies and collected data with time-invariant values representing the period 1970-1990. Although country scores were based on interviews with key stake- holders, the questions sought to uncover objective patterns in the public admin- istration in three main areas: meritocratic recruitment, career paths and salary schemes. Also, the PRS group commercializes data on bureaucratic quality as part of the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), which exists for a large number of countries since 1984. The index is based on experts' assessments and published on a yearly basis. Although criticized for its lack of transparency (e.g. Fukuyama 2012), ICRG's index of Bureaucratic Quality has been used to measure state capacity in articles particularly interested in administrative features of the state. In 2005, the World Bank started to publish their IDA Resource Allocation In- dex (IRAI), based on data from the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). CPIA data assigns scores to 77 countries in 16 di erent policy and insti- tutional items, divided in four areas: economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion and equity, and public sector management and insti- 12tutions. Within the latter, there is one particular item measuring the quality of public administration. It de nes six di erent levels of quality, based on policy coordination and responsiveness, implementation e\u000eciency, merit and ethics, and payment schemes. Another interesting source of data on the bureaucracy comes from the Global In- tegrity Index (GII) by the NGO Global Integrity. This index started in 2004 and has assessed 109 countries on di erent aspects of governance (although with high variance in the number of waves for each country and their regularity). In par- ticular, the indicator Civil Service: Con icts of Interest Safeguards and Political Independence computes experts' appraisal of the legal measures in place to protect the civil service from politicization. More recently, the Quality of Government Institute launched a web survey meant to capture the impartiality of the public service in 58 countries, with insights from 528 country experts (Dahlstr\u007f om, Lapuente and Teorell 2010). It comprises ques- tions assessing the degree of politicization and favoritism in the implementation of policies. These indicators su er from a series of limitations: lack of time variation and limited coverage of countries (Evans and Rauch 1999; Dahlstr\u007f om, Lapuente and Teorell 2010), very (CPIA, GII), non-systematic coverage of coun- tries (GII), lack of full clarity in the scoring criteria (CPIA and ICRG), lack of objective measurements (as opposed to perception-based), which is the case of all of the above mentioned sources. Comprehensive, objective and sensible ways to measure bureaucratic features exist, but unfortunately data are cross-sectional and comprising only 16 European countries (Gilardi and Maggetti 2010; Hanretty and Koop 2009). Additionally, the concept of bureaucratic autonomy entails a level of complexity that has made it di\u000ecult to nd consensus regarding its operational- ization (Christensen 2010). We are therefore left with no objective indicators for bureaucratic autonomy with time series variation, and are forced to look for proxy variables instead. After careful consideration of various literatures on bureaucratic capacity and auton- omy, we choose to use objective data on the politicization of removals of central bank governors, in countries where central banks enjoy formal autonomy and xed mandates for their head executives. We gather this data simply by computing whether removals occur before the governor's legal mandate is due, which allows to capture a more general de facto correlation between political and bureaucratic cycles in the areas in which the bureaucracy is expected to be autonomous. We resort to one of the many variables included in the comprehensive database compiled by Dreher, Strum and de Haan (2010), which informs whether central 13bank governor turnovers are regular or irregular, in 158 territorial units (countries and banking unions) over the period 1970-2011. This regularity is de ned in re- lation to their legal mandate, where rotations occurring before the legal date are considered irregular. On this basis, we propose the following measure of bureau- cratic itmeasures the annual cumulative ratio of irregular to regular turnovers over the preceding 20-year period, arising from data from as early as 1970 (the index is therefore computed from 1990 until 2010). It has a rather straightforward in- terpretation: negative measures indicate that most of the turnovers (TOR) have been irregular and positives indicate the opposite. We consider here that more occurrences of regular turnovers means a more autonomous life for the agency. By resorting to a de facto measure, the indicator does not necessarily pick up the e ect of legal reforms (except indirectly through changes in legal mandates). The assumption that central bank autonomy is representative of overall bureau- cratic autonomy is of course a rather strong one. Although it would be ideal to gather data on various autonomic state agencies for every country and every year, so far we nd only comprehensive data for central banks. However, we believe this assumption to be supported by previous theoretical work. For instance, Gi- lardi's extensive work on how to operationalize agency autonomy (2002, 2005a, 2008) is directly inspired by the literature on central bank independence and the aim of extending a similar approach to other agencies (Gilardi and Maggetti 2010: 3-4). We also nd support for our choice in the work of North, Wallis, Weingast and Webb, where courts and central banks are regarded as key areas that should main- tain their autonomy from rulers: \\In a mature LAO [limited-access order], the government's commitments to policies and institutions can be more credible [than in fragile or basic LAOs] because elite private organizations are in a position to put economic pressure on the government to abide by its commitments. This ability arises as private organizations act to protect their interests in the di erentiation and autonomy of public institutions, such as courts and the central bank\" (North, Wallis, Weingast and Webb 2011: 18-19). In addition, the scatterplots of Appendix 6.2 show positive and signi cant cor- relations between our proxy of bureaucratic autonomy and three out of the four alternative measures of bureaucratic independence and quality. 143.2 Data and analysis Once we have laid out our novel and objective indicator of bureaucratic autonomy, and selected a number of indices of state capacity from the literature, we run a series of bivariate correlations. Table 1 describes the variables and presents descriptive statistics for the data used in these bivariate correlations. Table 2 presents panel bivariate correlations be- tween our proxy measure of bureaucratic autonomy (AUT it) and commonly used operationalizations of state capacity. In order to test the possibility of context- dependence in the relationship between state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy, the full sample of observations is divided into autocracies, anocracies and democ- racies. A country in a given year is an autocracy if the index Polity2 from the database PolityIV is less than -5; anocracies are between -5 and 5 and democracies are those above 5 (Marshall and Jaggers 2013). At rst glance, the correlations show that there is no clearly positive or negative correlation between the two. How- ever, an interesting pattern seems to arise from the correlations: state capacity is negatively correlated with autonomy in most of the cases within the sub-sample of autocracies, no clear pattern arises from the sub-sample of anocracies, and a positive relationship is shown in democracies. 15Table 2: Bivariate Correlations: Bureaucratic Autonomy and State Capacity Dimension SC measure Autocracies Anocracies Democracies Administrativ e -0.4110\u0003\u00030.0232 0.0591 Con -0.3026\u0003\u0003\u00030.0385 -0.0207 -0.0989 -0.0656 -0.2350\u0003\u0003 exports 0.3356\u0003\u0003\u00030.1180 Military Personnel -0.12\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.1688\u0003\u0003-0.0726 0.1039 Notes: R* indicates a reversed scale, meaning that higher values of the variable represent less capacity. Stars indicate signi cance levels:\u0003p <0:10,\u0003\u0003p <0:05, \u0003\u0003\u0003p <0:01. These levels are adjusted by the clustering within countries. A cautious interpretation of this could be that the indicator captures the true level of autonomy only in consolidated democracies, and that in the case of au- tocracies and anocracies the measurement is less reliable. Another interpretation is that while bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity converge in the context of consolidated democracies, they signi cantly di er in anocracies and autocra- cies. In these types of polities, it is apparent that capacity, if anything, is coming from sources other than bureaucratic autonomy. In any case, the correlations sug- gest that the relationship between state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy is not homogeneous and that it should be interpreted in the context of the di erent regimes' characteristics. This basic evidence can in principle sustain and reconcile the di erent links between bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity observed in the literature: bureaucratic autonomy is a credible component of state capacity in 16certain conditions, but not always. 4 The Impacts of Bureaucratic Autonomy and State Capacity on the MDGs This section's purpose is to move beyond conceptual considerations and test whether both state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy levels have signi cant impacts on a series of policy goals. So far, research has provided evidence of the positive and signi cant impact of state capacity on economic performance (Evans and Rauch 1999, Dincecco and Katz 2012; Dincecco and Prado Stuckler 2012) and peace (Sobek 2010; Braithwaite 2010). Here, it is the goal to empirically estimate and compare the e ects of state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy on two indicators of the Millennium Development Goals: child mortality and tuberculosis prevalence rates. As mentioned in the introduction, we focus on these indicators because we view them as sensible social outcomes that are likely to be indisputable as social goals across (essentially) every country and regime type. We also nd it plausible, ex ante, that the capacity of the state, for instance to distribute development aid e ectively, to accumulate expertise and human re- sources, or to grant stability to policy implementation mechanisms, could have a signi cant impact on whether a country is successful in achieving these goals. There have been numerous statistical studies assessing the determinants of child mortality and tuberculosis levels. The work of Wang (2003) uses Demographic and Health Survey data (DHS) to unravel the factors that a ect infant and child mortality in 60 low-income countries. Among other ndings, the work shows that urbanization determines a faster reduction in mortality, as well as access to electric- ity, income levels, children's vaccination in their rst year, and health expenditure. Gakidou et al. (2010) use time series data for 175 countries to tackle a similar question. They assemble a comprehensive database on educational attainment and nd that increases in the years of education of women in reproductive age (between 15 and 44) substantially reduce child mortality levels on a year-to-year basis be- tween 1970 and 2009. In addition to the traditional health factors, Leipziger et al. (2003) also nd an important role played by access to basic infrastructure, such as access to piped water and improved sanitation. Liu et. al. (2012) account for the most recent trends in child mortality, showing a global decrease of more than 25% in the ten years from 2000 to 2010. Its ndings show that neonatal compli- cations and infectious diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria explain a substantial proportion of the primary causes of child mortality. 17Regarding tuberculosis, Dye et al. (2009) nd that higher scores in the Human Development Index (HDI), lower levels of child mortality, and proper access to improved sanitation accelerate the decrease in tuberculosis incidence, although this rate varies substantially in di erent world regions. In a comprehensive review of six empirical studies, L\u007f onnroth et al. (2010) conclude that a clear log-linear relationship exists between Body Mass Indexes (BMI) and the incidence of tuber- culosis. The work of Hargreaves et al. (2011) focuses on the social determinants of tuberculosis, and develops a framework based on data from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) and WHO that suggests that social protection mechanisms, as well as e ective urban planning interventions should be considered in analyzing progress in tuberculosis control. We build on all of this previous work on the determinants of child mortality and tuberculosis levels. However, our primary focus here is on the role of political and government aspects, as a lot less is known about how these a ect the MDGs. One notable exception is the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Paci c (UNESCAP) report of 2007, centered around the role of governance in the provision of basic services to the poor. It stresses the importance of good governance in overcoming barriers to access, and argues that certain principles such as inclusiveness, transparency and civic participation facilitate the achievement of MDGs (UNESCAP 2007). The analysis also contributes to discussions about the role of Weberianness in poverty reduction more generally (e.g. Henderson et al. 2007). We contribute to the discussion on the determinants of the two MDGs, child mortality and tuberculosis levels, by placing the focus on much less explored factors linked to governance and institutions, such as bureaucratic autonomy and state capacity. Our estimations measure the e ect of a series of policy, institutional and economic variables on the evolution of child mortality and tuberculosis prevalence. The selection of determinants is informed by previous studies on the subject. The estimation equations with (3) Tables 3 and 4 provide an empirical assessment of the relationships formulated in eqs. (2) and (3) respectively. The rst dependent variable (CHmort) is the annual mortality rate among children under 5 (per 1,000) taken from the World Devel- opment Indicators of the World Bank3. The second dependent variable (TBprev) is the annual level of tuberculosis prevalence (per 100,000 people) also taken from WDI4. Both tables include a basic set of determinants (speci cations 1 and 3) as well as an extended group of covariates (2 and 4), as expressed in eqs. (2) and (3). The baseline speci cation includes institutional, economic, demographic and in- frastructural determinants, following the bulk of the literature on child mortality and tuberculosis, and the speci c interest in state capacity and institutions. The rst explanatory variable is bureaucratic autonomy (AUT) as presented in eq. (1). The second is a measure of state capacity (CAP): yearly levels of tax revenue as share of GDP, taken from the Government Finance Statistics (GFS-IMF)5. Al- though there are several proxies for state capacity, this is one of the most widely used and accepted. A continuous measure of democracy levels is added as well (DEM), taken from the Polity2 indicator of the Polity IV project updated to 2011. The lags of per capita GDP (GDPpc) and GDP growth (GROWTH) levels are collected from the New Angus Maddison database. Estimations also include the most acknowledged determinants of child mortality and TB prevalence: a) a mea- sure of population growth (annual %) taken from WDI (POPgr); b) the lag of the levels of educational attainment levels of women in reproductive age (15-44) (ATTAIN), with data from Gakidou et al. (2010) and complemented with Barro and Lee (forthcoming) for the year 2010; c) the lag of urbanization rates (URB), 3Under- ve mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching age ve, if subject to current age-speci c mortality rates. Data on child mortality as well as tuberculosis prevalence are downloaded from the World Bank Open Database (Azevedo 2011). 4The prevalence of tuberculosis is the estimated number of pulmonary, smear positive, and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases (WHO 2011). 5GFS has two bases of measurement for all their variables: cash and non-cash (i. e. disburse- ments versus commitments). Countries have tended to shift from cash to non-cash (accrual) accountancy systems, and although both are considered in order to maximize the number of ob- servations, a small non-systematic bias arises during transitions. The non-cash basis is preferred when both measures are available. 19understood as the share of the population living in urban areas; d) the lag of access to safe water (WATER), and nally e) we construct a measure of immunization levels (IMMUN), averaging the share of one-year-old children immunized against hepatitis B, BCG and Polio. These three measures are taken from the World Bank Open Database (Azevedo 2011). The extended speci cations add three policy measures showing sectoral govern- ment expenditures: the lags of health (HEALTH), education (EDUC) and social protection (SOC) expenditure as a share of GDP, from GFS (IMF)6; as well as a State Fragility Index (SFI) from Polity IV7(only available since 1995) in order to control for con icts or other shocks that might drag changes in the levels of bureaucratic autonomy. Section 6.3 in the Appendix shows descriptive statistics for all the variables in the estimations. Data are cross-national time-series for the period 1990-2010 (unbalanced), and estimations are run with both random (RE) and xed e ects (FE) in order to capture unobservable levels are reported. Tables 3 and 4 also report the number of observations, the overall R2, and for the RE speci cations also the p-value of the Hausman speci cation test in order to assess the suitability of RE vs. FE assumptions. 4.1 Results The four speci cations of Table 3 show somewhat similar results in terms of the explanatory variables' e ects on child mortality. The Hausman test in this case, however, suggests that only the xed e ects model should be ultimately considered. Column 3 shows a highly signi cant and inverse relationship between bureaucratic autonomy and the levels of child mortality, while a smaller signi cance and coef- cient are found for state capacity (tax revenue). Democracy does not exert such an e ect. Of the two macroeconomic variables, GDP per capita and GDP growth, only GDP per capita is signi cantly associated to lower levels of child mortality. In contrast, the more popular determinants of child mortality such as female ed- ucational attainment, urbanization, immunization and safe water access show a signi cant inverse e ect. Population growth, on the other hand, exerts no e ect. When the speci cation is extended in column 4, all variables retain their sign and signi cance, with the exception of GDP per capita and state capacity, which 6The same criterion is applied as in the Tax Revenue variable. 7SFI combines scores on eight dimensions of stateness, ranging from 0 (no fragility) to 25 (extreme fragility): security, political, economic and social a) legitimacy and b) e ectiveness (Marshall and Jaggers 2013). 20become insigni cant. Of the policy variables only health expenditure appears as signi cant, although with a positive sign. This may be indicating a case of reverse causation, by which health expenditure e ectively responds to child mortality lev- els. The explanatory power of both columns 3 and 4 is high, ranging from 68% to 73% of variance being explained. Table 4 estimates the e ect of the same set of determinants on TB prevalence. In this case the Hausman test suggests that both RE and FE are unbiased estimators for the extended model (columns 2-4), while for the baseline model (columns 1 and 3), only FE should be considered. The FE estimator of the baseline model (column 3) shows once more a signi cant and negative association between bu- reaucratic autonomy and TB prevalence, but in this case a signi cant and positive association between the latter and state capacity. Immunization and safe water access levels also exert a signi cant impact in the expected direction, although female education emerges as moderately signi cant with a positive sign. In the extended speci cations (2 and 4) bureaucratic autonomy, state capacity and GDP per capita maintain their sign and signi cance. Immunization levels show again a strong negative impact, while female education loses overall signi cance. Social protection and education expenditure emerge as weakly signi cant with a positive sign, suggesting again a potential case of reverse causality. The overall R2 uctuate between 24 and 34% when explaining the variance of TB prevalence. In sum, the overall results in both Tables 3 and 4 suggest that increases in bu- reaucratic autonomy are strongly associated with reductions in child mortality and TB prevalence levels over the 1990-2010 period, while the e ect of state capacity is more ambiguous. The results also reinforce the impacts of the traditional de- mographic and infrastructural determinants found in the literature, in particular immunization and access to safe water levels. All three policy variables appear as somewhat relevant for these development outcomes, although the nature of the association needs to be more carefully assessed. These results con rm the importance of bureaucratic institutions and state capac- ity in improving basic welfare standards. When comparing the e ects of organi- zational aspects of state capacity (autonomy) with scal ones, it seems that the former have a stronger e ects for the period examined. To further test this last premise, Tables 5 and 6 test the extended model against alternative measures of state capacity, in the administrative, legal and coercive di- mensions, for the same time period and sample of countries. In these, bureaucratic autonomy emerges as signi cant at the 1% level in ve out of the six speci cations, for both MDG outcome variables. The di erent state capacity alternatives are neg- ative and signi cant for child mortality as well in four out of the six columns. For 21TB prevalence, on the other hands, the evidence on the e ect of state capacity proxied by tax revenue is rather ambiguous. 5 Conclusions This article has provided a general discussion linking state capacities, bureaucratic autonomy and two socio-economic development goals. We discussed the theoret- ical links between state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy, pointing out that in some strands of the literature -mostly the earlier works- `state e ectiveness' or `state capacity' presuppose the existence of professional and politically insulated Weberian bureaucracies, whereas other strands -mainly those concerned with con- ict and development- do not necessarily address bureaucratic autonomy. We also delineated a simple strategy to better understand the empirical links between the two concepts. For this purpose we proposed a minimalist but novel objective in- dicator for bureaucratic autonomy and linked it with some of the most common measures of state capacity. The results showed that the nature of this relationship depends on the political context, and that the association is positive in democ- racies, while less clear in autocracies and anocracies. This nding suggests that capacity is composed of other elements in these regimes, and that state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy should be considered separately whenever state capac- ity is not narrowly de ned. Accordingly, we estimated the distinct e ects of state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy on child mortality rates and the prevalence of tuberculosis, two indicators of the Millennium Development Goals. The preliminary results indicate that autonomy is e ective in explaining the reduc- tion of both outcomes over the period 1990-2010. There is an initial hint that the level of scal state capacity, proxied by government tax revenue, is a relevant ex- planatory factor for child mortality, but in the case of tuberculosis prevalence the results are counterintuitive and deserve further exploration. Other institutional determinants such as political regime do not seem to have the same relevance. In contrast to what may be expected, GDP growth does not seem to have an impact on the achievement of either MDG goal, whereas the more traditional de- mographic and infrastructural variables do. The impact of sectoral government spending needs to be further assessed but the results suggest it bears some rele- vance. Moving beyond the direct and detailed interpretation of the regressions, the con- textual dependence of the convergence between state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy, in particular the results presented in Section 4, lends support to the view that institutional development is not a linear process. 22Table 3: Determinants of MDGs: Child mortality (unbalanced sample) Dep var: Child mortality RE FE (1) (2) (3) (4) Bureaucratic Autonomy -0.043\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.031\u0003\u0003-0.046\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.035\u0003\u0003\u0003 (0.003) (0.021) (unbalanced sample) Dep var: TB prevalence RE FE (1) (2) (3) (4) Bureaucratic Autonomy -0.042\u0003-0.069\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.051\u0003\u0003-0.078\u0003\u0003\u0003 (0.057) (0.003) (0.025) of Child Mortality: di erent dimensions of State Capacity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Bureaucratic Autonomy -0.014 Intensive Money Property Rights di erent dimensions of State Capacity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Bureaucratic Autonomy -0.077\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.081\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.079\u0003\u0003\u0003-0.037 Intensive Money Property Rights parentheses. \u0003p<0:10,\u0003\u0003p<0:05,\u0003\u0003\u0003p<0:01 26The topics of state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy deserve an important place in the discussions about institutions and development, and this paper represents one contribution within a eld where several theoretical and empirical questions remain unresolved. In the future, similar assessments should seek objective mea- sures of bureaucratic autonomy that incorporate other bureaucratic agencies than just central banks and extend the analysis and improve the precision of the rela- tionships. 276 Appendix 6.1 Measures of state capacity in literature Source: extract from Cingolani (2013).286.2 Scatterplots 29V ariable Description Source Countries (Years) Mean St. Dev Min Max Child Mortality Mortality rate, under 5 years old (per 1,000)World Development Indicators142 (1990-2010) 62.434 61.054 2.6 311 Indicators142 (1990-2010) 210.262 226.515 1.1 1307 Bureaucratic Autonomy IndexMeasures yearly changes in bureaucratic autonomy (see table 1)based 0.833 Tax revenue Revenue from taxes as share of GDP, in the budgetary base of the central governmentGovernment Finance Statistics, International Monetary Fund120 (1990-2010) 16.106 7.528 0.112 60.48 Democracy Continuous of democracyPolity IV 140 (1990-2010) 2.895 6.764 -10 10 Per capita GDP Ln of GDP per capita, US dollars, chain seriesNew Maddison Historical Datasets140 (1990-2010) 8.173 1.136 5.315 10.276 Historical Datasets140 (1990-2010) 0.0165 0.066 -0.954 0.625 Population growth Indicators (World Bank)142 (1990-2010) 1.551 1.598 -7.533 18.588 Female Education Mean years of educational attainment in women in reproductive age (15-44)Gakidou et. al. 2010 and Barro and Lee (forthcoming)141 (1990-2010) 7.651 3.625 0.3 14.7 Urbanization (%)World Development Indicators142 (1990-2010) 53.870 22.233 5.416 100 Immunization Average of the share of one-year-old children immunized against hepatitis B, BCG and PolioWorld Development Indicators142 (1990-2010) 83.091 16.270 11.5 99 Safe water Improved water source (% of population with access)World Development Indicators139 (1990-2010) 81.743 19.370 2 101 State Fragility Index Composite index on 8 stateness dimensionsPolity IV (2011) 140 (1990-2010) 9.701 6.783 0 25 Health expenditure Health expenditure as share of GDP, in the budgetary base of the central governmentGovernment Finance Statistics, International Monetary Fund107 (1990-2010) 1.442 1.345 -0.008 8.748 Social Protection expenditureSocial protection expenditure as share of GDP, in the budgetary base of the central governmentGovernment Finance Statistics, International Monetary Fund107 (1990-2010) 3.425 3.888 -0.928 20.069 Education expenditureEducation expenditure as share of GDP, in the budgetary base of the central governmentGovernment Finance Statistics, International Monetary Fund107 306.3 State capacities and MDGs: Variables and descriptive stats 6.4 Correlation Matrix 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Child mortality (1) 1 Tuberculosis Prevalence (2) .617 1 Bureaucratic Autonomy (3) -.014 .023 1 Tax Revenue (4) -.122 -.021 -.083 1 Democracy (5) -.315 -.110 .123 .200 Ln GDP per capita (6) -.840 -.564 .059 .257 .336 1 GDP growth (7) -.175 -.064 .015 -.036 -.053 .137 1 1 Urbanization (10) -.667 -.479 .106 .134 .149 .737 .019 .014 .595 1 Immunization (11) -.411 -.376 -.197 .092 .020 .260 .066 -.140 .261 .235 1 Safe Water (12) -.816 -.509 .143 .163 .262 .790 .141 -.199 .595 .661 .292 1 State Fragility (13) .122 -.022 1 Soc Prot.
