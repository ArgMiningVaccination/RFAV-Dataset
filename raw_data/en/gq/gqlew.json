Your chiropractors in Gatineau (Hull Aylmer sectors) have a comprehensive approach aimed at the relaxation, correction and prevention of musculoskeletal disorders. First appointment: file opening and full examination The first consultation with one of our chiropractors in Hull and Aylmer consisted of an initial interview, a complete examination of your condition as well as a radiological examination (directly at the clinic) if necessary. First, during the history, your chiropractor will take the time to listen to you, to understand your goals and values in terms of health care. He will also be able to ask you questions likely to direct his clinical diagnosis. This is an important step in the first appointment that will allow you to establish a bond of trust with your doctor of chiropractic. Then, your chiropractor in Hull Aylmer will carry out the following examinations in order to determine the cause (s) of your pain while considering the overall clinical picture. - Posture analysis and vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, weight, height, etc.) - Orthopedic examinations (range of motion, biomechanical tests and maneuvers, etc.) - Concise and / or detailed neurological examinations depending on the presentation - X-ray examination or prescription of another form of medical imaging When your chiropractor deems it necessary, it is possible to undergo treatment at the first consultation. Your first video visit - Alinea Chiropractic Clinic - Chiro in Hull Aylmer Second appointment: examination report and treatment Following your initial examination, our team of chiropractors in Gatineau (Hull, Aylmer sector) will make a point of explaining your diagnosis to you (and your imaging results if applicable). We will take the time to guide you towards the actions you can take yourself at home to relieve your pain and optimize your health. For example, we may prescribe certain therapeutic exercises, lifestyle modifications, or recommend certain natural products to help you take control of your pain and your health. If treatments are indicated for your clinical presentation, your doctors of chiropractic will explain what can be done based on the best evidence, their clinical experience and of course your goals. If necessary, we can also refer you to another trusted healthcare professional. Chiropractic care protocol: how many visits? Rest assured that in any case, you will not have to commit to a care contract with Alinea Chiropractic. Each individual is unique and responds differently to treatments. It is therefore impossible to predict with certainty how many visits you will need. After a detailed examination and a precise diagnosis of your condition, your chiropractors in Hull Aylmer (Plateau Gatineau) will be able to give you an overview of the number of visits planned. In most clinical presentations, significant improvement can be achieved between 6 and 12 chiropractic treatments. The chiropractors at our chiro clinics in Gatineau have a holistic vision of health. They consider the individual as a whole and aim to support the patient in his healing process. Your active involvement during your care is essential in order to obtain the expected results. Generally, a chiropractic care protocol will be divided into 3 distinct phases: 1. Relief phase First of all, during the relief phase, we promote rapid and natural relief of your pain and discomfort. Like a gym training program, the frequency of chiropractic care is more frequent to allow you to control your symptoms effectively and in the short term. For example, joint adjustments / manipulations provided by chiropractors have been shown to be effective in the short term in reducing pain associated with low back pain ( [Bussi\u00e8res & al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29606335/)), neck pain ( [Bryans 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24262386/)) and headaches ( [Bryans et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21640251/)). 2. Rehabilitation phase Then, during the rehabilitation phase, we will work on the return to normal functioning of the structures. The reduction or complete disappearance of your pain does not indicate that the function of the injured tissues is optimal. They will therefore use therapeutic exercises to work on mobility, strengthening, stretching, endurance and proprioception of the tissues involved in your condition. This phase of care is very important to have long-term effects on your health. The frequency of [chiropractic treatment](https://chiroalinea.ca/chiropratique/chiropractic-treatment-hull-aylmer-gatineau/) will gradually decrease according to clinical progress. 3. Preventive care phase Finally, the preventive care phase aims to prevent the recurrence of pain. A healthy lifestyle that includes daily physical activity, healthy eating, adequate sleep, and stimulating and positive social relationships are of the utmost importance in keeping you healthy and preventing injury. Many patients also consider that a sporadic visit to their treating chiropractor contributes to their well-being. Moreover, some studies ( [Eklund et Al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30208070/) and [Iben et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31832142/)) show that regular follow-up with a chiropractor could help prevent recurrence in low back pain.
