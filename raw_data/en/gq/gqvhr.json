Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 09, 2019 The human body consists of five layers of energy. The first layer is the physical body, which has weight, shape, and volume. You can touch it, see it, and contemplate its reflection in the mirror. But there are four other energy fields surrounding the physical body that are not so easily seen and which are commonly referred to collectively as a person's aura. Together, these five layers, or energy bodies, comprise the human energy field. These layers are where our mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional characteristics are stored. They can be in balance or out of balance. Which is why energy medicine practitioners believe that it's not enough to just treat the physical body when people fall sick. The other four layers must be evaluated and treated as well. How to Detect Energy Fields It takes someone with clairvoyant ability to see the second, third, fourth, and fifth layers, which can, but not always, look completely different from one individual to the other. The layers may also be perceived in ways that do not involve third eye visualization. For example, some energy practitioners can sense a person's aura via touch, scent, or sound. To people with these special abilities, these layers are living energies with a pulse that can be measured. Physical Energy This is the layer that we generally think of as our physical selves. Although our physical bodies are a kind of package, consisting of flesh, skin, bone, organs, and blood, they are also energy, same as the other layers of the body that most people cannot see or sense. Etheric Energy The second, or etheric\u2014from the word \"ether\" \u2014a layer of our energy body, is located approximately one quarter to one-half inch\u2014but not more than an inch\u2014from the physical body. Energy medicine practitioners who are adept at psychically sensing this layer have described it as feeling much like a spider web, sticky, even stretchy. It is also gray or gray-blue in color. The etheric energy body has also been referred to as the blueprint or holograph of the physical body. Emotional Energy The emotional layer of our energy body is the third layer. Centrally located among the five layers, this layer is where our feelings and fears reside. This layer can be quite volatile when we are experiencing extreme high or low emotions. Mental Energy This is the layer from which our ideas spring. Our belief systems are also stored here. This is where our thoughts are assimilated and sorted out, and it is where we house our personal truths, or, rather, our perceptions based on our experiences. Spiritual Energy The spiritual layer of the human energy field is the final layer. It is the place where our \"consciousness\" or \"higher awareness\" resides. This final layer ties us not only to our past lives but also to universal consciousness.
