He did his initial consultation of 3.5 hours (yes that is correct... how many Dr's do you know that spend that much time with their patients) and pinpointed her issues, provided natural medicine and in 2 weeks, she was feeling 100 times better. I really appreciate what you have done for me, my wife and my mother! \" Jose CANONSBURG PENNSYLVANIA "}
