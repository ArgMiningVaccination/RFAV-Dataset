Additionally, the updated Guid ance provides reorganization of som e questions and minor edits to the March 2003 Guidance. 1A. Introduction A-1. What is the purpose of the McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youth ( McKinney-Vento) program? The McKinney-Vento program is designed to address the problem s that hom eless child ren and youth have faced in enrolli ng, atten ding, and su cceeding in school. Under this program , State educational agen cies (S EAs) m ust ensure that each homeless ch ild and you th has equal access to the sam e free, appropriate p ublic education, including a public preschool education, as other children and youth. Hom eless children and youth should have access to the educational and other services that they need to enable them to m eet the sam e challeng ing State s tudent academ ic achievem ent standards to which all student s are held. In addition, hom eless students may not be separated from the m ainstream school environm ent. States and districts are required to review and unde rtake steps to revise laws , regulations, practices, or policies th at may act as a barrier to th e enrollm ent, attend ance, or success in school of homeless children and youth. A-2. What is the statutory author ity for the McKinney-Vento program? The program is authorized under Title VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Hom eless Assistance Act (42 USC 11431 et seq.), (M cKinney-Vento Act). The program was originally authorized in 1 987 and, m ost recently, reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. A-3. What is meant by the te rm \"homeless children and youth\"? The McKinney-Vento Act defines \"hom eless children and youth\" as individuals who lack a f ixed, regula r, and adequate n ighttim e residence. The term includes - Children and youth who are: - sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, econom ic hardship, or a sim ilar re ason (som etimes referred to as doubled-up ); - living in m otels, hotels, trailer pa rks, or cam ping grounds due to lack of alternative adequate accommodations; - living in emergency o r transitional sh elters; - abandoned in hospitals; or - awaiting fos ter care p lacem ent; Children an d youth who have a primary ni ghttime resid ence that is a public or private place not designed for, or or dinarily used as, a regular sleeping accomm odation for human beings ; Children and youth who are living in car s, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or tr ain stations, or sim ilar settings; and 2 Migratory children who qualify as ho meless bec ause they ar e living in circum stances described above. A-4. How does the cu rrent McKinne y-Vento program differ from the predecessor program? The principal differences between the current McKinney-Vento program and the predecessor program include the following: Express prohibition against segregating homeless students - The statu te expressly prohibits a sch ool or State from segregating a hom eless child or youth in a separate school, or in a se parate program within a school, based on the child or youth's status as hom eless. ( See Section E of this guidance.) Requirement for transportation to and from school of origin (see definition in Appendix A) - The State and its local educa tional agencies (LEAs) m ust adopt policies and practices to ensure that transportation is provided, at the request of th e paren t or guardian (o r in the case of the unacco mpanied youth, the liaison) to and from the school of origin. There are specific provisions regarding the responsibility a nd costs for transportation. ( See Section H.) Immediate school enro llment requirement - If a dispute arises over school selection o r placem ent, an LEA m ust admit a hom eless child or youth to the school in which enrollm ent is sought by the parent or guardian, pending resolution of the dispute. ( See Section G.) Changes in \"best interest\" determination - LEAs m ust make school placem ent determ ination s on the bas is of the \"bes t interes t\" of the child or youth. In determ ining what is a child or youth's best interest, an LEA m ust, to the extent feasible, keep a hom eless child or youth in the school of origin, unless doing so is contrary to the wish es of the child or youth's parent or guardian. ( See Section G.) Local lia ison in all s chool distric ts - Every LEA, whether or not it receives a McKinney-Vento subgrant, m ust desi gnate a local liaison for hom eless children and youth. ( See Section F.) New subgrant requirements - A State that receives an allocation g reater than the State m inimum allotm ent m ust competitiv ely subgrant to LEAs at leas t 75 percent of its allo cation. A State that receives the m inimum State allotm ent must com petitively subgrant to LEAs at least 50 percent of its allocation. ( See Sections C and K.) A-5. What Federal civ il rights req uirem ents apply to school districts in educating homeless children? School districts, as recipients of Federal financial assistance and as public entities, must ensure that their ed ucation al program s for hom eless children are ad ministered in a nondiscrim inatory m anner. The Depart ment's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 3enforces Federal laws th at proh ibit d iscrim inatio n on the bas is of race, color, or national origin (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); sex (Title IX of the Education A mendments of 1972); age (A ge Discrim ination Act of 1975); and disability (S ection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as applied to recipients of Federal financial assistance and Title II of the A mericans W ith Disabilities Act of 1990, as applied to public edu cational entities). F or more inform ation about the application of these law s, contact the OCR enfor cement offi ce that serves your state. A-6. What is the purpose of this guidance? This guidan ce rep laces the prior non regulatory g uidance for the Educatio n for Hom eless Children and Youth program . The guidance describes the requirem ents of the current program and provides sugg estions for addressing m any of those requirem ents. The guidance does not im pose any requirem ents beyond those in the program statute and other applicable Federa l statutes and regulations. W hile States may wish to consider the guidance in deve loping their own guidelines and standards, they are free to develop a lternative approaches th at meet the applicab le Federal statutory and regulator y requirem ents. B. Federal Aw ards to States B-1. On w hat basis does the Depar tment aw ard McKinney-Vento funds to States? The Departm ent awards McKinney-Vento funds to States by for mula. The am ount that a S tate receives in a gi ven year is based on th e proportion of funds allocated nationally that it receives under Title I, Part A of the Elem entary and Secondary Education A ct of 1965 (ESEA), for that year. For the purpose of determ ining allotments, the term \"State\" in cludes each of the fifty States, the District o f Colum bia, and Puerto Rico. The m inimum State allocation for fis cal year 2004 is $150,000. B-2. Are the outlying areas and the Burea u of Indian Affair s (BIA) eligible to receive McKinney-Vento funds? Yes. The Departm ent is authorized to reserv e 0.1 percen t of each year's appropriation to award grants to the outly ing areas (i.e., the U. S. Virgin Islands, Guam , American Sam oa, and the Co mmonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). In addition, the Department transfers, under a m emorandum of agreem ent, one percen t of each year's appropriation to the BIA for program s for hom eless Indian students served by schools funded by the BIA. 4C. State Uses of Funds C-1. For what purposes may a Stat e use its McKinney-Vento allocation? A State m ay use its McKinney-Vento allocation f or the following purposes: State activities - A State that receives an a llocatio n greater th an the State minimum allotm ent (i.e., greater th an $150,000 for FY 2004) m ay reserve for State-level activities up to 25 percent of its alloca tion f or that fiscal yea r. A State funded at the m inimum level m ay reserve for State-level activities up to 50 percent of its allocati on for that fiscal year. Subgrants to LEAs - An SEA m ust award funds not reserved for State-level activ ities to LEAs on a com petitiv e basis. C-2. For what purposes may a State use McKinney-Vento funds that are reserved fo r State-level activities? A State m ay use McKinney-Vento funds that are m ade available for State use to support the broad array of activities conducted by the Office of Coordinator for Education of Hom eless Children and Youth. ( See Section 722(f) of the statute and Part D of this guidance.) The SEA may conduct these activities directly or through grants or contracts. D. Office of the Coordinator Fo r Education Of Homeless Children And Youth D-1. What are the primary responsibili ties o f the State Coordinator for Education of Homeless Children and Youth? The prim ary responsibilities of the S tate coordinator are to: Develop and carry out the St ate's McKinney-Vento plan; Gather valid, reliable, and com prehens ive inform ation on the problem s faced by hom eless children and youth, the progress of the SEA and LEAs in addressing those problem s, and the su ccess of McKinney-Vento program s in allowing ho meless child ren and youth to enro ll in, attend, an d succeed in school; Coordinate services on behalf of the McKinney-Vento program ; Provide tech nical assistance to LEAs in coord ination with th e local lia isons to ensure th at LEAs com ply with the McKinney-Vento Act; and Collect and transm it to the U.S. Depa rtment of Education, upon request, a report containing the inform ation that th e Department determ ines is necessary to assess the educational need s of hom eless children and youth. 5D-2. What are the rep orting requ irements th at State coordinators must meet? The McKinney-Vento Act gives the Departm ent the au thority to collect from States, at such tim es as the Departm ent may require, inf ormation that the Departm ent determ ines is necessary to assess the e ducational needs of hom eless children and youth. The Departm ent will be issui ng further g uidance on State reporting responsibilities. D-3. What are the State coordinator's respon sibilities regarding the coordination of services? State coordinators m ust facilitate coor dination among the SEA, the State social services agency, and oth er agencies (inc luding agencies providing m ental health services) to provide services to hom eless children and yout h and their families. To improve the provision of com prehensive se rvices to these children and youth and their f amilies, coordina tors m ust coordina te and collabo rate with educa tors, inc luding child developm ent and preschool progra m personnel, and service providers. Additionally, State coordinators m ust coor dinate services with local lia isons and community organizations and groups repr esenting hom eless children, youth, and families. Com prehensive services include health care, nu trition, and oth er social services. Where applicable, State coordinators must also coordinate services with State and local housing agencies responsible for de veloping com prehensive affordable housing strategies under Section 105 of the Cranston/Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Public Law 101-625). Additio nally, State Coordinato rs may wish to coordinate housing, health and other services with the State representatives for the President' s Interagency Council on Hom elessness - United States Interagency Council on Hom elessness \u00b7 451 7th Street SW \u00b7 Suite 2200 \u00b7 Washington , DC \u00b7 20410. D-4. What are the tech S tate ust provi de tech nical assistance to LEAs, in coordination with local liaisons, to ensure LEA com pliance on such issues as school choice and placem ent, enrollm ent policies, en rollment di sputes, schoo l records, duties of local liaisons, and reviewing and re vising policies that m ay act as enrollm ent ba rriers. Through strong leadership and collabor ation and communication with the LEA liaisons, the State coordinato r can help ensure that di stricts will carry ou t the requirem ents of the Act. Establishing clea r-cut policies and p rocedures at the Sta te level and m aking sure d istricts know and understand them will facilitate th e smooth and consistent im plementation of the McKinney-Vento Act. 6 Enrollment Barriers The school enrollm ent and retention barriers that hom eless children and youth m ost frequently face are the fo llowing: transportation, immunizatio n requirem ents, residency requirem ents, providing birth certificates, legal guardianship requirem ents. U.S. Department of Education's McKinney-Vento Report To Congress for Fiscal Year 2000 D-5. Is the State coord inator requ ired to prov ide technica l to school districts that receiv e McKinney-Vento subgrants? No. The State coordinator m ust provide tec hnical assistance to a ll school districts. The McKinney-Vento Act requires that all hom eless children be given the opportunity to achieve to challengi ng State academ ic standards. D-6. By w hat means sh ould State coordi nators provide technical assistance? The State coordinator may pr ovide a wide activ State conferences, guidance docum ents for LEA liaisons, a State W ebsite that add resses Mc Kinney-Vento issues and provides a listing of State reso urces, a lis tserv, a to ll-free help line, and newsletters or bulletins. Many school districts have not im plem ented targeted se rvices for hom eless child ren and youth. Therefore, S tate le vel technical assistance will be essential to fam iliarize new LEA liaisons with the requirem ents of the McKinney-Vento Act and to provide guidance on serving eligible students. D-7. What are examples of technical assi stance that school districts may need? Areas in which school districts and LEA liaisons m ay need technical assistance include the following: Understanding the requirem ents of the McKinney-Vento Act; Establishing procedures to address pr oblem s related to enrollm ent and school selec inter-distri ct disputes; ining LEA needs and developing a plan for services; Creating school district and community awarenes s of the need s of eligib le students; Identifying Federal, S tate, and local resources; Identifying hom eless children and youth; Collecting d ata; Enhancing parental involvem ent activities; and Identifying s trategies for im proving academ ic achievem ent. 7 Technical Assistance Strategies: Best Practices Many State and local hom eless educati on coordinators conduct extensive awareness activities. As school perso nnel gain a broader understanding of the needs of hom eless children and youth, they are better able to implement policies and p ractices that ensure access to school and support success in school. Inform ation dissem ination is often cited as a successful strategy used by State coordinators to ensure school districts understand and uphold the McKinney-Vento Act. Inform ation dissem inatio n activ ities include th e publication of guidance and m anuals , holding State conferences for homeless education, and providing web pages on SEA websites. Several S tate coordinators reported visiting McKinney-Vento subgrantees to offer assistance with program eval uation. Technical assistance through interagency coordination is key to m eeting the needs of eligible students and providing com prehensive serv ices that are continuous and non- duplica tive. The Education of Homeless Children and Youth Program: Learning to Succeed E. Prohibition Agai nst Segregation E-1. May States or d istricts segregate homeless children and youth in separate schools or in separate programs w ithin a school? No. Hom elessness alone is not sufficien t reason to separate students from the mainstream school environm ent. SEAs a nd LEAs m ust adopt policies and practices to ensure that students are not segregated or stigm atized on the basis of their status as homeless. Services prov ided with McKi nney-Vento Act funds m ust not replace the regular acad emic program and m ust be desi gned to expand u pon or im prove services provided as part of the school' s regular acad emic program . If a State receives funds under the McKinney-Vento program , every district in th at State - whether or not it receiv es a McKinney-Vento subgrant from its SEA - is prohibite d from segregating hom eless students in separate schools or in separate program s within schools, based on the child's or youth's status as hom eless. Schools m ay not provide services w ith McKinney-Vento funds on school grounds in settings that segregate hom eless children and youth from other children and youth [except as necessary for short periods of tim e for health 8and safety em ergencies or to provide tem porary, special, and supplem entary services to m eet the unique needs of hom eless children and youth]. There is a v ery lim ited exception to th e prohibition against segregating hom eless students in separate schools or in separate settings within a school that applies only to four \"covered counties\" - Orange Count y, CA; San Diego County, CA; San Joaquin County, CA; and Marico pa County, AZ - if the conditions described in section 722(e)(3)(B) of the statute are m et. The De partm ent has provided separate guidance on this ex ception to the af fected States and dis tricts. E-2. May a district edu cate homeless children at an off-site facility, su ch as a shelter? No. Hom eless children and youth must be educated as part of a school's regular academ ic program . Ser vices m ust be provided to hom eless child ren and youth through program s and m echanis ms that in tegrate hom eless children and youth with their non-hom eless counterparts. Services provided with McKinney-Vento funds must expand upon or improve services pr ovided as part of the regular school program . E-3. May a school separate a child from the regular school program if he or she resides in a domestic violence shelter? No, however, schools can and should take all other necessary steps to protect children who are victim s of dom estic violence, such as protecting children' s identity in school database system s, arranging for anonym ous pick-up and drop-off locations for school buses, enrolling children in a different school, sensitizing bus drivers and school personnel to the child' s circum stances, tr aining school staff on confidentiality laws and policies, and helping families to f ile cop ies of protective o rders with schools. In this way, schools can address safety c oncerns and provide equal educational opportunities without causing further disruption in children' s lives. E-4. Are \"transitiona l classroo ms\" in shelters, w here children and youth receiv e educational services w hile they are being assessed or w hile they w ait for school records, permiss ible u nder McKinney-Vento? No. Districts are required to adopt p olicies that will elim inate barriers to school enrollm ent that m ay be caused by tracki ng, obtaining, and transferring records. F. Local Liaisons F-1. Is every LEA in a State required to desig nate a loca l liaison for h omeles s children an d youth? Yes. Every LEA - whet her or not it r eceives a McKinney-Vento subgrant - is required to designate a local liaison. 9F-2. What are the responsib ilities of the loca l liaison for h omeles s children and youth? The local lia ison serv es as one of the prim ary contacts betwee n hom eless f amilies and school staff, district personnel, shelter wo rkers, and other service providers. The liaison coordinates services to ensure that hom eless children and youth enroll in school and h ave the oppo rtunity to su cceed academ ically. Local liaiso ns m ust ensure that: Hom eless children and youth are id entified by school personnel and through coordination activities wi th other entities and agencies; Hom eless students enroll in, and ha ve full and equal opportunity to succeed in, the schools o f the LEA; Hom eless children and youth and th eir fam ilies receive educational servic es for which they a re eligib le, including Head Start, Even Start, and preschool program s administered by the LEA, and referrals to health, mental health, dental, and other appropriate services; Parents or guardians of hom eless ch ildren and youth are inform ed of educational and related opportunities av ailable to their children, and are provided with m eaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children; Parents and guardians an d unaccom panied youth are fully inform ed of all transportation services, including trans portation to and from the school of origin, and are ass isted in access ing transportatio n services; Enrollm ent disputes are m ediated in the req uirements of the and Public notic e of the edu al rights of hom eless students is dissem inated to locations where they receive se rvices under the McKinney-Vento Act. In meeting these responsibilities, local li aisons must assist hom eless children and youth with such activities as the following: Enrolling in school and accessing sch ool serv ices; Obtaining immunizations or m edical records; Inform ing parents, school personnel, and others of the rights of hom eless children and youth; Working with school staff to m ake sure that hom eless children and youth are imm ediately enrolled in school pending resolution of disputes that might arise over school enrollm ent or placem ent; Helping to coordinate transportati on services for hom eless children and youth; and Collaborating and coordinating with St ate Coordinators for the Education of Hom eless Children and Youth and community and school personnel responsible for providing educati on and related support services to homeless children and youth. 10 Needs Assessment: Best Practices A particu larly effective tool fo r addressing the problem s face d by homeless children and youth is im plem enting a needs assessm ent process that, in turn, can shape the develop ment of an a ction plan. T aking tim e to identify the needs of hom eless child ren and fam ilies and the resources the school dis trict and com munity offer will enab le the liaison to m ake inform ed de cisions about the types of ac tivities that will resu lt in s ervices to enhance o pportunities for school su ccess for eligible students. The liaison can collaborate w ith other program s, organizations, and agencies to set goals for hom eless education progra ms and services and should collect data on an ongoing basis to determ ine progress in achieving the goals. The data will provide the foundation for the im provem ent of services for eligible s tudents. Local Homeless Liaison Toolkit F-3. What is the relationship betw een the SEA and the loc al liaisons? An SEA must ensure that each of its LEAs designates an app ropriate s taff person to serve as a liaison for ho meless child ren and youth. The SEA should obtain from each of its LEAs, by a date specified by the Stat e, contact inform ation concerning the local liaisons. Through its State coordinator, the S EA should provide guidance to LEAs to assist them in designating local li aisons and in understanding th e duties and responsibilities of the liaisons. The SEA should work with LEAs and local liai sons throughout the year to ensure that hom eless children and youth are receiving the se rvices that they need in ord er to enro ll in, attend, and succeed in school. F-4. How can a State assist LEAs in designating local liaisons? The State m ay issue gu idance to LE As that describes factors for an LEA to consider in designating its liaison. The type of person best suited to address the problem s faced by hom eless child ren and youth m ay vary accord ing to the particu lar circum stances within a State or district. For example, in appointing a liaison, an LEA might consider the following: If it is like ly tha t the L EA will hav e to rev ise local policies and proced ures to address enrollm ent and school atte ndance barriers, the LEA may want to designate as a liaison an individua l who is cur rently in a po sition to communicate effectively with policy makers. That person m ight be a director of pupil servic es, a local Title I coordinator, or an assistant superintendent. 11 If an LEA has in place strong lo cal p olicies and p rocedures to assist homeless students, the LEA m ight c onsider designating as a liaison an individual closer to the provision of direct services. For example, social workers, other support staff, and guidance counselors have been successful liaisons due to their skills and experience with outreach efforts in the community. F-5. What strategies can a local liaison use to identify ho meles s pres choolers? Local liaisons can identify preschool-aged homeless children by working closely with shelters and social service agen cies in their area. In a ddition, the liaison should work with school personnel, w ho can inquire, at the time they are enrolling homeless children and youth in school, whether the fa mily has preschool-aged children. The LEA liaison should also co llaborate with the school di strict special education program . The Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that highly mobile children with disabilities, such as migrant and hom eless children who are in need of special edu catio n and related services, are loca ted, identified and evaluated. Additionally, IDEA re quires that hom eless preschooler s and all hom eless children be included in the \"Child Find\" process for early ide ntification o f special edu cation needs. F-6. How can a local liaison assist home less fa milies in enro lling their children in a presch ool if the pr ogram has a w aiting list? The LEA liaison should work with presc hool program staff to rem ind them how important th eir services are for hom eless ch ildren and to inf orm them of how waiting lists of ten cr eate ba rriers for hom eless f amilies w ho wish to e nroll their c hildren. Some preschool program s keep slots ope n specifically for hom eless children. Identify ing Home less C hildren and Youth: Best Pract ices Hom eless children and youth are difficu lt to identify for m any reasons, and thus often go unnoticed by school personnel. In order to identify homeless children both in and out of school, LEA liaisons can coordinate with comm unity service agencies, su ch as shelters, soup kitchens, food banks, transitional liv ing program s, street outrea ch team s, drop-in centers, community action agencies (especially in rural areas, where there m ay be no shelters), welfare departm ents, housing orga nizations to begin to develop a relationship on issues such as the school enro llment proces s, transportation, and othe r student services. Where available, th e LEA liaisons ca n engage the local hom eless task force, hom eless coalition , and hom eless ass istance \"Continuu Care\" as partn ers in the iden tification of students who are hom eless. LEA liaisons can develop relationships with truancy officials or other attend ance o fficers and train them on how to recognize school absences that m ay be the resu lt of hom elessness. 12They can provide officials with inform ation so that they m ay discreetly refer eligib le studen ts to appropriate services. LEA liaison s can use creative techn iques to id entify unaccompanied homeless youth while respecting thei r privacy and dignity, such as administerin g surveys to peers, us ing enrollm ent questionnaires, or providing specific outreach to areas wher e eligib le stud ents who are out of school m ight congregate. Liaisons can m ake speci al efforts to identify homeless preschool children. LEA liaisons can provide a district-w ide residency questionnaire to all students upon enrollm ent. Questionnaires that m ay suggest hom elessness can be sent to the local liaison for a final determ ination of homeless status, and, if affirm ative, lead to the provi sion of referrals and other assistance (See Exam ple in Appendix D.) LEA liaisons should avoid using the word \"hom eless\" in initial contacts with school personnel, f amilies, or y outh. For most people, the word \"hom eless\" conjures up stereotypical images of a dults, not children or youth in classroom s. Sc hool personnel m ay be unlikely to recognize students who are hom eless initially, but often respond affir matively when asked if they know of students who ar e staying temporarily w ith relatives, are staying at cam pgrounds or in their car, are living at m otels, are living with another fa mily tem porarily, or have m oved s everal tim es in a year. Families an d students w ho are hom eless m ay not think of themselves as \"hom eless\" because of the stigm a attached. Therefore, outreach posters and m aterials placed in shelters, campgrounds, motels, and pu blic housing projects should describe the sym ptoms of hom elessness (for exam ple, different kinds of living situations) ra ther than simply refer to a person' s \"hom eless\" status. Local Liaison Toolkit G. School Placement, Enrollme nt, and Eligibility for Serv ices G-1. On w hat basis does an LEA make school placement determinations for homeless children and youth? Hom eless children and youth frequently m ove, and m aintaining a stable school environm ent is critical to th eir success in school. To ensu re this stabil ity, LEAs must make school placem ent determ ination s on th e basis of the \"best interest\" of the homeless child or youth. Using this standard, an LEA must - (a) Continue the child's or youth's edu cation in the school of origin for the duration of hom elessness when a fam ily becomes hom eless between academ ic 13years or du ring an academ ic year; or for the rem ainder of the academ ic year if the child or youth becom es per manently housed during an academ ic year; or (b) Enroll the child or youth in any pub lic school that non-hom eless students who live in the a ttendance are a in which the child o r youth is a ctually living a re eligible to attend. G-2. How does an LEA determin e the child's or yout h's best interest, an LEA m ust, to the extent feasible, keep a hom eless child or youth in the \"school of origin\" unless doing so is contrary to the wishes of the child or youth's parent or guardian. If an LEA wishes to send a homeless child or youth to a school other than the school of origin or a school requested by the parent or guardian, the LEA must provide a written explanation of its decision to the parent or guardian, together with a stat ement regarding the right to appeal the placem ent decision. G-3. Why is it so important to mainta in a stab le education environment for homeless children and youth? Changing schools significantly im pedes a stude nt's academ ic and social growth. The literature on highly m obile stud ents indicates that it can ta ke a student four to six months to recover academ ically after cha nging schools. Highly m obile students have also been fo und to have lower test scor es and overall academ ic perform ance than peers who do not change schools. Ther efore, the McKinney-Vento Act calls for LEAs to m aintain students in their school of origin to the extent feasible. G-4. What should a school district co nsider when determining the extent to which it is f easible to e ducate a homeles s child or youth in his or her school of origin? As stated above, to the extent feasible, a district must educate a hom eless child o r youth in his or her school of origin, unless doi ng so is contrary to the wishes of the parent o r guardian. The placem ent dete rmination should be a student-cen tered, individualized determ ination. Factors that an L EA may consider include the age of the child or youth; the distance of a comm ute and the im pact it m ay have on the student's education; personal safety issues ; a stu dent's need for special instruction (e.g., special education and related services ); the length of anticipated stay in a temporary shelter or other tem porary locati on; and the tim e remaining in the school year. G-5. What procedures must an LEA follo w if a dispute arises betw een a school and a parent or guardian regarding pla cement of a homeless child or youth? If a dispute arises over school selection or enrollm ent, the LEA m ust immediately enroll the hom eless student in the school in which enrollm ent is sought by the parent or guardian, pending res olution of th e disput e. Sim ilar provisions apply placem ent of unaccompanied youth. Inter-district enro llment dispu tes should be ( See G-9). 14Hom eless fam ilies and youth m ay be unaware of their righ t to challenge placem ent and enrollment decisions. Therefore, the LEA must provide the parent, guardian, or unaccom panied youth with a written statem ent of the schoo l placem ent decision and the appeal rights. The L EA must refer the unaccom panied youth, parent, or guardian to the LEA liaison, who must expeditiously car ry out the dispute resolution process. When enrollm ent disputes arise, it is cri tical that students not be kept out of school. Interruption in education can severely di srupt the student's academ ic progress. To avoid such disruptions, LEAs need an established process for resolving school placem ent disputes. Pe rmitting stud ents to en roll imm ediately in the s chool of choice pending resolution of disputes he lps provide needed stability. LEA hom eless liaisons help ensure that dispu tes are resolved objectively and expeditiously. W ritten n otice p rotects both stude nts and scho ols by outlin ing the specific reasons for the school's decision. It facilitates di spute resolution by providing decision-m with docum ents to guide their determ inations. G-6. In providing special services to homeless children an d youth, how does a school or district avoid st igmatiz ing those children? As stated above, a district or school m ay not segregate hom eless children and youth from the m ainstream school environm ent. Homeless children and youth are entitled to receive all of the services that are provided to their non-ho meless counterparts and in the sam e setting as th eir non-hom eless peers. In som e circum stances, it m ay be appropr iate to provide add itiona l serv ices to homeless children and youth in a separate se tting. In doing so, a district should be careful not to stigm atize these students. If a district does im plement a supplem ental program exclusively for hom eless children, su ch as a shelter-based even ing tutoring program , it should not be cal led \"the hom eless tutoring program \" or the \"shelter tutoring program .\" Instead, the district s hould use a nam e such as \"Discovery Club\" or \"Hom ework Club\" to Attendance Statistics The Departm ent's FY 2000 Report to Congress indicated that 87 percent of hom eless K-12 child ren and youth were enrolled in school. However, only 77 percent a ttended school regularly. Less than 16 percent of eligible pres choo l aged hom eless child ren were enrolled in preschool program s. U.S. Department of Education's McKinney-Vento Report to Congress for Fiscal Y ear 2000 15G-7. What are a school's responsib ilities for en rolling hom eless ch ildren and youth? A school selected on the of a \"best interest determ ination\" ( see G-1 and G-2) must imm ediately enro ll the hom eless child o r youth, even if the child or youth is unable to produce the records norm ally requi red for enrollm ent (such as previous academ ic records, m edical records, p roof of residency, birth certificates, o r other docum entation). The enrolling school m ust immediately con tact the scho ol las t attend ed by the child or youth to obtain relevan t academ ic or other record s. If a child or youth needs to obtain imm unizations, or m edical or imm unization records, the enrolling school m ust immediat ely refer the parent or guardian to the LEA hom eless liaison, who m ust assist in obtaining the im munizations or records. The record s must be m aintained so th at they are availab le in a tim ely fashion when the child enters a new school or scho ol dist rict. To facilitate immediate enrollm ent, timely transf er of records from school to school should also take into account procedures for State-to -State reco rd transfers. The McKinney-Vento statute provides a broa d mandate to States and districts to change policies or practices that act as a bar rier to th e enrollm ent, attendance, and school success of hom eless children. It is important for them to review policies and practices on an on-going basis, so that new barriers do not prevent children from receiving the free, appropriate public education to which they are entitled. G-8. What are some steps that LEAs ca n take to ensure immedia te enrollment? Hom eless children and youth often do not have the docum ents ordinarily required for school enro llment. Enrolling them in school immediately pro vides th ese children and youth needed stability and also is a legal requirem ent. To facilitate imm ediate en rollm ent, LEAs should consid er the following practices: Train all school enrollm ent staff, s ecretaries, guidance counselors, school social workers, and principals on the legal requirem ents regarding imm ediate enrollm ent; Review all regulations and policies to ensure th at they com ply with the McKinney-Vento requirem ents; Develop affidavits of residence or ot her form s to replace typical proof of residency. Such for ms should be carefu lly crafted so that they do not create further barriers or delay enrollm ent; Develop caregiver affidavits, en rollme nt form s for unaccom panied youth, and other form s to rep lace ty pical p roof of guardiansh ip. Again, s uch for ms should be carefully crafted so they do not create further barriers or delay enrollm ent; Establish school-based immuni zation clinics or on-site immunizatio ns; Collaborate with comm unity-based or public agencies to provide school uniform s within a district a nd am ong neighboring districts; Accept scho ol reco rds directly from families and youth; 16 Contact th e previous s chool for r ecords and assistance with p lacem ent decisions; Develop sho rt education al assessm ents to place students imm ediately while awaiting co mplete acad emic record s; Inform families and youth in a language they can understand or in an access ible format, as appropriate, of their righ t to attend eith er their s chool of origin o r local schoo l; Inform families and youth in a language they can understand or in an access ible format, as appropriate, of their righ t to transpo rtation and immediate enrollm ent; Develop access ible forms for written exp lanations of decisions and the right to appeal; and Expeditiou sly follow up on any special education and languag e assis tance referra ls or s ervices. G-9. What are effectiv e strategies fo r a LEA to use to res olve enrollment disputes? An LEA should consider the following st rategies for effectively resolving school enrollm ent disputes: Disputes should be resolved at the dist rict level rather than the school level; When inter-district issues arise, repr esentatives from all involved districts and the SEA should be present to resolve the dispute; A State-level appeal process, involv ing the State coordinator, should be available for appeals of d istrict-level decis ions an d The dispute resolu tion p rocess should be as inform al and accessible as possible, an d allow f or impartia l and com plete re view; Parents, guardians, and unaccom panied yout h should be able to initiate th e dispute resolution process di rectly at the school they choose, as well as at the district or L EA hom eless liaison's of fice; States shou ld estab lish tim elines to r esolve disputes at the local and State level; Parents, guardians, and unaccom panied youth sh ould be info rmed that th ey can provid e written or or al docum entation to sup port th eir po sition ; Students should be provided with all serv ices for which they a re eligib le while disputes are resolved ; Written notice should be com plete, as brief as po ssible, sim ply stated, and provided in a language the paren t, guardian, o r unaccom panied youth can understand. The notice should include: 1. Contact inform ation for the LEA hom eless liaison and State coordinator, with a brief de scription of their roles; 2. A sim ple, detachable form that parents, guardians, or unaccom panied youth can com plete and turn in to the schoo l to initiate the dispute process. (T he school should copy the form and return the copy to the parent, gua rdian or youth for their records when it is su bmitted) ; 173. A step-by-step description of how to dispute the school's decision; 4. Notice of the right to enroll imm ediately in the school of choice pending resolution of the dispute; 5. Notice th at \"immediate enrollm ent\" includes f ull participa tion in all school activities; 6. Notice of the right to appeal to the S tate if the district-level resolution is not satisfactory; and 7. Timelines for resolving district- and S tate-level appeals. G-10. Are children w ho are aw aiting fost er care placement eligible for services under the McKinney-Vento Act? Yes. As stated in A-3, children who are awaiting foster care placem ent are consider ed homeless and eligible f or McKinney-Vento services. (See Section 725(2)(B)(i) of the McKinney-Vento Act.) Children who are already in foster care , on the other hand, ar e not considered homeless. L EA liaisons should confer and co ordinate with local public social service agency providers in determ ining how best to assist hom eless children and youth who are awaiting foster care placem ent. G-11. Are children displaced from th eir hou sing by naturally occu rring disasters eligible fo r services under the McKin ney-Vento Act? When childr en and the ir families ar e displa ced f rom their hou sing as a res ult of a natural disaster, there is often a period of instability in which various private organizations and local, State, and F ederal agencies prov ide assistance. S EAs and LEAs should determ ine such children's eligibility for McKinney-Vento services on a case-by-case basis. In m aking this determ ination, they should take into consideration the serv ices that are available throug h these o ther sources. Following a disaster, one of the LEA's first priorities is to re-open im pacted schools as soon as possible and take steps to nor malize school routines. LEAs should then proceed to exam ine whether ch ildren who have been disp laced by the natural d isaster are eligible for McKinney-Vento services on a case-by-case basis. In such circum stances, the Departm ent would provide technical assistance and other assis tance, as available, to help the L EA. 18H. Transportation Transportation: The Number One Barrier The FY 2000 Report to Congress cite d lack of transportation as the number one barrier that hom eless ch ildren and y outh faced in attem pting to enroll in and attend school regularly. U.S. Department of Education's McKinney-Vento Report to Congress for Fiscal Y ear 2000 H-1. What responsibilities do SEAs and LEAs have regarding providing transportation services to ho meless children and youth? SEAs and LEAs are responsible for revi ewing and revising policies, including transpo rtation polic ies, that m ay act as barr iers to the enrollm ent and retention of homeless children and youth in schools in th e State. Under the McKinney-Vento Act, homeless children and youth are entitled to rec eive th e transportation and other services that are available to non-hom eless students. SEAs and LEAs m ust adopt policies and prac tices to ensure that transportation is provided, at the request of the parent or guardian (or, in th e case of an unaccom panied youth, the liaison), to or from the \"school of origin\" ( see definition in Appendix A) in accordan ce with the following requirem ents: If the hom eless child or youth contin ues to live in the area served by the LEA in which the school of origin is located, that LEA must provide or arrange for th e child's or youth's tran sportation to or from the school of origin. If the hom eless child or youth contin ues his or her education in the school of origin but begins living in an area served by another LEA, the LEA of origin and the LEA in which the hom eless child or youth is living m ust agree upon a m ethod to apportion the responsibility and costs for providing the child with tr ansportation to and from the school of origin. If the LEAs cannot ag ree upon a m ethod, the responsibility and costs for transpo rtation are to b e shared equ ally. 19 Steps to Improve Transportation for Homeless Students Although the McKinney-Vento Act perm its homeless students to remain in th eir schoo ls of origin despite their res identia l instability, lack of transportati on commonly prevents them from doing s o. Given that transportation has been one of the foremost enrollm ent ba rriers, in guidance to districts, States s hould highlight the transportation responsibilities of LEAs under th e reauthorized McKinney-Vento statu te. Additionally, highly m obile students have been found to have lower test scores and overall academ ic perfor mance than peers who do not change schools. This dim inished achievem ent hurts students and schools. States should w ork in con cert with LEA s to develop practices and policies to ensure that transpor tation is provided as required under the statute. Adopting a \"One Child, One School, One Year\" policy and providing transportation to enable a student to rem ain at his/her school of origin assures that a hom eless student need not change schools before the end of a current academ ic year. A system atic process - with agreed -upon steps and individual roles - can help hom eless students get to and from school efficiently and reliably. LE As should - (1) Identify one individual as the key contact regarding transpo rtation; (2) Develop a process to determ ine th e best inte rests of the student regarding travel to a particular school; (3) Standa rdize transpo rtation -related data for transportation em ergencies with back-up support; and (5) Identify other source s for funding or arranging transpo rtation. U.S. Department of Education's McKinney-Vento Report to Congress for Fiscal Y ear 2000 H-2. How can LEAs ensure that th e educ ation of homeless students is not disrupted during inter-district transfers? LEAs should have in place in ter-district (and inter-State, wh ere app ropriate) agreem ents that address potential transpor tation issues tha t may aris e as h omeless students transfer from one district to another. 20 H-3. May funds under Part A of Title I or Part A of Title V of the ESEA be used to transport homeless students to and from the school of origin? In general, LEAs m ay not use funds under Ti tle I, Part A or T itle V, Part A to transport hom eless students to or from their school of origin. Tr ansportation services to the school of origin are m andated under the McKinney-Vento Act's statute. The \"no-supplanting\" provisions in Title I a nd Title V prohibit those funds from being used to supp ort ac tivities that the LEA would otherwise be required to provide. H-4. Who should be involved in develo ping and implementing transportation policies for homeless students? School districts can best a ddress the transportation n eeds of hom eless and other highly m obile students through a team appro ach. However, based on the best interest of the stude nt and in co nsulta tion w ith th e paren t, the LEA ultim ately de termines the mode of transportation. The LEA's transpor tation director is a key figure in the process and should work with district leadership, the local liaison for homeless students, neighboring district s, and hom eless service providers to develop effective transpo rtation polic ies and procedures. Steps district directors of pup il transportation can take to support the transportation of homeless children and youth Comm unicate regularly with the district hom eless liaison Establish procedures to re ceive infor mation about the transportation needs and pickup location of hom eless students Train bus drivers and dispat chers on the rights and needs of homeless students, as w ell as on the need f or sen sitivity and confidentia lity Develop a bus routing system that can respond flexibly and quickly to new \"pickups\" Be aware of new m otel and she lter locations and pr epare to create bus stops nearby Support increased district comm itment to provide hom eless students transportation to school, as well as to before-and after-school program s. The Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program: Learning to Succeed H-5. Is an LEA requir ed to transp ort homeless students to and from their school of origin, if need ed, while en rollment disputes are b apply while disputes are being resolved. Therefore, at the request of the parent or guardian (or in the case of an unaccom panied youth, th e liaison), th e LEA m ust provide or arrange fo r transportation to 21and from the school of origin. Inter-district transportation disputes should be resolved at the SEA lev el. (See section 722(g)(1)(C). H-6. If an LEA does not provide transportati on to non-homeless stu dents, is it required to transpor t homele ss students? Yes. As discussed above, the statute not only requires an LE A to provide com parable services, including transportati on services, to hom eless student s, it also requires an LE A, at the request of a parent or guardian, to provide or arrange for transpo rtation to and f rom the school of origin. H-7. Do LEA transportation resp onsibilities apply to all LEAs in the State or on ly to those LEAs that receive a McKinney-Vento subgrant? This requ irement applies to all LEAs in the State. H-8. Does McKinney-Vento require an LEA to provide transportation services to homeless children attending preschool? To the extent an LEA offers a public pr eschool education, McKi nney-Vento requires that hom eless children have equal access to that preschool education as provided to non-hom eless children. Furtherm ore, the stat ue requires that the services provided to homeless children be comparable to those provided to non-hom eless children. Thus, if an LEA provides transportation for non-hom eless preschool children, it must also provide com parable transportation serv ices for hom eless preschool children. I. Comparable and Coordinated Services I-1. What are an LEA' s responsibilit ies regarding \"comparable services\"? An LEA in a participating State m ust provi de services to each hom eless child and youth that is com parable to services offe red to other students in the LEA. These services include public preschool program s, and educational program s or services for which a hom eless stude nt meets the elig ibility criteria, su ch as program s for children with disabilities, program s for students w ith lim ited English proficiency, vocational education, program s for gifted and tale nted students, befo re-and after-school program s, school nutrition pr ogram s, and transportation. I-2. What are an LEA' s responsibilities regarding coordination of services for homeless children and youth? LEAs are responsible for coordinating with local social service agencies and other service providers and program s, including program s under the Runaway and Hom eless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) , and with other LEAs on issues such as transpo rtation and the tra nsfer of records. Additio nally, they must coordinate with housing assistance providers. ( see D-3.) The purpose of this coordination is to ensure that eligible students have acce ss and reasonable proxim ity to available 22education and related support se rvices. It is also important to coordinate efforts in order to raise the aw areness of school personnel and se rvice providers of the effects of hom elessness and the challenges that hom eless students face. J. Homeless Unaccompanied Youth J-1. Why does the McKinney-Vento Act place specia l emphasis on serving the needs of homeless unaccompanied youth? Hom eless unaccom panied youth often face uniq ue barriers in enrolling and succeed ing in school. T hese barriers incl ude sch ool attendan ce policies, credit accrual, and legal gu ardianship requ irements. Without a parent or guard ian to advocate for them and exercis e parental ri ghts, they m ay be denied enrollm ent and remain out of school for extended periods of tim e. Unaccom panied youth also m ay not understand their educationa l rights, or know how to acquire this inform ation. J-2. How do local liaisons assist h omele ss unaccompanied youth in accessing the educational services to which they are entitled ? Local liaisons assist unaccom panied youth in accessing educational services through such activities as: Helping unaccom panied youth choose and en roll in a school, after considering the youth's wishes; Providing u naccom panied youth with noti ce of their app eal rights in a language they can understand or in an accessible f ormat; Inform ing youth of their right to tran sportation to and from the school of origin, and assisting unaccom panied yout h in accessing tran sportation; and unaccom panied youth are imm ediately enro lled in school pending the resolution of disputes. K. Subgrants to LEAs K-1. What portion of an SEA's McKinne y-Vento allocation must be used for subgrants to LEAs? An SEA that receives m ore than the m inimum statutory McKinney-Vento allocation (see section 722(c)(i)) must s ubgrant at least 75 percent of its allocation to LEAs. (See C-1.) An SEA that receives th e minimum statutory McKinney-Vent o allocation must subgrant at least 50 percent of its allocation to L EAs. ( See C-1.) 23K-2. On w hat basis does an SEA aw ard McKinney-Vento subgrants to LEAs? An SEA awards McKinney-Vento subgrants to LEAs com petitively on the basis of the needs of the LEAs requesting ass istance and the quality of their applications. K-3. What information must an LEA include in its applicat ion for McKinney - Vento funds? An LEA tha t seeks a McKinney-Vento award must subm it to its SEA an a pplica tion that con tains the f ollowin g information: An assessment of the ed ucation al and related needs of hom eless children and youth in the area served by the LEA; A description of the services and pr ogram s that the LEA would provide; An assurance that the L EA meets the maintenance-of -effort requirem ent; An assurance that the L EA would us e subgrant funds in compliance with section 722(g) (3) through (7) of the McKinney-Vento Act; and A description of policies and procedur es that the LEA would undertake to ensure th at its ac tivitie s would not isolate or stig matize homeless ch ildren and youth. K-4. For how long may an LEA receiv e a su bgrant? An LEA ma y receive McKinney-Vento subgr ant funds for a period no t to exceed three years. An LEA ma y re-apply for additional McKinney-Vento funds after the initial thre e-year pe riod expi res. The meet the requirem ents outlin ed in K-3 above. L. Local Uses of Funds L-1. For what activities may an LEA use McKinney-Vento subgrant funds? LEAs m ust use McKinney-Ven to funds to assist hom eless children and youth in enrolling, attending, and succeed ing in school. In particular, the funds m ay support the followin g activ ities: (1) Tutoring, supplem ental instruction, and other educationa l services that help hom eless children and youth reach the sam e challenging State content and State stu dent perform ance standa rds to whic h all ch ildren are he ld. As clearly specified in the E SEA, as r eauthorized by the NCLB Act, all academ ic enrichm ent program s for disadvan taged students, including program s for hom eless students, m ust be aligned with State standards and curricula. A ddition ally, when offe ring supplem ental instruction, LEAs should focus on providing services fo r children and youth that reflect 24scientifically based research as th e foundation for program s and strategies to ensure academ ic success. (2) Expedited evaluations of eligible students to m easure their strengths and needs. These evaluations should be done prom ptly in order to avoid a gap in the p rovision of neces sary services to those ch ildren and y outh. Evaluations m ay also determ ine a hom eless child or youth' s eligibility for other program s and services, includi ng educational program s for gifted and talented students, special educatio n and related services for children with disabilities, English language acquisition, vocational education, school lunch, and appropriate program s or services under ES EA. (3) Programs and other activ ities designed to raise awareness among educators and pupil services personnel of the rights of homeless children and youth under the McKinney-Vento Act, and the special needs such children and youth have as a result of their hom elessness. (4) Referrals of eligible students to me dical, dental, m ental, and other health services. (5) Paying the excess co st of transpo rtation not otherwise provided through Federal, S tate, or local funds, to enab le students to atte nd schools selected under section 722(g )(3) of the McKinney-Vento Act. (6) Developm entally appropriate ea rly childhood education program s for homeless children of preschool age that are not provided through other Federal, S tate, or local funds. (7) Serv ices and assis tance to attract , engage, and retain hom eless children and youth, and unaccompanied youth, in public school prog rams and services provided to non-hom eless children and youth. (8) Before- and after-school program s, mentoring, and summ er program s for homeless children and youth. Qualif ied personnel m ay provide hom ework assistance, tutoring, and supervision of other educational instruction in carry ing out these a ctivities. (9) Paying f ees and cos ts associated w ith tracking, obtaining, and transferring records necessary for the enrollm ent of students in school. T he records may include birth certificates, guar dianship records, immunization records, academ ic records, and ev aluations of students needed to determ ine eligibility for other program s and services. (10) Education and training program s for parents of hom eless children and youth regarding the rights th eir children have as hom eless individuals and regarding the educational and other resources availa ble to their children. (11) Program s coordinating services pr ovided by schools and other agencies to eligible students in order to ex pand and enhance such services. 25Coordination with program s funde d under the R unaway and Hom eless Youth Act should be included in this effort. (12) Pupil services program s providi ng violence prevention counseling and referrals to such counseling. (13) Program s addressing the particular needs o f eligible stu dents th at may arise from dom estic vio lence. (14) Providing supplies to non-school faci lities serving elig ible students and adapting these facilities to enab le them to provide services. (15) Providing school supplies to eligib le students at shelters, tem porary housing facilities, and other locations as appropriate. (16) Providing extraordinary or em ergenc y serv ices to e ligible students as necessary to enroll and retain such children and youth in school. L-2. Where may an LEA provide services for homeless children and youth? To the m aximum extent practicab le, an LEA must provide McKinney-Vento services through program s that integrate hom eless and non-hom eless children and youth. The services m ust be designed to expand or improve services provided as part of a school's regular academic program , but m ay not replace services provided under the regular program . LEAs m ay provide subgrant services thr ough program s on school grounds or at other facilities. If services are provided on school grou nds, the schools m ay use McKinney-Vento funds to provide the sam e services to other children and youth who are determ ined by the L EA to be at risk of failing in, or dropp ing out of, school. As discussed in Part E of this guidance, LEAs and schools may not provide services in settings w ithin a school that segreg ate hom eless children and youth from other children and youth, except as necessary for s hort periods of tim e for health and safety emergencies, or to provide tem porary, speci al, and additional services to m eet the unique needs of hom eless children and youth. L-3. May a district or school provide an after-school program that exclusively serves homeless children w ith McKinney-Vento funds? Yes. Hom eless children are en titled to part icipate in the regular after-school program provided by the school, and schools must addres s all barriers to their full participation in these program s. If no after-school program s are provided by the school or the program s provided do not m eet the needs of hom eless children, McKinney-Vento funds m ay be used for after-school se rvices for hom eless children, and for non- homeless children who are at risk of failing in, or dropping out of, school. 26M. Coordination with Titl e I, Pa rt A of the ESEA M-1. Are homeles s children and youth eligib le to receive T itle I, Part A services? Yes. Hom eless children and youth are auto matically eligible fo r services under Title I, Part A of the ESEA, whether or not they live in a T itle I school attendance area o r meet the acad emic standards require d of other children for eligib ility. Hom eless children and youth m ay receive T itle I educational or s upport services fro m schoolwide and targeted-assi stance school program s. A State m ust include in its State Title I plan a description of how the plan is coordinated with the McKinney-Vento Act. ( See Section 1111(a)(1) of the ESEA.) Additionally , an LEA receiving Title I, Part A funds m ust include in its lo cal plan a description of how the plan is coordinated with the McKi nney-Vento Act. The local plan m ust describe services provided to hom eless children. M-2. If a h omeless child becomes perman ently housed during a school year, is that child e ligible to rec eive Tit le I, Part A serv ices fo r the remainder of that school year? Yes. In general, a hom eless child or youth that becom es perm anently housed during a school year continues to rem ain eligible for Title I, Part A services for the remainder of that school year. This helps ensure educational stability for for merly homeless children. For exam ple, it m ay be appropriate in certain circumstances for an LEA to use Title I, Part A funds to transport formerly homeless students to or from their school of origin for the rem ainder of the school year in which they becom e perm anently housed. (However, the Title I supplanting prohibition prohibits an LEA from using Title I, Part A funds to trans port hom eless s tuden ts to or from their school of origin. ( See Question H-3.) M-3. Are homeless children and youth who attend non-Title I schools eligible to receiv e Title I, Part A s ervices? Yes. An LEA m ust provide com parable se rvices to a hom eless student who does not attend a Title I school. An LEA must reserve funds for homeless children who do not attend participating Title I schools and m ay, for instance, provide support services to children in shelters and other locations wh ere homeless children liv e. Services should be provided to assist hom eless students to effectively tak e advantage of education al opportunities. This provision applies to hom eless students in public and private schools, institutions for neglected children and, where appropria te, local institutions such as local community day school program s. See Section 1113 of the ESEA. SEA and LEA Title I p lans must be coordi nated with the p lans agencies develop under the McKinney-Vento Act. LEAs can develop form ulas for reserving the appropriate am ount of Title I funding for homeless students, as required in Section 271113(c)(3 ). However, because of the T itle I supplanting p rohibition, T itle I funds may not be used to support the costs of transporting hom eless students to or from their school of origin. ( See H-3 and M-2.) M-4. What types of services may an LEA provide to homeless students w ith funds reserved under Section 1113(c)(3) of Title I? An LEA ma y use funds reserved under this section to provi de services to eligible homeless students in both Title I and non- Title I schools that are com parable to services provided to non-hom eless student s in T itle I schools. Services provided should assist such children in m eeting the State' s challenging academ ic content and academ ic achievem ent standards. An LEA has the discretion to use reserved funds to provide a hom eless student with servic es that are not o rdinarily provided to othe r Title I stud ents and th at are not available from other sources. For exam ple, where appropriate, an LEA at its discretion m ay provide a student with an ite m of clothing to m eet a school's dress or uniform requirem ent so that student m ay effectively tak e advantage of ed ucation al opportunities. Reservation of Funds for Homeless Students Many school districts with subgrants pool Title I and McKinney-Vento funds to support extended-day and summer activities, or to provide school supplies, tutoring and other resources. Several S tates provide f ormulas that requir e all LEAs to use Title I se t- asides based on shelter counts (nigh tly average m ultiplied by a district's per-pupil allocation). LEAs m ay adjust the am ounts based on local data and needs assessm ents. Several LE As use local counts (one-m onth averages and one-day counts) of h omeless stu dents m ultiplied by Title I per-pup il allocation to com pute set-aside am ounts. Symposium on Homeless Education and Title I - Hosted by U.S. Department of Education and the National Center for Homeless Education ( NCHE) 2001 M-5. Does a State's academic assessmen t system need to include homeles s students? Yes. The final regu lations that im plem ented changes to th e standards and assessm ent requir ements of Title I, Part A require St ates to include homeless s tuden ts in the ir academ ic assessm ent, reporting, and accountab ility system s, consistent w ith section 1111(b)(3)(C)(xi) of the ESEA. Ass essments of hom eless students ar e to be included 28in school district or in State accountabili ty system s when students have been in a school for a full academ ic year. However, St ates are not required to d isaggregate, as a separate category, the assessm ent re sults of homeless students. As hom eless children and youth fall at the low end of the poverty continuum , LEAs and States should include the assessm applicable catego ries (e.g., The \"all student category.)\". Strategies to Facilitate Coordination and Collabo ration Betw een Title I and the McKinney-Vento Act Ensure tha t LEA local liaisons a ttend Title I con ferences and in-se rvices, and that Title I coordinators attend hom eless education conferen ces and in-service professional developm ent. Ensure colla boration between local Title I coord inators and LEA local liaisons on a plan th at iden tifies ways that Title I will serve child ren and youth experiencing hom elessness. Ensure collaboration between the Stat e Title I co ordinator an d the State McKinney-Vento coordinator on the St ate Title I plan or the State consolidated plan. Share Title I and Hom eless Education handbooks with other program staff. Collect and share with in and across dist ricts concrete data on the needs of children and youth in hom eless situations. Initiate district efforts to m ake or ganizational accomm odations f or elig ible students, as necessary, in such areas as transportati on, rem aining in the school of origin, records transfer, class schedu ling, and special services that will help them enroll, attend, and succeed in school. Ensure that the needs of highly m obile students are included in the school improve ment plans and not addressed as a separate issue. Establish and widely dissem inate in form ation on district-wide policies, procedures, and to iden tify and serve elig ible s tudents. Ensure LEA eless liaison repres entation on the State Co mmittee of Practition ers. Include hom eless parents in Title I pa rental involvem ent policies and create opportunities for hom eless parents to be involved.

See Question A-3 of the Guidance. Unaccompanied Youth. The term unaccompanied youth includes a youth not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian. Th is would include youth living in runaway shelters, abandoned buildings, cars, on the stre ets, or in other inadequate housing and children and youth denied housing by their fam ilies (som etimes referred to as \"throwaway\" children and youth) , and school-age unwed moth ers, living in hom es for unwed m others, who have no other housing available. If a child or youth's living situation does not clearly fall into the situations described above, the L EA should refer to the McKinney- Vento definition of \"fixed, regular and adequate n ighttime resid ence\" and c onsider the Determ inations homele ssness should be m ade on a case-by-case basis. Note that incarcerat ed children and youth and childre n and youth in foster care are not considered hom eless.. In addition, th e com munity and schools should work together to reach hom eless fa milies and unaccompanied youth and ensure they are aware of their educational rights. Deve loping local policies and procedures and reach ing out to the com munity and educat ional staff who require information on homeless students, and the legal requirem ents, and supportive practices in serving homeless students, is cr itical to fulfill the inten t of the McKinney-Vento Act successfully . School of Origin . The school of origin is the school that the child or youth attended when perm anently housed or the school in which the child or youth was last enrolled. 31APPE NDIX B: RE LATED EDUCATION LAWS The McKinney-Vento Act states th at hom eless child ren and youth m ust have access to the sam e educational services provided to other students. In addition, other laws make reference to serving hom eless students. For exam ple: Head Start has added hom eless preschoolers as a targeted population to be served. Background on hom elessness and its im pact on young children, as well as implementation guidance, can be found in a 1992 Inform ation Mem orandum from the Head Start Bureau (U.S. Department of Health and Hum an Services, Log Num ber: ACF-IM-92-12: http://www.nl chp.org/FA_Education/us_hhs_m emo.pdf). Just as the McKinney-Vento law requires public schools to identify and rem ove barriers that m ay delay enrollm ent, the same requirem ent applies to preschool program s, such as Head Start. The Individuals with Disabilities Edu cation Ac t (IDEA) requ ires that ho meless preschoolers and all hom eless children be in cluded in the \"Child Find\" process for early identification of speci al education needs. It is recomm ended that, w hen possible, the eligibility p rocess f or identifying special needs be expedited to avoid delays in ser vices prov ided to eligib le child ren ca used by f requent m obility. Title I targets students most at risk of failing in school. A child who is hom eless and attendin g any school in the d istrict is eligible for Title I s ervices. Th ese schools include schoolw ide programs, target ed assistance schools, and non-Title I schools. LE As m ust res erve (s et aside) a portion of Title I fu nds needed to provide services to eligible students in non-Title I schools that are com parable to those being received by other Title I students. In additi on, in order to receive its allocation of Title I funds, the LEA must de scrib e how the district will co ordinate with the McKinney-Vento Hom eless Assistan ce Act when f iling its p lan with the SEA. See Section 1111(a)(1); Section 1112(a )(1); Section 11 12(b)(1)(E)(ii); Section 1112(b)(1)(O); S 1113(c)(3)(a ); and Section 1115(b)(2)(E). Free and red uced priced m eals - The a pplication process for free and reduced priced m eals can be expedited for students experiencing homelessness. S chools that have determ ined a student is hom eless and is elig ible f or subsidiz ed m may make this determ ination withou t com pleting the f ull app lication proc ess. Local liaisons have been identified by the U.S. Departm ent of Agriculture to assist in this effort: fns.usda .gov/cnd/Governance/Mem os/2002-04-04.pdf. Additiona lly, the Child N utrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 was signed into law (Public Law 108-265) on June 30, 2004. The Act changes the eligibility of hom eless c hildren from an adm inistrative procedure to law. 32APPE NDIX C: DRAFT ST ANDARDS AND INDICATORS OF QUALITY* Draft Standards and Indicators of Quality For the Evaluation of L ocal Education Programs For Home less Children and Youth (McKinney-Vento Programs) *The following information is not a part of the U.S. Department of Ed ucation's Governmen t Performa nce Results Act (G PRA) requirements. It is neither required nor endorsed by the Department. It is offered as part of the technical assistance and support provided to Stat es and LEAs by the National Center for Homeless E ducation (NCHE) at SERVE Program evaluation is a critical el ement of program i mprovem ent. Although many good program s exist, what is lacking is an em phasis on using data to see if we are m aking a difference. It is vital to c onstruct tools to ensure that we m ake continuous progress in servi ng hom eless children and youth. An appropriate evaluation plan com pares the pro gram of interest to a se t of standard s and indicators characteristic of high quality program s for hom eless children and youth. Standards express general charact eristics of high quality program s while indicators are subunits of the standards and describe m ore specific aspects of the program s. During the summ er 2001, NCHE convened a work group of State coordinators, local coordinators, represen tatives of national organizations, program evaluation specialists, and U.S. Departm ent of Education staff. The group developed the following quality outcom e standards and indicators for McKinney-Vento program s. SERVE Eval uation Program staff led the group through a process to develop indicators based on discussions of effective programs and practices that result in increased schoo l enrollm ent, attendance, and achievem ent of homeless children and youth. Reflecting the McKinney-Vento statute, th e following five standards and their associated indicators were dr afted to facilitate local program pers onnel to evaluate their progr ams with the results leadi ng to effective program matic decisions. Standard 1. Within one full day o f an attemp t to enroll in a school, homeless children an d youth will be in attendance. Rationale: H omeless children and youth are of ten denied en rollment or are enrolled but not allowed to attend school until certai n requirem ents are m et. Research shows that gap s in attend ance are linked to poor academ ic perfor mance; ch ildren cannot learn if they are not in school. McKinney-Vento: The school selected in accordance with this paragraph shall immediately enroll the hom eless child or youth, even if the child or youth is unable to produce records norm ally required for enrollm ent, such as p revious acad emic record s, proof of residency, or other docum entation. (See Sec. 722(g)(3)(C)(i) of the McKinney-Vento Act). 33 Standard 2. Home less p re-k to 12 c hildren and youth will h ave stab ility in school. 2.1. Attendance rates w ill be at or abov e the releva nt district a verage. 2.2. Students w ill remain in the sch ool of origin for the period of homelessness or, if permanently h oused, for the remaind er of the school year, unless parents or unaccompanied youth requested transfer to another sch ool. Rationale: S chool stability and continuity in school enrollm ent ar e associated with school success including achievem ent, prom otion, and graduation. Research studies have indicated that a child m ay lose 4-6 m onths of academ ic progress with each m ove to a new school. The importance of a child attending one school and of attending consistently (in one school or in several sc hools without gaps duri ng a transition if the child m ust change schools ) cannot be underestimated. McKinney-Vento: The local education agen cy serving each child or youth to be assis ted und er this subtitle sha ll, ac cording to the child's or youth's best interest continue the child's or youth's education in the school of origin for the duration of homelessnes s in any cas e in which a f amily becom es hom eless between academ ic or during an academ ic year; or for the rem ainder of the acad emic year, if the child o r youth becom es per manently housed during an academ ic year. (See Sec. 72 2(g)(3 )(A)(i)(I) and (II) of the McKinney-Vento Act). Standard 3. Home less c hildren and youth will r eceiv e spec ialized s ervices when eligible. 3.1. Eligible homeless preschool children can participate in public preschool (Head Start, Even Start, State pre-K, preschoo l programs f or children w ith disabilities under t he Individuals w ith Disabilities Education Act, me als, programs for children w ith limited Eng lish prof iciency, and Title I pre-sch ool programs). 3.2. Eligible homeless children and youth can receive special education and related servic es under the Individuals w ith Disabilit ies Education Act, educational and related aids and services under Section 504 of the Rehabilita tion A ct of 1973, a nd educational programs for students w ith limited English proficiency. 3.3. Homeless children and youth w ill receiv e appropriate s ervices, based on assessment of individual needs, through a combination of resources, including, but not limite d to Title I , McKinney -Vento, and other federally funded programs. Rationale: C onsisten t with the in tent of the No Child Left Behind Act , the provision of services to the neediest of students is essential to closing the academ ic achievem ent gap between students m ost at risk of failure and those least at risk. Hom eless students 34frequently move from school to school befo re eligibility for specialized program s can be determ ined or before they can rise high enoug h on waiting lists to be adm itted to program s. Program s must find ways to accomm odate th eir eligibility po licies and procedures to address the need s of highly m obile students. McKinney-Vento: Each hom eless child or you th to be assisted under this subtitle shall b e provided serv ices com parable to services offered to other students in the school selected, including the following: tran sportation services; educational services for which the child o r youth m eets the elig ibility criteria, such as services provided under Title I of the ESEA or sim ilar Stat e or local program s, educational program s for childr en with disab ilities, and edu cational programs for students with lim ited English prof iciency; program s in vocationa l and technical education; program s for gifted and talented students; school nutr ition program s. (See S ec. 722(g)(4) of the McKinney-Vento Act). Standard 4. Parents or persons acting as parents of homeless children and youth w ill partic ipate meaningfully in their c hildren's ed ucation. 4.1. Parents or persons acting as parents w ill have a face-to-fa ce conference w ith the teacher, guid ance counselor, or socia l worker within 30 days of enrollment. 4.2. Parents or persons acting as paren ts will be provided w ith individual student rep orts informing them of their ch ild's specific academic needs and achievement on academic assessmen ts aligned w ith sta te academic a chievement standards. 4.3. Parents or persons acting as parents w ill repo rt monitoring or facilitating homew ork assignments. 4.4. Parents or persons acting as parents will share reading time w ith their children (i.e., parent reads to ch ild or lis tens t o child read ). 4.5. Parents w ho would like pare nt skills training w ill attend available programs. 4.6. Parents or guardians w ill demons trate aw areness of McKinney-Vento rights. 4.7. Unaccompanied youth w ill demonstrate aw areness of McKinney- Vento rights. Rationale: R esearch sho ws that one of th e most critical ind icators of acad emic success is th e involvem ent ch ts often ace many challeng es to th eir participa tion in their children's education. Sc hool districts need to take extra steps to help parents in hom eless fa milies becom e involved in the edu cation of their ch ildren. 35McKinney-Vento: Each local educational agency liaison for h omeless children and youth ... shall ensure that the parents or guardians of hom eless children and youth are inform ed of the educational and related opportunities availa ble to their children and are provided with m eaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children. (See Sec. 722(g)(6)(A)(i v) of the McKinney-Vento Act). Title I, Part A regarding Standard 4.2 : A state ass essment system shall produce individual student interpreti ve, descriptive, and diagnosti c reports, consistent with clause (iii) that allows p arents, teach ers, and principals to under stand and address the specific academ ic needs of students, and includ e inform ation regard ing achievem ent on assessm ents aligned with State acad emic achievem ent standards, and that are provided to parents, teachers, and principals, as soon as is practicably possible after the as sessment is given, in an understandable and uniform for mat, and to the extent practicable, in a la nguage that parents can understand. (See Sec. 11 11(b)(3 )(C)( xii) of the E SEA). Standard 5. Home less c hildren and youth in grades 3-12 will mee t their state s' academic standards. 5.1. Performance on standards-based assessments in reading and math will be w ithin or above the profic ient range or w ill show a one-for- one gain. 5.2. Rates of promotion to the next grade level w ill be at or above the district average. 5.3. Rates of hig h school graduation or equivalent w ill be at or above the district average. Rationale: C onsisten t with the No Child Left Beh ind Act , homeless child ren and youth must be given the opportunity to achieve to the sam e high standards as all other children. Each of the preceding standard s helps to provide the support a hom eless child o r youth needs to succeed acad emically. McKinney-Vento: Homeless ch ildren and yout hs should have access to th e education and other services that such children and yout hs need to ensure that such children and youths have an opportunity to m eet the same challenging Stat e student academ ic achievem ent standards to which all stude nts are held. (See Sec. 721(4) of the McKinney-Vento Act). 36Appendix D: Sample Student Residency Questionnaire* Everyday Unified School District *[This for m was not developed nor is it endorsed by the U.S. Departm ent of Education.
