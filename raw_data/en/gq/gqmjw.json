Moxibustion Moxibustion, or moxa for short, is a technique mostly used to warm and tonify acupuncture points. Although it can be used in a few different ways, every style of moxa involves using the herb Mugwort in some form. If it's needed, Summer Nemri, LAc, EAMP, almost always combines moxa with acupuncture. The most common form of moxa that Summer uses is stick moxa. A dark black cigar-looking stick is lit by fire to the tip until it burns red. After it is sufficiently heated up, Summer holds the stick and hovers it over the points while they have needles in them. Summer does a pecking motion but never touches the stick to a patient's skin. \"I want patients to feel the heat from the moxa, but it should never feel like it's burning,\" she explains. Every person's skin varies in sensitivity to heat, so Summer always asks for patients to share if it feels too hot. Moxa is very commonly used to turn breach babies with great efficacy! And on occasion, Summer sends patients home to do moxa on themselves too. Essential Oil Therapy Applying organic, therapeutic-grade essential oils has become a customary part of Summer's practice, and she incorporates it into most acupuncture and massage treatments. Unless patients specify sensitivity to essential oils or aroma, they will likely be experiencing the lovely aromas and relaxing effect of different oils on their bodies and on specific points throughout the treatment. Summer uses high-quality oils selected specifically to assist in every treatment where she sees fit. Essential oils are medicine. They absorb directly into the bloodstream via the skin, and they act very quickly. Generally, Summer mixes the oils with a carrier oil, such as shea butter or cocoa butter, because some patients' skin types can be sensitive to strong oil. Many essential oils are anti-viral and anti-bacterial. In nature, the oils of the plant serve to protect it against mites and viruses. They can act similarly when applied topically. The process of essential oil extraction is intensive\u2014it can take a lot of plant material to make a few drops of oil, so these medicines are very pure and precious. The benefits are multifold, and Summer uses each single or blended formula with intention for each patient's specific condition(s). Certain components in essential oils, such as linalool and terpenes, have been shown to significantly decrease stress and calm the nervous system. When we are able to be in a more calm and receptive place, healing happens much faster with longer lasting results. Hemp Extract Summer is a BIG FAN of Hemp extract as a way to bring ultimate balance and address full body imbalance. For the past 3 years she's been on a deep dive into WHY hemp is so important for us to be supplementing with, and believes it MUST be taken by all humans as a dietary supplement to deal with daily stressors, food and environmental toxicity we face. CBD (CannaBidiol) has made a huge boom in the mainstream recently since hemp was legalized. This is great news! Why? Because if you haven't heard of it yet, ALL living beings insect and above have what's called and EndoCannabinoid System (ECS). Endo-meaning internal. We make our OWN EndoCannabinoids! This recent discovery is being called the most important medical discovery of our time. Why? Because we are finding that the ECS has receptors all over our bodies, including high concentrations in our brains and in women, the highest concentration of receptors in our uterus'. I find it fascinating that hemp just so happens to match our own internal ECS receptor system. Why can't we rely on our own system to make Endocannabinoids? Well, it's a thing called stress and imbalance. Hemp was taken away from us decades ago, and made to look like the devil. Personally, I question why A PLANT is so evil that it must be made illegal. Now we understand how VITAL it is for our well-being. Because most of us are going around in fight or flight mode, our nervous systems can only focus on survival. Our sympathetic nervous system is so engaged, that relaxation and deep healing is not made a priority. So our bodies aren't producing as many Cannabinoids. When we supplement, our bodies are finally able to relax and heal and balance out!! The ECS is at the ROOT of ALL imbalance in the body. Crazy right??!! The ECS modulates ALL systems in the body, from reproductive to endocrine to nervous to digestive. The jury is out, and the research on positive health benefits is APLENTY. So don't be surprised if I tell you it might be a good idea to supplement. Most of our patients have heard my soapbox speech so much that eventually they give in, and dang are they glad they did!!! Life Changing!! To boot, I only carry the most optimal and effective quality hemp extracts I can find. Not only is CBD involved (the rockstar cannabinoid we've heard of), but CBG (CannaBigerol) is now receiving big recognition for the way it is activating Brain health by neuroregeneration.
