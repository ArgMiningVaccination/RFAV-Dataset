Best Management Practices for Erosion Control The purpose of this guide is to provide New Hampshire landowners, and the professionals that work with them, practical recommendations on sustainable management practices for individual forest ownerships. Throughout New England, across the United States, and around the globe, the issue of how we sustain our forest resources is the subject of intense scientific inquiry and policy debate. This complex subject is best defined by the single question: How can we produce the goods we desire today from the forest, without compromising the productive capability and biological integrity of the forest upon which future generations of people and wildlife depend? Our society has long recognized trees as a renewable resource. Today, however, society increas- ingly understands the importance of sustaining forests - in all their complexity - but there exists little guidance for landowners as to what is, or is not, a sustainable practice. Forest sustainability involves all resources and amenities provided by the forest: timber, water and scenery; trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants; soil bacteria, fungi and nutrients; wildlife and insects. It requires trade-offs and compromises among competing uses and the balancing of indi- vidual and societal needs, rights and responsibilities. While this set of recommendations is new, commitment on the part of private landowners to a healthy forest is not. Landowners, both private and public, committed to stewardship have helped conserve and maintain a forest that covers over 80% of the state and provides benefits for all citi- zens. Public and private agencies have contributed to this forest resource by providing a wide array of technical assistance and expertise. This guide builds upon New Hampshire's long tradition of good forest management. It provides landowners, and the professionals that work with them, spe- cific recommendations to help meet ownership objectives while conserving all values that the for- est provides. Forest sustainability is affected by \"landscape\" issues such as: population growth, conversion of forest land to urban uses, tax policy, acid rain, and other large-scale environmental threats. In order for landowners to implement the recommendations contained in this guide, they need to be able to afford to own and responsibly manage forest land. The state's Current Use program, which taxes land at its traditional use, must be maintained. Tax policy at both the state and national level needs to recognize the long-term investment that forest landowners enter into, and make it less costly for landowners to pass on forest land to their heirs. Markets for all forest products, espe- cially low-grade wood, must be strengthened so that landowners can continue managing the forest in a responsible manner. While these issues cannot be ignored, this guide deals only with \"opera- tional\" issues such as the prevention of soil erosion and protection of important habitats during timber harvesting. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 3 Background This guide was produced by 24 natural resource professionals (the Forest Sustainability Standards Work Team, or FSSWT), and hundreds of others who provided invaluable input through written comments or at public meet- ings. This effort came about because of a widely recognized need to develop a comprehensive guide to sustainable forest management in New Hampshire. This work reinforces previous recommendations of the Forest Law Recodification and Revision Roundtable (1993 - 1995), which recommend- ed that the Division of Forests & Lands coordinate an effort to produce a set of \"recommended voluntary forest management practices\"; and the Northern Forest Lands Council (1990 - 1994), which recommended that each state create a process to define credible benchmarks of sustainability. The Forest Sustainability Standards Work Team continues to work on the difficult process of defining state-wide benchmarks of forest sustainabil- ity and setting landscape-level goals. Two important principles guided the PSSWT in its development of this guide: These recommendations are intended for voluntary use and not as compulsory regulations. With the exception of a few recom- mendations that mirror state law, they represent options for landowners to consider in the management of their forests. These recommendations are based on the best available science, and the consensus professional judgment of the FSSWT. In certain areas, there remains both differences of opinion and scientific uncertainty. Knowledge of sustainable forest management is evolving. For this rea- son, the guide is structured to allow the user to easily remove sections to use in the field and replace as new information becomes available. This for- mat also allows landowners to select sections that are most relevant to their ownership. Future updates will be coordinated by the New Hampshire Division of Forests & Lands.

Page 6 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAIN ABILITY The following principles are adapted from the Northern Forest Lands Council Principles of Sustainability and the Society of American Foresters Task Force Report on Sustaining Long-Term Forest Health and Productivity. The headings are used for organizational purposes only, both sets of principles are interrelated and equally important. Maintain the structural, functional, and compositional integrity of the forest as an ecosystem, through: Maintenance of soil productivity Conservation of water quality, wetlands, and riparian zones Maintenance or creation of a healthy balance of forest size classes Conservation and enhancement of habitats that support a full range of native flora and fauna Protection of unique or fragile natural areas Meet the diverse needs of the human community, through: Continuous flow of timber, pulpwood, and other forest products Improvement of the overall quality of the timber resource as a foundation for more value added opportunities Addressing aesthetic impacts of forest harvesting Continuation of opportunities for traditional recreation Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 7 ABOUT THE MANUAL Within each of the tabbed sections are chapters which correspond to specific aspects of forest management that are relevant to the principle(s) highlighted within that section. Each chapter contains an issue statement, objective, con- siderations, recommended practices, cross references to other chapters, and literature citations. At the beginning of each tabbed section, the reader will find a brief list of general information sources and references for further read- ing. /EUE Each chapter begins with an issue description that provides background infor- mation on the topic of the chapter. Each description explains why a certain activity or natural feature is an item of concern, and why the topic is important to forest sustainability. OBJECTIVE The objective describes the desired outcome of sustainable forest management activities. CONSIDERATIONS Considerations are factors that can affect implementation of recommended prac- tices. Considerations may describe legal issues that influence how practices are applied, or highlight areas where scientists have not come to complete agree- ment on an issue. RECOMMENDED These are on-the-ground steps that landowners, and the professionals that work PRACTICES with them, can take during forest management activities to achieve the princi- ples of sustainability. These recommended practices are designed to meet the objective while factoring in the considerations. When site conditions make it difficult or impractical to implement the practices, managers should make sure the actions they take are consistent with the objective. CROSS REFERENCE Many aspects of sustainability are interrelated. Cross references lead the reader to additional information relevant to the issue. LITERATURE A list of literature cited is given at the end of each section. These are the sources CITED from which information for the chapter is drawn and which provide the scien- tific justification for the actions that are recommended. GLOSSARY A glossary defining technical terms appears at the conclusion of the manual. APPENDICES Several appendices provide additional detailed information. Page 8 Good Forestry in .the Granite State Copyright 1997 The recommended practices in this manual address a variety of forest manage- ment goals and objectives. Many of the practices are interrelated, but not all practices can be applied on every acre. Application of specific practices depends on the site and the landowner's priorities for ownership, income and manage- ment. Successful application of these practices requires a combination of sensible goals, clear objectives, and careful preparation. Owning forest land can be a financial investment as well as a way to leave a legacy of forest stewardship for the future. The key to protecting your invest- ment and legacy is working with a team of professionals: foresters, loggers, other natural resource professionals; plus financial and legal advisors. GETTING STARTED New Hampshire has a well established network of public and private organiza- tions to help guide private forest landowners. The most sensible first step for landowners is to learn as much as possible about their forest and to establish appropriate goals for managing it. County based foresters employed by the UNH Cooperative Extension (see Appendix A) can get landowners started by providing objective educational forest management assistance. Private consulting foresters provide detailed planning, inventory, and timber sale assistance to private landowners for a fee. These foresters are licensed by the State of New Hampshire. Cooperative Extension Offices can provide a list of licensed foresters. Other natural resource professionals (wetland scientists, wildlife biologists) can help identify special habitats and design management options to protect these resources. The public and private agencies and organizations listed in Appendix A provide printed materials and educational courses on a wide variety of forest management and related issues. PLANNING An important component of planning is setting clear short- and long-term goals PAYS and objectives. These must be realistic and based on the forest's current condi- DIVIDENDS tion and its potential capability. Goals and objectives can include: Goals and protection of water resources ObieCfiv@ protection and/or enhancement of wildlife habitat protection of native plants and animals periodic income timber production recreational development maintenance or enhancement of scenery and aesthetics Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 9 Information and Good management requires an understanding of what resources are on inventory your property. Knowing as much as possible about the property and its history can save time and money in developing and implementing a management plan. It is also important to consider a piece of land in relation to its surroundings (see page 13). Start with a property map. Work with a professional to develop a forest type map of the property (see forest type descriptions on page 15). Identify and mark property boundaries. Also, inventory or map: soil types riparian corridors and wetlands wildlife habitat features unique or fragile areas timber volume and species forest roads and transportation systems scenic, recreational, and cultural features Management Plans A management plan outlines how and when to reach goals and objectives for a specific piece of property. Careful planning is much more likely to bring results that adhere to the recommendations in this publication. Planning may be as simple as setting goals and objectives and accumulating inventory information, or as detailed as a written forest management plan prepared by a licensed forester. The more care and preparation taken before timber harvesting begins, the better the results will be. TIMBER Timber harvests have more impact, positive or negative, on the current and ,~ARVESTING future condition of New Hampshire's forests than most other actions taken by landowners during their ownership. Experience and research here and in other states clearly demonstrates that professional forestry advice and supervision during timber harvests makes a difference. Carefully prepared and supervised timber harvests often return greater income and meet goals more satisfactorily. Professional foresters can plan roads and trails, identify wildlife features and protection mechanisms, plan for regeneration, and restore the site when the harvest is over. A written contract is an important tool to make sure the harvest goes as planned. The contract should clearly identify which parties have responsibility for the cost and implementation of any of the recom- mended practices in this guide. In addition, be cautious of the potential liability that can result from the unintentional development of employer- employee relationships. Licensed foresters are available to plan and supervise tiniber harvests. Their services typically involve designing the timber sale, marking trees to be cut, estimating harvest volumes in advance, contracting with logging professionals, supervising harvesting, and marketing wood products. Page 10 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Certified professional loggers are available to implement management plans. These individuals have participated in the four-course voluntary certification program offered by the New Hampshire Professional Loggers Program. Certified loggers are required to take courses in first aid, safe and productive felling, fun- damentals of forestry, and timber-harvesting law. Lists of licensed foresters and certified professional loggers, and information on logging contracts, can be obtained from county extension foresters (Appendix A). ADDITIONAL Planning for the long-term ownership of forest property is important to the STEPS: ESTATE overall sustainability of the forests of New Hampshire.

Contact your legal advisors and a local land trust to find out more about estate planning and land protection options. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 11 YOUR LAND AND THE LARGER LANDSCAPE Forest ownerships do not exist in isolation, but are part of the larger landscape. The goals of a forest landowner, and the opportunity to achieve those goals, may be significantly affected by the nature of the surrounding lands. (Consider, for example, the difference between two similar tracts, one adjacent to the White Mountain National Forest and the other surrounded by subdivisions on the outskirts of Manchester.) Conversely, a landowner's actions can affect values throughout the surrounding landscape. When setting management goals, land- owners should keep in mind not only the nature of their own tract but also the condition and management of surrounding ownerships. The possibilities and constraints imposed by the larger landscape are particularly significant for small ownerships. This \"landscape perspective\" is especially important when considering options for wildlife-habitat management. A wide range of forest types and age classes is necessary to meet the habitat needs of different species. Most wildlife species require different habitats during different parts of the year or during different stages of their life cycle. Many large landowners (such as the National Forest and some industrial owners) manage wildlife habitat in units of 5,000 - 10,000 acres. However, few non-industrial forest landowners own sufficient acreage to fully meet all the habitat needs of many species of wildlife. Owners should examine their land within the larger context to identify what habitats are important to the larger surrounding area, and to determine the habitat management opportunities that may be effective and reasonable to pursue within their ownership. The benefits of managing for wildlife on smaller tracts may only be realized if this management complements conditions and management on neighboring lands (DeGraaf et al. 1 992). Among the things landowners should consider when examining the land- scape on and around their property are: In what ways is my land similar to the surrounding landscape and in what ways is it different? What is the mix of land uses around my property (forest, residential, agriculture, recreation, developed)? Who owns the land around my property and how large are the parcels? What uncommon or important habitats (such as ponds, wetlands, meadows, fields, or other features described in this publication) are present on my land that may be used by species from the surrounding area? Are there important habitats (such as deer yards or riparian areas) that extend onto adjacent ownerships? Are there any uncommon or rare species or natural communities on my property? Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 13 LITERATURE CITED Landscape management can range from the simple (examining maps or photos to see what lies around your property) to the complex (multi-owner management cooperatives). One way to get a better understanding of the larger landscape is to talk to neighboring landowners. A joint woods tour (perhaps in the company of a county extension forester) can give all parties a sense of the array of conditions in the neighborhood, as well as promot- ing discussion of the goals of different owners and opportunities for coordi- nated management. Management that encompasses a larger landscape can have economic benefits as well, such as the design of more efficient transportation systems. The cost and impact of roads may be lessened if they are designed for a larg- er area rather than individual ownerships. Other benefits may be possible by coordinating management and operations. Planning costs (such as map- ping and inventory) may be reduced if spread across a larger land base. Receipts from timber sales may be increased if management costs are shared and timber products are combined for greater marketability. Fully realizing these benefits requires formal cooperation between neighboring landown- ers. Legal aspects need to be considered when setting up this type of arrangement. Such multi-owner cooperatives are not yet common in New Hampshire, but have been formed in the southeastern United States (Johnson et al. 1996). However, even without such formal arrangements, a sense of the \"big picture\" can greatly help landowners determine realistic management goals for their properties. DeGraaf, R.M., M. Yamasaki, W.B.

They are named for the predominant tree species occurring in the type. Common forest types in New Hampshire include White Pine, Northern Hardwood, Spruce-Fir, Red Oak, Hemlock, and Aspen-Birch. Climate, elevation, soil conditions and land use history all play a role in determining which forest type will grow on a particular area. Forest type, in turn, influences the variety of wildlife that will inhabit an area and the silvi- cultural options available to the landowner. A forest type may be dominated by a single tree species or it may be domi- nated by several species growing together. White Pine often occurs as a pure (single species) type. Northern Hardwood, which is composed of sugar maple, beech, yellow birch and smaller amounts of other species, is an example of a multiple species type. In some areas two types blend together to form a Mixed-wood type. Mixed- wood types often occur in transition zones between major types. Two common mixed types are the Pine-Oak and Spruce-Fir-Northern Hardwood combina- tions. Brief descriptions of the common forest types follow. Information on other less common forest types may be found in Chapter 4.1, Rare Plants and Natural Communities. White Pine This type is most common in southern New Hampshire. Wliite pine may occur in pure stands or be mixed with red pine, hemlock, red oak and/or other hardwoods. White pine often colonizes abandoned agricultural land. On fertile sites the type is gradually replaced by hardwood or hemlock through a process known as ecological succession. On less fertile sandy soils the type is more persistent. On sandy soils, acid-loving plants such as blueberries, starflowers, and pink lady's-slippers are common on the forest floor. Wildlife species associated with the type include the red squirrel, deer mouse, pine warbler, and red-breasted nuthatch. Owls often use the type for winter roost sites. Timber products derived from white pine include lumber for furniture, toys, millwork and crates, and pulpwood. Perhaps the most important sustainability issue facing this type is the conversion of forest land to urban uses. Because white pine occurs primarily in southern New Hampshire at the urban-rural interface, it is under intense devel- opment pressure. When forest land is converted to residential or commercial uses, its ability to produce timber products, wildlife habitat, and other amenities is usually lost forever. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 15 M~H~~~~ ,qadWd This type is most common in central and northern New Hampshire. It is usually composed of a mix of trees, including: sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch, red maple, and white ash. Sugar maple is typically the most abundant species on rich sites. Beech increases in abundance on drier sites and yellow birch becomes more prominent on moist sites. Northern hard- woods typically grow on the slopes of hills and mountains where the soils are fertile and well-drained. Northern hardwood tends to be a relatively stable and permanent type. Sugar maple and beech are shade-tolerant trees which can reproduce and grow in the shade of a forest canopy. Yellow birch and white ash are somewhat less tolerant of shade and require more sunlight to reproduce and grow. Common understory shrubs include striped maple, witch hazel, and hobblebush. Wildlife species associated with the type include the gray fox, flying squirrel, red-eyed vireo, white-breasted nuthatch, and ovenbird. Products derived from the this type include lumber and veneer for furni- ture, paneling and doors, pulpwood, firewood, and maple syrup. An important sustainability issue is the extent to which high-grading has occurred within the type. High-grading is a type of logging in which the best trees are cut and poor quality trees are left to grow. Over time, a forest that is repeatedly high-graded will become dominated by low quality, low value trees. Sprvce-rit This type is most common in northern New Hampshire. Red spruce and balsam fir are the dominant species. The type grows on poorly drained flats and the shallow, rocky soils of mountain tops. Because the spruce-fir type grows on wet or shallow soils, the trees are susceptible to windthrow. Additional disturbances in spruce-fir include the spruce budworm, a native insect which can impact vast areas during its periodic outbreaks, and heart rot fungi which affect overmature balsam fir. Bunchberry, goldthread, and trilliums are common wildflowers in this type. Wildlife species associated with the type include .the pine marten, snow- shoe hare, spruce grouse, gray jay, black-backed woodpecker, and mby- crowned kinglet. Timber products include framing lumber and wood pulp for newsprint and high-quality printing and writing papers. An important sustainability issue concerns the forest-age class structure within the spruce-fir type. Due to the cyclical nature of spruce budworm outbreaks and historic cutting patterns, the type tends to grow in a boom- bust cycle. The budworm epidemic of the 1970s and the heavy salvage cutting that followed have resulted in a relative shortage of mature and middle-aged stands. This boom and bust cycle has important implications for both regional timber supply and wildlife habitat management. Page 16 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 R,& Oak The red oak type occurs in close association with white pine in southern New Hampshire. Stands of nearly pure red oak are common on ridge tops. On aban- doned agricultural land red oak often mixes with white pine to form the Pine-Oak type. Red maple and black birch are common associates. Maple-leaved viburnum, bracken fern, and whorled loosestrife are common understory species. Red oak is a valuable tree for both timber and wildlife. Red oak lumber and veneer are used to manufacture high-quality furniture. Acorns provide a valuable food source for deer, turkey, gray squirrel, and many other species of wildlife. Blue jays, tufted tit- mice, scarlet tanagers, and mfous-sided towhees are some of the birds that commonly nest in red oak and pine-oak stands. As with white pine, land use conversion may be the most important sustain- ability issue facing this type. /-/emlock Hemlock occurs on wet flats, rocky ridge tops, and moist slopes in southern and central New Hampshire. In many respects, its ecological characteristics are similar to the spruce-fir type of the north. Under dense hemlock stands spotted wintergreen and downy rattle-snake plan- tain sometimes occur. Hobblebush and maple-leafed viburnum may grow under small openings in the canopy. Red breasted nuthatches, solitary vireos, black- throated green warblers, and hermit thrushes are typical breeding birds. Deer often use hemlock stands for winter cover. Timber products include pulpwood, construction lumber, and bark for land- scaping mulch. The hemlock woolly adelgid, a recently introduced insect, poses a serious threat to the hemlock type. While this insect has not yet reached New Hampshire, it is of grave concern to natural resource managers. Insects and diseases brought into our region from other parts of the world can be particularly devastating to native plants and ani- mals. To help prevent the spread of the hemlock adelgid, there are restrictions on the importation of hemlock logs from infested areas such as southern New England. Agpen-B;& Aspen-birch is a pioneer type which is relatively uncommon in New Hampshire. The type is composed primarily of quaking and bigtooth aspen and white birch. It occurs on a wide variety of soils. Aspen and white birch require full sunlight to grow, and rely on disturbances such as fire, windstorms, or clearcutting to create the conditions necessary for their reproduction. Common associates in young aspen-birch stands are raspberries and blackber- ries. Aspen-birch provides valuable habitat for several species of wildlife including ruffed grouse, woodcock, Nashville warbler, mourning warbler, and beaver. Timber products include veneer used in the interior of doors, dowels, tooth- picks, chip board, and pulpwood. An important sustainability issue is that this type is becoming less common as abandoned agricultural land and large-scale burned areas develop into mature for- est communities.

McEvoy University of Vermont School of Natural Resources and Extension System 1995 Best Management Practices for Erosion Control on Timber Harvesting Operations in New Hampshire New Hampshire Department of Resources & Economic Development 1996 (Provided in Appendix C) Section One/Chapter One: Erosion and Soil Damage 1.1 EROSION AND SOIL DAMAGE /SUE Erosion and soil damage may diminish soil productivity. Soil erosion may result from roads, skid trails and landings; and includes not only soil loss from these areas but also slumping and landslides adjacent to poorly designed roads on steeper slopes. Application of Best Management Practices for Erosion Control (Appendix C) can greatly reduce these impacts. Soil damage can occur from timber harvesting by disrupting topsoil, mixing soil layers, creating deep ruts, and compacting soil layers. Half the feeder roots in a forest are found in the top six inches of soil. Roots need both air and water to supply the rest of the tree. Activities that compact the soil, eliminating space for air and water, will lower the productivity of the site. Much of this damage comes from heavy equipment. Machinery used outside the permanent trans- portation system (roads, landings, and skid trails) may excessively disturb the soil and reduce site productivity (Turcotte et al. 1991, Mou et al. 1993). Repeated passes of heavy equipment over certain types of soil, especially dur- ing wet conditions, can compact soil air spaces, impeding root growth and allowing the entry of root diseases such as Armillaria root rot fungus (Turcotte et al. 1991, Martin 1988). To some extent, natural soil processes (such as freezelthaw cycles and activities of soil organisms) help restore compacted soils to near pre-harvest conditions. The rate of recovery is dependent upon soil type, soil depth, and degree of compaction (Reisinger et al. 1992). Of particular concern are soils that have low fertility; have a high silt, clay, or organic matter content; or are shallow to bedrock. These soils may either be more subject to excessive disturbance or have most of the fine roots very near the surface where they may be easily damaged. OgjECTIVE Maintain the long-term productivity of the forest by minimizing erosion and soil damage. COWSIDERAT/O~~S Roads, skid trails, and landings are a necessary part of timber management. Some localized soil erosion and short-term compaction is unavoidable. Leaving roads open for recreational use may make it more difficult to install permanent erosion-control measures. Exposure of mineral soil is sometimes important to promote regeneration of certain species (such as white pine). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 21 Section One/Chapter One: Erosion and Soil Damage RECOMMENDED J Apply Best Management Practices for Erosion Control in all harvesting PRACTICE operations (Appendix C). J Contact the local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) office for soil maps and advice on which soils in the harvest area may be susceptible to erosion or compaction (see Appendix A). J Work with professionals to design roads, skid trails, and landings for the entire ownership (or a logical portion of it) in advance of the harvest. Build only what you need and can maintain properly. J Minimize damage to areas that NRCS describes as susceptible to erosion or compaction by: harvesting during dry, snow-covered, or frozen ground conditions. restricting equipment use to perma- nently designated skid trails. using equipment that is suited to the site and the size of material being harvested. using low-impact equipment such as mechanical harvesters with long booms or low ground pressure skidders. spreading limbs and tops on skid trails to cushion the impact of harvesting equipment (see illustration). J Promote rapid revegetation of heavily impacted areas by grading already exposed areas and seeding with a recommended conservation mix (see Appendix C, Best Management Practices for Erosion Control).

Page 22 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section One/Chapter Two: Soil Nutrients 1.2 SOIL NUTRIENTS ITSUE Forest soil productivity can affect how fast trees grow and what kinds of trees grow. The characteristics of a forest soil are defined by varying combinations of four main ingredients - mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air. Soil productivity is influenced by levels of nutrients. Of the 20 elements that are required for plant growth, five are taken up from the soil in relatively large quantities - nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Levels of these and other soil nutrients are determined mostly by the type of minerals from which the soil is derived. For example, limestone-derived soils tend to be more fertile, while soils derived from granite tend to be less fertile. Because there are few practical, economically feasible means of increasing soil productivity (Beattie et al. 1993), maintaining existing soil nutrients is important. Acid deposition, including acid rain and other forms of air pollution, has caused leaching of certain soil nutrients, especially calcium (Likens 1996). These losses may equal or exceed losses from timber harvesting over the length of the rotation (Hombeck et al. 1990, Pierce et al. 1993). Because of the potential for this loss, it is important that forest managers avoid exacerbating the nutrient deple- tion problem during timber harvesting. Nutrient loss from timber harvesting is affected by what portion of a tree is taken, the harvest method, and the regularity with which a stand is treated. The more frequently a stand is harvested and the more fiber removed over a rota- tion, the greater the amount of nutrients taken. Whole-tree harvesting removes more nutrients than conventional bole-only harvests because the tops and limbs are a significant reservoir for many nutrients. In general, whole-tree harvests by the clearcut method on short rotations (e.g. 40 years) will have the greatest nutrient impacts on the soil. Leaching of nutrients from the soil contributes to nutrient loss. Exposing soil can result in small amounts of harvest-induced leaching. Soil type and the per- centage of the watershed that is harvested can influence the amount of leaching. Prompt re-vegetation of the site can minimize losses. The greatest concern arises when the more intense practices are routinely applied over time on sites already low in nutrients. Sites that are low in nutri- ents include: coarse-textured sands, soils shallow to ledge, and soils with high seasonal water tables. O~~/ECJIVE Maintain the long-term soil productivity of the forest by minimizing loss of soil nutrients. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 23 Section One/Chapter Two: Soil Nutrients CONSIDERA TIONS The impacts of changes in soil nutrients over time are not well-known in New Hampshire. For instance: - There is little firm evidence to indicate changes in forest growth or species composition from past changes in soil nutrients. However, this issue is the subject of considerable ongoing research. - It is also unclear what role weathering of rock plays in replacing nutrients. Spreading of sludge (bio-solids derived from municipal solid-waste treatment), and commercial land application of wood ash are becoming more common sources of soil nutrient additives. At this time, there are no best management practices developed for the application of sludge. However, application of sludge is governed by state and federal law and may be limited by local regulation. RECOMMElVDED J Identify low fertility soils from maps and descriptions available from PRACTICES the local Natural Resources Conservation Service office or the state geologist's office (see Appendix A). J Use bole-only harvesting (taking out the main portion of tree only, leaving branches and limbs in the woods) on low-fertility soils, or where fertility is unknown, as a precaution against nutrient loss. J If whole-tree harvesting hardwoods, try to plan harvests during leaf-off periods to retain leaves and nutrients on site. J Limit disruption of soil organic layers except when needed to accomplish silvicultural objectives (such as regeneration of species that need a bare mineral soil seedbed).

Wetlands and riparian areas (i.e., areas along the shores of streams and ponds) are among the most critical parts of any forest ecosystem (Hunter 1990). Forest management within these areas has the potential to affect more animal species than anywhere else in the landscape (DeGraaf et al. 1992). Wetlands and riparian areas have a long history of use and alteration by humans, including urbanization, road-building, agriculture, draining, dam-building, and timber harvesting. The combined pressures on these areas underscore the importance of properly managing those that are not yet heavily impacted and restoring those that are currently degraded. 4 39.2 The importance of wetlands and ripari- an areas is reflected in the fact that the State of New Hampshire regulates forest practices in these areas (for example, RSA 482-A, wetlands regulations and RSA 227-5, basal area and slash disposal laws.) Guidelines for conducting forest management operations around streams and wetlands (known as Best Management Practices for Erosion Control or BMPs) have been available since 1972 (Cullen 1 996, Appendix C). These laws and guidelines are designed primarily to - protect water quality a generally adequate for However, they were n protect the full range values associated with wetlands an riparian areas. Manag of these areas should ta comprehensive approach that gives a high priority to both protection of water quality and conservation of wildlife habitat. Cooperative Extension Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 27 Section Two/Chapter One: Wetlands and Riparian Areas Designing Riparian management zones are designated linear zones along the shores of lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands. They are intended to retain relatively contin- uous forest cover for the protection and maintenance of water quality, wildlife Management habitat, and scenic values. It is difficult to arrive at any universal width to define these zones. Each ripari- an area has a unique combination of features that determine the appropriate size. A riparian area as used by wildlife might vary considerably in width at different points along a river. Water-body size, location, slope, elevation, soil, vegetation, and the nature of the activity outside the riparian area all affect how a riparian management zone should be designed. The following general guidelines should be considered when designing riparian management zones: The larger the water body, the larger the management zone should be. The more intense the land use outside of the management zone, the larger it should be. The management zone should be large enough to encompass all vegeta- tive communities subject to flooding, ecologically or visually sensitive zones, and steep slopes or easily-erodible soils adjacent to the water body. The following recommended widths are provided as general guidelines and should provide adequate protection for most water quality, habitat protection, and scenic objectives. The minimum recommended width for protection of water quali- ty is 100 feet on both sides of a stream (Chase et al. 1995). Wider zones are designed primarily to address wildlife habitat or aesthetic concerns. Increasing the width of the no-harvest zone will provide greater protection to non-timber values within riparian areas. -Legally required1-- - ~ecornrnended~~ Management No-harvest Management No-harvest Feature (see iZZustra~on, rtght): Intermittent streams 1st and 2nd order streams 3rd order streams 4th order and larger streams Pond <lo acres Great pond (>lo acres) Non-forested wetland <lo acres none Non-forested wetland >10 acres none Width required under RSA 227-J:9 (basal area law).

These include: and Protection of water quality through prevention of bank erosion and filtering of sediment and pollutants from upslope areas. Riparian Flood control and regulation of stream flow through the dispersal, Areas absorption and slow release of floodwaters. Groundwater recharge. Protection and enhancement of aquatic habitat through shading of streams, creation of structure through input of fallen trees, and input of energy in the form of leaves, twigs, fruit and insects (This is especially important on headwater streams and sniall rivers). Wildlife travel corridors for both mammals and migratory birds, espe- cially along larger rivers. Unique and diverse habitats. Riparian areas and wetlands are utilized by over 90% of the region's wildlife species and provide the preferred habitat for over 40% of these species (DeGraaf et al. 1992). Species such as loon or ducks use primarily open water, but may be affected by management in riparian forests. Large trees in these areas are the primary nesting sites for bald eagles, osprey, and some aquatic birds. Deer-wintering areas are often associated with riparian softwood forests. Many of the state's rare plants are associ- ated with wetlands and streamside forests. Recreational and scenic opportunities, such as hiking, fishing, hunting, boating, bird-watching, and wildlife viewing. ldentif ying Wetlands and Riparian Areas There are many types of wetlands and many ways to define them ecologically based on vegetation, soils, or hydrology. They may be either forested (such as red maple swamps or cedar bogs) or non-forested (such as sedge meadows, alder thickets, or sphagnum bogs). They include small or ephemeral areas such as seeps and vernal pools (see 4.2 and 4.3). However, all are characterized by having saturated soil for at least part of the year, and all support vegeta- tion adapted to wet conditions. Best Management Practices for Erosion Control includes a guide to wetlaiid identification (Appendix C). Riparian areas are generally defined as areas that influence, or are iiiflu- enced by, aquatic ecosystems (such as lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and tidal areas). Riparian areas may be defined on the basis of characteristic vegetation, which can vary from a narrow band of shrubs along small rivers or lake shores to floodplain forests hundreds of yards wide along large rivers. They may also be defined by the function they serve, such as filtering ero- sion from upslope areas or providing shade to a stream. In these cases the size of the riparian area depends on what function is being considered, and may include upland forest as well as truly riparian communities. Page 30 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Two/Chapter One: Wetlands and Riparian Areas The width needed to provide shade to a stream may be one tree height or less, whereas riparian wildlife habitat may extend several hundred feet into upland forests adjacent to a large river or lake (Jones et al. 1988, Elliot 1988, 1994, Meiklejohn 1994, Chase et al. 1995, Spackman and Hughes in press). OBJECTIVE Maintain the following important functions of aquatic ecosystems, wet- lands and forested riparian areas: protection of water quality flood control groundwater recharge aquatic and terrestrial wildlife habitat recreational and scenic opportunities CONSIDERATIONS Wetland permits or other legal requirements often apply to forestry operations in these areas. The integrity of aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems may be affected by activities of other landowners throughout the watershed. Riparian forests may be highly productive; limiting harvesting will entail some economic loss to riparian landowners. Riparian zones may serve multiple habitat functions which can include the location of old-growth areas or extended rotation forest types. Identification of forested wetland boundaries may be difficult without specialized training. Identification and layout of larger riparian areas, or areas in complex landscapes with numerous streams and wetlands, may be difficult and time-consuming, but detailed boundary delineation may not be necessary for many management purposes. Riparian forests may be more prone to natural disturbance than upland areas, and natural events may override even the most careful management efforts. RECOMMENDED J Survey the immediate watershed in which the harvest will occur (ideally in PRACTICES early spring) and identify important hydrologic features such as streams, ponds, wetlands, seeps, and vernal pools. Consult a forester or other qualified professional for help with identification of wetlands, if necessary. J Establish riparian-management zones along streams, rivers, ponds, tidal areas, lakes, and non-forested wetlands (see page 28). These are not necessarily intended to be no-harvest zones. 1n most areas the goal is to maintain a windfirm structurally stable forest that protects surface and groundwater quality, provides shade, coarse woody debris, and leaf litter to aquatic ecosystems, maintains wildlife habitat and travel corridors, and protects the scenic quality of river and lake shores. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 31 Section Two/Chapter One: Wetlands and Riparian Areas J Locate new truck roads and log landings outside of riparian manage- ment zones wherever possible, except where doing so would result in greater overall impact. Design roads and skid trails within riparian man- agement zones to minimize the total long-term impact on both water quality and wildlife habitat. J Apply the following guidelines within riparian management zones and forested wetlands: - Manage using an uneven-aged system through single tree or small group selection cuts. The residual stand should be maintained with 70% crown closure or full stocking as recommended in silvicultural guides. - Within larger management zones (wider than 100 feet), the 25 feet closest to the stream, pond or wetland should be left unharvested. This will provide increased protection to aquatic habitats and allow a reliable long-term supply of cavity trees, snags, and downed woody material. Land owners and managers desiring greater protection of non-timber values should consider wider no-harvest zones, espe- cially along larger rivers. J Trees with cavities, standing dead trees, downed logs, and large supra- canopy trees (especially white pine) should be retained during harvest operations to the greatest extent possible. J Avoid leaving isolated riparian management zones with long distances of abrupt edge. Riparian forests next to clearcuts may be subject to increased edge effect and risk of blowdown. Practices that minimize these risks include limiting harvest within the riparian management zone, increasing the width of the zone, or feathering the edges of the clearcut.

Forestry activities that can affect water quality include construction of roads, landings, and skid trails; stream and wetland crossings; handling of slash; removal of forest cover; spilling of petroleum products and the application of chemicals. The most important aspect of protecting water quality is maintaining the integrity of wetlands and riparian areas (see Chapter 2.1). OglECT/I/E Protect water quality from degradation during and following harvesting and road-building operations. Avoid the spilling or improper use of toxic chemicals, and prevent undesirable changes in sedimentation, temperature, nutrient content, or water levels in streams, lakes and wetlands. CO~VSIDERATIONS Water quality may be affected by activities throughout a watershed, many of which may be beyond the control of the landowner or land manager. Removing a significant proportion of the forest cover of any watershed can increase stream flow and the chances for erosion and downstream impacts. However, changes in water flow are highly variable depending on local climate, topography, vegetation, soil characteristics, and harvesting proce- dures. Therefore, no simple guidelines for forest cover retention can be given. Impacts are likely to be greatest in: - north-facing watersheds - areas with steep slopes - areas with poorly-drained soil - areas with high pre-harvest stream flow - areas dominated by soft woods (Lee 1980). Using biodegradable oils and lubricants can minimize risks to water quality, but check your chainsaw or other equipment manufacturer war- ranties to ensure that use of biodegradable oils and lubricants will not damage equipment or invalidate the warranty. Be aware of aquifers, wells, and public water supply reservoirs that harvesting may influence. J Become familiar with and apply Best Management Practices for Erosion RECOMrMErVDED Control during all harvesting operations (Appendix C), these are required by law in certain situations. PRACTICES J Survey existing roads for indications of instability and erosion prob- lems. Roads experiencing significant erosion should be stabilized according to guidelines in Best Management Practices for Erosion Control (Appendix C). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 35 Section Two/Chapter Two: Water Quality Monitor sites before, during and after harvesting operations for visible signs of erosion and sedimentation. These may include: - cloudy or muddy water - increased growth of algae in streams or ponds (green slime) - deposits of silt or muck on rocky or gravel streambeds - new runoff channels or gullies Take action to identify and correct the source of these problems J Exercise care when working with fuels, oils, hydraulic fluid, and similar materials. Conduct filling and maintenance of equipment well away from open water or wetlands. Keep sawdust or other absorbent material on the site to soak up accidental spills or leaks. Spills must be reported to the New Hampshire Department of Environ- mental Services (NHDES) unless: the spill is less than 25 gallons; is immediately contained; does not threaten surface or groundwater; and all discharge and contamination is removed within 24 hours (NHDES 1990). If a spill occurs, the best course of action is to contact the NHDES for information. J Encourage the use of vegetable-based bar and chain oil as an alternative to non-biodegradable petroleum-based bar and chain oil. These oils biode- grade rapidly and are virtually non-toxic to fish and algae. These oils are more expensive and your contractor may request that you share the cost. J Avoid excessive removal of vegetation within any individual watershed, especially those with characteristics discussed under Considerations. When harvesting is conducted across an entire watershed, impacts may be reduced by using partial or multi-stage (strip or shelterwood) harvests as opposed to clearcuts.

Overstory inclusions are small patches of forest 11 cover that are distinct from the surrounding forest but - too small to be mapped or treated as a separate stand (see illustration). An example would be a patch of hem- lock in a pure hardwood stand, or patches of oak in a primarily pine stand. Inclusions increase the diversity of habitats avail- able in an area, and provide feeding, nesting, and shel- ter opportunities that may not be present in continu- ous stands of a single type. They may result from either small-scale site differences or variations in the past dis- turbance history of a stand, and may range in size from a few stems to an acre or more. Over a quarter of New England's bird species and a lesser number of mammals use overstory inclusions in one way or another (DeGraaf et al. 1992). The value of a minor inclusion increases in proportion to how different it is from the surrounding forest (Hunter 1990). Even a single softwood tree in a pure hardwood stand can greatly increase the variety of available habitats. Management practices that do not consider overstory inclusions during harvest may not maintain these areas in future stands. Applying a single management practice designed for the dominant cover type may tend to make the stand more uniform, and may not adequately maintain or regenerate inclusions that differ in species composition, site, or regeneration requirements. O~IECTIVE Maintain and regenerate inclusions of softwood predomi- nantly hardwood dominantly softwood stands. CONSIDERA TIONS Applying different treatments to small inclusion areas may be uneconomi- cal if these treatments require different equipment or techniques. Small volumes of some species derived from treatment of inclusions may not be marketable. Inclusions may be prone to blowdown, sunscald, and other risks if surrounding cover is removed. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 41 Section Three/Chapter One: Overstory Inclusions Inclusions may be the result of irregularities in past distur- bance history, and natural successional patterns may work against the maintenance of these areas, especially if advance regeneration of the surrounding dominant vegetation is in place. Maintenance and regener- ation of inclusions will be more practical wliere inclusions result from relatively permanent site factors rather than past disturbance differences across a uniform site. RECOMMENDED J Develop specific prescriptions for stands containing inclusions to main- PRACTICE2 tain or regenerate these areas in their current type. Inclusions should not necessarily receive the same prescription as the rest of the stand. J Create inclusions in large uniform stands if site conditions allow. J Leave inclusions unharvested if: - the inclusion is relatively unique to the area - the inclusion is small (114 acre or less) and the volume of timber generated from its treatment will be limited - if the inclusion results from small-scale differences in site conditions and may be sensitive to disturbance (such as wet areas or shallow soils over ledge). J Leave a buffer around softwood inclusions to provide protection from wind. The buffer should be at least 2-3 tree heights wide on the side exposed to prevailing winds. Do not remove more than 25% of the basal area within this buffer. CROSlS REFERENCE Aspen Management 3.4; Deer Wintering Yamasaki, Leak, and J.W. Lanier. 1992.

Non-forested upland and wetland areas, though representing a small portion of New Hampshire's landscape, may contribute a disproportionately high share of wildlife habitat to the overall forest environment. These areas, dominated by grasses, forbs, brambles, or fruiting shrubs, provide necessary habitat for about 22% of New England's wildlife species, and seasonally important habitat to near- ly 70% of species (DeGraaf et al. 1992), including species of concern such as the bluebird and eastern cottontail. Prior to European settlement these habitats were found primarily in wet areas (such as along large rivers and in beaver-created meadows), and in areas cleared by Native Americans. Non-forested habitats increased greatly with the expansion of agriculture through the mid-1800s (NHDRED 1995). For the last 150 years, however, this habitat has been declining. Cropland and pasture now constitute only a small percentage of New Hampshire land. Some guidelines suggest that 3-5% of forest land should be maintained in permanent openings to maintain this habitat (USFS 1986, DeGraaf et al. 1992). The value of these openings depends on the surrounding landscape; they will be more beneficial in large areas of continuous forest cover than in areas that already contain a mixture of forest and non-forest habitats. The two primary sources of permanent openings in a managed forest are remnant meadows, pastures, or orchards on abandoned agricultural land; and log landings created during harvesting operations and maintained afterward. OBJECTIVE Create or permanently maintain openings dominated by grasses, forbs, or shrubs within forest-dominated upland landscapes. CO NSID ERA TI0 Ns Maintaining these habitats involves periodic treatments the cost of which is generally borne by the landowner. Landowners should check with their county extension forester on the availability of cost-share programs designed to reimburse some of these costs. Seeding with conservation mix and the application of lime and fertilization will result in more persistent establishment of grasses, potentially reducing maintenance costs in the long run. Maintaining permanent openings removes some land from the timber base. However, landings maintained as openings will be available for future harvest operations with little additional clearing. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 43 Section Three/Chapter Two: Permanent Openings RECOMMENDED J Clear abandoned meadows, pastures, or orchards that remain at least PRACTICES partially open of invading woody vegetation, and retain some larger trees or snags for perches and nest sites. J Retain old apple trees which provide a valuable food source for many types of animals. Pruning and releas- ing these trees can maintain their vigor (Olson and Langer 1 990). J When the harvest is complete: clear landings of debris; level and smooth the ground. Plant with a recommended seed mix only if necessary to stabilize the soil, for wildlife, and for appearance. Otherwise let natural vege- tation establish itself. Contact the Natural Resources Conservation Service for information on site-specific seeding practices. J Consider establishing new permanent openings in large expanses of continuous closed-canopy forest (Tubbs and Vemze 1972). Foresters or wildlife biologists can provide advice regarding the need for openings as well as their size, location, and configuration. J Treat permanent openings at approxinlately 5-year intervals to prevent succession to woody vegetation and to retain the dominant herbceous ground cover. More frequent treatments will maintain grass cover in openings; less frequent treatments will allow succession to brambles and shrubs. Treatment can be either by mowing, brush-cutting or prescribed burning. Burning should be done only with expert super- vision; contact the county extension forester in your area for more information on this practice.

Nutrients enter beaver flowages (the flat water behind the dam) in the open water stage and accumulate in bottom organic matter as flowages stagnate. When beaver abandon flowages and water levels drop, organic matter dries and decomposes, allowing grasses and forbs to colonize. In time, shrubs and trees reoccupy these meadows and the cycle begins again. Each of these successional stages provides habitat for a variety of wildlife, from frogs, turtles, waterfowl, great blue herons, swallows, otter, mink, and moose bear, moose in the open meadow stage (Hill 1982; Diefenbach et al. 1988; Williamson 1993). Beaver flowages also influence water quality as dams trap sediments and open meadows slow seasonal run-off (Hill 1982; Olson and Hubert 1994). O~JECIIVE Include beaver and their habitat as essential components of the forest management plan. Maintain hardwoods, especially aspen, along drainways in places where beaver dam-building activity and subsequent wetland openings are desired; and where water levels can be controlled so that transportation corridor and personal property damage is minimal. CO,VS/DER,qT'oNS Surrounding forest composition influences potential beaver occupation. Hardwoods (especially aspen) in the first 100 feet from aquatic edges are important beaver food sources in uplands (Buech 1985; Olson and Hubert 1994). Important aquatic foods include: water lily, duck potato, waterweed, pondweed, and duckweed. Channel gradients of quality beaver habitat are optimally less than 3% (Olson and Hubert 1994) and always less than 12% (summarized in Buech 1985). Valley (drainage) widths in quality beaver habitat are greater than 150 feet wide (Buech 1985; Olson and Hubert 1994). Controlling water levels can be accomplished with an array of drainage devices that can maintain water at a desired level (Buech 1985; Laramie & Knowles 1985; Diefenbach et al. 1988; Olson & Hubert 1994). Road layout and construction in wide and flat drainages can enhance beaver dam-building activities but will require additional road design features (Jones 1992). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 45 Section Three/Chapter Two: Beaver-Created Openings Excess animals can become a nuisance to property owners when their tree-cutting and dam-building activities exceed an acceptable level. Control of beaver or beaver dams may be subject to regulation under RSA 210:9; consult with the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department (NHF&G). Property owners can give written permission and access to licensed trappers during the regular trapping season. Outside of the legal season, property owners can contact the NHFSTG for the name of a local trapper who can remove nuisance animals under state supervision. Gradual removal of beaver dams can be accomplished in ways that slowly release impounded water without causing erosion and siltation if needed. Also consult with New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services for guidance on removing beaver dams. Harvesting more than 50% of the basal area within a riparian zone may require a variance from the basal area law (RSA 227-J:9). Contact the New Hampshire ~ivision of Forests & Lands for more information. RECOMMENDED J Determine the maximum acreage of acceptable flooding in a drainage PRACTICES and set an appropriate water control device (solid or wood pipe, beaver box) at that level to minimize excessive flooding damage. J Where safety factors allow, leave dead trees resulting from flooding for habitat value. J Consider regenerating aspen and other hardwoods in small patches or strips in flat and wide riparian corridors (where stream channel gradients are less than 3% and in drainages wider than 150 feet). J Locate new roads where they are un- likely to be flooded by new dam sites whenever possible. J Be prepared to install water-control devices in road culverts that do cross wide and flat drainages. Consult with the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department or UNH Cooperative Extension for plans and drawings of water-control devices. -- - - J Consider using stone fords for stream -==XI_ crossings when a solid maintenance- free base is required. Consult with the Natural Resource Conservation Service or the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services for permitting requirements. J Provide written permission and access to persons legally trapping excess beaver on private lands.

University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension Service, Durham, NH Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 47 Section Three/Chapter Four: Aspen Management ISSUE Aspen (also known as poplar or popple) stands are the preferred habitat for several wildlife species including ruffed grouse, wood- cock, Nashville warbler, and beaver. Landowners may wish to expand aspen cover in their forest to enhance wildlife habitat diversity. Aspen is uncommon in New Hampshire. Although aspen is one of the most widely-distributed forest types in North America, it is relatively uncommon in New Hampshire. According to the latest forest survey (1983), the aspen type occupies 117,000 acres (approximately 2% of the state's forest area). Aspen, which often grows in close association with white birch, occurs chiefly as a \"pioneer\" forest type. Pioneer types are the first to colonize disturbed areas such as burns. In the absence of disturbance, the aspen type is replaced by more shade-tolerant trees such as spruce, fir, white pine, or northern hardwoods. Given historical and current fire suppression policies, the use of clearcutting is needed to maintain or expand the aspen type in New Hampshire. O~JECTIVE Maintain or expand the aspen type to enhance wildlife habitat diversity. CONSlDERATIONS Aspen is extremely intolerant of shade; it needs full sunlight to grow. Disturbances such as fire or clearcutting are needed to grow shade-intoler- ant species such as aspen and white birch. Aspen seed is extremely small and light. It can be blown long distances, but requires exposed mineral soil for successful germination. Aspen typically regenerates by root suckering. When an area containing aspen is clearcut, dormant buds on the tree's lateral roots sprout, often producing several thousand suckers per acre. Because they have an estab- lished root system, the suckers may grow four feet or more in height during the first year. In New England, aspen stands reach maturity and begin to deteriorate at approximately 40 years of age. Deterioration may begin at age 30 on poor sites or age SO+ on good sites. At maturity, aspen trees are generally 10 to 16 inches in diameter depending on the quality of the site. Growing aspen requires a commitment to relatively short-rotation man- agement (40 +/- years). On poor sites such as infertile sands or shallow-to- bedrock soils, short-rotation management may lead to soil nutrient depletion, particularly if whole-tree harvesting is used. A number of insects and diseases attack aspen. The most serious threats are hypoxylon canker and the forest tent caterpillar. Currently, the only feasible method of dealing with these pests is to keep aspen stands vigorous by harvesting them at an appropriate rotation age. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 49 Section Three/Chapter Four: Aspen Management Clearcuts can be very unsightly, particularly the first few years after the cut. Landowners, foresters and loggers should pay close attention to aesthetic considerations when clearcutting. Visual impacts can be mitigated by limiting their size, shaping them to blend with natural landscape features, and screening them from highways or other high use areas. Wildlife species associated with aspen need large and small patches of this type. Large ownerships offer more flexibility in providing this vari- ety. RECOMMENDED J Perpetuation or expansion of the aspen type requires disturbances PRACTICES such as fire or clearcutting. If aspen is already present in an area, aspen regeneration can usually be secured by clearcutting adjacent to the aspen trees. The clearcut must be large enough to allow sunlight to reach the ground throughout the day. J Cut aspen when dormant (late fall through early spring) to maximize density of root-suckering (Perala, 1977). J Establishment of aspen on an area where none exists is more difficult and may involve site preparation to enhance the germination and survival of aspen seedlings. Contact a professional forester for advice on methods to establish aspen.

Page 50 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Three/Chapter Five: Deer Wintering Areas 3.5 DEER WINTERING AREAS /'uE White-tailed deer in New Hampshire live near the northern limit of their geographical range in the northeast. Because of the severe win- ter conditions experienced here, deer require special habitats to sur- vive. Thes.e special areas are typically lowland softwood stands, often associated with water courses and riparian habitat. They provide shelter from harsh winter weather by reducing snow accumulation and wind speeds, while allowing access to food supplies and escape from predators. Deer-wintering areas comprise about 3% of the land base in New Hampshire. The severity of winter weather often determines whether a par- ticular area is used in a particular year. The easier the winter, the farther deer will move from a core of dense softwoods that may only be used during the most severe weather (which may only occur once in five to ten years). The New Hampshire Fish 8 Game Department staff are available to review areas to determine whether or not they are functional winter habitat. Deer-wintering areas consist of two basic habitat elements: a core area identified by concentrations of dense soft- woods; and mixed hardwood and softwoods adjacent to or within the core area which provide accessible forage. Management planning for deer-wintering areas needs to provide a minimum of at least 50% of the entire area in functional shelter at all times. Functional shel- ter is softwood cover at least 35 feet tall, with crown closures averaging 65 to 70%. This crown closure distribution means some of this conifer cover will be much greater than 70%. Uninterrupted deer mobility and access throughout wintering areas can be provided by managing unbroken, dense lanes of softwood cover at least 200 feet wide utilizing existing networks of softwood riparian habi- tat where possible (Reay, 1990). Managing an existing wintering area for deer will ensure a continued yield of forest products and abundant regeneration. Diversifying age and size classes of softwoods will provide quality habitat for a large range of wildlife species. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 51 Section Three/Chapter Five: Deer Wintering Areas OWECTIVE Manage existing and potential deer-wintering areas to provide shelter, travel lanes to access food, escape from predators, and access to preferred browse. CON'IDERATIONS Management of deer-wintering areas may reduce or delay harvest of sawtimber-sized trees or increase administrative costs of harvesting. Deer-wintering areas are dynamic habitats, changing over time. Optimal habitat values and use require conscious planning and decision-making. Single softwood trees or clusters of trees can be important for cover, especially in winter logging jobs when deer often feed on the tops of recently harvested hardwood trees. The aggregation of small deer-wintering areas on smaller multiple ownerships provides a significant portion of the winter range. RECOMMENDED General: PRACTICE. J The New Hampshire Fish & Game Department (NHF&G) has mapped most active deer-wintering areas in New Hampshire. Contact NHFSTG to find out whether known deer-wintering areas occur on your land. J Manage timber stands within the deer-wintering area for a balanced age class distribution. J Maintain closed-forest cover in strips at least 200 feet wide as travel corridors across the deer-wintering area. Integrate, where possible, with riparian buffers. Manage buffers with uneven-aged techniques. J Maintain at least 50% of the deer-wintering area in shelter areas that contain trees 35+ feet tall with an average canopy closure of 6570%. J Manage a hardwood buffer strip around the perimeter of the deer- wintering area as an integral part of the management unit. Manage these 200 to 1,320-feet wide strips for browse production. Small cutting units (1-5 acres), and clearcutting is recommended, using a 40-year rotation and 10-year cutting interval. J Harvest during late winter months to provide tops for food and skid trails for ease of travel. Hardwood cuts planned adjacent to deer- wintering areas will produce additional browse. J Avoid building truck roads within the wintering area. Forest-Type Specific: J In spruce-fir stands, uneven-aged management using group selection is the preferred method for managing deer-wintering areas (Alexander and Garland 1985) and is especially important for stands smaller than 100 acres. Harvests should create openings 20 feet to 40 feet in diam- eter. Rotation ages should range from 70 years (fir) to 100 years (spruce). Page 52 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Three/Chapter Five: Deer Wintering Areas J Options for spruce-fir stands managed under even-aged systems depend upon advanced regeneration. If advanced regeneration is present, overstory removal can be completed on the area scheduled for harvest. If regenera- tion is absent, either two-cut shelterwood systems or strip clearcutting will stimulate seedling growth. J Hemlock is a superior cover species and is the basic cover component of many wintering areas in central and southern New Hampshire. Management of eastern hemlock stands may be difficult and professional advice should be sought. Refer to Tubbs (1978) and Reay (1985) for details on hemlock silviculture. The most beneficial management activity in these areas is the release of understory hemlock by removing competing hard- woods, and the establishment of browse plots throughout the area. Some general guidelines for management of hemlock deer-wintering areas are: - If advanced regeneration is present, a single removal of the overstory trees in areas to be regenerated is appropriate. If there is inadequate regeneration, a two or three stage harvest is recommended. - If harvesting in the summer, scarify soil before or during harvest, and remove advanced hardwood regeneration in the area prior to harvest. - Cutting units should be 10-20 acres. J Northern white cedar can be extremely hard to regenerate (especially in deer-wintering areas) because it is slow growing and is also a highly- preferred browse species. If a cedar deer-wintering area is encountered, contact a NHF&G biologist for details on management options.

Page 54 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Three/Chapter Six: Mast 3.6 MAST I~UE Sources of mast are critical to wildlife survival and need to be maintained in New Hampshire. \"Mast1' refers to nuts, seeds, and fruits of woody plants that provide food for wildlife (Elliott 1988). \"Hard mast\" refers to nuts and seeds; \"soft mast\" refers to fruits and berries. High levels of fat and protein in mast contribute to fat stores critical for migration or hibernation and to survival of newly independent young. Some birds and mammals depend heavily on mast during peak produc- tion periods in late summer and early fall, and/or during winter when some sources remain available on trees and shrubs, on the ground under the snow, or stored in caches. Sources of hard mast have changed in New Hampshire's forests during the last century. Chestnut blight eliminated American chestnut; Gypsy moth out- breaks have caused considerable mortality of oaks; and beech-bark disease now threatens availability of beechnuts. Over-harvesting of mature oak may impact mast availability. Mad Magt American beech, hickory, and red, white, and black oak are the primary sources of hard mast in New Hampshire forests. These are important dietary components for white-tailed deer, black bear, wild turkey, ruffed grouse, wood duck, and more than a dozen other mammals and birds. Beechnuts are an important autumn food source for black bears in northern New England. Beech trees begin heavy nut production at about 50 years of age or 8 inches DBH and produce good crops at 2- to 8-year intervals. Red oaks bear heavy acorn crops at 2- to 5-year intervals and are at peak production when trees are in 19-22 inch DBH. White oaks bear heavy crops at 4- to 10-year intervals, and peak in production at 24-30 inch DBH. There is considerable variation in production between trees, but individual trees tend to produce consistently good or poor acorn crops. Acorns of white oak are more palatable to wildlife than those of red and black oak because the former contain lower tannin levels. Ash, birches, maples, and conifer species are also important sources of hard mast for seed-eating wildlife. s~ff ~~d Black cherry is the primary soft-mast producer among New Hampshire's timber trees, and provides an important food source for bears, small mammals, and 28 bird species. While 10-year old saplings may produce fruit, peak production occurs between 30 and 100 years of age. Good crops occur at 1- to 5-year inter- vals, although black cherries usually produce some fruit annually. Black cherry trees may vary widely in fruit production, making the production history of indi- vidual trees an important consideration in selecting trees for harvest or reten- tion. Other important native sources of soft mast in the state include pin and choke cherries, wild apples, mountain ash, shadbush, and brambles (blackberries and raspberries). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 55 Section Three/Chapter Six: Mast OgJECTIVE Manage mast producing trees for a continuous source of wildlife food and quality seed for regeneration. TIOMS Individual beech and black cherry trees may be poor-quality timber but invaluable mast sources. Such trees may have greater value if left for wildlife than if harvested for wood products. Beech-bark disease may affect management decisions in infected stands (see Insects, Diseases and Wind Damage 5.6). Early successional shrubs, such as brambles and pin cherry, are important mast sources despite their \"weed\" status. When planting mast-producing shrubs, favor native over exotic species. Avoid planting invasive exotics such as multiflora rose, winged euonymus, non-native honeysuckle species, and autumn olive. RECOMMENDED PRACTICES J When managing stands with multiple mast-producing species, maintain the diversity of mast sources. J Manage oak stands on long rotations (100-125 years), growing trees to 20-26 inch diameters to maximize acorn production and timber value (Bums and Honkala 1990, Elliott 1988). Maintain oak in well-stocked stands by retaining vigorous trees with dominant crowns (Elliott 1988). J Retain any beech tree with recent, fresh claw marks on the trunk (see illustration) or clumps of broken branches in the crown. Retain mature (greater than 40 years old) beech in stands supporting wild turkeys. J When harvesting stands with a black cherry component, retain some trees with high fruit production or any tree that shows evidence of use by bear. J Retain wild apple trees and gradually release from competi- tion; prune cautiously (Elliott 1988).

In addition, the brown creeper nests under loose flaps of bark, attached at the top, on standing dead trees. These species require a range of cavity-tree size classes to provide suitable shelter (Table 1). Larger trees accommodate more species. Manen Fisher Long-ta luck excavi wn bat X PA r OBJECTIVE Maintain cavity and den trees, particularly trees with diameters exceeding 18 inches. CONSIDERA TIONS U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminis- tration (OSHA) regulations regarding dangerous tree removal should be consulted prior to timber harvesting. These regulations may be in conflict with the recommendations of this section. They require the removal of all snags by mechanical means. If the tree is to be left standing, it must be marked and no work conducted within two tree lengths of the tree, unless the employer demonstrates a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 inch DBH, secure standing Page 57 Providing for cavity trees in uncut patches and/or focusing on the following choices for retention trees will minimize safety issues: live trees with natural cavities or woodpecker holes, broken-topped live trees exceeding 12- dead trees, especially those with top-attached bark flaps, large aspens, longer-lived species (white pine, red spruce, eastern hemlock, sugar maple, beech, yellow birch), and/or saw-timber size individuals of species which persist for long periods as standing dead trees (yellow birch, sugar maple, elm, oaks, white pine). Section Three/Chapter Seven: Cavity Trees, Dens and Snags Riparian zones, roadside buffers, scenic areas, and small uncut patches contribute to snag retention goals for an ownership. Even distribution of snags on the landscape is desirable for some species, but there are many benefits to clumping snags as well (Elliott 1988). Uniformity is not always operationally practical or desirable. On smaller ownerships it may be necessary to manage snags on an acre by acre basis; on larger ownerships it is usually more practical to take a landscape-level approach - making sure that some areas of the ownership emphasize snag retention, while in other areas less priority may be placed on snag retention. RECOflMENDED J In areas under uneven aged management, retain a minimum of 6 PRACTICES secure cavity and/or snag trees per acre, with one exceeding 18 inches DBH and 3 exceeding 12 inches DBH (NHDRED 1995). In areas lacking such cavity trees, retain trees of these diameters with defects likely to lead to cavity formation. J In areas under even aged management, leave an uncut patch for every 10 acres harvested, with patches totaling 5% of the area (USDA Forest Service 1986, Elliott 1988). Patch size may vary from a minimum of 0.25 acre. Use cavity trees exceeding 18 inches DBH or active den trees as nuclei for uncut patches. Remember, the larger the tree, the more species that can use it. Riparian and other buffers can help to satisfy this goal. J Retain live trees with existing cavities.

Page 58 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Three/Chapter Eight: Dead and Down Woody Debris 3.8 DEAD AND DOWN WOODY DEBRIS ISSUE Dead and down woody material in various stages of decay (logs, stumps, limbs and upturned tree roots) serves many critical func- tions in a forest and should be present in most if not all stands. Dead and down woody material, often referred to as coarse woody debris, is important for nutrient retention and cycling, as nurse logs for regeneration of trees and understory plants, and as wildlife habitat (Harmon et al. 1986). Large (18+ inches) hollow or rotten logs and stumps generally have the greatest value. Softwood stands usually contain more and longer-lasting woody debris than hardwood stands. Maintaining snags and cavity trees will also serve to maintain coarse woody debris, as these trees eventually fall over. Coarse woody debris is utilized as habitat by over 30% of the region's mammal species (primarily rodents, shrews and carnivores), 45% of amphibians (primarily salamanders), and 50% of reptiles (primarily turtles and snakes) (summarized @om DeGraaf et al. 1992). It is used as a feeding site by rodents, shrews, black bears, and woodpeckers and provides shelter for many species of small mammals. Seventeen species of New Hampshire mammals, from black bear to deer mouse, den in or under downed logs. Coarse woody debris creates moist micro-habitats that are used by amphibians. Downed logs create pools and riffles in streams that provide important fish habitat and basking and nesting locations for turtles, waterfowl, mink, and otter. Several ground-nesting birds (including juncos and winter wrens) nest within upturned tree roots. In addition, dead and down woody material provides habitat for many lower organisms such as insects and other invertebrates, mosses, fungi, and lichens. The amount of coarse woody debris is low in many of New Hampshire's forests, especially those that have regrown from agricultural land. Dead and down materials have been viewed as potential wood products that should be salvaged, as fuels that create fire hazards, and as physical barriers to forest operations and regeneration. However, across much of the state, forests are maturing, and the supply of this material is naturally increasing as older trees die and fall over. Several trends may reduce the supply of this material, including greater utilization of cull material through chipping or whole tree harvesting, increasing intensity of forest management, and shortening of rotation lengths. OBECTIVE Manage for coarse woody debris by retaining material that currently exists and allowing its accumulation where it is currently missing. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 59 Section Three/Chapter Eight: Dead and Down Woody Debris CONSIDERATIONS Sound woody debris may have minimal economic value as biomass or chips. RECOJ&fENDED J Avoid damaging existing downed woody debris, especially large (18+ PRACTICE2 inches) hollow or rotten logs and rotten stumps during harvesting operations (including tree falling, skidding, and road and skid trail lay out). J Leave cull material from harvested trees, especially sound hollow logs, in the woods. Some cull material should be left behind during whole- tree or biomass harvesting operations that may otherwise utilize this material. Large pieces of cull material bucked out on the landing should be returned to the woods. J Avoid disrupting downed logs in and adjacent to streams, ponds, and wetlands. J Avoid disrupting upturned tree roots from May-July to protect nesting birds. J Maintain or create softwood inclusions in hardwood stands to provide a supply of longer-lasting down woody material.

Every species of native New Hampshire plant - whether a tree, a spring wildflower, or an inconspicuous grass - contributes to the quality of life in our state. The presence of unusual plants enriches our experience as we walk through the woods. This biological diversity provides a reservoir of materials for use in agriculture, medicine and industry, builds the soil, purifies water and air, and provides food and shelter for wildlife. Diversity allows the forest to adapt to changing conditions by providing many options for ecosystems to carry out the functions that maintain them (Taylor et al. 1996). Private landowners have a remarkable opportunity to help preserve New Hampshire's biological heritage by learning to recognize rare plants and natural communities and managing their land so as to maintain these important components of the forest. New Hampshire has over 1500 native species of vascular plants. Of these, about 25% are considered uncommon enough to be of special concern to the New Hampshire Natural Heritage Inventory (NHNHI), and about 20% are legally listed as threatened or endangered by the state under the Native Plant Protection Act, RSA 217-A (NHDRED 1995, Taylor et al. 1996). Only four plants are federally listed, and of those, only one - the small whorled pogonia - grows in forested areas. Many of the state's uncommon plants occur in non-forested habitats such as marshes, riverbanks and alpine areas. Of those that occur in forested areas, the vast majority are restricted to a small portion of the landscape and are unlikely to affect harvesting operations. Although some rare plants may be sensitive to disturbance, many species can be maintained in harvested areas if appropriate silvicultural and harvesting procedures are followed. The NHNHI plant tracking list includes 6 relatively uncommon tree species that may reach harvestable size: black maple, river birch, hackberry, Atlantic white-cedar, butternut, and jack pine (NHNHI 1994). Conserving the state's biodiversity requires consideration of natural commu- nities as well as individual species. The NHNHI recognizes about 130 different natural communities in the state, of which about 40 are partially or completely forested. As with rare plants, rare natural communities occupy only a small part of the landscape. The Nature Conservancy has estimated that a small percentage (5%) of all natural communities make up the majority (about 75%) of the land- scape; this includes the common forest types in which most management occurs. (However, because of the long history of intensive land use in the state, there are few examples of these communities that have been minimally dis- turbed by humans and which retain a relatively natural composition and struc- ture.) Over half of the natural communities occupy in total only about 5% of the landscape; this includes most rare forest communities as well as bogs, cliffs, alpine areas, and similar communities that exist only in small areas. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 63 Section Four/Chapter One: Rare Plants and Natural Communities /dentifying Identifying these plants and communities can be daunting if one is not an R~~ plantr and experienced botanist. However, people with an interest in natural history lVatural Communities and a good field guide to wildflowers can quickly learn to identify many rare plants. In addition, even people without formal training but with a keen eye in the woods can recognize certain areas as being different from the relatively common forest types that cover much of the landscape. A dis- proportionate number of rare elements are found in certain distinct com- munities that occupy a small part of the forested landscape. A guide to some important communities follows in this chapter. small whorled Small whorled pogonia is one forest plant that every forester and forest pog-nia landowner should know WSFWS 1995). It is one of the rarest wild orchids in eastern North America, and its largest populations are found in the southeastern third of New Hampshire and adjacent areas of Maine. It grows in a variety of wooded habitats, primarily mid-successional mixed-woods dominated by maple, oak, beech, and white pine. The understory in areas where this plant is found is usually sparse. Understory plants that are often associated with small whorled pogonia include Indian cucumber-root (to which it is similar in appearance), New York fern, partridgeberry, rattlesnake plantain, and witch-hazel. Small whorled pogonia can tolerate some level of disturbance, and the plant can be maintained in stands managed for timber. Though the effects of harvesting on this species are still being studied, partial cutting that retains a continuous forest cover is probably the best choice. O&C(!T/VE Increase awareness of New Hampshire's rare plants and natural communities and manage forests to maintain these features where they are found. ~O~S/DE~T/O~S Because of the many different rare plants and natural communities across the state, no general management guidelines can be stated, and there may be a wide range of silvicultural and harvesting techniques that are appropriate for different areas. Specific management guide- lines have not been developed for most rare plants and natural communities. However, as a general principle forest management in these areas should consider managing for the communities. Accurately identifying some rare species and natural communities may require specialized training and knowledge. Conducting detailed surveys to identify rare plants and communities may be expensive and time-consuming if not done by the landowner, volunteers, or students. However, for many areas, especially those with a low diversity of habitats, such surveys may only be a small fraction of other forest management costs. Page 64 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter One: Unique and Fragile Knowledge about the effect of various forestry practices on many rare species and communities is limited. Avoiding harvesting may be the best course of action for some species or communities but this entails an economic loss to the landowner. How- ever, these areas generally occupy only a small part of the forested landscape. Some rare species and communities may depend on disturbance (such as fire) for their maintenance. Suppression of these disturbances, com- bined with natural successional processes, may alter or eliminate these elements. Harvesting operations may not adequately simulate the natural disturbance regime. Many landowners retain a fear of legal restrictions on property use due to the presence of rare plants or communities and may be reluctant to ask for assistance or conduct inventories. However, the state's Native Plant Protection Act (RSA 217-A) explicitly states that the presence of state-listed rare plants will not restrict landowner activities. State agencies are directed to consider these plants when issuing permits (such as wetlands permits), though any protection actions they propose are generally voluntary rather than mandatory. In the case of endangered or threatened plants, the Federal Endangered Species Act only establishes regulatory requirements where a federal permit, such as a wet lands permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, is being sought. RECOMMENDED J While surveying or working in the harvest area, be alert for any area PRACTICES that appears unique or different from the general forest landscape. These will often be areas with distinct vegetation or extreme site conditions (very dry, wet, nutrient-rich, etc.). Work with professionals trained in identifying species or communities of concern. J Contact the NHNHI or the Nature Conservancy for information about any rare plant species or natural community that is known to (or could potentially) occur within the harvest area. J If a harvest area is suspected of containing rare plants or communities, the NHNHI can provide information about the potential sensitivity of the site and appropriate silvicultural treatments for some communities. J Conduct harvesting in areas suspected of containing rare plants or communities so as to avoid excessive changes in stand composition and structure, crown closure, forest floor characteristics, and other stand conditions.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 65 Section Four/Chapter One: Rare Plants and Natural Communities Emmpl@ of Uncommon forested wetlands: uncommon ' These wetlands contain less common tree species like northern white Alatutal cedar, black spruce, and black ash in the northern part of the state and Communitier in Atlantic white cedar, black or green ash, elms, black gum, black willow, sycamore, or swamp white oak in the south. Understory species of inter- New u8mphiirs est in these areas include swamp azalea, yellow lady's-slipper and many other types of orchids, bulbous bittercress, sweet coltsfoot, and swamp valerian. Fldplain forests: These forests occupy frequently flooded terraces along river margins. They are usually dominated by silver maple forests along major rivers and by red maple-black ash-cherry-ironwood forests along smaller rivers. They may also contain other uncommon species such as hackberry, east- ern cottonwood, boxelder, American elm, sycamore, swamp white oak, and river birch. Understory species of interest include green dragon and bladdernut. Uncommon dry (plne-oak-hickory) forest types: Most dry forest sites are dominated by relatively common forest types (red spruce in the north; white pine-red oak-hemlock in the south). However, less common types may be found on dry sites, especially in the southern part of the state. These communities may be distinguished by the dominance of less common species such as red, jack and pitch pine; black, white, chestnut, scarlet, and scrub oaks; hickories; and sassafras. Page 66 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter One: Rare Plants and Natural Communities Rich merit? forests (cove forests): These hardwood forests generally occur on lower concave slopes and are character- ized by deep, fine-textured soils and relatively high nutrient status. They may also be found on areas with calcium-rich parent material. They are dominated by sugar maple with white ash or basswood also present. Understory plants indicative of these sites include white baneberry, red-berried elder, sweet cicely, silvery spleen- wort, blue fern, maidenhair fern, wild ginger, and Dutchman's breeches. A considerable number of New Hampshire's rare upland forest plants occur in this forest type, including butternut, flowering dogwood, squirrel corn, ginseng, Goldie's fern, large yellow lady's slipper, and mountain sweet cicely. These commu- nities are very productive and well-suited for growing high-quality hardwood sawlogs. Careful management is required to assure that harvesting does not impact the ability of these sites to maintain populations of associated understory species. Ateas with calcareous bedrock: ' Communities growing in soils derived from calcium-rich parent material are uncom- mon in New Hampshire. They run the full range from open wetlands to upland forests to cliffs and rocky ridge-tops. Among the plants that may help identify these sites are alder-leaved buckthorn, red-osier dogwood, and and ebony spleenwort and blunt-lobed hepatica in dry oak forests. Many rare plants in New Hampshire are restricted to these sites.

Vernal pools are small depressions that fill when spring melt-water or autumn rains accumulate, or when the groundwater level rises above the level of the depression. They have no defined inlet or outlet. During dry periods, the presence of matted and discolored leaves in a small depression provides the most obvious clue to a vernal pool's existence. These ponds cannot support fish either because they are temporary, too shallow, too warm, oxygen-poor, or because they freeze solid in winter (Kenney 1995). Because they lack fish, vernal pools provide a unique habitat for aquatic organisms which fish would consume as prey. Wood frogs and mole salamanders breed only in vernal pools, and 10 other species of reptiles and amphibians also use these habitats for breeding and/or feeding (Colburn 1991). Protection of ver- nal pools is very important in maintaining local amphibian populations. Many species of insects and other invertebrates, including tiny snails and clams, also live in vernal pools. While some spend part of their life cycle in other habitats, a number survive in the mud during periods when the pool is dry. OBJECTIVE Manage vernal pools as amphibian habitat by avoiding temperature increases from loss of shade and by preventing siltation. CONSIDERA TIONS Best Management Practices for Erosion Control (Appendix C) do not address siltation of vernal pools. Some vernal pools may meet the statutory definition of wetland and thus are subject to state wetlands regulations. Consult with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services or the Natural Resources Conservation Service for assistance. Deep ruts in skid roads that collect water may attract breeding amphibians but do not function as vernal pools. Productivity of such pools is often low because the water becomes too warm and oxygen-depleted for larvae to survive to adulthood. Amphibians breeding in vernal pools may attach their eggs to small twigs up to an inch in diameter. However, larger woody debris can obstruct amphibian movement through a pool. Vernal pools typically represent a very small proportion of a forest. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 69 Section Four/Chapter Two: Vernal Pools RECOMMENDED J Identify and mark the perimeter of vernal pools during spring when PRACTICET they are filled with water. Vernal pool locations may not be obvious during the dry season or when the ground is snow-covered. Prior delineation will prevent damage during harvests conducted when they are difficult to detect. J Avoid running machinery through vernal pool basins, even during dry periods, to avoid changing the pool's ability to hold water (Roble and Kittredge 1991). Maintain a shaded and minimally disturbed buffer zone extending 50 feet outward from the high water line to avoid siltation and temperature increases (Roble and Kittredge 1991). Avoid locating roads and skid trails through areas which will drain into vernal pool basins to avoid sedimenta- tion from runoff. If necessary, conduct forestry opera- tions on snow or frozen ground to avoid erosion and siltation. If operation on bare, unfrozen ground is unavoidable, avoid leaving ruts exceeding 6 inches in depth within 200 feet of a vernal pool, as such ruts can create barriers for amphibians migrating to and from the pool (Roble and Kittredge 1991), and maintain cover by avoiding exposure of mineral soil within 50 feet of a vernal pool. J Avoid felling trees into or piling slash in vernal pool basins. Remove slash that falls into a pool during the dry season. If slash falls into a pool while it is holding water, leave it in place to avoid disturbing eggs already in the pool (Roble and Kittredge 1991).

Page 70 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter Three: Seeps 43 SEEPS /SUE Seeps are easily overlooked areas of critical habitat. Seeps or seepage wetlands are generally small areas (less than 114 acre) that occur where groundwater comes to the surface. Soil at these sites remains satu- rated for some portion or all of the growing season, and often stays wet through- out the winter. These wetlands can occur as hillside forest seeps in sloping head- water areas, or as larger sloping seepage forests in till outwash and river terrace sediments (Tiner 1994; Taylor et al. 1996). Because these sites are the first to green-up in the spring, they are frequented by a variety of wildlife. Black bear, for example, show a strong preference for seeps as important sources of food in spring and summer. In a Massachusetts study, skunk cab- bage, grass, and roots growing in seeps constituted a major portion of a bear's spring diet. Grasses, sedges, bulbous roots, and jewelweed next to seeps were shown to make up most of their early summer diet (Elowe 1984). Wild turkeys, deer and moose also seek seeps for food, water, and occasionally elements like calcium or sodium that may be present in the groundwater. Salamanders, spring migrating birds, and cold-water fishes also depend upon seeps. Seeps are preferred habitats of the northern dusky and two-lined salaman- ders and are often visited by their predators: skunk, raccoon, and river otter (Whitlock et al. 1994). During the stress of spring migration, woodcock and robins depend on these sites for water, food (earthworms, insect larvae, etc.) and as a refuge after early spring snow storms. Seeps located adjacent to streams or rivers maintain coldwater habitats for trout and salmon during summer months when cooler water temperatures pre- vent fish mortality. These same sites also foster fish survival in the winter by cre- ating a warmer environment than would normally occur. Trout and salmon abundance has been related to seeps and groundwater upwelling in streams and rivers (Meisner et al. 1988). OBJECTIVE Protect seeps and minimize disturbance to the forest floor (organic layer) adjacent to them during timber harvesting operations. Good Forestry in the Granite State Page 71 Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter Three: Seeps CONSIDERATIONS Some seeps may meet the statutory definition of wetland and thus be subject to state wetlands regulations. Consult with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services or the Natural Resources Conservation Service for assistance. RECOMMENDED J Keep equipment a minimum distance of 50 feet from the seep. PRACTICES J Locate roads and skid trails prior to the timber harvest (in seasons other than winter). J Conduct selection harvesting or uneven-aged management in the vicinity of seeps on frozen ground where feasible. Avoid even-aged management around seeps. J Keep tree tops and slash out of seeps and wildlife trails that access these areas. J Avoid intercepting the flow of water downslope of seeps when constructing roads or other developments. If unavoidable, ensure that the interruption of groundwater flow is minimized by adherence to appropriate BMPs for water crossings, such as culverts, portable bridges and pole fords.

These birds can be sensitive to human disturbance and habitat changes in the vicinity of nests. Red-tailed, red-shouldered, broad-winged, sharp-shinned, northern goshawk, and Cooper's hawks build large stick nests in major forks of mature hardwoods and on whorls of large branches of white pines in New Hampshire forests. Several of these species may reuse the same nest in successive years, or build a new nest nearby. These hawks also may remodel a nest originally constructed by a different species. Large owls (barred, great-horned, long-eared) may use old hawk nests. Suitable trees for supporting large stick nests are not common in present-day forests. The red-shouldered hawk was listed as threatened from 1980 to 1986 - biologists still consider it a species of concern (J. Kanter, pers. comm.). This species selects nest sites in large contiguous stands of mature trees Uohnsgard 1990), typically in or near lowland forests (Bent 1961). Nest trees frequently exceed 17 inches DBH (Nelson and Titus 1989) and occur in stands with canopy closure in excess of 65% (Campbell 1975, Bryant 1986). The northern goshawk is a species of concern because of recent declines in some parts of North America, particularly in the western United States (Block et al. 1993). This species has increased in New Hampshire as forests have matured (E.C. Janeway in Foss 1994). Goshawks nest in mature mixed hardwood and conifer forests (E.C. Janeway in Foss 1994) of trees exceeding 8 inches DBH. Most nest trees exceed 12 inches DBH (Speiser and Bosakowski 1987). Cooper's hawk populations are gradually recovering from pesticide effects (Johnsgard 1990) and the species is listed as a threatened in New Hampshire (J. Kanter, pers. comm.). Nests are located in pine stands, mixed and deciduous woods (Bent 1961), near water and forest openings (Johnsgard 1990). Excessive human activity near raptor nests during the early weeks of the breeding season may cause a pair to abandon the site, or may cause a female to flush from the nest, leaving eggs or nestlings vulnerable to fatal chilling or consumption by a predator (Fyfe and Olendorff 1976). OglECTIvE Manage for suitable nest trees for woodland-nesting raptors and avoid disturbance of nesting pairs. ~ONS/DE~T/O~S Some raptors like red-tailed and broad-winged hawk are more tolerant to disturbance and less stringent guidelines can be followed. Since the species using a particular nest usually is unknown, a conservative approach is best when planning forest management around raptor nests. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 73 Section Four/Chapter Four: Woodland Raptor Nest Trees Many woodland raptors nest near water or forest openings such as old woods roads (lohnsgard 1990, Speiser, 1993). Nesting hawks may tolerate vehicle traffic on regularly used roads. However, all-terrain vehicle traffic on otherwise unused roads can be a disturbance factor (Speiser 1993). Extensive openings make forest habitat more inviting for great horned owls, which prey on both adult and nestling hawks, and may generally discourage hawk nesting attempts (Craighead and Craighead 1969). RECOMMENDED PRACTICH J Check mature white pine and large diameter hardwoods for stick nests; retain trees containing large stick nests, hardwoods with three-pronged forks, and cavity trees (see Cavity Trees, Dens and Snags 3.7). J To avoid disturbance during the breed- ing season, discourage forest manage- ment activities within 1600 feet of active raptor nests (Call 1979) during February-June. J Surround raptor nests with an uncut buffer of at least 66 feet (Elliott 1988) and retain 65-85% canopy closure within a 165 foot radius of large stick nests to maintain habitat conditions in vicinity of nest. J In clearcuts, leave a group of several large trees for each 5-10 acres to ensure future availability of mature trees for nest sites (Elliott 1988). These clumps also can serve cavity needs (see Cavity Trees, Dens and Snags 3.7). J Avoid recreational use of logging roads adjacent to active nests during the raptor nesting season (February-July). Trails may be temporarily re-routed around nesting areas. CROSS RELERENCE Cavity Trees, Dens and Snags 3.7; Forest Structure 5.2.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 75 Section Four/Chapter Five: Heron Colonies 4.5 HERON COLONIES /~uE Herons nest in colonies in mature trees in or near wetlands and nest- ing birds are very sensitive to human disturbance. Great blue herons are large wading birds that nest in colonies of several to many pairs. Nesting colonies may be located miles from wetland and shoreline feeding areas. Most southern New Hampshire nests are in dead trees in beaver ponds; North Country nests are usually in live white pines that tower above the rest of the treetops. Heron colonies also may occur in mature live hardwoods on upland sites. New Hampshire heron colonies range up to more than 50 nests in size. While colonies of fewer than 8 nests may be relatively short-lived, larger colonies often persist for decades, and generate most of the annual production of young. New Hampshire currently supports about 30 colonies of at least 8 nests and numerous smaller ones (ASNH data). About 90% of known colonies, and all but one of the larger ones, are located south of the White Mountains. Human activity in the vicinity of a nesting colony during the breeding sea- son may lead to low productivity or abandonment (Bjorkland 1975, Werschkul et al. 1976, Simpson et al. 1987), and distance from human settlements appears to be a significant factor in colony site selection (Gibbs et al. 1987, Watts and Bradshaw 1994). Great blue herons will flush from nests in response to intrusions at distances of roughly 400-600 feet early in the breeding season (April-May) before incubation has begun, and at distances of roughly 100-300 feet during incubation and nestling periods (Vos et al. 1985). OglECTlVE Prevent disturbance or loss of heron nesting colonies. CONSIDERAT/O,VS New road construction in the vicinity of a nesting colony may result in nest abandonment. Nesting herons may tolerate vehicle traffic on existing roads, but pedestrians visible from nests are more of a problem than traffic. RECOMMENDED Within 330 feet of a heron colony: PRACTICES J Avoid harvesting and road construction; > Avoid recreational activities during the nesting season (April-August) (Elliott 1988). Between 330 and 660 feet from a heron colony: J Limit harvests to single tree or small group selection; J Avoid harvesting during the nesting season (April-August) (Elliott 1988). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 77 Section Four/Chapter Five: Heron Colonies Between 660 and 1320 feet from a heron colony: J Avoid high disturbance activities such as road construction, site preparation, and loud recreational activities during the nesting season (April-August) (Elliott 1988). J Avoid harvesting in ways that substantially increase wind exposure of nest trees. J When planning operations in the vicinity of a heron colony exceeding eight nests, consult the New Hampshire Nongame and Endangered Wildlife Program biologist at the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department.

Page 78 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter Six: Bald Eagle and Osprey Nests 46 BALD EAGLE AND OSPREY NESTS IaUE The bald eagle is a state-endangered and federally-threatened species and the osprey is a state-threatened species. Continued existence of both birds in New Hampshire depends on the supply of adequate nest trees. Both species require large water bodies for foraging; the osprey feeds almost exclusively on fish, while the bald eagle feeds largely on fish and waterfowl. While there is only one nesting pair of bald eagles in New Hampshire (at Umbagog Lake) at the present time, this number is likely to increase in the corn- ing decades (M. Amaral, USFWS, pers. comm.). This species typically nests in large live or dead trees, often white pines, usually within one half a mile of the shore of a large water body (Snow 1973). Ospreys nest in the upper Androscoggin drainage basin, the Connecticut Lakes region, and in the vicinity of Great Bay. After a period of serious decline due to the effects of DDT, New Hampshire's osprey population has expanded significantly during the past decade, and may colonize new areas in the future. Ospreys nest in dead or dead-topped trees, most often in white pines but occasionally in other tall softwoods. Osprey nests may be several miles from the nearest open water. Many are associated with a wetland or the riparian zone of a stream, but some are in upland settings. Both osprey and bald eagle nests are typically used for years or even decades, with pairs adding additional nesting material annually. OaECTIVE Maintain existing eagle and osprey nest trees and potential replace- ment trees. Avoid disturbance in the vicinity of active nests during the breeding season. CONSIDERATIONS The New Hampshire Fish & Game Department's Nongame and Endangered Species Program monitors nests of these species through efforts of the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, and maintains communication with landowners regarding the status of known nests. Provisions of voluntary management agreements in place with landowners since the mid-1980s are reflect- ed in the recommended practices provided below. RECOMMENDED PRACTICES J Contact the Nongame and Endangered Species Program coordinator at the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department for assistance in planning a harvest within one quarter mile of an osprey or bald eagle nest (Grier et al. 1984, Smith and Nevers 1985). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 79 Section Four/Chapter Six: Bald Eagle and Osprey Nests J Avoid human activity within 650 feet of active nests from April 1- August 30 (Call 1979).

Page 80 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter Seven: Bald Eagle Winter Roosts 47 BAU) EAGLE WINTER ROOSTS ISSUE Wintering eagles need perch sites and sheltered roosting areas. Large shoreline trees adjacent to open water provide perch sites from which eagles can scan the water for food, and to which they return with prey to eat. Stands of mature conifers, sometimes mixed with large hardwoods, provide shel- tered roosting areas where eagles spend the night and periods of inclement weather. These roost areas may be some distance from the shore. Roosts must provide protection from the wind and from excessively cold temperatures, as well as open flyways to perch sites. Large trees with widely-spaced branches allow eagles, which stand more than 3 feet tall and have a 6-7.5 foot wing- spread, access to suitable perches. Winter is stressful because cold temperatures increase energy demands and food can be difficult to obtain. Eagles spend many winter hours perching quietly in a protected location. Eagles vary in their tolerance to human activity, depend- ing on the individual eagle, the particular roost or perch, and even the individ- ual human involved (Snow 1973). Human activity near roosts and perches can interfere with foraging and disturb eagles from protected perches (Grier et al. 1984), increasing energy demands and sometimes forcing eagles to perch in exposed locations. In New Hampshire, wintering bald eagles occur in limited areas near open water in the Lakes Region, the Great Bay area, and along the Androscoggin, Merrimack, and Connecticut rivers. O~JE(JT/VE Manage for structural features (i.e. tree branching patterns and stand densities) of shoreline perch trees and night roost areas; avoid human disturbance of these sites from December-March. (JONS/DERAT/ONS Consistently-used roost and perch sites are limited in number and extent and are documented from annual monitoring efforts since the early 1980s. Winter eagle roosts are difficult to recognize when the eagles are not present. Wildlife biologists can advise on whether or not a planned harvest is in a sensitive area. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 81 Section Four/Chapter Seven: Bald Eagle Winter Roosts RECOMMENDED PRACTICES J When considering a white pine harvest within one half a mile of the shore in any of the identified wintering areas, or when planning a harvest in the vicinity of a known roost, consult the Nongame and Endangered Species Program coordinator at the New Hampshire Fish 6; Game Department for assistance in planning harvest activities. J Avoid harvesting in stands where eagles are known to roost. J Avoid routing recreational or logging trails in the immediate vicinity of known and potential night roosts and day perches.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter Eight: Old-Growth Forests 48 OUXROWTU FORESTS IaUE Old-growth forests in New Hampshire occupy only a tiny fraction of their original area. Preserving both identified and unidentified remnants of old-growth and restoring additional areas would provide many important habitat, aesthetic, educational, and other natural resource values. The forest that greeted New Hampshire's original European settlers exists today only as scattered remnants. These forest patches (commonly called old- growth, virgin, primeval, or ancient forests) tradition- ally refer to forests that have escaped harvesting or other human modification over the last 350 years. Carbonneau (1986) confirmed only 12 old-growth forest sites ranging in size from 2 to 400 acres and totaling about 3,000 acres statewide. It is possible that additional areas exist, but have not been identi- fied; these will generally be small areas that escaped harvesting because of difficult access. Any harvesting in old-growth areas will diminish their value as exam- ples of natural community composition and develop- ment. Restoration of pre-settlement forest conditions is not possible. However, there are areas that may have seen some level of harvesting in the past but still exhibit many of the characteristics of old-growth. Rather than being an eitherlor situation, the presence of old-growth should be thought of as a continuum, with certain stands being more old-growth like than others. Defining old growth by its characteristics, rather than its history, means that old-growth can be restored, simply by allowing natural ecological processes to progress over time without human interference. Old-growth forests have most or all of the following characteristics (Davis, 1996): An abundance of old trees, with long trunks free of lower branches; deeply furrowed or plated bark; signs of heartwood decay, large prominent root structures, flattened crowns with protruding dead limbs, large thick limbs, and trunks often showing a twist that develops wit11 age. An abundance of dead and downed logs in all stages of decomposition, criss-crossing the forest floor and lying in and across stream beds, covered with moss and lichens. An abundance of dead standing trees (called snags). Canopy gaps large and small, formed from trees that have fallen. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 83 Section Four; Chapter Eight: Old-Growth Forests Undulating forest floor expressed in randomly scattered pits and mounds where trees have fallen over and decomposed. Multiple growth layers: overstory (trees that make up the canopy); understory (trees beneath the canopy); and shrub, herbaceous, and ground layers visible to one degree or another, all reflecting a broad spectrum of age. Undisturbed soils with a relatively thick humus layer in some forest types. Abundance of lichens, mosses, and fungi, particularly in acid-based soils. Majority of tree species that fall into the late successional class (shade- tolerant trees) and a conspicuous absence of multiple-stemmed trees (called coppices). Absences of signs of human disturbance (lack of cellar holes, stone- walls, wire fence, roads, stumps). Maintaining or restoring old-growth characteristics as a component of New Hampshire's forest would have many benefits: Maintaining biological diversity. Some species of flora and fauna are more abundant in older forests, and some species are found primarily in old-growth stands. Serving as controls for understanding the impacts of forest management. Providing opportunities for citizens to experience old-growth forests. Contributing natural resource and economic values of which we are not aware. (For example, the Pacific Yew was commonly called a \"trash tree\" until it was discovered to be an important source of taxol, an anti-cancer drug (Kelly and Braasch, 1988). Og/ECTIVE Preserve existing stands of old-growth and restore additional areas where possible. CONSIDERATIONS Managing to retain or develop old-growth characteristics may entail an economic loss to the landowner. Maintaining or restoring old-growth forests requires long-range planning and commitment (150 to 300 years). RECOMMENDED J Survey harvest areas and identify places that exhibit characteristics of PRACTICES old-growth described above. J Avoid harvesting any areas suspected of being old-growth fragments. Page 84 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Four/Chapter Eight: Old Growth Forests J Consider restoring areas of old-growth within managed forests. Places that could be considered for old-growth management include areas already exhibiting some old-growth characteristics, inaccessible or inoperable terrain, or riparian management zones. These areas should be allowed to develop naturally, by letting ecological processes prevail over time (150 to 300+ years). J When permanent areas for old-growth cannot be established, defer cutting 1 to 2 rotations (80 to 160 years) on 2.5% of ownership. This procedure is easy to apply in the field, it doesn't lock up large amounts of forest land, and most importantly, meets the old-growth habitat needs of New Hampshire wildlife (Williamson, 1993).

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 85 Section Four/Chapter Nine: High-Elevation Forests 49 HIGH-ELEVATION FORESTS /WE High-elevation forest land in New Hampshire possesses unique ecological characteristics. High-elevation spruce-fir forests are often characterized by shallow soils, steep slopes, short growing seasons, unique habitat qualities and high visibility. They provide habitat for pine marten, Bicknell's thrush, black-backed woodpeck- er, blackpoll warbler, other species. In order to safe- guard habitat and soils, care must be taken when managing these sites. Traditionally, high-elevation forest land in New Hampshire has been consid- ered as those lands above 2,700 feet. Over eighty percent of high-elevation land in New Hampshire is publicly owned. The remaining high elevation land is in private ownership. Tlie objectives of these owners vary, with timber production being a high priority for some owners. OlUECTIVE Maintain the long-term ecological integrity of high-elevation forests and the systems they influence. CONSlDERATION.5' Most private timberlands above 2,700 feet in elevation are managed under a voluntary agreement between private landowners and the state. The recommendations that follow were derived from this agreement which specifically addresses land above 2,700 feet.* If you own land above this ele- vation and would like information on the agreement, contact the New Hampshire Division of Forests & Lands or the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department. Land below 2,700 feet may exhibit characteristics of high elevation forests. These lands are also characterized by shallow soils, steep slopes, and are often dominated by spruce and fir. They may occur on lower elevations on summits and ridge-lines throughout the state. These practices may be applicable to lower lands; work with professionals to adapt these recommendations to lower elevation sites. RECOMMENDED All Forest Types: PRACTICE9 J Access should be carefully considered, with winter skidding of wood to lower elevation land preferred. J Limit length of material to be skidded. J Schedule harvest for winter conditions. J Perform harvest layout during snow-free conditions. J Avoid removing softwood limbs and tops from the harvest site. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 87 Section Four/Chapter Nine: High-Elevation Forests J Avoid whole-tree harvesting of hardwood tree species. J Retain large live cull or cavity trees. Spruce-Fir Forest Types: J Management on high elevation lands should be directed toward maintaining the proportion of softwood types. J Forest management should be directed toward achieving the following composition and structure goals: At least 60% of the management area should remain in stands with an average tree diameter of 4 inches or greater. No more than 30% of the area should be in stands with an average tree diameter less than 4 inches or without adequate stocking. At least 10% of the area should be designated to remain unharvested.

McEvoy University of Vermont School of Natural Resources and Extension System 1995 Section Five/Chapter One: Regeneration 5.1 REGENERATION: THE RIGHT TREE ON THE RIGHT SITE /'UE Carefully designed regeneration practices help perpetuate desired tree species. Regeneration involves analyzing the capability of the site and deciding what species (or species mix) will meet your objectives. The appropriate practice is then implemented. The objective may be sustained production of certain timber species, valuable wildlife habitat, or other resource conditions. The choice of species to regenerate is limited by site capability, and the presence or absence of advanced regeneration. Sife C8pabj/jty Analysis of site capability will give insight about which species are best adapted to grow on a particular site. Site analysis may be complicated, requiring profes- sional advice. However, some general guidelines are (Leak 1982): SPECIES PREFERRED SITE AND SOIL CONDITIONS White ash (M), Sugar Moderately well-drained and enriched fine-textured maple (T) tills, especially with low acidity. Beech (T) Sandy tills, but common on a wide variety of soils. Red oak (M)* Sandy tills and outwash (but poorly developed here). White pine (M)* Outwash and to a lesser extent on sandy tills. Yellow birch (M) Moderately well-drained, fine-textured tills; also on poorly-drained pan soils in mixture with softwoods. Red spruce (T), hemlock Shallow pan soils, usually poorly drained; outwash (T), balsam fir (T) and lake bed sediments; shallow-to-bedrock soils. Paper birch (I), aspen (I), Adapted to a variety of soils, but often associated red maple (M) with tolerant softwoods. T= shade tolerant, M= intermediate shade tolerance, I= shade intolerant. * Currently found on a variety of soils due to agricultural history. They are generally dipcult to regenerate on some sites. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 91 Section Five/Chapter One: Regeneration Site capability categories have been developed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to correspond with their county soil survey maps. All counties in New Hampshire have been mapped at least once and some coun- ty maps are being updated. NRCS soil capability categories are referred to as Important Forest Soil Groups (IFSG). Advanced The presence of seedlings and/or saplings in the stand is referred to as \"advanced Regenewtion regeneration.\" Often advanced regeneration will determine what species of trees will regenerate in the stand and can reflect the site capability. Some hardwoods such as beech and red maple are very aggressive as advanced regeneration on certain sites. When crushed during timber harvest operations they often sprout profusely. Other hardwoods are not as aggressive and may sprout from small stumps but their future in the stand is less certain. Other species including most softwoods, may be persistent as advanced regeneration but may be easily eliminated from a stand if harvesting practices do not protect them. Most softwoods do not sprout. If advanced regeneration is destroyed during a timber harvest new stems must start over from seed. Many softwood species are slow starters from seed for the first few years, giving hard- woods a head-start in the regeneration process. A lack of advanced regeneration may provide opportunities to establish a desired species group suitable to the site. Measures may be taken to establish the desired species as advanced regeneration, or harvest practices may be designed to encourage pioneer species. Once the management objective is consistent with the site capability, an appropriate regeneration harvest method must be chosen as well as any inciden- tal site preparation practices. Regeneration practices are applied in even-aged stands at the end of the rotation when the stand is mature and ready for final harvest. In uneven-aged stands, regeneration takes place after every harvest cut, but should be carefully evaluated during harvest planning and implementation. O~JECTIVE Select a harvest practice that regenerates desired species rapidly and eco- nomically, consistent with management objectives and site capability. COfl'/DERAT/oflS Natural regeneration is prolific in New Hampshire due to favorable conditions of climate, soil, and native species. As a result, natural regeneration is usually the best option, although seeding or planting may be useful to meet certain objectives. Predation and browsing may impact regeneration success or cause the management objective or harvest method to be revised. Examples include predation on acorns and other seeds from small mammals, deer, turkeys, and insects; browsing from moose, deer, and rabbits; and defoliation of understory pine by gypsy moth. Page 92 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter One: Regeneration The success of regeneration practices can be clearly evaluated only after 5-10 years of observation after the regeneration is well estab- lished. There are no hard and fast rules that will result in successful regeneration of the desired species every time. When timber production is the primary goal, some common tree and shrub species may out-compete more valuable commercial species. Among the common competitive, non-commercial species (hobble- bush, striped maple, ferns and beech sucker growth), hobblebush and ferns are the most serious competitor to commercial species of regener- ation (Leak 1988). RECOMMENDED J Determine the species to regenerate, based on site capability, the PRACTICES presence or absence of advanced regeneration, and long-term timber/ wildlife values and biological and economic risks. J Chose a regeneration method based on the general guidelines below (Frank and Bjorkbom 1973, Lancaster and Leak 1978, Leak et a1 1987). Professional advice is recommended. SPECIES HARVEST METHOD (see iZZustrations) Beech sugar maple, Single-treelsmall group selection (< 114 red spruce*, balsam fir*, acre) or narrow strips (< 50 feet wide) hemlock* White ash, yellow birch, Group selection (114-2 acres) or medium aspen and paper birch (> 213 strips (50-100 feet wide) acre groups), red oak, white pine.

J Minimize beech-suckering by avoiding damage to beech roots by cutting in winter, minimizing skidder traffic especially near cut stumps, and winching. J Reduce shade-tolerant competitive species through heavy cutting (complete removal of all vegetation in groups or larger patches) which converts the stand to earlier-successional species.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 95 Section Five/Chapter Two: Forest Structure 5.2 FOREST STRUCTURE Managing forest structure can help landowners sustain quality timber production and meet a variety of goals. I Forert structure I Forest structure Forest structure is a function of the trees, shrubs, and ground cover found within a forest. Structure, which looks at the proportion of small, medium, and large trees, is usually reported as trees per acre by diameter class. Forests may have a simple structure or they can be very complex. In a simple structure, tree communities are composed of few species and age classes, and most of the tree sizes come close to the average stand diameter. The most extreme example of a simple structure is a plantation. Forests resulting from even-aged regeneration techniques may display a simple structure. As species and or age diversity increases within a stand or forest, structure becomes more complex. Different species often grow at different rates. A distinct canopy is no longer recognizable. Each species or age class exhibits an average stand diameter of its own, and smaller diameter classes may contain more trees per acre than the next larger one. When three or more age classes are present, foresters consider the stand uneven-aged. Wildlife biologists are often interested in structure because of its relationship to biological diversity and wildlife habitat. Other chapters in this publication address these habitat issues. The focus of this chapter is on the role of structure in maintaining a flow of timber products over time. OgJECTIVE Maintain a sustainable flow of quality timber through control of stand/forest structure. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 97 Section Five/Chapter Two: Forest Structure stand ~tructure CONSIDERATIONS Maintaining a balanced stand structure is more practical on larger ownerships. Sustained production of quality timber is sometimes attempted by simple rules such as keeping harvest equal to growth. This is only possible after the stand structure becomes balanced at an optimum level, and may not account for other practices in this publication. Control of stand structure requires appreciable effort, and probably pro- fessional assistance with stand inventory and timber marking practices. Standlforest structure and density guidelines vary by species. General guidelines are given to cover the likely range in conditions. Even-aged stands can provide horizontal diversity (i.e. a variety of forest types and age classes across the landscape) if harvesting is properly controlled. (DeGraaf et al. 1992). Uneven-aged stands often provide a variety of vertical structure (i.e. multiple canopy layers, for example; overstory, mid-story and shrub layers). (DeGraaf et al. 1992). Even-aged stands can provide some vertical structure, particularly when routinely thinned, and uneven-aged stands can provide some horizontal structure, especially when group selection is used. Site factors, such as soil, can influence stand structure. RECOMMENDED Inventory: PRACTICES J Inventory the stand to gather data on the number of trees per acre, average diameter, basal area, and stem quality. Page 98 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter Two: Forest Structure Even-aged management: CROSS REFERENCE J Provide an array of even-aged stands over time using clearcut or shelterwood harvest practices. J Strive for the following percent of acres in seedlinglsapling stands, pole- timber stands and sawlog stands (Frank and Bjorkbom 1973, Lancaster and Leak 1978, Leak et a1 1987): TREE SIZE PERCENT based on rotation ages of about 80 to 120 years (shorter if there is a predominance of short-lived species such as aspen, white birch or balsam fir). J Lower the percents suggested in the above table in seedlinglsapling stands and increase the percents in sawlog and mature stands, when rotation ages are extended for some biodiversity, wildlife or aesthetic goals. Uneven-aged management: J Provide stands with a range in tree sizes using some form of partial cutting such as individual tree selection or group selection. J Harvest trees to adjust stand conditions to within the recommended ranges below. Sustained yield is insured by the ever increasing number of younger trees available in the stand. TREE DIAMETER PERCENT B.A PERCENT NOS. stand contained a basal area of 100 square feet per acre, 40 square feet per acre may represent trees 6-10 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH), 25 square feet may represent trees 12 to 14 inches DBH and 35 square feet may represent trees 16 inches DBH or greater. If the stand contained 100 trees per acre, those same classes may contain 70, 17.5 and 12.5 trees per acre respectively. J Identify, maintain, and regenerate when appropriate, important wildlife habitat inclusions (aspen, soft mast, hemlock, oak raptor nesting trees) as part of uneven-aged management practices.

However, lack of low grade markets, high-grading, and ignorance of proper forestry has resulted in many forests exhibiting timber quality well below the capability of the soil and site. Quality is a function of both tree size and the amount of clear knot-free lumber the tree can produce. Both are heavily influenced by the density of the stand. The density of trees in a forest stand affects tree growth and quality. When the density is too high, tree growth will slow. When the density is too low, growth per acre diminishes and there may be problems with excessive branch- ing. Low stand density interferes with natural pruning and can produce excessive branching resulting in reduced lumber quality. Pruning excess branches is expen- sive but can lead to increased timber quality in the right circumstances. S'fehdDens;tg Stand density, or crowding, is based on tree size (diameter) and the number of trees per acre, and how close they are growing. Foresters usually calculate stand density in terms of basal area. Basal area is a mea- sure of the area of the cross-section of tree at diameter at breast height, or DBH. To picture basal area - imagine that all hf; the trees in a stand were cut off at 4.5 feet above the ground (illustration 1). The area of the top surface of the stump (illustration 2) would be measured to determine the basal area of that tree (illustration 3). Basal , area is usually expressed in square feet. If the basal area of all trees on an acre were added together, the result would be square feet of basal area per acre. It takes several small trees to equal the basal area of a large tree. For example, the basal area of four 6-inch diameter trees equals the basal area of one 12-inch diameter tree. A stand's Illustration 3 density can be adjusted by removing some of the trees h2 through timber management. Different standards apply to I I even-aged and uneven-aged management techniques. When a forest stand is managed for only one or two dis- tinct age classes, it is termed even-aged management. These stands are regenerated by clearcut, shelterwood, or seed-tree cutting methods. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 101 Section Five/Chapter Three: Managing for High-Quality Trees Even-eged The best density for even-aged stands is reflected in stocking guides (see management illustration). These guides assist the timber manager in determining if the forest is stocked too heavily with trees (overstocked), too lightly (under- stocked) or adequately (fully stocked). Stocking guides provide at least two reference lines, an A-line and a B- line. In general, the A-line shows the upper density limit of a naturally devel- oping uncut forest stand, although some stands do become more dense. The B-line estimates the best density for saw- timber growth in the stand. If the stand's density is higher than the B-line, the stand is too crowded and diameter growth will be slow. If density is lower than the B-line the stand is under-stocked, resulting in lower timber growth per acre and ' excessive branchiness (knots in the timber). When density has increased to halfway between the A-line and the B-line, foresters gener- ally reduce the stand's density to the B-line level. This permits enough trees to be cut to provide for a commercial harvest, and increases diameter growth. The trees removed are often the poorest quality stems so that the growth is concentrated on the best quality trees (crop trees). Crop trees may be chosen on the basis of commercial value, aesthetic quality or their contribution to desired wildlife habitat. Since crop trees are the stems most capable of achieving the desired goals, extra con- sideration should be used in deciding what the spacing around these trees should be and how much light these stems receive. In uneven-aged management, forest stands are managed for three or more age classes. This technique simultaneously provides for regeneration, thinning competing trees and harvesting mature timber. In uneven-aged management all diameter classes are represented in the stand. Since the relative proportions of the diameter classes to each other are the same, there is generally one best density range after the harvest. Foresters mark the trees to be cut in the stand to achieve a desired distribu- tion of diameter classes. Diameter classes are used because age is difficult to determine in standing trees. Harvests can be considered when the basal area is at least 30 square feet above the desired distribution (see recommended practices for specifics). OmTIVE Control the growth and quality of forest stands through the maintenance of optimum stand densities. Page 102 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter Three: Managing for High-Quality Trees CONS/DERAT/ON' Crop tree species susceptible to epicormic sprouting (most hardwoods) should be protected from receiving too much light. For those species not prone to epicormic sprouting it may be wise to provide extra light to increase diameter growth. Young stands, where most of the trees to be removed will not produce commercial products, may require non-commercial treatments. These stands may qualify for federal cost share assistance. Pruning also may qualify for federal cost sharing. Contact your county extension forester for more information. The following conditions will affect the optimum residual basal areas in uneven-aged stands: - The time between harvests (cutting cycle - which ranges from 10-25 years). When the cutting cycle is short the density of the remaining forest stand should be on the high end of the suggested density range. This is due to the shorter growing period until the next harvest. When the cutting cycle is long the density of the remaining forest stand after cutting should be on the low end of the suggested range. This is to accommodate the longer period of growth available and to prevent overcrowding within the stand toward the end of the cutting cycle. - Occasionally, the stand density must be decreased to the lower ranges of suggested density to accommodate the harvesting of trees that would otherwise die or deteriorate to unacceptable levels. There are many causes for this such as insect attack and diseases, abiotic factors such as ice damage and drought stress, or uneven distribution of age classes. A dramatic jump in value usually occurs as a tree grows into the sawlog class (greater than 8-10 inches DBH for softwood and greater than 10-12 inches DBH for hardwoods). An even greater jump in value may occur as a tree grows past the 10-18 inch DBH size classes into the prime and veneer grades. The difference in value between a 12 inch DBH sawlog-grade tree and an 18 inch diameter veneer grade tree can be 400-500%. (see illustration). The overall quality of a stand being considered for uneven-aged management may be so low (less than 40 square feet per acre of high quality trees in hard woods and 60 square feet per acre of high quality trees in soft- woods and mixed-woods), that even-aged management of the stand may be a better option (Leak et al. 1987). Professional assistance should be sought in making this determination. Providing a sustainable flow of timber depends on main- taining density, stand structure, and providing for regen- eration. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 103 Section Five/Chapter Three: Managing for High-Quality Trees Growing high quality trees cannot be accomplished through high-grading (removal of best trees) or liquidation (removal of all merchantable trees). Diameter-limit cuts also are not preferred, and, if used, must be carefully designed based on inventory data and use of different limits by species to qualify as a quality-sustaining practice. Stand density varies by the species mix. In using this chapter, remember the following: Hardwood = less than 25% sq. ft. / acre sq. ft. / acre sq. ft. / acre 4 90 5 4 100 8 1 114 100 RECOMMENDED Even-aged management: PRACTICES J Measure the basal area and average stand diameter of the overstory trees only. Leave out the trees that are in the understory and are completely over-topped by other tree crowns. J Follow the density guidelines below. Thin when the density is halfway between A and B. Example: A mixed-wood stand is determined to have an average stand diameter of 8 inches and a basal area of 135 square feet per acre. Locate the average diameter in the first column and follow that row across to the mixed-wood category. Half the distance between the A-line and the B-line would be: (155 + 101) + 2 = 128 square feet per acre. The basal area of the stand presently (135 square feet per acre) is greater than half the distance between the A-line and the B-line. Uneven-aged management: J Measure the basal area of all trees down to 4.5 - 5.0 inches in DBH. (Since uneven-aged stands have a range of tree size, average stand diameter is not used as a guide.) Page 104 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter Three: Managing for High-Quality Trees J Use the following optimum ranges. Schedule a harvest when the basal area exceeds the desired residual basal area by about 30 square feet. Stand Type the range is based on the 1973 spruce fir cutting guide and applies to longer cutting cycles. When considering a white pine stand the minimum residual basal area would be higher. The higher end of the range will maximize growth. Pruning: J Prune in pole-sized stands when crop trees can be well identified. No more than 100 softwood crop trees per acre should be pruned. In hardwoods, no more than 50 to 75 crop trees per acre should be pruned. This number represents how many crop trees can be carried to full maturity in a managed stand and add enough growth of clear, knot-free wood to justify the pruning investment. Trees selected should be 4 to 6 inches in diameter, and never larger than 10 inches. Pruning should follow, rather than precede, thinning. J Keep damage to crop trees at an absolute minimum during harvest operations and document when and where pruning occurred. This will insure that the investment in pruning will be protected.

Damage to standing timber caused during a timber harvest operation is a major concern. Activities associated with felling, winching, and skidding can result in damage to 20 - 40% of the trees left behind (Ostrofsky 1988). Young trees may be bent or broken during felling or crushed by harvesting equipment. Valuable lower trunks of larger trees may be wounded, allowing entry of fungi or insects that cause wood discoloration and decay. Branches and tops may be broken during felling, reducing crown area and eventually stand vigor. Injuries resulting in exposed sapwood wounds of 100 square inches or greater are likely to develop decay (Hesterberg 1957; Lavalle and Lortie 1968). Skidding can cause root damage allowing entry of rot-causing microorganisms. Repeated passes of heavy equipment over certain types of soils, especially during wet conditions, can compact soil air spaces, impeding root growth. Approxi- mately 80% of skidding injuries to residual trees involves bark removal to the butt log (Nyland and Gabriel, 1971). Logging may also combine with other stress factors to make individual trees and eventually stands more susceptible to die-back (Ostrofsky 1988). Poor vigor invites insect and disease. Even though stands may not be physically damaged during logging, the removal of trees may unavoidably reduce the ability of a stand to withstand wind (Smith 1962). O~TIVE Control and minimize logging damage to residual trees during harvest operations. CONSIDERATIONS Some damage is unavoidable. However, research indicates that damage levels to the residual stand of 10% or less is possible by experienced operators (Cline et al. 1991). Minimizing damage depends equally on supervision, careful planning of transportation systems, care in felling, and skidding. Of particular impor- tance is skid road layout. More damage occurs when bark is loose during spring and early summer; however, it is not always possible to avoid harvesting during these times, so extra caution is warranted. Logger training, experience, attitude and motivation are more important than equipment size in minimizing logging damage. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 107 Section Five/Chapter Four: Controlling Logging Damage Certain species (e.g. paper birch and balsam fir) are more susceptible to damage than others. Trees which grow on very dry, wet or windy sites or that have a history of insect or disease attacks are less likely to survive logging damage. RECOM~MENDED Planning Ahead For Damage Control: PRACTIC\u20acS J Plan the locations of skid trails before harvest to accommodate the equipment as well as skidding needs of future harvests. Too many bumper treert poor mad layout Fewer bump treest better road layout Avoid thinning stands during the spring and early summer. Wounds occur more frequently when the bark is loose. Use professional loggers skilled in proper directional felling, winching, and skid- ding procedures. Ask for references. Include contract provisions that provide incentives for loggers to minimize dam- age and impose sanctions in the event of careless damage to the residual stand. When stand conditions warrant, use group or patch cutting to reduce damage to the residual stand. Under this method trees can be felled toward the newly cre- ated opening, rather than the residual stand. J Use equipment appropriate for the size and density of the trees in the stand. Equipment which is too large will increase production costs and damage to the residual stand. Conversely, equipment which is under-sized for handling the timber in a stand can cause considerable damage. J Harvest stands of shallow rooted species in frozen or dry conditions (generally winter north and mid-to-late summer south). J Avoid exposing adjacent uncut stands to I prevailing winds. Page 108 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter Four: Controlling Logging Damage Damage Control During Operations: J Minimize the number of skid trails by winching instead of driving the machine to each individual stump. J Remove or hinge forks and large branches from felled trees before winch- ing or skidding. J The sharper the winching or skidding angle, the shorter the log needs to be. Research shows that damage rates of up to 30% are not uncommon in tree length harvesting (Weinsauer and Mattson 1987). When practical, limit length to 32 feet. J The use of feller buncher type machines with booms, where skidding and felling equipment is restricted to designated skid trails, can greatly reduce damage. J Work around pockets of advanced regeneration. Harvesting when a heavy snow cover is present will help protect small seedlings and saplings. J Monitor the harvest to make sure the operation is being properly conducted.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 109 Section Five/Chapter Five: Clearcutting 5.5 CLEARCUTTING /=LIE Clearcutting is perhaps the most controversial of all forest manage- ment practices. Most resource professionals accept clearcutting as a legitimate tool for the management of timber or wildlife habitat. However, inappropriate or excessive clearcutting can have adverse environmental impacts. As with all forest management activities, clearcutting should only be used for well-defined silvicultural purposes and with consideration of the full range of forest values that may be affected. It is a tool that'must be used carefully, as it creates the most extreme changes to the forest environment of any harvesting technique. There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a clearcut. How- ever, in this region a clearcut is often defined as any harvest that leaves less than 30-45 square feet of residual basal area per acre on a minimum area of 2-5 acres. It is not the intent of this handbook to endorse or condemn the practice, or to answer all questions regarding clearcutting, but rather to suggest guidelines for its use if landowners or the professionals that work with them decide that it is an appropriate method for meeting their objectives. Foresters and wildlife biologists have applied clearcutting for the following purposes (BAG 1993, NHDRED 1995, MCSFM 1996): Regeneration of early successional species such as white birch and aspen (USFS 1986). Regeneration of areas occupied by low-quality stands with limited potential for improvement through partial harvesting. Harvest of stands with a high potential of blowdown or other losses if partially harvested, for example, stands of mature balsam fir. Creation of early successional wildlife habitat; including increases in herbaceous and shrublwoody regeneration layers, soft mast, and associated insects and earthworms that occur in such places (Elliott 1988, Owen and Galbraith 1989; Krusic and Neeful 1996, Santillo et al. 1989; et al. 1987; Vermont Fish and Wildlife Dept 1986; Williamson 1993). Salvage of timber killed or damaged by natural disturbances such as blowdown, fire, insects or disease. Release of adequate, desired advanced regeneration, sometimes referred to as a natural or one-cut shelterwood. Concerns about clearcutting include both site-specific effects and landscape- level effects. Among the primary concerns regarding clearcutting are: By removing most or all of the vegetation on a site, clearcutting may lead to a temporary increase in nutrient loss through leaching (Bormann and Likens 1979). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 11 1 Section Five/Chapter Five: Clearcutting Excessive clearcutting within an individual watershed reduces evapo- transpiration and increases the rate of snowmelt and storm runoff, potentially increasing the size and frequency of floods which can lead to increased erosion or changes in streambed characteristics (Lee 1980, Davies and Sowles 1984). It can take 5-10 years following clearcutting for streamflow to return to pre-harvest levels (Hornbeck et al. 1987). Large and rapid changes in the microclimate of the forest floor (including heating and drying) may adversely affect some herbaceous plants, amphibians, insects, lichens, fungi, mosses, and soil microbes. The time required for these organisms to recover is not well known and may range from a few years to many decades (Chandler 1987, 1991; Chandler and Peck 1992; deMaynadier and Hunter 1995, in preparation; Selva 1994; Strayer et al. 1986, Moffat 1993, Petranka et al. 1993, Meier et al. 1995). Extensive clearcutting reduces the amount of mature or late-successional habitat and correspondingly increases the amount of early successional habitat. The overall effect depends on the forest age class distribution in the surrounding landscape. If there is little mature habitat in the area, clearcutting may further reduce habitat diversity. If, on the other hand, an area is dominated by mature habitat, a certain amount of clearcutting may increase habitat diversity. Extensive clearcutting creates relatively uniform even-aged stands that do not retain diverse structural characteristics. A separate concern involves so-called \"liquidation cuts\", which are clearcuts or heavy partial cuts conducted without consideration of silvi- cultural need. These cuts may remove young or high-quality timber with the potential to grow into higher-value products, and are the most likely to ignore necessary protection for soil, water quality, wildlife habitat, long term forest productivity and other forest values. It is important to distin- guish between these cuts and clearcuts prescribed by professionals for specific silvicultural reasons. OglECTfVE Conduct clearcuts according to recognized silvicultural guide- lines and with appropriate consideration of forest regeneration, soil productivity, water quality, and plant and animal habitat. CONS/DERAT/ONS There is little agreement on the recommended maximum size for clearcuts. However, the two largest public ownerships in the state (the White Mountain National Forest and Nash Stream State Forest) limit clearcuts to 30 acres (USFS 1986, NHDRED 1995b). Some industrial owners operate under self-imposed limits of between 20-75 acres. Page 112 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter Five: Clearcutting RECOMMENDED J PRACTICES J The impact of clearcutting on some forest values, such as wildlife habitat, will depend on the nature and condition of the surrounding landscape over which a landowner may have little control. Due to ecological and social concerns, clearcutting should be used only where other silvicultural methods will not meet landowner objectives. Clearcuts should be planned and conducted with the assistance of profes- sionals. Layout of clearcuts must give full consideration to the landscape in which the cut occurs as well as any necessary site protection or mitigation measures. Clearcuts should be planned as part of an overall forest management strategy designed to maintain a sustainable balance of forest structures, age classes, and habitats across the landscape. Carefully consider how the site will be regenerated prior to harvest. Clearcuts should be avoided in the following areas: - Slopes > 35% - Thin organic soils on top of bedrock (\"duff soils\") - Soils classified in Natural Resources Conservation Service soil surveys as having severe erosion hazard - Riparian management zones (except for specific wildlife management purposes) - In or around seeps, or vernal pools - In highly visible or aesthetically sensitive areas Clearcuts should be separated by a manageable stand of at least the width of the area being harvested. This stand should be maintained with at least 70% crown closure or full stocking as recommended in silvicultural guides. Clearcuts should retain snags and patches of mature live trees for wildlife habitat. Minimize soil disturbance by careful adherence to Best Management Practices for Control of Soil Erosion. (Appendix C) Carefully consider the aesthetic impact of the proposed harvest. Use the visual quality protection techniques described in Chapter 6.5.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 115 Section Five/Chapter Six: Insects, Diseases and Wind Damage 5.6 INSECTS, DISEASES AND WIND DAMAGE /=UE Forests in New Hampshire are stressed by many existing insects and diseases, and others (e.g. hemlock woolly adelgid) threaten to become epidemic in the future. Many insect, disease and wind factors are difficult to control or predict. However, excessive damage from insects, diseases or wind results in severe eco- nomic loss and discourages investment in forest land and management practices. Impacts vary with the cause. Periodic gypsy moth defoliation causes growth and quality losses, reduced mast crops, and increased mortality of oaks, white pine and hemlock. White pine weevil attacks top leaders of white pine, causing deformity of the stem and appreciable loss of value. Beech-bark disease begins with bark infestations by a white scale insect followed by infection with a disease organism (Nectria) that causes mortality or bark and stem disfiguration of beech, as well as reduced beechnut crops. Spruce budworm becomes epidemic at wide- spread intervals, causing repeated defoliation, top-killing, and mortality of over- mature fir and associated spruce. High winds blow over or break trees or cause root damage. Although hurri- cane-size storms are infrequent in New England, damaging wind storms can be expected every 15-30 years (Leak et a1 1994). Species and forest cover types vary greatly in resistance to wind damage. White pine is most susceptible; losses of up to 80% of the volume were reported from the 1938 hurricane. Associated hemlock trees also were heavily damaged. Spruce-fir (especially the fir) is next in susceptibility to losses from wind damage. Northern hardwoods are least dam- aged; the 1938 hurricane produced losses of about 10-20%, even in stands that were hard hit. Factors other than cover type also are important: exposure to wind (noticeable in the mountain notches that characterize central and northern New Hampshire), soil depth and soil moisture (shallow and wet soils are worst), stand age (large, overmature stands most susceptible), and stand density (heavily thinned stands most at risk). OBJECTIVE Reduce mortality, growth loss, and defect due to insects, diseases, and wind damage. CONSIDERA TIONS There are well-recognized benefits from the natural-disturbance factors listed above including the provision of dead and down woody debris wildlife trees, and openings for regeneration. While native pests are part of natural functioning of ecosystems, many of the most destructive insect and disease problems occurring in New Hampshire are the result of exotic pests introduced into the state. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 11 7 Section Five/Chapter Six: Insects, Diseases and Wind Damage Control of beech bark disease often means removing infected trees. This recommendation may conflict with recommenda- tions for protection of mast-producing beech that show evidence of bear use. While predators such as birds cannot control outbreaks, they provide important constraints on insects at endemic population levels, and can extend the period of time between outbreaks (Holling 1973, Reichert in Allen and Hoekstra 1992). State law (RSA 227-K:3) allows the director of the Division of Forests & Lands to designate control areas when localized infestations of exotic, non-native insects or diseases threaten to spread to adjacent lands. The law also requires landowners to undertake actions to control the infestation; if the land- owner is unwilling, the State may take such actions. The emphasis in this section is on silvicultural methods that may limit undue losses on individual ownerships. Where severe infestations from insects are already under- way, regional biological or chemical control programs may be necessary. Maintenance of populations of native preda- tor species will help reduce intensity of infestation. RECOMMENDED Gypsy Moth (introduced): PRACTICES J Over the long term, limit susceptibility to defoliation by reducing the percent of basal area of tree species preferred by the gypsy moth (Gottschalk 1993). Preferred species include: oaks, paper and gray birch, aspens. Less preferred species include: most northern hardwoods, pines, hemlock. Immune species include: white ash, balsam fir. PREFERRED SPECIES (O/o) RELATIVE SUSCEPTIBILITY 0-20 Low 20-50 Moderate 50-80 High 80-100 Very High J Maintain crop trees with large crowns, dense foliage, few dead branches, and minimal epicormic sprouting (Gottschalk and MacFarlane 1993). J If stand defoliation has occurred, wait 3 years before choosing a silvi- cultural course of action (regeneration, thinning, salvage), since the extent of mortality will become evident during that time period (Gottschalk 1993). J Provide habitats that favor predators of Gypsy moth: black-billed and yellow-billed and masked shrews, red-backed vole Page 118 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Five/Chapter Six: Insects, Diseases and Wind Damage and white-footed mouse. Examples include: thickets of regeneration and shrubs for cuckoos and towhees and large dead logslbranches on the ground for small mammals (Smith 1985, 7'hurber et a1 1994). White Pine Weevil (native): J Grow white pine seedlings and saplings in shade (40-80 square feet of basal area or in small openings less than one tree height in diameter) until at least one unweeviled log height (18 feet) is attained. Conifer shade may provide more protection than hardwood shade since early spring weevil activity (before hardwood leaves are out) is the most damaging to terminals. In addition to the direct effects of shade, overstory trees reduce the size and vigor of the leader, making it less attractive to weevils (Houseweart and Knight 1986). J In young even-aged stands experiencing weevil damage, maintain high stand density to minimize the deformations caused by weevil injury. An approximate spacing of less than 6 feet by 6 feet is required for maximum effect (Graber 1986). Beech-bark Disease (introduced): J Some beech trees, recognized by their clean, smooth boles with a minimal presence of the white woolly scale, are resistant to the beech scale insect that precedes infection by the Nectria fungus (Houston 1982). Remove non- resistant trees and encourage regeneration of the resistant. Leave trees with recent evidence of bear claw marks. J In partial cutting operations (thinnings, selection cuts), remove trees that are heavily infested with the white, woolly scale and/or red, small fruiting bodies of the Nectria fungus, including those rough-barked trees that show evidence of previous beech-bark damage. To minimize regeneration by root suckers from these nonresistant trees, avoid damage (even slight damage) to beech roots by logging on snow and keeping skidding activity away from the cut beech trees to the extent possible. When the clean-barked, resistant trees are removed, encourage root-suckering by logging during snow-free season and allowing moderate skidding activity near these resistant trees or groups of trees @ersonal communication: D. Houston, NEFES and J. Ecker, Maine BPL). (native): J Preferred food sources of the spruce budworm are balsam fir and white spruce (Maclean 1980). Spruce budworm is most destructive and epidemic in 60 to 80 year old stands with a high proportion of balsam fir. Although silvicultural controls of the budworm are somewhat limited in effectiveness, the best approaches for avoiding serious damage are (1) to harvest fir stands prior to over-maturity, (2) to encourage higher spruce-to-fir ratios through regeneration practices and early cultural work, (3) to break up extensive stands of fir and spruce-fir with intervening stands of hardwood or mixed- wood provided that management objectives and site conditions permit (Baskerville,. 1975, van Raalte 1972), and (4) to encourage budworm preda- tors. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 119 Section Five/Chapter Six: Insects, Diseases and Wind Damage J At least 49 bird species are known to prey on budworm pupae, and 11 species are considered important predators at low to moderate levels (Jennings and Crawford 1985). The most effective predators include: (1) in mature conifer mixtures yellow-rumped warbler, and red-breasted - Nashville warbler, white-throated spar- row, and black-capped chickadee; and (3) in somewhat open, immature conifer stands and hardwood regeneration - magnolia warbler and solitary vireo (Crawford et al. 1983). Wind Damage: J Landowners can limit their losses from wind (especially in areas with a history of wind damage) by: - Maintaining a diverse forest of mixed species to spread the risk; especially by limiting the acreage in susceptible types such as mature white pine on wet soils. - Limiting partial harvests in susceptible stands to no more than 113 of the basal area, and perhaps leaving an uncut buffer on the windward side of the stand (Frank and Bjorkbom 1973). - Orienting strip cuts at right angles to the prevailing winds if possible.

If roads are built during dry seasons, they are cheaper to construct and look much nicer. Operating on frozen ground that has a good snow cover will result in less damage to the soil, ground cover, seedlings, and the residual trees, which often translates into a better looking job. Many outdoor recreational activities take place during specific seasons of the year. Harvesting activities that are sched- uled to avoid peak use will help to minimize potential conflicts. OgJECTlvE Minimize visual and audible impacts of forest management activities by scheduling such activities during the appropriate seasons of the year and during lower levels of recreational use. CONSIDERATIONS Bark on trees is very tender and easily damaged from first bud break through mid-July. Many aesthetic concerns are exacerbated during wet conditions. Tourism and recreation are an important part of the state's economy that depend upon an attractive forest background. Many outdoor activities take place during specific seasons of the year. RECOMMENDED Before the Harvest: PRACTICES' J Because many aesthetic concerns are caused by running water and soil erosion, limit or prohibit access during mud season when road or skid trails are especially susceptible to damage. J Minimize the impact on sensitive sites by limiting harvests to dry or frozen ground conditions. J Avoid thinning stands during the late springlearly summer, when the bark is still soft and vulnerable to damage. J When operating near residential areas reduce the impact of noisy equipment, by modifying working hours, shutting down idling equipment, reducing truck noise (by using lower rpm's) to and from the landing, and consider using equipment with noise-reducing features. J Notify abutters or others that may be impacted by the harvest, so that they are aware of the details. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 125 Section Six/Chapter One: Timing of Forest Management Activities During the Harvest: J Supervise the job on a regular basis so that problems can be identified and solved in a timely fashion. J Avoid operating during or immediately following prolonged periods of wet weather.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Six/Chapter Two: Truck Roads and Skid Trails 6.2 TRUCK ROADS AND SKID TRAILS ISSUE Permanent truck roads and skid trails can create some of the most visually dramatic and permanent changes in a woodlot. They can also be the greatest expense of a timber harvest. Construction and use of truck roads demands careful planning to reduce cost and to min- imize the impact. When truck and skid roads are built and used during the dry season (on some sites, frozen ground may be preferable, especially for temporary winter use), they hold up better, look neater, erode less, and are less expensive to construct and use. Cutting and removing trees on the road right-of-way in advance of bulldozing results in better looking roads. OgjECTlVE Reduce visual impacts associated with the design, construction, use, maintenance, and closure of forest access roads and skid trails. CONSIDERATIONS Frequency of access, amount of anticipated traffic, seasons during which access is required, and safety concerns affect the number, type and layout of forest access roads. The limited road-construction season generally coincides with the tourist season in many recreationally-sensitive areas. Shielding the location of new roads from highway view may impact ecologically-sensitive areas. Building forest access roads to accommodate visual quality concerns - or using existing roads that require traveling greater distances - may involve increased costs. Traffic during wet periods can increase maintenance needs and create unsightly ruts and mudholes. Roads provide access for undesirable activities such as dumping and/or undesirable traffic that could damage roads. Leave damaged bumper trees for future protection or as future cavity trees. Post-harvest use of roads by all-terrain vehicles can have negative aesthetic impacts. State laws must be observed when constructing or using roads. The state or towns may hold landowners, loggers, or foresters responsible for damage to public roads. RECOMMENDED Design/Planning: PRACTICES J Consult Best Management Practices for Erosion Control (Appendix C) when constructing new or upgrading existing roads. Consult the Good Forestry in the Granite State Page 127 Copyright 1997 Section Six/Chapter Two: Truck Roads and Skid Trails Natural Resources Conservation Service or the county extension forester for help and the availability of federal cost-share funds. J Near public highways, reduce visibility by curving access roads. J Look for opportunities to create scenic vistas. J Minimize the number of roads approaching highways or recreation areas. J Install a gate or block access with boulders or other obstacles, to keep vehicles off roads during and after use. Post signs that help send a positive stewardship message, yet restrict harmful uses. J Designate \"bumper trees\" along skid trails and on sharp turns to minimize damage to the residual trees. Construction & Use: J When constructing a new road, if stumps cannot be trucked or buried, push them off the road and leave in an upright position. Stumps left in this manner look more natural. Hardwood stumps often sprout, which helps to further soften their impact. J Slash from roads and trails should be disposed of without filling vernal pools or cultural features such as old cellar holes. J Utilize merchantable timber within road clearings. J When upgrading existing roads, clear trees and brush along roads for only the minimum essential width needed for basic construction, maintenance, and traffic needs. Limit the number and length of truck roads. J Avoid tracking mud onto highways by using clean fill, wood chips, or mats, etc. on truck roads from landing to highway. J Check state and local regulations pertaining to gravel operations. When using on site gravel (borrow) pits: J Locate borrow pits and crushing operations out of the visible corridor as much as possible. J Screen pits from travel routes or recreation areas using existing vegeta- tion or landscape berms. Avoid facing them directly toward the road. J Have a plan for how the gravel will be taken out and the area rehabilitated. J Rehabilitate pits upon completion of use as per guidelines in RSA 155-E. J Regularly inspect roads and trails, and maintain as necessary. J Shape and seed ditches and exposed areas to avoid erosion and to improve visual impact and place waterbars as recommended in the BMP's.

Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 129 Section Six/Chapter Three: Landings 6.3 LANDINGS /DUE The portion of a timber sale where neatness and organization is the most noticeable is the landing - the nerve center of every logging operation. Landings are cleared areas where timber is brought from the woods, sorted and stored until it is trucked to a market. Many times landings are located beside the road. People often judge the quality of a timber harvest by the appearance of the landings, both during and after the harvest, without ever stepping into the woods. While economics and logistics may dictate certain location requirements, equal thought should be given to the impact of merging people and machinery on these openings in the woods. A clean, properly sized, well-organized landing, will help improve productivity, provide a safer work environment, reduce clean- up costs, and will draw positive attention from the public. OUECTIVE Minimize the impact of landing operations on the traveling public and recreational users, both during and after the operation. CONSIDERATIONS The volume of timber to be cut and the need to sort logs by species and/or products often dictate landing size. Topography and location of timber can limit the placement and number of landings. The proximity of harvest to highways or high-use areas can affect the placement of landings. The placement and size of landings may depend upon additional uses such as parking, camping, wildlife openings or future harvest operations. Landing clean-up and seeding practices will increase costs. RECOMMENDED Before the Harvest: PRACTICES J Consult Best Management Practices for Erosion Control (Appendix C) when planning landings. J Plan landings to access future sales. J If possible, avoid landings within view of travel routes, recreation, or residential areas. Consider a short, curved road to landings. J In extremely sensitive areas, consider leaving a buffer of 150 feet or more between landings and major roads, recreational trails, rivers, and residential areas. J Keep the number of landings to a minimum, and size landings to accommodate products and equipment needs. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 131 Szction Six/Chapter Three: Landings J Reduce clean-up costs by identifying disposal areas for blocks and other debris in advance. Push unmercliantable debris into those areas over the course of the job. Blocks, stumps and other woody debris from on site logging operations buried on site are exempt from New amp shire Department of Environmental Services permitting requirements for stump dumps. During the Harvest: J Organize landings to accommodate sorting, processing, and short-term storage and to allow safe movement of workers and equipment. Remove wood on a regular basis, especially in high-visibility areas. J Minimize the amount of wood waste on the landings, through good utilization, and by cutting and leaving unmerchantable sections in the woods or hauling unused blocks back to the woods. J Treat any slash at landings as soon as possible. J Avoid using landings that evolve into one continuous zone along roadsides. J Limit the number of skid trails entering and leaving the landing in order to minimize the amount of disturbance. J Remove and properly dispose of all trash, motor oil, and other refuse from the landing daily. After the Harvest: J When the job is done, clear landings of all debris by burying, trucking it to another location or pil- ing it. Level and smooth the ground. Plant with recommended seed mix only if necessary to sta- bilize the soil, for wildlife, or for appearance. Otherwise, let natural vegetation establish itself. Contact the Natural Resources Conservation Service for information on site specific seeding prescriptions. CROD REFERENCE Permanent Openings 3.2. LITERATURE Jones, G. T. 1993.

Page 132 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Six/Chapter Four: Slash Disposal 6.4 SIASU DISPOSAL I'UE Unlopped tops (slash) can be particularly unsightly. When the presence of tops on the ground is not properly addressed, their appearance is one of the first things that people criticize. Such appearance is not important to the public alone. Many landowners are concerned about the impact that logging will have on the recreational and aesthetic use of their forest. Studies and experience demonstrate that top lopping will help to significantly increase the aesthetic recovery rate for most timber sale areas. OB~E(JT/VE Minimize the visual impacts of slash. (JoNS/DER,~T/ONS Slash is unavoidable when harvesting timber. Slash near roads, lakes, streams, and property boundaries is subject to special regulation under the slash law, RSA 227-J:10. Briefly stated, this law requires that slash be removed from within 25 feet of a property line; from within 50 feet of any great pond or body of water greater than 10 acres, public highway or active railroad bed; and 100 feet of any occupied structure. Slash helps to maintain soil on site and protect developing seedlings from temperature extremes and over-browsing by deer. Slash can benefit wildlife by creating micro- habitats for small mammals, birds, and other species. Slash treatment has an associated cost and, when done manually, can be dangerous to the operator. Maximum utilization of merchantable wood conflicts with recommended practices regard- ing dead and down woody debris. Slash provides soil nutrients. The branches, twigs, leaves, and needles of trees contain a higher percentage of nutrients than the trunk of a tree. On some sensitive sites, it may be more important to leave this biomass for nutrient recycling, instead of removing it. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Slash can be a fire hazard. Page 133 Section Six/Chapter Four: Slash Disposal RECOMMENDED J Eliminate or minimize slash consistent with the slash law, PRACTICES RSA 227-J:10. J Lop tops to a height of 2 feet or less within 50 feet of a recreational trail. In some instances it may be desirable to pull the tops back 50 feet or more before they are lopped. Otherwise lop tops 4 feet or less above the ground throughout the harvested area. J In areas where the presence of slash is a visual quality problem, consider using mechanized operations that remove slash and low- grade wood that has traditionally been left behind.

Page 134 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Six; Chapter Five: Aesthetics of Clearcutting 6.5 AESTHETICS OF CLEARCUTTING IEUE Clearcutting is a forest management practice that causes sudden and drastic visual change to a forest. Public concern about the visual impacts of clearcutting has lead to develop- ment of systematic scenery management techniques, some of which have been in use for 15-20 years, or longer. Concerns often relate to size, arrangement and amounts of clearcutting, the effects of which may be tempered by patterns in vegetation, landform and rockform. Recent studies in mountainous terrain, including public opinion, contribute to further understanding of the visual impacts of clearcutting. It was found, for example, that while many people have favored smaller sized patches, a size of 10-14 acres viewed from 2-5 miles appar- ently has less impact on scenic value than smaller (eg 4-5 acre) or larger (20-30 acre) harvest areas. Also, while effects on scenic values increase as more clearcut harvesting occurs, the greatest impact is the change from no harvest to 1% removal per decade (Gobster, et al. 1995). OHECTIVE Minimize the negative visual impact of clearcuts in high visibility areas. CONSIDERATIONS The visual impact of a clearcut area will vary depending upon the size, shape, location, and time of year it is viewed. Clearcuts are most unsightly in the first few years following the harvest. Aesthetic impact decreases as the /I area regenerates. / / I Aesthetic considerations may con- flict with other forest management goals such as creation of early suc- cessional habitat. RECOMMENDED PRACTICES (/ In visually sensitive areas, harvest in multiple stages. (/ Leave patches (or islands) of varying Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 135 Section Six/Chapter Five: Aesthetics of Clearcutting sizes and shapes of trees to break-up the cut area and reduce apparent size. d Keep openings into harvest area narrow to limit view from public roads, lakes and rivers, or recreation areas (see illustration previous page). d Utilize natural terrain to minimize apparent size. d Shape clearcuts to resemble natural openings where ownership patterns allow and by integrating more partial harvest treatments along roadsides and highly visible slopes (Maine Council on Sustainable Forest Management, 1 996). d Avoid long straight edges for harvest bounds that intersect with roads at hard angles, or that are visible from roads or water bodies (Maine Council on Sustainable Forest Management, 1996). d Maintain an uncut or partially cut buffer of 150' along recreational trails and in residential areas, as well as the roads and streams required by the basal area law. d When cutting next to a highway: - Adhere to the basal area law (RSA 227-J:9). - Avoid operating during mud season; follow all Best Management Practices for Erosion Control (Appendix C). - Obtain maximum utilization of all merchantable wood. - Lop tops and keep evenly distributed, or remove and chip, if economically feasible. - Keep stumps low. - Eliminate whips, bent saplings, and broken trees. d Design clearcuts to take into account slope, topography, existing vegetation patterns, and principle viewing points.

Page 136 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Section Six/Chapter Six: Cultural Resources 6.6 CULTURAL RESOURCES (adapted from Stone walls and Cellarholes) ISlSUE Cultural resources can be inadvertently damaged during logging operations. Cultural resources are the evidence left by people who once inhabited the land. Knowing about these resources can provide an impor- tant link to the past. They also may be of religious significance, provide information to archeologists, be of interest to the local histori- cal society, or provide an attraction for visitors. In New Hampshire, cultural resources may include stone walls, cellar holes, sugar shacks, logging camps, old dam sites, or cemeteries. Cultural resources include archeological sites such as Native American ceremonial grounds, or the trash dump of an old farmhouse. Landscapes can also be resources, generally a combination of structures and sites that give a sense of a time or lifestyle. Old farmsteads with fields and apple orchards and lilac bushes are a good example. The key to protecting cultural resources is to be able to identify clues on the ground, and plan management activities accordingly. O&ECTII/E Protect cultural resources during harvesting operations. CONSIDERATIOMS In some cases it may be impossible not to damage a site. In these instances it is important to photograph the site and mark its location on a map for future historians. Native American sites and cemeteries have certain legal protections, see RSA 227-C. Stone walls along scenic roads also may have legal protection, depending on whether your town has designated the road as scenic under RSA 231:157-158. Stone walls that serve as boundaries are protected under RSA 472:6. RECOMMENDED J When property is being evaluated for timber resources, include cultural PRACTICES resource locations and issues. Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 137 Section Six/Chapter Six: Cultural Resources J Determine the management strategy to be used around the cultural fea- ture. It may include: - No disturbance - Minimal disturbance, felling but no equipment - Minimal disturbance, light equipment or operations on frozen ground - Contact the New Hampshire Division of Cultural Resources at 603-271-2394 for additional advice - Flag the area and show contractor and crew the areas to protect J Do not pile slash or garbage in cellar holes, quarry sites, or other depressions with historic significance. Fell trees away from any structures. J Avoid skidding over stone-faced bridges or culverts. If existing roads and bridges are to be used, use a deck to cover old culverts. J If stone walls must be crossed, use existing openings (barways) when possible. If new openings need to be made, limit the number of crossings, cut only the minimum width necessary. Restore the wall when work is completed or leave open for future use. J Protect wells by installing concrete well covers whenever possible. CROSS REFERENCE Permanent Openings 3.2.

Minimizing conflicts between timber harvesting and recreation use can leave visitors with a positive impression of forest management. OBJECTIVE Minimize the negative visual and audi- ble impacts of timber harvesting in or near areas of high recreational use. CONSIDERA TIONS Scheduling a timber harvest during low use may not coincide with the best season to operate. Recreational use of private forest land can conflict with forest management activities. Many liiking trails use old logging routes, while many logging roads often become new hiking trails. RECOMMENDED J Before the harvest, erect'signs to inform, educate, and/or warn recreational PRACTICE users regarding management issues, harvesting activities, and safety concerns. J Notify abutters, recreation officials, conservation commissions, or others that may be impacted by the harvest, so that they are aware of the details. Consider having a local newspaper run a story on the sale. J Leave large attractive trees in high-use public areas. J Lay out skid trails and logging roads with future recreational use in mind so that they can be easily incorporated into trail systems. J Leave buffer zones along recreational trails. Limit the number of skid road crossings, keeping them at right angles to the hiking trails when possible. J Lop tree tops 2 feet or less in high-use areas. Otherwise lop tops 2 to 4 feet above the ground throughout the harvested area. (Where deer severely disrupt natural regeneration, leave slash higher to protect new seedlings. Contact the New Hampshire Fish & Game Department for more information). Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page 139 Section Six/Chapter Seven: Timber Harvesting in High-Use Recreation Areas J Conduct disruptive phases of management operations, such as road or landing construction, during periods of low recreational use. J When harvesting operations cannot avoid peak recreational use, consider the following: - Temporarily relocate trails away from management activity areas. - Reduce the impact of noisy equipment by modifying working hours, shut down idling equipment, reducing truck noise (by using lower rpm's) to and from the landing, and consider using equipment with noise-reducing features. J Limit skidding on recreational trails, where practical. J Protect recreational trails that are impacted by skidding from soil ero- sion, leave free from woody debris, smooth ruts, and seed as necessary. J Monitor the job on a regular basis so that problems can be identified and solved in a timely fashion. J Consider inviting the public to tour your woodlot to learn more about harvesting operations.

Ephemeral Existing for a short time; short lived. Epieormic sprouting Small branches occuring on the stem and branches of some tree species, as a response to increased light often from thinning or removal of sub- stantial portions of the tree crown. Even-aged management A timber management system that results in the creation of stands in which trees of essen- tially the same age grow together. Regeneration in a particular stand is obtained during a short period at or near the time that a stand has reached the desired age or size for regeneration and is har- vested. Cutting methods pro- ducing even aged stands are: (1) clearcutting; (2) patch clearing (3) strip clearcutting (4) shelterwood; and (5) seed tree. 1) Clearcutting: an even- aged cutting method where- by most or all trees within a given area are removed in one cutting which leads to the establishment of an even-aged forest or stand. Reproduction of the new stand, either artificial or natural, is secured after cut- ting. Modifications of the clearcutting method include: patch clearcutting and strip clearcutting 2) Patch Clearcutting: a modification of the clearcutting method where the area being treated is removed in a series of clearcuts made in patches. Often employed to regener- ate even aged stands which cannot be reproduced by natural seeding if all trees are removed in a single cut- ting. 3) Strip Clearcutting: a modification of the clearcutting method where the area being treated is removed in a series of clearcuts made in strips. Trees on the uncut strips furnish all or part of the seed for stocking the cut strips, and protect the cutover area and the new crop. The width of the cut strips depends on the dis- tance of effective seed dis- persal, usually not exceed- ing 5 times tree height. 4) Shelterwood: a series of two or three harvests that gradually open the stand and stimulate natural repro- duction of a new even aged stand. 5) Seed Tree Method: an even-aged cutting method that removes most of the trees in one cutting except for a small number of trees left singly or in small groups to serve as a seed source for the establishment of regen- eration. Even-aged stand All trees are the same age or at least of the same age class. A stand is considered even-aged if the difference in age between the oldest and youngest trees does not exceed 20 percent of the length of the rotation. From an ecological view- point, the minimum size of an uneven aged stand could be considered as the size of the largest opening entirely under the influence of adja- cent mature timber. The opening of critical size might be that which, at the very center, exhibited the same temperature regime as any larger opening. Such an opening is probably about twice as wide as the height of the mature trees. Forb An herb other than grass. Ford A structure built for crossing a stream. Forester A person trained in the science of developing, caring for and cultivating forests. Forest management The application of business methods and technical forestry principles to a forest property to produce desired values, resource uses, products, or services from a forest (see Forest sustainability). Page G2 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Glossary Forest type A natural group or association of different species of trees which commonly occur together over large area. Forest types are defined and named after one or more dominant species of trees in the type. Forest sustainability The capacity of a forest to pro- duce the goods we desire today without compromising the productive capability and bological integrity on which future generations will depend. &oup selection See uneven-aged management. H igh-gradi ng An exploitive logging practice that removes only the best, most accessible and mar- ketable trees in the stand. Hydrology The properties, distribution, and circulation of water on the surface of the land, in the soil and underlying rocks, and in the atmosphere. l n tegrated resource management The simultaneous considera- tion of various disciplines to balance competing demands on a natural system to main- tain or enhance its health, diversity, and cultural and aes- thetic value. vest site for further processing and transport. Lopping Cutting off branches, tops and small trees after felling, into lengths such that the resultant slash will lie close to the ground. Overstory The upper crown canopy of a forest, usually stated in refer- ence to the largest trees. Patch cleatcutting See even aged management Plantation A stand of trees that has been planted or direct seeded. Pole timber A DBH size-class representing trees that are usually more than 4.0 inches DBH and less than 10.0 inches DBH. Predation The act of capturing and kil- lling other animals for food. Regeneration The renewal of a stand of trees either by natural or artificial means. Residual trees Trees that are left to grow in the stand following a silvicul- tural treatment. Landing Revegeta tion A place where trees and logs The re-establishment of vege- are gathered in or near a har- tation on bare soil by natural or artificial means. Rotation The age at which a stand is considered ready for harvest. RSA Revised Statutes Annotated, the compilation of the laws of the State of New Hampshire. Sapling Trees that are more than 4.5 feet tall but less than 5.0 inch- es DBH. sawlog A log considered suitable in size and quality for producing lumber. scarification Loosening topsoil, or breaking up the soil, in preparation for regeneration by planting, direct seeding or natural seed- fall. seedlings Trees that are less than 4.5 feet tall. seed tree method See even-aged management. Seep A spot where groundwater oozes slowly to the surface, forming a small pool. selection harvesting The removal of trees, either as single scattered individuals or Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Page C3 Glossary in small groups, at relatively short intervals, repeated indef- initely, so that the continuous establishment of reproduction is encouraged and an uneven- aged stand is maintained. sheltetwood See even-aged management silvicultute The art and science of manag- ing a forest. Single ttee selection See uneven-aged management. site index A measure of the relative pro- ductive capacity of an area based on tree height growth. Site pteparation Removal of unwanted vegeta- tion and other material, fol- lowed by cultivation as prepa- ration for the planting or seed- ing of trees. Site preparation may include removal of slash and other debris, removal or control of competing vegeta- tion, or exposure of bare soil. size class Descriptive term defining the most common tree size in a stand, for example poletimber or saw-timber stand. slash The residue left on the ground after felling, lopping, storm, fire, girdling or poisoning. It includes nonmerchantable portions of trees, such as stumps, broken branches, dead trees and other debris left on the ground. Snag A standing dead tree generally left for wildlife management purposes. stand A group of trees reasonably similar in age structure and species composition as to be distinguishable from adjacent areas. Stocking An indication of the number of trees in a stand as compared to the optimum number of trees to achieve some manage- ment objective, usually improved growth rates or tim- ber values. Strip cut See even-aged management. succession The orderly and predictable replacement of one plant com- munity by another over time in the absence of disturbance. Supracanopy ttees Super dominant trees whose crowns protrude above the main crown canopy. sustainable fotest management See forest sustainability. Sustained yield An annual or periodic output of products from the forest, that does not impair the pro- ductivity of the land, generally harvesting equal to growth. Timber stand improvement (TSI) Silvicultural activities that improve the composition, con- stitutioii, condition and growth of a timber stand. Uneven aged ma nagemen t The application of actions needed to maintain a continu- ous high-forest cover, recur- ring regeneration of desirable species, and the orderly growth and development of trees through a wide range of ages and sizes to provide a sus- tained yield of forest products. Cutting methods that develop and maintain uneven-aged stands include: (1) single tree selection; and (2) group selec- tion. 1) Single tree selection: removal of trees as either single, scattered individuals or in exceedingly small groups at relatively short intervals, repeated indefi- nitely, by encouraging the continuous establishment of reproduction and main- taining an uneven-aged stand. 2) Group selection: period- ic removal of trees in small groups producing openings smaller than the minimum feasible acreage for a single stand under even-aged man- agement leading to the for- mation of an uneven-aged stand with a mosaic of small and variable sized age class groups. Differing from sin- Page G4 Good Forestry in the Granite State Copyright 1997 Glossary gle tree selection in that the predominant characteristics of the group rather than the individual stems, are evalu- ated for treatment. Uneven-aged stand A stand of trees that contains at least three well defined age classes intermingled on the same area. Vernal pool An ephemeral body of water that fills in the spring, holds water for at least 10 days, and dries up by fall in some or all years and that does not con- tain fish. Windfirm The ability of the root system of a tree to withstand wind pressure and keep the tree upright. Windrow Slash, residue and debris raked together into piled rows.

With a common understanding of the risks and through the use of this publication, the forest industry, landowners, and the government working together can protect our state's water resources. This publication is primarily a reference and training tool designed to help foresters and loggers become better informed about the best management practices for reducing soil erosion and controlling sedimentation from timber harvesting activities. When using this publication, it is important to remember that for every situation encountered, there may be more than one correct method to prevent erosion and sedimentation. Flexibility and understanding are important, since the intent of any best management practice is to keep sediment out of the streams. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author has drawn freely from the publications listed in the reference section and received assistance and suggestions from county, state, and federal foresters as well as the forest industry. The reader is urged to consult these publications if detailed information beyond the scope of this publication is desired. When needed, help and advice for the implementation of the Best Management Practices can be obtained from any of the agencies listed in the Available Assistance Section. Your comments about this publication are welcome. Assistance in the preparation of this publication was contributed by: State of New Hampshire - Department of Resources & Economic Development Division of Forests and Lands State of New Hampshire - Department of Environmental Services Water Supply and Pollution Control Division Water Resources Division Wetlands Bureau University of New Hampshire Cooperation Extension USDA - Natural Resource Conservation Service USDA - Forest Service - White Mountain National Forest USDA - Forest Service - State and Private Forestry New Hampshire Timberland Owners' Association Numerous professional loggers and foresters who have reviewed drafts DEFINITIONS Best Management Practices - Proper methods for the control and dispersal of water on truck roads, skid trails, and log landings to minimize erosion and reduce sediment and temperature changes in streams. Bog - A low-lying area with standing water or saturated soil for a significant portion of the year that is dominated by grass-like vegetation, shrubs and dwarf trees and which has a thick vegetative mat under foot. Erosion - Wearing away of the surface of the land, by action of water or wind due to timber harvesting operations. Facultative Species: Trees and shrubs that are equally likely to occur in wetlands or uplands (estimated probability 34-66 %). Facultative Upland Species: Trees and shrubs that usually occur in uplands (non-wetlands) (estimated probability 67-99 %), but occasionally found in wetlands (estimated probability 1-33 %) . Facultative Wetland Species: Trees and shrubs that usually occur in wetlands (estimated probability 67-99 %), but occasionally found in uplands (non-wetlands) (estimated probability 1-33 %) . Forested Wetland - A wetland where trees are the dominant plants. Freshwater Wetland - An area that is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetland permits are required for any dredge, fill, or construction in a wetland, intermittent or perennial stream or other surface water. Geotextile - A product used as a soil reinforcement agent and as a filter medium. It is made of synthetic fibers manufactured in a woven or loose non-woven manner to form a blanket like product. Grade - Expressed in percent, the distance a road or trail rises or falls over a horizontal distance. For example, a road or trail that rises or falls 10 feet over 100 feet in horizontal distance has a 10% grade. 10 FEET 50 FEET 100 FEET HORIZONTAL DISTANCE Intermittent Stream - A water course that flows in a well defined channel during the wet periods of the year or after major storms. Marsh - A low-lying area with standing water or saturated soil for a sufficient portion of the year that is dominated by reeds, cattails, sedge, or grasslike vegetation. Minimum Impact Forest Management Project - A temporary wetland crossing for forest management or timber harvesting purposes which is less than 50 feet in length and requires less than 3,000 square feet of fill, and which follows the Best Management Practices. Mulch - A natural or artificial layer of plant residue or other materials covering the land surface that conserves moisture, holds soil in place, aids in establishing plant cover, and minimizes temperature fluctuations. Obligate Upland Species: Trees and shrubs that almost always occur in uplands (non-wetlands) (estimated probability > 99 %). Obligate Wetland Species: Trees and shrubs that almost always occur in wetlands (estimated probability > 99 %) . Perennial Stream - A watercourse that flows throughout the year or nearly so (90 percent) in a well defined channel. Same as a live stream. Riprap - Rock or other large aggregate that is placed to protect streambanks, bridge abutments, outflow of drainage structures, or other erodible sites from runoff. Sediment - Soil material that has been detached, transported, suspended, or settled in water Slope - Degree of deviation of a surface from the horizontal, measured as a numerical ratio, as a percent, or in degrees. Expressed as a ratio, the first number is the horizontal distance (run) and the second number is the vertical distance (rise), as 2: 1. A 2: 1 slope is a 50% slope. Expressed in degrees, the slope is the angle from the horizontal plane, with a 90 degree slope being veritcal (maximum) and a 45 degree slope being a 1 : 1 slope. Stream - Any channel for the passage of surface water having a defined bed and banks whether natural or artificial, with perennial or intermittent flow. Swamp - A tree or shrub wetland, with standing water or saturated soils for a sufficient portion of the year, that often has a \"hummocky\" appearance and buttressed roots. Dominant full sized trees may include red maple, black ash, black willow, black spruce, tamarack, or white cedar. Wetland - An area where water is at, near, or above the land surface long enough to be capable of supporting aquatic or hydrophytic (water loving) vegetation and which has soils indicative of wet conditions. RAINDROP ON BARE SOIL 3 PLANNING THE OPERATION When the forest floor is disturbed and truck haul roads and skid trails are constructed, the natural filtering action of the soil is reduced. Trucks and skidders may compact the underlying soil. When it rains or the snow melts, surface water is not readily absorbed. Instead, the surface water flows into the roads and trails which can act as channels that increase the velocity and volume of the water as it flows downhill. As the water flows it may erode the soil and destroy the road and other capital improvements. Water quality management through systematic planning helps prevent erosion. This kind of management can be achieved by planning and laying out the roads and skid trails correctly, and by finding ways to get the water off the roads and trails as quickly as possible, before erosion can accelerate. Careless construction leads to rebuilding, lost time, higher costs and harm to soil, water, and fish habitat. If systematic planning does not take place before the operation begins, then there is the risk that the ditches, the crossdrains, culverts and water bars may not provide adequate drainage. Guidelines: Layout Obtain topographic maps, soils maps, aerial photographs and property maps. Use topographic maps, soils maps, and aerial photos to identify streams, forested wetlands, other bodies of water, steep slopes, flood plains, property boundaries, and harvest area boundaries. Locate the property lines and the area to be harvested on each of the maps and photographs. Walk the area and see how the land lays and where the stands for harvesting are located. Outline areas on the maps that are near streams, ponds, lakes, or wetlands, and mark very steep and very wet areas, and areas with poor timber. Consider the following for maximum erosion control: + Minimize the amount of soil disturbance + Minimize the amount of cut and fills + Minimize the number of stream crossings + Provide adequate drainage of the road and main skid trail area + Plan buffers around sensitive areas Draw on the maps the proposed location of your haul roads, main skid trails, and log landings. Look for the best placement on slopes, the position of streams and wetlands, possible stream crossings, and areas of soil instability. Walk the proposed location of haul roads and main skid trails. Establish control points along the way. These should be points you can identi@ on a map, aerial photograph, and on the ground. Flag this route as you walk in. Check skidding distances on both sides of your proposed route. Walk back out following your flagged route. 1. Adjust flagging to take advantage of natural features that will make road and trail construction and drainage easier. 2. Check the grades to make sure that they meet guidelines for truck haul roads and skid trails. 3. Flag areas suitable for landings and borrow pits. 4. Make sure the route provides the best access to present and fiture harvest areas Draw on your maps the final proposed location of your truck haul roads, skid trails, stream crossings, erosion control devices, etc. Be aware of applicable state and local laws which relate to timber harvesting, wetlands, surface waters and fish and wildlife habitat. Obtain all necessary permits prior to any construction or timber harvesting. (See Logging and the Law) Construction During the construction of truck haul roads and skid trails, there are certain activities that must be planned because they directly relate to the amount of erosion that can occur. Timing - Most problems can be prevented or minimized by timing the harvesting operation to take advantage of seasonal conditions. 1. Winter harvesting to take advantage of snow cover and frozen ground. 2. Bridge construction and culvert installation should be done during summer when streamflow is low. 3. On streams having important fisheries value, bridge and culvert installation should be avoided during egg incubation period of October to April. 4. If construction is necessary, it should be done well ahead of time to permit disturbed soil to stabilize before the road or trail is to be used. Design - The entire road and trail system should be designed before any construction begins. This process may seem to take more time, but the system will be more efficient, less costly, and easier to maintain. 1. Grade - Keep grades low except where short, steep sections are needed to take advantage of favorable topography and to avoid excessive cut and fill. 2. Width - The width of the road or trail should be designed for the equipment to be used on the timber harvesting operation. 3. Angle - Consider the proper angle for cuts and fills in designing roads on varying types of soils and rock materials. Make road cuts reasonably steep in order to minimize surface exposed to erosion. 4. Alignment - Avoid the toes of slopes, breaks in a slope, and running parallel to a streambank. 5. Surface - Crushed rock and gravel may be needed to keep the road surface from washing out during rainfall and runoff. 6. Drainage - Provisions must be made for the passage of surface water from adjacent slopes, as well as for rapid drainage of the roadbed itself. 7. Stream Crossings - All crossings sites should be selected at right angles to the stream and should not interfere with natural streamflow. Retirement A plan should be developed that provides for the retirement of truck haul roads, skid trails, and log landings. Smooth and shape all road and landing surfaces. Remove all temporary culverts and replace them with water bars, broad based dips, or ditches. Permanent culverts must be sized properly and provisions made for their continued maintenance. Remove all temporary stream and wetland crossings. Seed, mulch, lime, and fertilize. ARE YOU IN A WETLAND? Wetlands Characteristics: Hydrology, or the presence of water in or above the soil; Signs on the surface of the ground include: Waterstained (dark) or silt covered leaves; Lines of organic debris such as leaf litter on tree and shrub stems above soil surface; Water or silt stained plant stems; Swollen bases of tree trunks (an adaptation to wet soils); Exposed plant roots (an adaptation to wet soils). Soils, which show observable features when saturated or flooded for long periods of time; Signs in the soil include: Sphagnum moss on the surface; A thick upper layer of peaty organic matter; Soils mostly neutral grey in color (gleyed), or grey soils with rust colored (orange-brown and yellow-brown) splotches within 18\" of the surface. Vegetation, which is usually composed of a predominance of species suited to hydric (largely anerobic) soil habitats. Signs in the composition of plant species include: More than half the plant species being those that grow most oRen in wetland soils. Plant species have been classified by the US Fish & Wildlife Service based on how frequently they occur in wetlands. All plants, including herbaceous groundcovers, are important in wetland determination. However, only trees and shrubs are included here because there are fewer species than herbaceous plants, they are more easily identified by most people and they can be observed and identified at all times of the year. The species are grouped into five categories, listed here from most to least wetland adapted: .............................................. Obligate Wetland Species occur more than 99% of the time in wetlands. ...................................... Facultative Wetland.. Species occur between 67-99% of the time in wetlands. ................................................................. Facultative.. Species occur equally in uplands and wetlands. Facultative Upland ........................................... Species occur between 1-33% of the time in wetlands. Obligate Upland .................................................. Species occur less than 1% of the time in wetlands. Care must be taken when estimating wetland conditions using only plants. One reason is that common trees in the most marginal (least wet) wetlands (forested wetlands) are often the facultative species Red maple and Balsam fir and the facultative upland species Eastern hemlock. Even White pine and other species more commonly found in drier sites will grow on raised hummocks in a forested wetland. In these cases, a survey of the shrubs present will often provide a better indication of wetland conditions, as will groundcovers if they are present. In many forested wetlands, Highbush blueberry and Winterberry holly are common and readily identified at any time of the year. The technical determination of wetland boundaries incorporates all these characteristics, but is not practical for informal determination of whether you are working in a wetland. However, a rough estimate of a wetland boundary can be made using the signs given above. Begin by finding an area that seems obviously to be a wetland. Then, walk toward the upland, noting changes in vegetation as you go. If possible, sample the soil for the characteristics and look for above-ground signs noted above. When you no longer observe a majority of wetland plants or soil conditions, consider this the approximate wetland edge. This process can be repeated at intervals around the wetland edge, marking as you go. If you're not sure about wetland determination, refer to section in this manual on Available Assistance.

O Purpose: To provide for an efficient transportation system for forest products from the landing while also protecting forest land and water quality, for recreation, forest fire access, or other needed forest management activities. 0 Condition Where Practices Applies: Where area and volume to be harvested makes it necessary and economically feasible to install such a road system. Guidelines: A well thought out efficient transportation system will minimize the area disturbed and vulnerable to erosion. Keep the length of the truck road, from the log landing to a public highway, to a minimum. Have gravel or wood chips for about 200 feet prior to entering on a public highway to keep mud off of the highway. Road grades should be kept to 10% or less. Steeper grades are permissible for short distances. Long level sections are difficult to drain properly. Grades between 3% and 5% are desirable. Place roads on high ground with gentle grades. Avoid sharp curves. Use a fifiy foot minimum radius for large trucks. Minimum tread width is 10 feet for one-way traffic and 15 feet for two-way traffic. Increase the tread width by a minimum of 4 feet for trailer traffic. Use a geotextile construction fabric underlayment when constructing roads on poorly drained surface. Move surface water quickly off road surfaces and onto undisturbed forest floor. Ditches should be used to efficiently divert water away from the road surface. Water entering a roadway should be moved under or away from the roadway before gaining sufficient flow and velocity to erode ditches. Drainage ditches should not end where they will feed water directly into streams or other surface waters. (See Erosion Control Devices) If streams must be crossed, do so by the most direct route and preferably at right angles to the stream. A bridge, culvert, or food of acceptable design may be required. (See Stream Crossings) Road grades approaching stream crossings shall be broken and surface water dispersed so it will not reach the watercourse. (See Erosion Control Devices) Restrict vehicle traffic on sofi roads during Spring and Fall mud seasons. Restrict vehicle traffic during heavy rains. Do not allow skidding on truck roads. Check with the State of New Hampshire - Department of Transportation or the local town officials to determine if a driveway permit is required. SKID TRAILS Guidelines: O Definition: An unsurfaced, single lane trail system usually steeper and narrower than a truck road and used for skidding harvested products. O Purpose: To bring logs, tree lengths, or other roundwood products from the stump to a log landing or concentration area. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Use where harvested products must be brought to one location for sawing, chipping or loading. Where topography and size of operation make this the most economical means of collecting logs, trees, or other roundwood products. A well thought out efficient transportation system will minimize the area disturbed and vulnerable to erosion. L 9 Trail grades should be kept to 15% or less. Steeper grades are permissible for shorter distances. 9 Plan skid trails from the top down. Locate skid trails to take advantage of natural cross drainage. Use reverse grades and provide upgrade turns where natural reverse grades are not available. (See Erosion Control Devices - Reverse Grades) Major skid trails should be located away from streams, ponds, lakes, and wetlands. (See Erosion Control Devices - Streamside Management Zone) Move surface water quickly off trail surfaces and on to undisturbed forest floor. (See Erosion Control Devices) If streams must be crossed, do so by the most direct route and preferable at right angles to the stream. A bridge, culvert, or ford of acceptable design may be required. (See - Stream Crossings) Trail grades approaching stream crossings shall be broken and surface water dispersed so it will not reach the water course. (See Erosion Control Devices) At no time will logs be permitted to be skidded or equipment driven through flowing streams. @ Skid across slope where feasible. Skid uphill to the log landing whenever possible so that water running in the skid trails is dispersed away from landing. Silt fencing, haybale erosion checks or water diversions shall be used to prevent soil from skid trails from entering streams and other surface waters. Use brush to minimize rutting in soft soil. LOG LANDINGS O Definition: An area where harvested logs and trees are temporarily stored and assembled. O Purpose: To provide an area where forest products are sorted and loaded onto trucks for transport to a mill. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Should be so located as to minimize the adverse impact of skidding operations in sensitive areas and on the natural drainage pattern Guidelines: Landings should not be located in streamside management zone. Set landings back 100 feet or more from streams, ponds, lakes, and wetlands. If landings cannot be set back 100 feet from streams, pond, lakes, and wetlands, sediment traps should be used to minimize sedimentation from surface runoff. Adequate streamside management zone should be left between landings and water courses. Locate landings away from low or poorly drained areas. Locate landings on gently sloping ground that allows for good drainage. Landings should be sized to the minimum required for the area to be cut, the equipment used and the diversity of products produced. Construct diversion ditch around uphill side of landings where seepage and lateral flow of water may be a problem. Provide adequate drainage on approach trails so that drainage does not enter landing area. Divert water draining from landings so that it does not enter truck roads, skid trails, or flow directly into streams, ponds, lakes, or wetlands. Servicing of equipment on site must be done in such a way that old oil, hydraulic fluid, etc., should be properly contained and removed from the site and disposed of in accordance with proper waste disposal procedures. STREAMSIDE MANAGEMENT ZONE O Definition: A protective strip of undisturbed forest soil between disturbed areas (skid trails, truck roads, and log landings) and a water course (stream, pond, lake, and wetlands). To provide an undisturbed zone to slow runoff, allowing sediment to settle and be filtered out before reaching a water course. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Should be maintained between all water courses and truck roads, major skid trails, or log landings where soil has been exposed. The streamside management zone should be protected to prevent exposure of mineral soil. Equipment operation in this area should be limited. If mineral soil is exposed, it should be stabilized by seeding and/or mulching as soon as possible. Harvesting practices which do not expose mineral soil may take place in the streamside management zone such as felling and winching of timber. I No log landings should be within the streamside management zone. 19 Truck roads and major skid trails should not be within the streamside management zone except when entering and leaving 'stream crossings. New Hampshire law limits harvesting near surface waters and public roads. STREAMSIDE MANAGEMENT ZONE WIDTHS Side slope (percent) Width (feet) 0- 10 50 11 - 20 70 21 - 30 90 31 - 40 110 Note: Add 20 feet for each additional 10 percent of side slope. BROAD BASED DIPS O Definition: A dip and reverse slope in a truck road surface with an outslope in the dip for natural cross To provide cross drainage on insloped truck roads to prevent build-up of excessive surface runoff and subsequent erosion. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Use on truck roads and heavily used skid trails having a gradient of 10% or less. May be substituted for other cross drainage structures where no intermittent or permanent streams are Guidelines: 10% SLOPE f 10' \\ SECTION A i Proper construction requires an experienced bulldozer operator. Installed after the basic roadbed has been constructed and before major hauling use. On grades steeper than 8%, surface dips with stone (approx. 3\" diameter) or gravel. Use dips on approaches to steep declines in heavily used skid trails. Discharge area shouid be protected with stone, grass sod, heavy litter cover or slash and logs to reduce the velocity and 5lter the water. SPACING FOR BROAD BASED DIPS Road Grade (percent) Spacing Between Dips (feet) 2 300 4 200 6 165 8 150 10 140 12 130 WATER BARS O Definition: An excavated channel with earthen or reinforced berm constructed across a truck road or skid trail. O Purpose: To intercept and divert water from side ditches and truck road or skid trail surfaces, minimizing erosion by decreasing the slope length of surface water flow. Cl Conditions Where Practice Applies: On any sloping truck road or skid trail where surface water runoff may cause erosion. Guidelines: Start placement of water bars at the farthest skid trail and work back to the log landing and then to the truck road. Install water bars with a sludder blade, dozer blade, excavator or by hand. SHALLOW WATER BAR DEEP WATER BAR Install water bars at the top of any sloping road or trail and at proper spacing along steep sections. Water bars may be shallow or deep depending on the need. Soil should be left along the lower side of the water bar. Should be constructed at a 30' - 35' angle downslope from a line perpendicular to the direction of the truck road or skid trail. Should drain at a 3% outslope onto undisturbed litter or vegetation The uphill end of the water bar should extend beyond the side ditch line of the road or trail to hlly intercept any water flow. The downhill end of the water bar should be hlly open and extended far enough beyond the edge of the road or trail to disperse runoff water onto undisturbed forest floor. Place rocks, slash, or logs to disperse water coming from a water bar Ifthe road or trail is to be kept open after the harvesting operation, the following guidelines should be used in order to preserve effective water bars. -Reinforce the water bars -Keep travel to a minimum -Use only in dry weather -Make frequent inspections -Maintain as needed SPACING FOR WATER BARS RoadITrail Grade (percent) Spacing Between Water Bars (feet) 2 250 5 13 5 10 8 0 15 60 20 4 5 3 0 3 5 REVERSE GRADES Definition: A short rise in a downhill skid trail that forces any water in the trail to drain off to the side. Obtained by turning the skid trail up the hill a short distance then turning downhill again. O Purpose: To break the grade of the skid trail as often as practical, therefore limiting slope length. CI Condition Where Practice Applies: Where additional drainage can be provided by taking advantage of natural cross drainage on sidehill locations. Guide lines: Reverse grades are commonly applied to only skid trails. Requires greater planning and layout of trail system. Use in conjunction with other water control measures. Requires minimum construction time and low maintenance. Unsuitable on very steep terrain and hardpan soils. CROSS DRAINAGE CULVERTS 0 Definition: Corrugated pipe, well casing, dredge pipe, or other suitable material placed under a truck haul road or major skid road to transmit ditch runoff and seeps from a drainage area of less than 10 acres. 0 Purpose: To collect and transmit water flows from side ditches and seeps, under truck haul roads and major skid trails safely without eroding a drainage system or road surface. 0 Conditions Where Practice Applies: For any size operation where cross drainage of storm water is required temporarily or permanently. Guidelines: This is the most expensive method of road cross drainage and should be used where heavy use is anticipated during and after the harvesting operation. * When sizing culverts for temporary roads, allow for periods of high flow, such as spring runoff or cloudbursts. The minimum size culvert to be installed is 12 inch diameter and 20 feet in length. When constructing roads on sidehill locations, ditch the uphill side of the roadway to intercept surface runoff. Allow inlet end of culvert to extend into side ditch so that it intercepts water flowing in the ditch. Construct a berm across the side ditih to assist in diverting water into the culvert. Allow outlet end of culvert to extend beyond any fill and empty onto an apron of rock, gravel or logs. Space culverts according to road grade: On gentle slopes (1-2%). ................................. 30 feet On moderate slopes (3 - 10%). .......................... .I50 feet ....................... On steep slopes (1 ON+). ,100 feet or less Culverts should be installed at a 30-35 degree angle downgrade. Culverts should be sloped at least 5 inches for every 10 feet of length to permit self-cleaning. When harvesting operation has been completed, the road should be stabilized by installing water bars and removing all pipe culverts fiom truck roads which will not be maintained. Culverts, when not maintained, are very likely to become blocked with rocks, ice or other debris. Runoff water can become rerouted over and around the culvert and may wash out sections of road into brooks, streams, ponds or wetlands. It is important to clean culverts regularly. Check after every storm. Culvert size selection should be based on the size of the drainage area of the watershed and should be able to handle the largest flows. * Estimate drainage area by taking measurements on a USGS topographic map, using contour lines to define the drainage limits. The Natural Resource Conservation Service can assist you with determination of drainage area. ROAD SURFACE 112 DIAMETER 112 DI HAND TAMP OPEN TOP CULVERTS 0 Definition: A wooden, concrete, or slotted steel pipe culvert placed across truck haul roads to convey surface runoff and side ditch flows across to downslope side. 0 Purpose: To collect and direct road surface storm runoff and upslope side ditch flows across road without eroding drainage system or road surfaces. 0 Conditions Where Practice Applies: This practice is a temporary or permanent drainage structure for truck haul roads. Properly built and maintained, it can be used for cross drainage on roads of smaller operations as a substitute for a cross drainage culvert. This practice should not be used for handling intermittent or live streams or skid trail cross drainage. Guidelines: Can be constructed of cull logs or from sawn lumber. If made of durable wood or treated material, these culverts will give many years of service. Install flush with the road surface and skewed at an angle not less than 30 degrees downgrade. Allow the inlet end to extend into the cut slope or side ditch so that it intercepts water. 28 Allow outlet end to extend beyond any fill and empty onto an apron of rock, gravel or logs. Open top culverts must be cleaned regularly to remove sediments, gravel, and logging debris to allow normal hnction of structure at all times. SPACING FOR OPEN TOP CULVERTS Road Grade(percent) Spacing Between Culverts(feet) 1-2% 3 00 3 - 10% 150 1 0%+ 100 or less INSLOPING O Definition: A section of road is sloped slightly (1-3%) toward the cut bank. O Purpose: Effective way of limiting erosion because water is removed from the road surface quickly and diverted directly to the inside ditch which will carry the water into a culvert. 0 Condition Where Practice Applies: Used when the soils are easily saturated or highly erodible. This will limit the amount of ditch water which will flow on to unstable fills. INSLOPED ROAD WITH DITCH ( cross section ) OUTSLOPING A section of road sloped slightly (1-3%) from the cut bank to the outside edge of the road bed. To prevent erosion by diverting runoff from a road surface on to undisturbed forest floor. O Condition Where Practice Applies: Guidelines: Outsloping on fill is not desirable. For safety, do not use for trucking during freezing weather. Do not use on silty or hardpan soils when wet or if seeps are present. OUTSLOPED ROAD ( cross section ) CROWNING O Definition: A section of road is sloped slightly (2-4%) from the center line of the road to the outside edges of the roadbed. O Purpose: Effective way of limiting erosion because water is removed from the road surface quickly and diverted directly onto the forest floor or into a ditch which will carry the water into a culvert. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Used when soils are easily saturated or highly erodible when adjacent areas are relatively level with roadbed or on steep side hills. Guidelines: CROWNED ROAD ON STEEP SLOPES ORIGINAL GROUND CROWNED ROAD CORDUROY O Definition: Crossing of a wet area where there is not a defined channel using poles or cull logs as a roadbed. O Purpose: To be used as a wet area crossing by a skid trail where it is necessary to provide soil stability. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: To be constructed on wet soils subject to rutting and extreme compaction by timber harvesting equipment Guidelines: Use geo-textile fabric or other appropriate bedding. Place 8 - 10 inch diameter poles or cull logs side by side in wet area to serve as a roadbed. Place poles or cull logs perpendicular to the direction of travel across wet area. The top width of corduroy roadway should be at least 10 feet. Shall not be crossed when they are overtopped with water. After corduroy roadway has been overtopped with water, repair and maintenance will be required. Corduroy roadway should be inspected regularly. May be left in place after harvesting operation has been completed. TEMPORARY BRIDGE 0 Definition: A structure of wood and steel materials installed across a natural or constructed channel or stream. 0 Purpose: To carry a single lane haul road or skid trail over a stream to enable more direct routing while keeping equipment and products out of the water. 0 Conditions Where Practice Applies: Where restrictions such as topography or property lines make it necessary to cross a stream. Stream crossings are a major concern in the construction and use of a truck haul roads and skid trails because of the potential for large amounts of sediment to enter a stream. Keep the number of stream crossings to a minimum. Guidelines: Install bridges at right angle to the stream. A maximum of 15 degree skew may be allowed as an exception where approach conditions are difficult. Align approach and exit with the bridge's center line with as little curvature as possible. Stream alignment should be straight at the point of crossing and of uniform profile. Minimum acceptable bridge width is 10 feet. Firmly anchor abutments out of the water in stable bank material and parallel to the stream channel. Do not narrow stream channel with abutments. LOG ,U LOG CRIB .k PLANK PREFABRICATED CRIB a Acceptable abutment materials can be rock, logs, sawn timbers or a combination of any of the above. (See Logging and The Law) Place abutment aprons or approaches as close to gradient of bridge surface as possible. Avoid abrupt rises and drops from bridge gradient to apron gradient. (See Logging and The Law) Stringer material may be either logs, sawn timbers or steel. Match center line gradients of span and stringers with that of the road or trail. It is recommended that a registered engineer be contacted to design the bridge. Log stringers should have a flat upper bearing face to accept a plank deck as well as a flat bearing surface on abutments. Placement of log stringers on abutments should alternate small and large ends. Deck material shall be placed perpendicular to the stringer direction and be tight. A curb shall be installed along the outer sides of the deck and be fastened tight to the deck. Minimum size will be 6\" x 6\" and will run the entire length of the span. Pole timbers can also be used, but must be straight and of sound quality. The bridge must be anchored so that it will not wash out during high water. Old trailer beds make excellent temporary bridges over small streams. Placement of bridges that require work in the stream should be done when the water level is low and in as short a period of time as possible. (See Logging and The Law) Do not gravel the deck. The gravel holds moisture that will cause the deck to rot. When the harvesting operation has been con~pleted, stabilize the area by removing all bridges from truck haul roads and skid trails which will not be maintained. Road and trail grades approaching stream crossings shall be broken and surface water dispersed so it will not reach the watercourse. (See Erosion Control Devices) Find stream banks that are firm and level and approaches that are reasonably level for a distance of 50 feet on each side of the stream crossing. STONE FORDS O Definition: Stream crossing using the stable stream bottom or stone fill as the roadbed. To be used on a truck haul road as a stream crossing rather than a bridge or culvert. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Perennial Stream Ford - Can be constructed and used during periods of low flow. When drainage area exceeds one square mile, a log box culvert should be installed. Guidelines: Installation of fords is permissible only when it is not feasible to construct a bridge or install a pipe culvert, i.e. streams having no or low banks. Fords are prohibited on all streams in watersheds tributary to drinking water intakes or reservoirs for public and private water supplies, where the ford is within 2,000 feet of such intake or reservoir. : Shall not be crossed when they are overtopped with water. Skidding across stone fords is prohibited. Construct on sound stable stream bottoms, whenever possible. Use geotextile fabric or other appropriate bedding for approaches. Do not use in stream. Use angular rock fill material of at least 75% greater than 5 inches in diameter. Use larger sizes for large drainage areas. Use 2 inch round stone on surface of ford to protect tires from sharp edges of angular rock. Height of fill should be at least 112 foot above low flow water level. However, total fill should not to exceed 2 feet above stream bottom. The top width of the fords should be at least 10 feet. Side slopes of fords should be greater than or equal to; 2: 1 upstream and 3: 1 downstream. After fords have been overtopped with water, repair and maintenance will be required. Do not place gravel or fill on the top of stone fords. The log box culvert may float during overtopping and should be anchored. Large stones or boulders on the downstream face of a stone ford will increase its life. Roads and trail grades approaching stream crossings shall be broken and surface water dispersed so it will not reach the stream. (See Erosion Control Devices) Find stream banks that are firm and level with approaches that are reasonably level for a distance of 50 feet on each side of the stream crossing. 2 : 1 SIDE SLOPE MINIMUM 3 : 1 SIDE SLOPE DOWNSTREAM Number of 15\"xl5\" Drainage Area (Square Miles) Log Box Culverts ShallowkIigh Elevation Soils Normal Soils 1 2 3 4 1-5 1-8 5- 10 8- 17 10 - 15 17 - 20 15 - 20 f I[ \"; POLED FORDS O Definition: Temporary stream crossing in a defined channel using poles or cull logs as the roadbed.

Fords are used for crossing streams with light use truck haul roads and skid trails where there is limited potential for sedimentation of the stream. Guidelines: Installation of fords is permissible only when it is not feasible to construct a bridge or install a pipe culvert, i.e. streams having no or low banks. Fords are prohibited on all streams in watersheds tributary to drinking water intakes or reservoirs for public and private water supplies, where ford is within 2,000 feet of such intakes or reservoir. Shall not be crossed when they are overtopped with water. Constructed on sound stable stream bottoms. Use geo-textile fabric or other appropriate bedding if needed to stabilize the approaches to the crossing. Find stream banks that are firm and level with approaches that are reasonably level for a distance of 50 feet on each side of the stream crossing. Place 8 - 10 inch diameter poles or cull logs side by side on the stream bed to serve as the roadbed. The top width of these fords should be at least 10 feet. Poles and logs must be removed immediately after use. After fords have been overtopped with water, repair and maintenance will be required. Poled fords should be inspected regularly to make sure the stream is not becoming turbid. Do not gravel or fill over poled fords. STREAM CULVERTS O Definition: Corrugated pipe, well casing, dredge pipe or wooden box culvert placed under a truck haul road or major skid road to permit crossing of an intermittent or live stream. O Purpose: To transmit water flow of intermittent or live streams under truck haul roads and major skid trails. To carry a single lane haul road or skid trail over a stream to enable more direct routing while keeping equipment and products out of the water. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Where restrictions such as topography or property lines make it necessary to cross a stream. Stream crossings are a major concern in the construction and use of truck haul roads, major skid roads, and skid trails because of the potential for large amounts of sediment to enter a stream. Guidelines: Keep the number of stream crossings to a minimum. Culvert size selection should be based on the size of the drainage area of a forested watershed ant should be able to handle the largest stream flows. Estimate drainage area by taking measurements on a USGS topographic map, using contour line: to define the drainage limits. The Natural Resource Conservation Service can assist you wit1 determination of drainage area. Install a culvert/emergency spillway when the expected life of the stream crossing is greater thar the duration of the harvesting operation. Construct during periods.of no or low flow and in as short a period of time as possible. Install culvert crossing at right angle to the stream. A maximum of 15 degree skew is allowed a! an exception where approach conditions are difficult. Align approach and exit with culvert crossing center line with as little curvature as possible. Road and trail grades approaching stream crossings should be broken and surface water disperse( so it will not reach the watercourse. (See Erosion Control Devices) Stream alignment should be straight at the point of crossing and of uniform profile so as not to obstruct the flow of water.

TOP WIDTH- OF ROAD 2 : 1 CULVERT Y EMERGENCY SPILLWAY SIDE SLOPE I I HAUL ROAD, SKID TRAIL, AND LOG LANDING STABILIZATION Definition: Planting vegetation such as grasses and legumes on exposed mineral soil and erodible segments of truck haul roads, skid trails, or log landings. O Purpose: To permanently stabilize the site; to reduce damages from sediment and runoff, provide wildlife food value and habitat; enhance natural beauty; maintenance of the right-of-way is desired. O Conditions Where Practice Applies: Areas of exposed mineral soil that are subject to erosion and where a permanent vegetative cover is needed. Guidelines: Old or new water diversion structures such as water bars, culverts, broad based dips, etc., must be operative before stabilization is initiated. Where feasible, prepare a seedbed by grading, removing debris, and scarieing the soil to a minimum depth of 3 inches. When the area to be seeded has been recently loosened to the extent that an adequate seedbed exists, no additional treatment is required. Lime and fertilizer should be thoroughly applied to the seedbed as indicated by soil test 1. Lime to a pH of 6.0, but in the absence of a soil test, apply a minimum of 2 tonlacre of ground agricultural limestone (high magnesium). 2 Fertilize at the rate of 500 pounds of 10-10-1 0 per acre. Mulch, such as straw, hay, woodchips, or bark, retains soil moisture, important for seed germination, and protects the soil surface from erosion due to runoff. Mulch can be used to: (1) promote natural revegetation or (2) protect seeds that have been spread over an area. If you seed, apply mulch immediately afterward. Seeded areas should be closed off from all use until cover is adequately established. Inspect all seeded areas for failures and make necessary repairs. Grasses and other herbaceous cover can stabilize bare mineral soil and minimize erosion. It is a good practice to seed disturbed areas following harvesting. Close off vehicle access with a gate, fence, boulders, or with a large tree felled across the road. Mulch seedings and anchor on slopes or where subjected to concentrated flow. Track in seed with a dozer whenever possible to improve germination and establishment, especially when seeding flatpea or crownvetch and on sandy, droughty sites.

WETLANDS PERMITTING Timber harvests which involve stream or wetland crossings require a wetlands permit. The level of harvesting impacts on a wetland dictates the type of wetland permit required. There are three types of actions: minimum, minor, and major. MINIMUM IMPACT WETLANDS PERMIT The minimum impact wetlands permit is attached to the intent to cut form. A minimum impact wetlands permit is only allowed under the following circumstances: 0 Forest management harvests only - land conversion projects require a separate dredge and fill permit; 0 Wetland impacts of less than 3,000 square feet; 0 Permanent culverts or rock fords which do not exceed 15 feet in width and 50 feet in length; 0 Stream crossings up to 10 feet in width; 0 Wetland crossings of up to 50 feet in width. To complete the minimum impact wetlands permit, simply fill in the one page questionnaire, prepare a map of the harvest area using a USGS topographic map showing all wetland crossings and pay an additional fee of $25. Forest harvesting can begin as soon as local officials sign the intent to cut.

Wetlands -an area that is inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions does support, a prevalence of vegetation (more than 50%) typically adapted for life in satu- rated soil conditions (hydric soils). Wetlands include, but are not limited to swamps, bogs, marshes and similar areas. Swamp - a wetland that is dominated by trees and/or shrubs. Typical trees are red maple, hemlock. black ash, black willow, black spruce, tamarack and white pine. Bog - a wetland distinguished by stunted evergreen trees and shrubs, peat deposits, andlor highly acidic soil and water con- ditions. Marsh - a wetland distinguished by : 1) absence of trees and shrubs; 2) dominance of soft stemmed herbaceous plants such as grasses, reeds. and sedges; and 3) water table is at or above the surface throughout the year, but can fluctuate season- ally. Svrface water - those portions of waterS of the state, as defined by USA 482-A:4, which have standing or flowing water at or on the surface of the ground. This includes, but is not limited to rivers, streams. (perennial and seasonal), lakes. ponds and tidal waters. Designated Prime Wetland -A wetland designated by a municipal& as requiring special protection. Check with town office for location of these wetlands. Natural Heritage Inventory - A listing maintained by the Department of Resources and Economic Development. Call 603- 271 -3623 for information. Best Management Practices for Erosion Control on Timber Harvest Operations in New Hampshire - A manual devel- oped by the Department of Resources andEconomic Development (DRED). Copies are available from DRED, 172 Pemboke Road, Concord, NH 03301 (603-271-2214); or UNH Extension, Durham, NH (603-862-1028). There is no charge. Wetlands Application - Forms for applying for permits to work in wetlands or surface waters when criteria of sections 2 or 3 are not met. These forms can be obtained from the town clerk. or by calling the WetIands Bureau at 603-271-2147. For projects not qualifying for minimum impact for forestry notification, no work in wetland or surface water may commence with- out a posting permit. EXCAVATING AND DREDGING PERMIT Ifthe timber harvest has minimum impacts but the land is being converted to other than non-forest uses, or if a logging operation will result in wetland impacts greater than those described above, a dredge and fill permit from the New Hampshire Wetlands Bureau will be required. Applications for these permits are available at town and county conservation district offices. Permit applications, a detailed plan, proof of notification of abutters and fees based on the square footage of impacted wetlands are required. When the application and accompanying materials are submitted to the Bureau, four copies of each must also be provided to the town clerk. The town clerk keeps one and sends the other copies to the selectmen, planning board, and conservation commission. Town clerks may charge an administrative fee of up to $10. RSA 482-A:3 Excavating And Dredging Permit; Certain Exemptions No person shall excavate, remove, fill, dredge or construct any structures in or on any bank, flat, marsh, or swamp in and adjacent to any waters of the state without a permit from the wetlands board. The permit application together with a detailed plan and a map showing the exact location of the proposed project, along with 4 copies of the permit application, plan and map, shall be submitted to the town or city clerk, accompanied by a filing fee in the form of a check made out by the applicant to the New Hampshire wetlands board. The permit application fee shall be $50 for minimum impact projects. Fees for minor and major projects shall be assessed based on the area of dredge or fill proposed and the number of boat slips requested. The rates shall be $100 per boat slip and $0.025 per square foot. At the time the permit application is submitted to the city or town clerk, the applicant shall provide postal receipts or copies, :' verifLing that abutters, as defined in the rules of the wetlands board, and except as further provided in said rules, have been notified by certified mail. The postal receipts or copies shall be retained by the municipality. The town or city clerk shall immediately sign the application and forward by certified mail, the application, plan, map and filing fee to the wetlands board. The town or city clerk shall then immediately send a copy of the permit application, plan and map to the local governing body, the municipal planning board, if any, and the municipal conservation commission, if any, and may require an administrative fee not to exceed $10 plus the cost of postage by certified mail. One copy shall remain with the city or town clerk, and shall be made reasonably accessible to the public. The foregoing procedure notwithstanding, applications and fees for projects by agencies of the state may be filed directly with the wetlands board, with 4 copies of the application, plan and map filed at the same time with the town or city clerk to be distributed as set forth above. MINIMUM SHORELAND PROTECTION STANDARDS RSA 483-B:9 V. The following minimum standards shall apply to the protected shoreland provided that forestry, involving water supply reservoir watershed management or agriculture conducted in accordance with best management practices, shall be exempted from the provisions of this chapter: (a) Natural Woodland Buffer (1) Where existing, a natural woodland buffer shall be maintained within 150 feet of the reference line. The purpose of this buffer shall be to protect the quality of public waters by minimizing erosion, preventing siltation and turbidity, stabilizing soils, preventing excess nutrients and chemical pollution, maintaining natural water temperatures, maintaining a healthy tree canopy and understory, preserving fish and wildlife habitat, and respecting the overall natural condition of the protected shoreland. (2) Within the natural woodland buffer of the protected shoreland under conditions defined in RSA 483-B:9,V the following prohibitions and limitations shall apply: (A) Not more than a maximum of 50 percent of the basal area of trees, and a maximum of 50 percent of the total number of saplings shall be removed for any purpose in a 20-year period. A healthy, well-distributed stand of trees, saplings, shrubs and ground covers and their living, undamaged root systems shall be left in place. (B) [REPEALED 1992,235:28, I.] (C) Trees, saplings, shrubs and ground covers which are removed to clear an opening for building construction, accessory structures, septic systems, roadways, pathways, and parking areas shall be excluded when computing the percentage limitations under subparagraph (a)(2)(A). (D) Dead, diseased, unsafe, noxious or fallen trees, saplings, shrubs, or ground cover may be removed. Their removal shall not be used in computing the percentage limitations under subparagraph (a)(2)(A). (E) Stumps and their root systems which are located within 50 feet of the reference line shall be left intact in the ground. (F) Dead and living trees that provide dens and nesting places for wildlife are encouraged to be preserved. (G) Planting efforts that are beneficial to wildlife are encouraged to be undertaken. ALTERATION OF TERRAIN An alteration of terrain permit application must be filed if the harvest is being done to clear and stump land for non-forest uses. The permit is required if and more than 100,000 square feet (a little more than 2 acres) or 50,000 square feet in the shoreland protection zone (RSA 483-B:9, V) of land are affected. Alteration of Terrain permits are available at county conservation district offices and the Water Supply and Pollution Control Division of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES). 485-A: 17 Terrain Alteration Any person proposing to dredge, excavate, place fill, mine, transport forest products or undertake construction in or on the border of the surface waters of the state, and any person proposing to significantly alter the characteristics of the terrain, in such a manner as to impede the natural runoff or create an unnatural runoff, shall be directly responsible to submit to the division detailed plans concerning such proposal and any additional relevant information requested by the division, at least 30 days prior to undertaking any such activity. The operations shall not be undertaken unless and until the applicant receives a permit from the division.
