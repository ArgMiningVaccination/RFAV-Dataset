Though there's a lot of misinformation floating around about the vaccine, health organisations from the WHO, to the CDC, and the Hong Kong Department of Health have confirmed that the vaccine is the best way to reduce your risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from Covid. The vaccine also helps reduce your risk of catching or spreading coronavirus, as well as protecting against emerging variants of Covid-19. The side effects of the Covid vaccine are usually mild, and noticeable symptoms should not last longer than a week. The most common symptoms include: - Soreness around the injection site. - Feeling tired. - Headaches. - Aches and pains. - Nausea and/or vomiting. Some people may experience adverse reactions to the vaccine, like allergic reactions, or clotting, however these side effects are incredibly rare, and do not outweigh the benefit of getting vaccinated. Though symptoms only last a week, your body takes a little longer to process the vaccine. In the following few weeks after immunisation, your body will create T and B lymphocytes, which learn how to fight the virus in future should you come into contact with it. [1] Why vaccine side effects occur Researchers have found that around 70% of people who receive the Covid vaccine experience side effects. [2] Side effects are a natural response to vaccination. When you receive an injection, your innate immunity responds. White blood cells rush to the injection site and produce cytokines, which causes a whole host of symptoms, including inflammation. Not everyone will experience the same symptoms, but that's to be expected, as our bodies, and thus our immune responses, are completely unique. [3] Women may also be more susceptible to side effects, as generally, their immune responses are stronger. [4] Side effects are a sign that the vaccine is working effectively, as it shows that your body is responding to the injection. It may not be all that pleasant, but hang in there! It's doing good work. Don't worry if you don't experience side effects. As mentioned earlier, the vaccine's most important work occurs in the weeks following immunisation, when your lymphocytes learn how to fight the virus- the period in which symptoms should have ceased anyway. Supplements for easing symptoms Though side effects are a natural sign the vaccine are working, it doesn't mean we have to suffer with them. Our practitioners have put together their supplement protocol for easing symptoms of the Covid vaccine. Some, like curcumin and zinc, are anti-inflammatory, helping ease aching muscles, or soreness around the injection side. Others, like vitamin C and glutathione, have powerful antioxidant properties, easing oxidative stress, which is caused by high levels of pollution in Hong Kong and can put extra unnecessary pressure on your body when it needs to heal. Alongside these supplements, you should also make sure to drink enough water, to promote a healthy immune response to the vaccine. The first stage Take these supplements for three days prior to the vaccine, and five days afterwards. 5000IU of vitamin D in the morning and the evening. (10,000IU per day total) 1000mg of vitamin C, three times daily. (3000mg total per day) 30mg of zinc after breakfast and dinner (60mg total per day) The second stage Take these supplements for one month following the vaccine (beginning on the day of vaccination). Take 250mg of curcumin, twice daily. (500mg total per day) And 100mg of glutathione, twice daily. (200mg total per day) In Summary Taking the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself against Covid-19. Though side effects are a natural sign the vaccine is working, we don't have to suffer with them. Taking these supplements helps ensure that your body gets what it needs to recover from side effects, reducing inflammation and helping your body combat widespread issues in Hong Kong, like pollution, which puts extra stress on your body as it acclimatises to "}
