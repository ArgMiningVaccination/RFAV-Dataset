There were common problems which often brought officials ofthetwo programs together. And, ofcourse, there were countless com- mon interests and, most important ofall, themutual desire forvictory. Itwasbutanatural blending when, on July an- nounced that theFlying Training theTechnical Training Com- mand would beconsolidated toform the Army Air Forces Training Command. Maj. Gen.

The new Command isnationwide in scope. Ithasbeen divided geographically into western, central and eastern areas, within which flying andtcchnical traininu functions willbeclosely coordinated.

There thefirstmachine gun, carried inthelap ofapassenger, was fired ataground target from aflying machine. Crudely fashioned bombs also were taken aloft anddropped ontargets. Subsequent steps inconverting theair- plane into aneffective military weapon were made during thefirstWorld War when Germans and Allies introduced new methods offitting their planes with machine guns and bombs. Asearly as 191') German observers flying over Paris fired rifles atFrench aircraft intheair. The French retaliated with automatic rifles.
