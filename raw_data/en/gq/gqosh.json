Iain worked tirelessly at this and did an amazing job. And I would like to thank Gill Zukovskis for all the care that she put into the final editing and advice. I'd also like to thank my lovely wife for her editing and encouragement skills. As well, my son Steven had some input, and a thank-you to all of my children. I would like to thank major contributors. t hese include: Ulrich w elte MD of Germany, w endy Howard LHom of Scotland, and Karim Adal MD of Switzerland. Also Katrin Sigwart MD and all those at Narayana Verlag. I am always impressed with those at Narayana who show such a strong commitment to the evolution of deep and effective homeo pathy. Others helped with sending me cured cases, ideas, editing and contrib-uted to portions of the manuscript. t hese include: Sally w illiams, Savitri Clarke, Nancy Frederick, Ute Adolphs, Pat Deacon, and Griegel, Kelli Kirkpatrick, Latifa r obert Muntz, Francis t reuherz, Jan Scholten and many others. I apologize if I have forgotten anyone but send you much gratitude. Louis Klein: Miasms and Nosodes Copyright by Narayana Publishers 79400 Kandern5foreword by Jan sCHoLT en I have known Lou Klein for many years and I have always admired his insights on homeo pathy and remedies. Besides being a friend of mine, he is a very good therapist and teacher. t his new book \"MIASMS AND NOSOD e S, O r IGINS OF DIS e AS e \" dis- cusses the use of nosodes in homeo pathy. t he homeopathic nosodes are a very special group for several reasons. First of all they include the earliest living organisms on earth. For about a billion years there were only primi-tive organisms such as bacteria on our planet. t he higher organisms like plants and animals evolved only later, and they probably came into exis-tence through symbiosis or cooperation with bacteria, as Shafica Kara-gulla has explained. t he mitochondria in our cells may have descended from bacteria and share many features with them. A second point is that it is often difficult to ascertain the exact composi- tion of our nosode prescriptions. Bacteria cannot be taken in isolation, as they are too small. Nosodes are made from sputum, tissues like lungs, discharges, cultures in laboratories and so on. So they are mostly not pure but for the most part can be mixed with the material they are liv-ing in. t hat is the reason we have many different t uberculinum nosodes, for example. So nosodes have the aspect of being vague, not precisely defined. Lou Klein has the capacity to work with this vagueness very effectively. He knows how to extract the essence of the remedy from provings, from natural history and especially from patients. He is able to make the vague more exact. t his book is the first to do this successfully in homeo pathy. Nosodes are strongly connected with Miasms, as the title of the book indicates. But the concept of miasms is also quite vaguely defined. t he term is used in many different ways in homeo pathy and thus it is much disputed. One aspect of miasms is their infectious nature, as diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another. And bacteria and viruses have that characteristic. Miasms can also be inherited and as such can be seen as more general qualities. t hey can be viewed as the state behind all symptoms and syndromes. In that sense all remedies are miasms, but nosodes are particularly closely linked to them. Historically, Hahne mann started with three miasms, Psora, Sycosis and Syphilis, two of which are connected with bacteria, Neisseria and t reponema. Louis Klein: Miasms and Narayana Publishers 79400 Kandern6Foreword by Jan Scholten An important theme in this book is the use of the Stages. t he 18 stages originated from the periodic system of the elements, being the 18 columns of the periodic table. But they have become known as more fundamental principles, showing the evolution of all processes in creation. t he nos- odes can also be classified in stages. r ajan Sankaran has begun to set out the classification of the Plant Kingdom in the form of miasms. Lou Klein brings further depth and precision by classifying the nosodes in stages and families. He also brings in scientific classification of the Bacteria King-dom, making these remedies much more understandable. I remember regular discussions with Lou about the nosodes and their stages. Lou had put y ersinia in Stage 9 together with Ignatia, whereas Sankaran had put Ignatia in Stage 12, the cancer miasm. w e debated if Diphtherinum is more Stage 12 or Stage 8. And each time it led to a bet-ter understanding of those remedies, giving more insight into their real essence. It was great to discuss with a colleague and friend who is so knowledgable about homeo pathy. Lou Klein doesn't have the showiness of some other teachers. It can take some time to tune into his way of thinking because he has such a broad overview. But once you get in tune, the rewards are great. He teaches you not only the remedies, but also a way of thinking, analyzing and sensing the patient and the remedies. I see this book as a must for every homeopath.Jan Scholten, May 2009 Louis Klein: .d efinitions Homeo pathy can treat the residual effects of infection even when the infective agent is not present. t his is a bold statement, with great signifi- cance, because from the point of view of conventional medicine without an infective agent present there is little to be done except palliate or sup- press. A corollary to the first statement (also crucial to the homeopathic understanding) is that a very large percentage of chronic . diseases . can be associated with an infective . agent. t he main thrust of this book is not about the acute infection. Nor will we discuss whether conventional medicine is completely effective in treating every proliferation of an infective agent. w hat we will study in this book is the impact of infective agents on the development of chronic disease, and how that impact can be transmitted to offspring, even without the infective agent present. In homeo pathy, we believe that there are two aspects to any infective disease condition. One is the material aspect that can be seen with the microscope, and the other is the energetic aspect which remains unseen. In fact, we hold that either simultaneously with, or prior to, the manifesta-tion of any disease (including an infection) there is an energetic shift and change in the host. For the homeopath, this energetic shift can best be discerned through attention to the individual disposition of each patient (that is, the host) rather than through the narrow and exclusive task of identifying the com-mon infective agent. A good homeopathic prescription always takes into account the individual nature of the person and their recent and long-term life history as well as a specific external etiology. t o the homeopath, the real clues to treating any disease condition are uncovered not only by way of laboratory investigation but by way of a thorough investigation into the individual and their history. t his focus on the whole of the person is no longer emphasized in modern conventional medicine. As noted, there are energetic shifts, which manifest (from an even earlier, latent state) and act as pre-cursory fields for disease, and these have been discussed in homeo pathy for the past two centuries. Homeo pathy has named them miasms, and homeopaths have prepared energetic homeo- pathic remedies from actual infective agents or from discharges, and these Louis Klein: Miasms and Nosodes Copyright by called nosodes. t hese nosodes were, and are, an attempt to treat the energetic disturbance in the patient with a similar energetic vibration. w hen a homeopathic remedy is prepared from a nosode, it is no longer material; what it becomes is an artifact of the original substance from which it was made. t his is what homeopathic remedies actually are - an energetic artifact of the original substance. w hen discussing, studying, or even seeing the effect of these nosodal homeopathic remedies, it is always important to keep in mind that the homeopathic remedy itself is energetic. t here is nothing left of the original substance; therefore, a nos- ode is no longer infective by all conventional standards. If we are to study and to develop homeopathic materia medica, it will require that we focus on the individual dispositional state that can be generated or seen for each remedy rather than completely focusing on the common infective pathology. (I will give further explanation of this distinction below.) e specially in the present modern climate of great drug- taking, with suppression or palliation of the pathological symptoms and thereby a lack of traditional homeopathic modalities, the disposition is ultimately the key to effective homeopathic prescribing. I have already mentioned some terms which outsiders to the homeopathic community will likely find strange or archaic. Indeed, even within the homeopathic community these words can have different shades of mean-ing. As a result and before proceeding any further, I feel it is important to give my own definition of these terms and offer some insights into the historical evolution of the concepts involved. disposition First and foremost, we begin with the word disposition, which Hahne - mann used in his Organon: Disposition . is . . . . our . attitudes . and . our . actions. I came to this succinct definition after careful thought and much applica- tion. Hahne mann stresses both symptom and disposition, but especially the latter, in Aphorism 210 of the Organon: .... and in all cases of disease we are called on to cure, the state of the patient's disposition is to be particularly noted, along with the totality of the symptoms, if we would trace an accurate picture of Louis Klein: Miasms and Nosodes Copyright by Narayana Publishers and Nosodes, and the History of Miasms 11the disease, in order to be able therefrom to treat it homoeopathi- cally with success.1 As much as disposition plays a prominent role in the selection of the remedy, the evaluation of whether we have successfully applied a homeo- pathic remedy is to be found in the curative positive change in pathology, in the \"annihilation of the disease\" (as Hahne mann said), and not neces- sarily with regard to any change of disposition in the early follow-ups. In counter-distinction, pathology can be defined as the true manifestation of disease. t his distinction between pathology and disposition is neces- sary for effective evaluation of the homeopathic match between the rem- edy prescribed and the patient. In a section of each chapter of this book which bears the title \"Clinical Focus Guide,\" the reader can find short phrases describing each aspect of the remedy under study - both pathology and disposition are combined together. t his book is specifically about miasms and nosodes. In the next chap - ter, I will be discussing definitions of these words and how there has been an evolution in understanding that has allowed a change of per - ception concerning miasms. t his topic, however, needs some initial explanation. Miasms the word miasm derives from the Greek miasma pollution\" related to miainein \"to pollute.\" It also refers to the mist that one may see swirling and arising from a swamp. Hippocrates used the term to describe the idea of tainted water or air that he believed was responsible for the spread of infectious diseases. Although it seems archaic to us today, \"miasma\" was a common term in Hahne mann's day. Diseases such as cholera, dysentery, leprosy, malaria (which actually means \"bad air\"), bubonic plague, and pulmonary tuber - culosis were all understood to be caused by \"miasma.\" Miasma was con- sidered \"a dangerous, foreboding, or atmosphere\" - the \"contamination\" or \"pollution\" that one absorbed when exposed to sickness, death and decomposition. 2 As the dominant theory of disease causation for several hundred years, \"miasma\" was the precursor to modern \"germ theory.\" An understanding of the nature of infection and contagion and its airborne, waterborne, or contact-mediated means of transmission in epidemics emerged as early as the 12th century. 3 A definitive link between microorganisms and specific diseases had yet to be accepted in Hahne mann's time, but the stage was Louis Klein: Nosodes Copyright by Narayana Publishers 79400 KandernIntroduction 12in many ways already set; the theorists had long debated the possibility. t he existence of microorganisms had been established and accepted 75 years before Hahne mann's birth, and \"seeds\" of specific contagion had been proposed as a means of disease causation at least 130 years earlier.4 Given its common usage, it was a natural enough step for Hahne mann to appropriate the term \"miasm\" and remold its definition to envelop the whole of his theory regarding the origin of chronic disease. He included the role of specific infectious agents, but also drew attention to the cre- ation of a long-lasting \"miasmatically induced\" \"change of state\" as a result of a disturbance in the energetic field, or the vital force surrounding and permeating the body. In Hahne mann's view and in subsequent usage within the homeopathic profession, the word evoked both the energetic and contagious aspect. t his ability to combine simultaneously energetic, vitalistic views with sci- entific ones is part of the splendor of homeo pathy. t o effectively grasp the meaning and utilize the concept of miasm, a description needs to include the energetic and infectious facets. w e will discuss this further. nosode each miasm has a nosode associated with it. A nosode is a homeopath- ically-prepared remedy made from an infectious disease product either directly from the bacteria or virus, or less directly from a tissue purported to contain it. Due to potentization - the dilution and shaking - nosodes lose their infectious nature even while their energetic possibilities are increased. As I do not practice an isopathic or pleomorphic approach, there will be little discussion in this book of these methodologies. w ith an emphasis on the disposition of miasms and nosodal remedies, the isopathic approach is marginalized. t he use of homeopathically prepared vaccines in the treatment of chronic disease and for the effects of vaccination (but not as a replacement for immunization) will be discussed in volume 2. As mentioned, some of the meanings of words and concepts used here have changed and evolved from Hahne mann's original ideas. t herefore, it is important to discuss the historical evolution of the concepts related to miasms and nosodes to which we now turn. Louis Klein: Miasms and Nosodes Copyright by Narayana Publishers 79400 Kandern438rattus I have included Rattus in this section in order to shed more light on the Yersinia miasm. homeopathic . abbreviations Ratt-r. (Synthesis only, which also has rattus is the black rat (also known as the house, roof or ship rat) which is now largely confined to hotter parts of the world. It has mainly been supplanted in cooler parts of the world (including e urope and most of North America) by Rattus norvegicus, the brown, common or Norway rat. Both the black and the brown rat originated from Asia. Jayesh Shan in India proved Rattus rattus, while Nancy Herrick's Califor - nia proving featured blood from a pet rat of the species Rattus norvegi- cus, hence her alternative remedy name Sanguis soricis (blood of a rat in Latin).I have added this remedy description because it is very pertinent to the Yersinia remedies and I hope it will help to elucidate the whole miasm. scientific .n ames Rattus rattus Rattus commentary Since the two homeopathic provings are of closely related species, I will use the simple name \"Rattus'\" to describe the combined remedy picture in this commentary.Enterobacteriales: related remedies r att-n. . & .r att-r. KandernRattus 439r ats conjure up all sorts of images but primarily for most individuals a negative and even fearful reaction. r ats are also historically associated with the plague and the spread of disease as well as nocturnal, dark, dank and shadowy places. t he words \"rat,\" \"ratty,\" ratfink,\" etc. are all used in a derogatory fashion, to deride someone for their sneaky or unethical actions. \" r atting on someone\" or \"being a rat,\" refers to someone who tells another's secrets or a group's secrets to selfishly save themselves and/or for personal gain. t he word \"packrat\" describes someone who compul- sively hoards items. t hese are the ways that the actions of rats have crept into our culture and vocabulary, reflecting our general feelings towards them and our understanding of their actions. t he twists and turns of our language reveal much about the remedy itself. t he patient who needs Rat- tus as their homeopathic remedy may conjure up many of the images that the words above bring to mind, be that secretive action, revealing secrets or taking things which do not belong to them. Similar to other remedies in the Yersinia miasm, with the homeopathic remedy made from rat's blood, we see an attempt to sabotage . those in authority and those who are successful. In particular we see attacks on those who have some sense of purpose or integrity to what they are doing and who are successful in the form of practical outcomes. As a practitio- ner, these patients will attempt ultimately to undermine your success by virtue of how they interact with you during the course of their treatment. there is a lack of respect for another's possessions and for what others have earned, as well as an attempt to destroy the sense of integrity that another person may have. Inside there is a sense of wanting to use others for their own selfish dark purposes. In the North American proving one of the prov- ers says, \" t here's a glimpse of the darkness in me, wanting to claim her, use her, albeit with the best of intentions.\" t his also expresses another aspect of what I have seen in Rattus patients: they have little self-awareness about their actions (and little need for it). t heir actions are not so much out of craftiness but more from instinctual desires; they feel that their intentions are good and, as found throughout this miasm, \"egalitarian.\" there is a lack of awareness as to taking responsibility for others. During the Indian Rattus proving, one of the provers states: \"I was indifferent to my responsibility and duty as a doctor.\" t here is an underlying indiffer - ence towards the welfare of others and little sense of guilt. As a practi- tioner, you will get an uncomfortable feeling from the person who needs this remedy. t his can manifest in a number of situations. As a practitioner treating the patient who needs Rattus you may see that, after each (cor - rect and incorrect) prescription, this patient will do something to sabo- tage any positive benefits gained - mainly by starting other therapies. Not only that, they will attempt to create disharmony between you and your employees or other professionals (or, if you know them better, your r att-n. . & .r att-r. Louis by Narayana Publishers 79400 Kandern440friends). t hey will attempt to mess with your possessions or accomplish- ments, as does a packrat. Paradoxically, in spite of being shadowy in their dealings, they can be quite socially active and even have an extroverted quality, especially in the healthier stages. Underlying such extroversion, however, there remains a proactive desire to mess with others' material things or accom-plishments, both materially and psychologically. On the other hand, it's not really the rat alone that causes the plague. t he rat carries a flea (the most common such is the Oriental r at flea, Xeno- psylla cheopis) and it is the flea that carries the bacteria. Dispositionally, then, you could say that the patient feels wrongly accused of many things, concomitant with a state of not really caring deeply, or not having any sense of duty or compassion. Deeper inside they can feel ugly, despised, and invisible. t his feeling exists in conjunction with a kind of delusion or belief that others mistreat them. t hey have the impression that they have been mistreated and excluded - especially in situations where they decide to be compliant. t hey are resentful of this and can actively com- plain of it, albeit in private. In the two provings the elements of living in the shadows, idols, and then destruction and darkness each came through: all these are part of the Yersinia miasm. t here was also a theme of sabotaging the happiness of others (and especially of male authority), both of which I have seen in clinical practice. Nancy Herrick writes in the introduction to her proving: t he main theme .... is secrets. Listen to the words of the provers: \"Didn't want to be seen .... people who sit all day looking out of their secret worlds .... w e were having a secret affair. Something about this stuff wants to remain hidden .... .\" t hese are deep, dark, profound secrets: \"not exactly insane but not your everyday, run-of-the-mill .... .\" She also mentions that these have to do with sexual secrets. My clini-cal experience confirms these insights. t his focus combines with those themes that I have discussed above to present as a desire to tell sexual secrets about others while they themselves stay in the shadows. In this regard, there is an interest in (or dreams of) \"cheap\" sexuality or dirty things. t his can also manifest as a voyeurism, in the original sexual sense, but also as the desire to know another's business along with the envy of such. I find that these patients reveal much about their sexual partner but lit- tle about themselves. Additionally, they can feel that their partner is the r att-n. . & .r att-r. Enterobacteriales: related remedies Narayana Publishers 79400 KandernRattus 441cause of all their problems and can actively work to undermine him or her. In children or teenagers this may be indicative of the way they view their father especially, as the one in authority (compare Ammonium car - bonicum). t hey may hold deep grudges - again, note that same remedy. t he patient has a constant inner complaint that they are being \"put upon\" - particularly when asked to do something for another person. In other words, as came out in the proving and as I have confirmed in my own clinical experience, they feel they are \"prostituting\" themselves when they give anything. t his is another main theme of this remedy. t hey may express it as feeling that their husband treats them \"like a prostitute\" or they may have many dreams of prostitutes, as arose in one of the prov-ings. t hey have the sense that they are exploited but, in getting the whole pic- ture, you catch a glimpse of the fact that it is they who are exploitative even while the delusion of being exploited is constantly on their mind. e ither they keep all of this very secret or if they do confide any sexual problems to you as a practitioner, the patient may go into too much detail on sexual issues. If there are sexual problems they blame their partner. After a while, though, you get a sense that they are the ones who have the base sexual nature which they attribute to (and blame on) their partner. t his will prove to be an important remedy for the treatment of cancer and AIDS. names . and .

Pet rats are Brown r ats descended from those bred for research, and are often called \"fancy rats\", but they are still the same species as the common city \"sewer\" rat. Domesticated rats tend to be both more docile than their wild ancestors and more disease-prone, presumably due to inbreeding. the common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans. Many wild rats carry a number of diseases and parasites, but which diseases, and what percentage of the rat population is infected, vary with the population under study. Some parasites may have interest- ing effects on rat behavior which benefit the parasite. r ats can carry over thirty different diseases dangerous to humans, includ- ing w eil's disease, typhus, salmonella and bubonic plague. t he Black Death (which killed at least 75 million people in e urope, the Middle e ast and Asia in the mid-late 14th century) is traditionally believed to have been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, car - ried by the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis which preyed on R. rattus living in e uropean cities of the day; it is notable that these rats were victims of the plague themselves. r egardless, w hile modern wild rats can carry Leptospirosis and some other zoonotic conditions (those which can be transferred across species, to humans, for example), these conditions are r att-n. . & .r att-r.

Around 26% of all electrical cable breaks are caused by rats, and around 18% of all phone cable breaks. Around 25% of all fires of unknown origin are estimated to be caused by rats. r ats are frequently blamed for damaging food supplies and other goods. when it comes to conducting tests related to intelligence, learning and drug abuse rats are a popular choice due to their high intelligence, inge-nuity, aggressiveness and adaptability. . A 2007 study found rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only found in humans and some primates. It was discovered that rats emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic, socially- induced vocalization during rough and tumble play, and when tickled. t he vocalization is described as a distinct \"chirping.\" Humans cannot hear the \"chirping\" without special equipment. It was also discovered that like humans, rats have \"tickle skin.\" t hese are certain areas of the body which generate more laughter response than other areas. t he laughter is associated with positive emotional feelings and social bonding occurs with the human tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. t hose that laughed the most also played the most, and those that laughed the most preferred to spend more time with other laugh-ing rats. t his suggests a social preference to other rats exhibiting similar responses. However, as the rats age, there does appear to be a decline in the tendency to laugh and response to tickle skin. t he initial goal of Pank- sepp & Burgdorf's research (2003) was to track the biological origins of joyful and social processes of the brain by comparing rats and their rela-tionship to the joy and laughter commonly experienced by children in social play. Although, the research was unable to prove rats have a sense of humor, it did indicate rats can laugh and express joy. Chirping by rats is also reported in other studies, where rats have been seen to chirp when wrestling one another, before receiving morphine, or having sex. t he sound has been interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. clinical .
