I adore his Duchy Originals food range - even if the pasties do contain more fat than a Big Mac.* So I was dismayed to read that a row has broken out over his health tinctures. There are three - one to detox, one to help lift the mood and a third, claims the maker, to relieve symptoms of the common cold and flu. These 50ml bottles come with a pipette that dispenses 2.5ml doses of brown liquid - the Duchy recommends you add drops to water twice a day for maximum health benefits - and sell at \u00a310 a go. Tried, and tested: Professor Ernst criticised the Prince's tinctures, above, but Sharon said she felt 'chipper' all week after taking Duchy's Hyperi-Lift Figurehead: Charles with a bag of his Duchy Originals However, this month Professor Edzard Ernst, one of Britain's leading experts in alternative medicine, said the detox tincture did not work. Prof Ernst, director of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter's Peninsula Medical School, even accused Prince Charles of peddling 'quackery' and ignoring science to 'rely on make-believe and superstition'. He is right in a way - new medicines have to undergo rigorous clinical trials before going on the market. There have been no such trials on these tinctures and reports of their success are anecdotal. The Duchy team say their tinctures are made by homeopathic and herbal medicine experts Nelsons, and comply to the highest regulatory standards. There is scant medical evidence that these work either, but millions swear by them. I tested the Duchy range for a week - as alternative health fads go, this is one of the easier ones I have tried. I once had a hosepipe inserted somewhere unmentionable at a Thai health spa in the belief I was somehow flushing out toxins, so taking a herbal preparation was always going to be a doddle. I also spoke to pharmacist Dr Nyokabi Musila, a University of London research fellow specialising in clinical guidelines, drug discovery and development, to find out if there really is any chance these liquids could improve my health. Detox Contents: Artichoke extract (Cynara scolymus) extraction solvent is ethanol. Claims: Food supplement to help eliminate toxins and aid digestion. The only real effect was a tendency to run to the loo slightly more often. I'd say I wasn't as bloated as I usually am after a drinking session on St Patrick's Day, and a little perkier, but who knows whether that was down to the artichoke, the iced water I served it in or the alcohol that is part of the tincture-making process? No great benefit, but also no harm done. Dr Nyokabi says: Dandelion and artichoke act as a liver stimulant, increasing bile production, which may be referred to as detoxing because the liver has a role in metabolism. Artichoke has been used as a traditional medicine in Brazil for a range of conditions, including liver and gallbladder problems. Dandelion is believed to be a diuretic, so it could increase the diuretic side effects of other drugs to treat heart conditions. The leaves also contain minerals and Vitamins A and C. This tincture may be of benefit, but more research is warranted. Hyperi-Lift Contents: Dried St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) flowering tops and ethanol. Claims: A traditional herbal medicinal product used to relieve the symptoms of slightly low mood and mild anxiety. This one I loved. Maybe it was the sunshine but I felt chipper all week. I even did some gardening. I ladled the stuff out in the This Morning TV studios, where I'm TV critic, offering the cutback-facing masses some 'Prince Charles liquid sunshine'. We even slipped some into TV sourpuss and Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner's fruit juice. My GP, Dr Mark Ashworth, was enthusiastic, saying St John's Wort is commonly used in Germany and studies have shown it to be 'better than nothing, although not quite as good as Prozac'. Dr Nyokabi says: International research organisation the Cochrane Collaboration found St John's Wort lifts depression, possibly by keeping the chemical serotonin, which is linked to positive moods, in the brain for longer. A study by St James' University hospital in Leeds found it was the only alternative medicine proven to have an effect. In some countries, physicians can prescribe it. It is known to interact with certain pharmaceutical medicines used to treat heart disease, depression, seizures, certain cancers or to prevent conditions such as transplant rejection or pregnancy, and therefore a health professional should be consulted before taking it. I have known people to benefit from using it and would recommend it for mild depression. Echina-Relief Contents: Dried Echinacea purpurea root and ethanol. Claims: A herbal medicinal product used to relieve symptoms of the common cold and flu-type infections based on traditional use. It didn't work for us. I gave it to a drippy-nosed neighbour who said her week finished as badly as it had started. But I shall keep it to serve with chicken soup to provide a boost of royal-approved healing for friends. Dr Nyokabi says: Echinacea is used in traditional North American medicine and is believed to help stimulate the body's immune system. A US study reported echinacea decreased the odds of catching a cold by 58 per cent and the duration of colds by a day-anda-half, although other clinical trials reported no benefits. A Cochrane review found it to be beneficial. I'd recommend this tincture in combination with other supplements such as ginger, Vitamin C and zinc as well as plenty of rest. But it's not for those suffering progressive auto-immune disorders such as AIDS, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis and lupus. *Duchy Original pasties contain 264 calories and 5.5g of saturated fat per 100g, a Big Mac has 229 calories and 4.14g of saturated fat per 100g.
