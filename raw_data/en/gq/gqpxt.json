Healthy for Life U will help you build a strong foundation of health for you and your family! The Healthy for Life U teamWelcome!Jacob C. Velie National Integrative Health My personal passion for health started when my mother was diagnosed with acute leu - kemia when I was 7 years old. After four years of treatments and fighting, my mother passed away in my father's arms, on the edge of her hospital bed, as I looked on. After her death, I became interested in the human body, health and disease. Through - out my childhood, I was also morbidly obese, weighing almost 290 pounds as a high school senior. These factors drove me to seek further information about the body and research how it really worked. Even though I participated in strength training, track and played football, my weight was out of control and I didn't feel well. I was told I would be heavy for the rest of my life because my family was heavy. I have since developed my own program based on research and lost nearly 100 lbs. in five months. I have been recognized nationally by the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition. Driven by my experience and success, I studied to become a personal trainer, and com - mitted my life to helping others achieve the same physical and mental transformation My background in physiology, personal training and self-studies in cellular biology, nu - trition and dietetics, neuroscience and biophysics has served me over my 11-year career in health education, clinical health consulting and clinical administration. I have had the pleasure of working with many physician groups, universities, companies and families around the country. Most recently, I spent five years as the founder and CEO of Preventive Health Group, an integrative medical clinic in Des Moines, Iowa, that practiced family medicine, physical medicine, rehabilitation, lifestyle education and psychotherapy. The clinic served as an internship and experiential learning location for medical and pharmacy students, as well as an educational center for graduating nurses and students. The knowledge and experience I have gained in my personal and professional life has been built into the Healthy for Life U curriculum. This course is the culmination of years of experience, research and learning from mentors. It's exciting to see the amazing re - sults in thousands of families and individuals around the country. I pray this experience changes your life as it has so positively changed mine.MEET THE TEACHER ABOUT THE AUTHORMaster Your Health 501 - The Awakening ......................................................................................... 1-1 502 - Nutrition and You ................................................................................... 2-1 503 - Shop Till You Drop .................................................................................. 3-1 504 - Prepared and Dangerous .................................................................... 4-1 505 - Top Chef ..................................................................................................... 5-1 506 - Supplementation ...................................................................... 6-1 507 Environment ................................................................................... 7-1 508 - Movement ................................................................................................. 8-1 509 - Natural Family Care ................................................................................ 9-1 510 - Renew Your Mind ................................................................................ 10-1 511 - Medicine Revisited .............................................................................. 11-1 512 - Bringing It All Together ..................................................................... 12-1 Table of ContentsTABLE OF CONTENTSKids' health!

U HEALTHY FORLIFE 501The Awakening 1-1 501 THE AWAKENING Discovering the Potential of Health and Hope for Y our Future. What is health? World Health Organization definition: Health is a state of complete physi - cal, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Chronic Disease Management - \"Managed\" with meds No symptoms of disease - Hope to not catch \"something\" Thrive - Enough energy and vitality to truly enjoy all aspects of life Where are you? Rate yourself on the Health Potential Scale. _________ List a few things that are most important to you in your life: _____________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________ Are these things affected by your health? __________ Definition holistic 1. emphasizing the importance of the whole and the interdepen - dence of its parts. 2. concerned with wholes rather than analysis or separa - tion into parts. Yes We are called to serve. How you feel physically and emo - tionally will have an effect on how you serve others. God has given each of you a gift from His great variety of spiritual gifts. Use them well to serve one another. - 1 Peter 4:10 Tyndale House Publishers. (2004). Holy Bible: New Living Translation. (2nd ed.)

Key Point: Most disease is preventable. The field of cellular biology claims that less than ______ of ALL disease is ge - netic. This means that ______ of ALL disease is preventable through lifestyle and health design. - Dr. Bruce Lipton, The Wisdom of Your Cells. It has long been assumed that our ______________________ run our life and determine our level of health.holistic full life potential 2% 98%+ genetics Our bodies are more than just physical, we are also spiritual. We need to take care of the body we have been given. Don't you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself, for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body. - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 Tyndale House Publishers. (2004). Holy Bible: New Living Translation. (2nd ed.) Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale House Publishers.1-3 501 THE AWAKENING It has recently become understood that our genes are actually ______ in control of our health and our lifestyles, in the vast majority of cases. ________________________ have a much more important impact on the quality of life and level of health we experience. Gene Expression (Epigenetics) This refers to how-when-why any specific gene would go through the pro - cess of being ________________________ (RNA). The regulatory proteins in the body _____________________ this process through reading the needs of the body and the signals coming from the environment in which the body lives. Not all genes are expressed, and some ______________________ are.

This means ____________________ for a great quality of life for everyone! The vast majority of doctors do not believe their patients will make the necessary lifestyle changes to improve their health and stick with it, or they do not believe it is possible for lifestyle changes to resolve diseases. This is why the system does not focus on lifestyle changes or disease resolution. Y our Body Every system in the body is designed to work together to keep you _______________________. The definition of symptom is a __________________ from normal function or feeling that is noticed by a patient, indicating the presence of disease or abnormality. It is vital to observe, in the definition, that a symptom is an indication of the presence of disease, and not the disease itself. So why are we treating the evidence instead of looking for the cause? When you ____________________ symptoms, you are still allowing the dis - ease to exist without check or gauge of its progression. The proper literal words for symptoms would be __________________, _____________________ or _____________________. Symptoms are like _____________________________ lights for your body to tell you something needs to change or something needs attention. When symptoms occur, your body needs __________________ to fix the underlying problems in order to _______________. Your body has that in - nate ability.reversible hope healthy departure treat indication suggestion sign check engine support heal Our bodies were created to be healthy. Then God looked over all He had made, and He saw that it was very good! And evening passed and morning came, marking the sixth day. - Genesis 1:31 Tyndale House Publishers. (2004).

In conventional medicine, the idea of prevention is ____________________ or _________________________ , which is not prevention at all. Your body was built to _________________ and be ___________________. The Principle of Regeneration You are ______________________ hundreds of millions of cells every sec - ond and replacing or recycling cells that are no longer productive. The science of how - How body is supposed to work under ideal conditions. The science of now - How your body is working now based on lifestyle. Due to the rapid rate of cellular reproduction, your body's systems are being ________________________ at an amazing rate: 1. The lining of your digestive tract (mouth, throat, stomach, intes - tines, etc.) is being regenerated/replaced every 4-6 days. 2. Vital organs like the liver and kidneys are replaced every 6 weeks. 3. The body's largest organ, the skin, is replaced every 4 weeks. 4. The skeletal system is 98% new every 10-12 months. Due to this process, all you need to do is change the ___________________ and ____________________ your body has and you will begin to see heal - ing happen rapidly.resolution management disease screening early detection heal healthy producing replaced environment resources1-6 Master Your Health 501 THE AWAKENING 501 Activity 1.

Workbook Page 1-1: Review your definition of health. Does anyone still think that health represents disease control with drugs or waiting for health problems to show up before paying attention to their body? 2. Workbook Page 1-1: Does your current definition of health align with your health and life goals? 3. Workbook Page 1-1: Where are you on the health scale? Are you happy with this or do you desire to change it? 4. Workbook Page 1-2: In the past, have you included all of the areas of health in your personal definition? Have the programs you have par - ticipated in up to this point paid attention to all of these areas? 5. Workbook Page 1-2: Jake reminded us that every desire we have in life, whether it is personal, professional, financial or health related, is 100% connected to how you take care of yourself and how healthy you are. Do you believe that feeling well and taking care of yourself can help you achieve all of the other goals in your life? 6. Workbook Pages 1-2 through 1-4: Through the science of Epigenetics we have learned that almost all disease is preventable and reversible because of the body's design and innate ability to protect and heal it - self. How does this change the view of your body or your current state of health? Are you excited to begin harnessing this wonderful intel - ligence of the body? 7. Workbook Pages 1-4 through 1-5: We have learned that symptoms are designed to help us support the body through healing. If we stop symptoms, we will interfere with or slow down the body's healing pro - cess. Where are some areas in your health that you are currently inter - fering with a symptom instead of using the symptom to help support the body through a healing process? Example: Most drugs interfere with symptoms and do not actually ad - dress the needs of the body. Lowering cholesterol with a statin drug does not address what caused the cholesterol to go up in the first place. 8. Workbook Page 1-5: It is always exciting to hear how amazing the hu - man body is. What were some things that really opened your eyes about the body's regeneration capabilities? Considering the way you treat your body, do you believe that your body is able to regenerate itself as it was designed to? 1-9 501 THE AWAKENING 9. Workbook Page 1-6: Are health problems and being too busy to take care of your health getting in the way of your goals, responsibilities and desires? Identify and write down some ways this is happening in your life right now. 10. Workbook Page 1-6: Are your goals worth the time and effort it will take to learn new lifestyle skills that can help reverse and prevent disease? Be sure that you have written down your health goals on Workbook Page 1-6.U HEALTHY FORLIFE 502Nutrition and You 2-1 502 NUTRITION & YOU What Is Nutrition? Definition nutrition 1. the supply of substances (i.e., nutrients) required by an organ - ism, directly or indirectly, for its metabolic activities, (i.e., for the provision of energy, for growth and/or for the renewal of degraded components). 2. the act or process of supplying or receiving nutrients. 3. the scientific study of the nutrient requirements of particular organisms and of the supply of those nutrients. Definition food 1. any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth. Is there a difference between nutrition and food? ______________ A new term for bringing these concepts together is ________________. Whole food will always be the ________________ processed and closest to the source you can find. In Section 1: Whole Foods in the Resource Guide , ______________ and _____________ ratings are used to help you make choices that are best for your individual stage of transition. Good foods are going to be ________________ processed.Yes Whole food least Best lessGood Whole foods are foods that have not been altered and remain in the state that God created them. God de - signed food for our bodies! You say, \"Food was made for the stomach, and the stom - ach for food. \" - 1 Corinthians 6:13a Tyndale House Publishers. (2007). Holy Bible: tion. (3rd ed.) Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale House Publishers.2-2 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU Best foods are going to take into account the ________________ of raising the food and _______________ in processing, packaging and ingredients. Whole Food Group - Protein Proteins are made of amino acids and are known as the _______________ ________________ of the body. Combinations of _______________________ bind together to make many structures in the body. The body has more than 150,000 _____________________ enzymes, made up of amino acids, that perform different functions and carry out tasks. There are two classifications of dietary amino acids: __________________ and _______________________. Without essential amino acids the body is ____________________ to com - plete all of the cellular functions necessary for the Laboratory of Human Nutrition and Clinical Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Tech - nology, Vernon R. Young. Essential components of nutrition must be _____________________, while non-essential nutrients are made in the body by using combinations of oth - er essential amino acids.methods practices building blocks amino acids different essential non-essential unable consumed2-3 502 NUTRITION & YOU There are ___________________ essential amino acids, which are mostly found in meat, dairy and egg proteins. Plant-based proteins ____________ normally contain all eight essential amino acids. The Protein Myth The _________________ that too much protein is dangerous to your kid - neys is simply unsubstantiated by either scientific proof or anecdotal evi - dence. People who eat high levels of protein simply do not have issues with their protein processing or their kidney function. Even people with proven kidney issues have not shown adverse side effects from consuming high levels (over 25% of daily caloric intake) of protein. Protein is an immense part of your body. All 100 trillion cells are made up of 50% protein. These are complex combinations of amino acids and must be supported by your ______________ . A large amount of the protein that you eat is actually used in its ______________ digestion. Many of the amino acids that make up the meats actually become the digestive enzymes necessary to efficiently di - gest the rest of the protein and make sure they get to the tissues and cells of the body! So, until we have any conclusive evidence that protein is causing anything but positive health outcomes such as optimal weight, strength, strong bones and energy, it is simply _______________________ to make claims that protein is dangerous for any part of our body. Please remember, we are talking about properly sourced, high-quality proteins.eight do not myth diet own irresponsible Historically, people have eaten animal protein and fat all the way back to biblical times. God encouraged the eating of animal protein and fat through the consump - tion of meat. When you arrive, you may use the money to buy any kind of food you want\u2014cattle, sheep, goats, wine or other alcoholic drink. Then feast there in the presence of the LORD your God and celebrate with your household. - Deuteronomy 14:26 Tyndale House Publishers. (2007). Holy Bible: tion. (3rd ed.) Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale House Publishers.2-4 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU Whole Food Group - Fat Fats serve _____________________ vital purposes in the body. They provide _______________ insulation and an efficient source of energy. Fats are also involved in ____________________ functions that include syn - thesis of fat soluble vitamins (i.e., A, D, E and K), making vital components for cell membranes and are a large part of the myelin sheaths that electrically insulate nerve fibers. Fat-soluble vitamins Vital uses of Vitamin A: Eye health Formation of cells, tissues and glands Barriers to infection Competence of macrophages (white blood cells) for immunity Proper utilization of iron to create red blood cells. Lack of Vitamin A results in anemia and defective immunity Vitamin A is most commonly found in: Eggs Whole milk Liver Yellow animal fats Carrots Spinach Sweet potatoes Red bell peppersmany thermal important2-5 502 NUTRITION & YOU Vital uses of Vitamin D: Bone structure (mineralizing, growth, and remodeling) and usage of calcium Acts as a cytokine, defending against microbial invaders Modulates neuromuscular function Reduces inflammation Influences the action of many genes that take part in proliferation (cell growth), differentiation (less specific cells become specialized, i.e., a stem cell becomes muscle or bone) and aptosis (programmed cell death) Vitamin D is most commonly found in: Created in the body from sunshine on your skin Cod liver oil Atlantic herring Catfish Oysters Salmon Trout Halibut Vital uses of Vitamin E: Primarily as an antioxidant Traps free radicals (toxins) Preventing chain reactions that create oxidation in the cells. A diet high in manufactured fats (margarines, vegetable oils, trans fats) can cause Vitamin E deficiency and contribute to premature red blood cell death2-6 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU Vitamin E is most commonly found in: Sunflower seeds Almonds Spinach Papaya Dark leafy greens Blueberries Vital uses of Vitamin K1: Appropriate regulation of blood clotting proteins (used primarily by the liver) Vital uses of Vitamin K2: Place blood calcium where it belongs in the bones and teeth Keep blood calcium out of where it does not belong, in the soft tissues (arterial calcification, etc.) Used in conjunction with Vitamin A and D Vitamin K is most commonly found in: Green grass and involved in chlorophyll and directly contributes to animals having high levels of K2 in their fat (body and milk fat). Vitamin K 1 is most commonly found in: Dark leafy greens Brussels sprouts Broccoli Onions Vitamin K 2 is most commonly found in: Animal fats and consuming meats, eggs and dairy from grass-fed animals.2-7 502 NUTRITION & YOU Fat is needed for so many important functions: Thermal insulation Efficient energy Cell membrane structure Eye health Formation of cells for glands and tissues Membranes for barriers to infection Competence of microphages vital to innate immunity Proper use of iron to create red blood cells Bone structure and uses of calcium Defends against microbial invaders Reduces inflammation Modulates neuromuscular function Influences actions of genes responsible for cell health, morphology and elimination of unhealthy cells Transporting antioxidants Major part of neuromuscular function Reduces cellular damage and DNA damage Regulation of blood clotting proteins Transports regulators for appropriate use and placement of calcium in bones vs. soft tissue After looking at this list, how would a low-fat diet affect your health? _____________________ Drugs can't carry out the functions in this list and in some cases __________ the body from carrying out these functions.Adversely inhibit2-8 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU Foods that _____________________ these valuable nutrients are primarily meat, dairy, eggs and green and orange vegetables. Whole Food Group - Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are made up of various types of _______________. The different types of ________________ that are the base for carbohy - drates are: 1. Monosaccharides (i.e., glucose or simple sugars) 2. Disaccharides 3. Trisaccharides 4. Polysaccharides (i.e., glycogen or complex sugars) Glycogen is ____________________ as energy in the cells of most tissues, but most notably in liver and muscle cells. Please pay attention to this definition from the Oxford Reference . In an ideally balanced diet, about two-thirds of the energy supply should be from carbohydrates. But unlike proteins and fats, which must provide certain essential components, no particular dietary carbohydrates are necessary for health. This may seem paradoxical, in that the brain cru - cially needs a constant supply of glucose \u2014 but this can, if necessary, be made internally from proteins. Excess of dietary carbohydrate, when the glycogen stores are filled, is converted and stored as fat, and this can be released as fatty acids when needed for energy production. Alan W. Cuthbert \"carbohydrates\" The Oxford Companion to the Body. Ed. Colin Blakemore and Sheila Jennett. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Global Informa - tion Network. provide sugars sugars stored2-9 502 NUTRITION & YOU In one statement, it is said that an ideally balanced diet should have about two-thirds of the energy supply coming from carbohydrates, \"but unlike proteins and fats, which must provide certain essential components, no particular dietary carbohydrates are necessary for health. \" The two primary _______________________ of carbohydrates that you want to be able to differentiate are: 1. Processed carbs - Chips, crackers, breads, pastas 2. Whole food carbs - Fruits, vegetables, natural dairy sugars (lactose), unprocessed grains Whole food carbs are in their most ____________________ state. Processed carbs are normally broken down, bleached and altered in a manner that doesn't make them a whole food anymore. We call these _____________________ carbs since the processing eliminates most nutri - tional content. As long as 90% of your carbohydrate intake comes from ________________ carbs, the rest can be processed with minimal risk to your health. Chlorine dioxide is one of the chemicals used to bleach processed carbs. This chemical combines with the residual proteins in these processed products and creates alloxan, which is used to induce diabetes in lab rats.categories natural white whole food2-10 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU Reading a Food Label There are a few key areas that you will want to become an expert at regard - ing your food labels: Serving Size 1 Sandwich (229 grams) Servings Per Container 1 Calories 420 Total Fat 2g Dietary Fiber 3g Sugars 11gTrans Fat 0g Amount Per Serving % Daily Value*Nutrition Facts *Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

Sugars - Can be chemically derived through GMO corn by-products. 7. Protein - Look for foods high in protein.2-11 502 NUTRITION & YOU 502 Activities Activity 1 It has long been known that the best way to get a different result, or at least accomplish something that you want, is to first become clear and aware about your current situation and what is causing it, as well as being very intentional about the goals that you have. In this week's activity, we would like to have you begin journaling. The pur - pose of journaling your foods, activities, moods and thoughts is to be able to step back and observe our current behaviors and actions. Then we will be able to move forward with a plan to change the things in our lives that hinder the accomplishment of our health and life goals. The idea of this activity is not to alter what you are doing, more to observe the way you have been doing things before any specific lifestyle changes are made or before any specific lifestyle plan is executed. So, take a few minutes a few times per day to simply log what you are doing, when you are doing it, and how you are feeling about it. There is no wrong way to do this other than not being truthful with yourself. Please write ev - erything down with as much detail as you are comfortable with and we will then use this tool to develop our plans for moving forward with changes necessary to accomplish our goals. This is not intended to be a long-term activity, just for a week or two so you can establish a good understanding of your current food choices. A sample is provided at the end of this section. For additional copies, the food journal is available as a free download from our website. Activity 2 Begin looking at the labels on the food you are eating. Notice all of the added ingredients. Activity 3 Read through the Section 1: Whole Foods in the Resource Guide to help pre - pare for the next lesson.2-12 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU Take it Further If you'd like to learn more about nutrition and your body, a good resource is the book Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon.

Workbook Page 2-4: There are a lot of us that believe that fat makes us fat and is bad for us. What has happened with the health of the popula - tion as the amount of fat-free, low fat and sugar-free foods being con - sumed has increased? What vitamins must have fat in the diet to be assimilated and used for your body's functions? 5. Workbook Pages 2-5 through 2-7: List and discuss five functions that the body must have adequate fat consumption in the diet to carry out. Is anyone suffering from symptoms that are connected to these func - tions, potentially caused by lack of dietary fat intake? 6. Workbook Pages 2-8 through 2-9: Health professionals have told us for decades that our diets need to consist of a majority of carbohydrates. Read the Oxford Reference excerpt and discuss how this affects our nu - tritional intake. 7. Workbook Page 2-8: Now that you know that dietary carbohydrates are not essential to the body, how does this change your meal plan? 8. Were you surprised to learn that most processed carbohydrates contain a chemical that induces diabetes? How does this change how you look at processed foods and how you will choose your food in the future?2-14 Master Your Health 502 NUTRITION & YOU 9. Food labels have changed so much over the years.

Before you decide to begin a meal plan or specific diet that would change the types of food you eat, you must first purchase the foods from some - where and get them into your home.

More often than not, these res - taurants are not sourcing local ingredients and are most likely going to have a higher amount of preservatives and artificial ingredients in their foods. Look for businesses that openly communicate their commitment to local ingredients. Normally these locations will have information on their menus and websites about the farmers they source from or the foods that they offer that are most fresh. Do an Internet search for organic or local restaurants. Again, they will most likely pop up in a search of \"organic restaurants (insert the city you are interested in). \" Business owners are always proud of the extra work they put in to bring you the highest quality, seasonal ingre - dients. Whole food grocery The best ways to spot your local options: Most of the larger supermarkets now have small- to medium-sized areas that focus on \"health foods. \" Make sure to seek out organics in areas like these as non-organics are usually not up to the standards you will be looking for. Just because a food is in the health food section doesn't necessarily mean that it is healthy for you. Many times the processed foods found there will be the \"lesser of two evils, \" as they are normally not packed with so much junk (i.e., organic chips vs. regular chips).3-8 Master Your Health503 SHOP TILL YOU DROP Do some research on search engines. Use searches like \"health food stores (insert your city here). \" Other useful search words would be: farmers markets, co-ops, CSAs or searching for farms in your local area that sell produce, eggs and other fresh-from-the-farm products. Again, it is important that you ask your farmers about their growing practices too. There are national websites dedicated to listing local and organic food options as mentioned above. Here are a few of these website resources: Local Harvest - www.localharvest.org: Type in your ZIP code to find local farmers, farmers markets, restaurants, CSAs and grocery stores. Organic Highways - www.organichighways.com: Farmers, co-ops, bakeries and restaurants. Search by state. Eat Well Everywhere - www.eatwellguide.org : Farmers, co-ops, bak - eries and restaurants.

We are going to explore the application strategies that will help you get there. Whether or not you have health issues now, this chapter will help you develop the way that you shape your health. Let's review some extremely important facts that we have covered in previous lessons: The vast majority of disease is preventable and/or reversible. Your body is amazingly designed to experience health as a \"default. \" Nutrients work directly with the body to accomplish normal func - tion. When nutrients and tools are lacking, we experience symptoms. The origin of the food we eat is more important than the specific diet we choose. The purpose of this lesson is to learn how to utilize whole food groups and nutrients to accomplish the type of health and life we want.digest Meal planning Health God wants us to have an abundant life and be willing and able to meet His call.

Myth #1 Y ou must eat a _______________________ diet. First, what is a \"balanced diet\"? Well, if you ask the experts, they are all go - ing to give you a different answer. But if we look at some important history lessons, we will find that there really wasn't that much \"balance\" (as conven - tionally defined) in the diets of our healthier ancestors.deliberate balanced4-3 504 - PREPARED & DAN - GEROUS Geography - Before the rise of the Industrial Revolution, we did not have access to foods that were not able to be grown within a short distance around the areas we lived. This limitation was due to lack of shipping speed and lack of mass preservation techniques like refrig - eration. Weather - If the region that you lived in was too cold or too hot, you simply did not have access to certain foods as they did not grow in your region. Also, seasonal foods would not be available for extended periods during the year. Myth #2 Calories in... ________________________. If this widespread myth was true, we simply wouldn't have an obesity and chronic disease epidemic today. The belief that you can simply decrease your caloric intake and you will lose weight at a rate equal to your decrease (i.e., caloric deficit of 3,500 calories will always equate to a 1lb. weight loss) is not taking into account the dynamic nature of the body or the multifaceted nature of the factors in your lifestyle that have an effect on your body. Myth #3 Y ou must eat _________ small meals a day, or 3 squares a day. If you have ever read a book on dieting or listened to reports on the news, you have read and heard various experts advocating 5-6 small meals per day or advocating for the old-school \"3 squares\" approach. The bottom line is that they both have a purpose. Knowing which approach matches your goals and lifestyle, you will be able to formulate your meal plan correctly for you. The quality of the food is much more important than the frequency of eating.calories out 5 - 64-4 Master Your Health 504 PREPARED & DANGEROUS Myth #4 A calorie is a _____________________. Now, we have covered this myth in great detail in previous chapters, but it is still very important to pay attention to it because this is the belief of many nutritionists and dieticians. A calorie just being a calorie, no matter where it comes from, simply doesn't take the current industry and culture into ac - count. Even cardboard has a caloric value, but no nutritional value. This be - lief is outdated and unscientific. Myth #5 Low-fat, no-fat and ________________________ foods are healthier and lead to weight loss and increased health better than their unaltered counterparts (whole milk, yogurt, cheese, butter, etc.). Again, this is a topic that we have already covered in previous lessons but it has to be talked about as it is a cultural mainstay. Products that are taken out of their natural state, stripped of their original nutrients and stuffed full of all kinds of chemical and synthetic components, are simply not a better choice than their natural counterparts. Has the creation and sale of these types of foods improved our health? YES / NO Myth #6 One size fits all for nutrition. _____________________ should eat the same types and amounts of foods. I think we all know the answer to this myth. We are all obviously different and that would mean that it is not only OK, but healthy, to eat differently than others. You will most likely, after a period of time and application, be able to tell what balance of macronutrients you thrive on (proteins / carbs / fats) and what whole foods you most enjoy to deliver the nutrition your body needs.sugar-freecalorie Everyone4-5 504 - PREPARED & DAN - GEROUS The Key Principles to Becoming an Expert Meal Planner Many would agree that the number one reason people fail to follow-through on a meal plan is due to lack of planning or lack of skills around meal plan - ning and preparation. You must develop new skills that allow you to become more ____________, ______________________ and _____________________ with the types of activities that will lead to the attainment of your goals. Game Changer #1 Y ou must learn how to work with and ________________ food. Not having the skills to prepare food with ease will drastically limit your abil - ity to accomplish your goals for life and health. We have not found an al - ternative to food prep unless the budget is unlimited to find restaurants or private chefs who make the food you need. Game Changer #2 Y ou must create and ___________________ your food sourcing strategy. It is vitally important for you to know where you are going to get your foods. It will take a little bit of time and research, just like anything in life that is new. Once you know where your foods are and set up your schedule to get them, buying foods will be quick and calculated. Game Changer #3 Y ou must know what you are going to do if you are _________________ for any given situation.efficient comfortable knowledgeable prepare execute unprepared4-6 Master Your Health 504 PREPARED & DANGEROUS The ability to think on the fly and apply your knowledge of food and food processing is key. You will most likely not be able to find a perfect solution, but knowing your stuff will help you make a decision and find solutions that still nourish your body and increase your capacity for health. Game Changer #4 Be an ____________________ at eating out, if and when necessary. The restaurants in your area are important for you to know. There are count - less times when failure to prepare or plan ahead will lead to eating out. That is not a bad thing and will not throw you off of reaching your goals as long as you know the places that make the types of foods that will improve your health. These are usually locally owned restaurants that advertise and edu - cate their patrons about the source of their foods. Game Changer #5 Know your ingredients and ________________ terminology. With the lack of effective regulation on how companies bend the truth re - garding the health benefits and ingredients in their food, we as consumers must take the responsibility upon ourselves to understand the meaning be - hind the label. Game Changer #6 Have your _________________ stocked and thawed for use. Set out the protein for that day's supper in the morning to make sure you have your meal base ready to go. Game Changer #7 Eat __________________ foods. Eating foods that are seasonal will ensure that their nutrient content is at its peak, and they will always taste better too. These foods can be obtained from a local grower instead of shipping an out-of-season food halfway around the world.expert food labeling proteins seasonal4-7 504 - PREPARED & DAN - GEROUS Apples Asparagus Beets Blueberries Broccoli Brussels Sprouts Cabbage Carrots Cauliflower Celery Collards Corn Cranberries Grapes Green Beans Leeks Lettuce Melon Mushrooms Onions Peaches Pears Peas Peppers Potatoes Pumpkins Raspberries Rutabagas Spinach Summer Squash Strawberries Sweet Potatoes Tomoatoes Turnips Winter SquashWinter Fresh Produce Spring Summer AutumnFruits and vegetables all have seasons, the time of year where they are at there best and have the most nutrition.

Many people make the mistake of wanting to have too many different foods in their new meal plans. You will end up setting your expectations too high for preparation and this usually causes frustration. Eventually, you will revert back to what is familiar. It is much better to eat a few foods over and over again until you become more skilled with food preparation and cooking. Then you can diversify all you want. Using the Reference Guide Reference Guide 12 Weeks to Life-Long HealthHealthy LifeforTMIn the Section 2: Meal Planning in the Reference Guide , foods listed in the green section are primary foods that can be consumed freely. Use these foods to plan your meal around. We have noted serving sizes in Section 1: Whole Foods in the Reference Guide . Foods listed in the yellow sections, just right of the primary foods, are foods you can accent your meal with. Foods listed in the red sections, to the far right, signify foods that should not be consumed as a staple in your meal plan. These foods are normally flour- based processed foods and are not as high in nutrients as the primary and secondary whole food groups, due to their nutrients being stripped away by heavy processing. PRIMARY PROTEIN & FAT CHOOSE THESE FIRST A primary protein describes a core whole food for your meal plan.

PRIMARY CARBOHYDRATE CHOOSE THESE FIRST Primary carbohydrates are always known as \"living\" or fresh foods. Examples are fruits, vegetables, root vegetables and other foods that are closely as - sociated with whole foods, such as fermented or cultured foods (sauerkraut, yogurt, etc.). SECONDARY CARBOHYDRATE SUPPLEMENT WITH THESE Primary carbohydrates do not include grains. Grains should be used as an accent food or secondary whole food focus after you have planned your intake of primary carbohydrates. Quick Steps of Implementation Section 2: Meal Planning in the Reference Guide includes breakfast, lunch, din - ner, snack and shake ideas and recipes. 1. Set a date to convert your food sourcing and meal plan. This will give you some time for the transition but will also hold you to a dead - line for healthier eating.

Cauliflower is not something that you need to avoid, even though it is white. Eliminate Gluten. Eliminate all ___________ from the daily diet. This will include yogurt, milk and cheese. The primary goal is to avoid the lactose (natural milk sugar). Use __________ flavorings like Redmond Real Salt, vinegars and raw oils. Do not use regular salad dressings as they will normally have add - ed sugars. Eliminate __________________ from your daily diet.

We have provided a meal planning worksheet for your convenience at the end of this lesson. You can download and print additional sheets from our website. It is important to sit down and plan what you and your family are going to prepare and eat during the next week. Take some time once a week to plan out what you will be preparing. Use these steps to help you be successful in your meal planning. 1. Gather recipes and then write down what you need to get at the gro - cery store. 2. Go shopping for everything that you have written down. 3. Make some of the ingredients or dishes on the weekend, so when you come home from a long day you will have a quick, ready-to-heat meal. Having some of the longest-to-prepare items ready ahead of time makes making meals easy and quick. Some things you can even make ahead of time and freeze. Examples of this are chicken pot pie, chili, soup, etc. Activity 2 After creating your meal plan, create your shopping list using the template provided at the end of this lesson.slowlyfour4-13 504 - PREPARED & DAN - GEROUS Take it Further Visit www.mambosprouts.com for coupons and resources for whole foods.

Having _______________ tasting food as youngsters, causing us to believe that the specific foods we remember as something we don't like at all. We need to re-evaluate these beliefs and try these foods again in different forms.

Is it really a surprise that the further away we get from the wisdom of previous generations, we find ourselves in a health crisis? Supplementation is the last lesson to close out the Nutrition and Health sec - tion of the course. Supplementing our diets has become necessary because our modern food, environment and lifestyle may cause vulnerability to dis - ease due to gaps in our nutrient load and ability to assimilate. Supplements are very specifically purposed to fill this ________ and deliver the essential nutrients our body needs to operate at its highest capacity. Definition Supplements (dietary) - Legally defined in the U.S. as products contain - ing vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances for use to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake. They are _____________________ from regulation as either food additives or drugs.

In all cases, the companies uti - lizing these claims have no way of proving their supplements actually fall into these categories because these categories simply do not exist. The only way a company can claim to have a pharmaceutical-grade supple - ment is if they have a written letter of certification from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). Most likely, when asked to provide this, they will be unable to do so. The purpose of this lesson is to explore the fundamentals of choosing supplements that might be necessary for your body and why supplements are necessary to consider in the first place. Let's take a look at the fundamental reasons that supplementation needs to be considered as a tool in your health goals. Just because you ______________ it, doesn't mean it \"entered\" your body. Definition Malnutrition - The condition arising due to the lack of one or more of the nutrients that are required in the diet to maintain health. Malnutrition can result from a reduced intake of nutrients (undernourishment), an inability to use absorbed nutrients (malabsorption), failure to meet a required increase in nutrient intake or nutrient losses. \"malnutrition\" A Dictionary of Biology.

Nutri - tional diseases are commonly associated with chronic malnutrition. 2. __________________________ - disease that is long-lasting or recur - rent. The term chronic describes the course of the disease, or its rate of onset and development. A chronic course is distinguished from a re - current course; recurrent diseases relapse repeatedly, with periods of remission in between. As an adjective, chronic can refer to a persistent and lasting medical condition. Chronicity is usually applied to a condi - tion that lasts more than three months. Malnutrition is mostly present in America with a term known as ___________________________. The World Health Organization cites malnutrition as the gravest single threat to the world's public health. \" Improving nutrition is widely regarded as the most effective form of aid for world health. Emergency measures include providing deficient micronutrients...directly through supplements. \" Why Should Y ou Consider Supplements?

Core supplementation Core supplementation should consist of ___________________________ nutrients (must be taken in through your diet) to ensure these nutrients are properly absorbed in adequate supply for base health. Proteins Essential Amino Acids (EAAs). For a complete list, see 502. Most essential amino acids can be obtained from meat, dairy and egg sources. Supplemen - tation is not typically needed. If you have a difficult time accomplishing whole food intake of these nutrients, please remember the following infor - mation.essential6-5 506 - SMART SUPPLE - MENTATION Consider the source: Proteins are vital to most action in the human body (cells are 50% amino acids). Amino acids need to be sourced from an appropriate, natural source. It is common for protein to become denatured in processing, rendering it useless and possibly even harmful. This is another reason to understand the source of your protein and make sure you are supplementing with a non- denatured, \"native\" source of protein. It is also important to make sure you are supplementing with the entire spectrum of essential amino acids, as these need to come from your diet. Lipids Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) are known as LA (Linoleic Acid: Omega 6) and ALA (Alpha Linolenic Acid: Omega 3). All other omega fatty acids are derived from these two __________________ sources, and are thusly called derivatives. With respect to fatty acids, only 8% or less (normally stated between 1-5%) of the parent form Omegas are converted to any type of derivative. The body prefers to utilize the parent omega oils primarily. Consider the source: 1. Essential fatty acids make up an immense amount of our cellular vol - ume (roughly 50%). In the body, omega 6 fatty acids are 15-35 times more prevalent than omega 3 fatty acids in both fatty tissues and blood-borne fats (triglycerides). 2. There are very ____________________ parent omega 3 or parent omega 6 fats in fish oil. Fish contain these high levels of derivatives \"parent\" little6-6 Master Your Health506 - SMART SUPPLE - MENTATION because their body needs to operate much differently than the hu - man body. Fish live in different environments and in much different temperatures (cold-blooded vs. warm-blooded). Fish are simply not designed like humans and are not the magic bullet for supplements in our diet. Due to these differences, fish contain large amounts of deriv - ative fatty acids (EPA and DHA, not parent omegas), which are in much higher amounts and ratios than those found in the properly regulated human body. When consuming fish oil as a primary source of fatty acid supplementation, you are actually mega-dosing the body with levels of derivative fats (EPA and DHA), which is not how the body regulates its own fatty acids. 3. Proper fatty acid supplementation should always focus on the parent sources of fatty acids LA (Linoleic Acid: Omega 6) and ALA (Alpha-Lin - olenic Acid: Omega 3). When taking lessons from human physiology, we find the fatty acid structures to be predominantly the parent form fats (LA and ALA). Supplements should always focus on parent forms of omegas with very little derivative content. 4. These supplements should also be organic in nature and _____________________ sourced. Because of their high concentra - tion, you do not want to take a supplement that could potentially carry concentrated levels of toxins, contaminants and peroxidase (oxidized fat). Vegetable-sourced fatty acids are flax oil, evening primrose oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil and pumpkin seed oil. These must all be organic and extremely low in oxidation (damaged fats due to oxygen exposure). Minerals Calcium, Chlorine, Sodium, Potassium, Phosphorus, Magnesium and Sul - phur. (Essential mineral resource cited: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture National Research Council) Consider the source: There are several different formats from which vitamins and minerals are sourced:whole food6-7 506 - SMART SUPPLE - MENTATION 1. Elemental - mimics the chemical strand; \"non-living\"; can be made in a lab. Most vitamin/mineral supplements on the shelves fall under this category as it is extremely cheap to make. The body is unable to utilize these minerals due to their form. Minerals are meant to be digested by a carrier, like a protein, that brings it through the intestinal wall and into the blood. This is nearly impossible with elemental minerals. 2. Ionic - can be elemental minerals or organic minerals that are tied to an ion bond. This bond wants to tie itself to other cells in the body and may bond itself to other cells prior to reaching the protein cells in the intestinal wall that are responsible for the uptake of these minerals into the blood stream. 3. Colloidal - suspended in a glue-like medium and touted for its small molecules being easily transported through the intestinal wall. How - ever, colloidal mineral particles are inhibited due to the glue-like medium. Colloidal minerals have also been found to be larger than ionized minerals, making them actually harder to move through the intestines. 4. Chelated - chelation or chelated basically means that the metal (or mineral), which has been ionized in the stomach, is attached to a car - rier protein that moves the mineral substance through the wall of the intestine and into the blood stream. In a whole food state, many min - erals are already attached to a protein (chelated) and are able to com - pletely avoid the process of ionizing in the stomach and pass through to the blood stream even easier. Glycine has been researched to be the most efficient carrier protein for this process. Due to their bioavailability, chelated minerals should always be your first choice in mineral supplementation.6-8 Master Your Health506 - SMART SUPPLE - MENTATION Probiotics Due to the importance of the health of the digestive tract, probiotics have quickly become the non-essential, \"essential\" supplement. The body is ______________ microbial (roughly 90 trillion microbial cells). The majority of the ____________________ system is operated and con - trolled from the digestive tract. The environmental and diet-related contributors to the interruption of digestive health are: a. Pasteurization b. Irradiation c. Nutrient Chemical additives (preservatives, carbonation, fluoride, chlo - meaning \"against life\"), anti-inflammatory meds, birth control, etc.) f. Processed fatty acids and denatured amino acids in foods g. Stress and stress response The _________________________ used in growth of our foods (e.g., herbi - cides, fungicides, pesticides) will also compromise the bacteria in the diges - tive tract and make it more difficult to digest whole food nutrition. The lack of food and nutrients to feed our digestive bacteria will cause them to die off and/or become imbalanced.

Daily detox Essiac is a commonly used blend of herbs, first used by the Native Ameri - cans to help support the body's detoxification processes. Essiac has been known as an anti-cancer mechanism and helps the body eliminate damaging elements that may be found in the blood and organs. Non-Essential Supplementation Non-Essential Nutrients - Vitamins, lipids or amino acids that can be cre - ated in the body by using different combinations of other nutrients. Vitamins Thirteen organic substances are essential to human life in very small amounts. Eleven of these must be supplied in the diet (vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, E, K, folate (B5)). The other two (niacin and vitamin D) can be made in the body if there is a sufficient amount of the amino acid tryptophan and exposure to sunlight respectively. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid.dietary6-10 Master Your Health506 - SMART SUPPLE - MENTATION Vitamin C and Vitamin(s) B are water-soluble vitamins. These vitamins cannot be dissolved in lipids (fats), only water-based sub - stances, such as the blood. Vitamin A, D, E and K are fat-soluble vitamins. Anything interfering with fat _______________________, such as a defi - ciency of bile or chemicals that block fat absorption, will interfere with the uptake of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamins are still generally available in our foods.

These are normally _____________________ interventions. These types of ______________________ are known as homeopathic tinc - tures, dietary supplements, herbs, specialized meal plans and super-doses of certain vitamins for treatment. Orthomolecular medicine is a science-based approach to treatment of chronic and acute disease through temporary and closely monitored mega- dosing of vitamins or other supplements to support the body's own healing responses. Final Recommendations Here are the essential nutrients that will complete your whole food meal planning. 1. Essential amino acids - If your whole food intake lacks essential ami - no acids, look for a whole food sourced amino acid supplement de - rived from grass-fed meat, dairy or egg sources. 2. Essential fatty acids - Parent-sourced , organic omega 6 (LA) and ome - ga 3 (ALA) are the most beneficial supplements and should be con - sidered by most people. Fish oils should be avoided as they are not as pure as plant based oils and have overdoses of EPA and DHA (deriva - tive fatty acids). 3. 3.Essential minerals - Due to the depletion of minerals in the soil and conventional growth practices, finding a good chelated mineral sup - plement is a good idea. Minerals should be the chelated variety as healing short-term supplements6-12 Master Your Health506 - SMART SUPPLE - MENTATION they are the most bioavailable source of essential minerals. 4. Probiotics - To ensure appropriate digestion and assimilation of foods and nutrients, probiotics will help to rebuild the flora and bacterial bal - ance in the digestive tract. This is paramount for breaking down the healthier foods that you will now be eating. 5. Daily detox - Due to the onslaught of toxicity from our normal envi - ronment, a daily detox that helps to support the body's purification systems should be seriously considered as a type of \"insurance\" policy against daily free-radicals and chemical exposure. Side Effects The majority of side effects and overdose from supplements are accidental. In large doses, some vitamins have documented side effects that tend to be more severe with a larger dosage. The likelihood of consuming too much of any vitamin from food is remote, but overdosing (vitamin poisoning) from vitamin supplementation does occur. At high enough dosages, some vita - mins cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. When side- effects emerge, recovery is often accomplished by reducing the dosage. The doses of vitamins individuals can tolerate varies widely, and appear to be related to age and state of health. In 2008, overdose exposure to all formulations of vitamins and multivitamin- mineral formulations was reported by 68,911 individuals to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (nearly 80% of these exposures were in children under the age of 6), leading to eight \"major\" life-threatening out - comes and zero deaths.

Definition movement - any form of physical activity that has a significant metabolic demand. Thus, physical activities include training for and participation in athletic competitions, the performance of strenuous occupations, doing household chores and non-sporting leisure activities that involve physical effort. \"Physical activity\" The Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science & Medicine. Oxford University Press, 2007. Oxford Ref - erence Online. Oxford University Press. Global Information Network. 15 May 2011. Different categories of physical activity can be divided into: Aerobic activity - Calculated running, rowing, jogging, swimming, walking or cycling, etc. Resistance training/core strength - Using weight (body weight, additional weighted movements or resistance bands) to put concentric force on mus - cle tissue, connective tissue and bones. Stretching and flexibility - your flexibility is a large determining factor when assessing your health. Recreational and enjoyment activity - hiking, leisurely bike riding, canoe -8-4 Master Your Health 508 MOVEMENT ing, gardening, knitting, etc. This is defined as anything that helps you to relax and eliminate stress from the body. Daily activity - anything that you might do on a daily or situational basis that requires more energy than being inactive. Movement is any form of ___________________ taken that causes the body to be in motion. Movement is the __________________ element in life. Without movement, life deteriorates or ends. The only difference between you and a corpse...is movement! Movement helps to move the __________________ and nutrients through - out the body and lymphatic system and helps to flush out toxins. For ex - ample, think of a pond with a fresh water source or a stagnant pond. Move it or __________________ it! We would categorize your ___________________ without pain as a mea - sure of your physical and structural health. The Myths What are your beliefs about movement and how are they impacting your health? Most people believe that health is ultimately decided by ________________ level. It is important to understand that fitness is simply the ability to perform a specific ______________________ with efficiency (i.e., running a mile in 5 minutes). Fitness is not a _______________________ definition of health.action primary fluids lose mobility fitness action holistic8-5 508 MOVEMENT Myth #1 I exercise a lot so I can __________________ whatever I want... Truth: It is actually more dangerous to be extremely active and not eat ap - propriately than to be sedentary. When you exercise, you are requiring more resources from the body. If you do not replenish and nourish the body with appropriate food, you will actually cause a greater nutrient deficiency by exercising and breaking the body down. Myth #2 Aging is an automatic reason to _____________________ movement and it is natural to move less with age. Truth: Movement should be a central focus as we age. Movement actu - ally promotes the body to make new cells faster and keeps the muscles and bones strong and conditioned. Movement will increase neural activity, which in turn keeps the mind sharp and continuing to grow. The _____________________ the amount of movement of the body, the less mobile and less healthy it will become. You will actually age _____________________ based on how low your level of movement is throughout life. Myth #3 Deterioration of my _____________ and muscles is inevitable. Truth: Misalignment and chronic misuse are the primary causes for the breakdown and weakening of muscles, joints and bones, as well as the nervous system. Another cause is undernutrition or malnourishment (poor diet). When utilized, these areas constantly regenerate and become stron - ger with use, to adjust to the environment. Strong wind makes strong trees.eat decrease lower faster joints8-6 Master Your Health 508 MOVEMENT Myth #4 Resistance training will ________________ me up. Truth: Resistance training will make muscles more toned and lean. It is ex - tremely difficult and takes specific planning to use resistance training to bulk up muscles and add large amounts of lean tissue. In most cases, be - cause muscle tissue is about three times as dense as body fat, you will actu - ally become a lot less bulky when utilizing resistance training in addition to aerobic exercise. Myth #5 Rigorous exercise is the __________________ right way. Truth: Working out with intensity is a great way to accomplish results when exercising and being active. However, these should only be for short bursts, and not for a long period of time. The only reason you would want to ex - ercise with great intensity for a long period of time is if you are specifically training your body to accomplish a certain task that requires efficiency in that exercise area (i.e., running a marathon, cycling 50 miles). Vigorous ex - ercise for long periods of time actually generates an immense amount of stress and oxidation in the body and takes a lot of work to heal from. Myth #6 More is always ______________________. Truth: Exercise is actually most effective when doing only enough struc - tured exercise to achieve a positive response from the body and to accom - plish the benefits of health that you are looking for. More exercise is actually a stressor on the body and can cause severe complications to your health if not done properly. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that being an ac - tive person is bad, I am saying that the exercise you do to stay healthy or accomplish your health goals does not need to take 1-2 hours every day of the week. Myth #7 Exercise is to ____________________ calories and lose weight. Truth: In the vast majority of cases, if someone is exercising to lose weight, they are being distracted by a cosmetic symptom (body fat) and are ignor - ing the actual cause of the issue, nutrition. It is important to understand that bulk only better burn8-7 508 MOVEMENT you cannot exercise and burn extra calories without the body asking for the calories in return (i.e., you will get hungrier and eat more). There are numer - ous studies that show exercising does not lead to weight loss because peo - ple are ignoring or are ignorant to the actual cause of their problem in the first place. Again, if you begin to exercise and are still eating an unhealthy diet (which was probably the primary cause for your problem in the first place), you are actually causing more harm than good. Pain: Are Y ou Just Waiting for Something Bad to Happen? Many of us just ____________________ to give our body attention until ex - periencing a symptom that causes us annoyance. Physical activity pain is a perfect example of this. Pain is a ____________________ from the body to tell us that something needs attention. This gives us the ________________________ to pay attention and give our body what it needs or to rehabilitate the issue to correct it. Most people ______________________ pain or cover it up with over-the- counter drugs or medications because they can still walk, talk and get their tasks checked off their list. _________________ of all office visits in family medicine are coded as a physical pain problem.wait opportunitysignal 50%ignore8-8 Master Your Health 508 MOVEMENT Myth #8 Y our family care doctor will help you ________________ the problem. Truth: The only tool that a family doctor has for pain is anti-inflammatories or other pain medication. The only other option is referrals to another pro - fessional, such as a physical therapist. Most insurance companies are reduc - ing their coverage for physical therapy, even after extensive surgery such as back, neck or joint replacement. Myth #9 Taking pain medications or over-the-counter medication (acetamino - phen, naproxen, etc.) for ______________________ periods of time makes sense and is safe. Truth: There is nothing smart or safe about this approach to your health. Are the drugs you are taking every day helping to solve the problem...or are they just covering up the actual problem and causing you to make it worse as you can't actually feel the problem anymore? There is a large amount of research confirming the damage to organs and overall health that is caused by the long-term uses of pain drugs. They desensitize your body, which is never a good thing. If you need to utilize pain drugs for a short time to help you get through a healing protocol, then that is fine. Just realize that this approach will, in many cases, get in the way of the body's normal process of healing and resolution and will hinder your ability to truly know how you are doing or if you are healing effectively. Myth #10 Taking pain medications for the _________________ type of problem that continues to happen intermittently is a smart way to keep healthy, even though I am not taking them every day. Truth: Obviously it doesn't make sense to continually \"cover up\" a problem that keeps popping up and then going away. Your body is trying to tell you something and this is an opportunity to pay attention and find a solution. If resolve long same8-9 508 MOVEMENT you do not work on a solution for the cause of these types of issues, they will most likely turn into long-term, chronic issues instead of the intermittent issues they started as. Myth #11 Y ou should __________________ until your body hurts to pay attention to it. Truth: Waiting for pain prior to taking physical action is like waiting for someone to hit you before you duck...not smart. The bottom line is, we know that we will have physical health issues if we don't move. Myth #12 Surgery is mostly successful in solving the ________________ of prob - lems and is safe. Truth: The incidence of back, neck and joint surgeries is skyrocketing in this country. All the while, we have become more and more unhealthy and im - mobile. Our level of physical pain and prescriptions to address it has gone up. Surgery is, and should always be, your very last resort once you have tried absolutely everything else. In our opinion and clinical experience, the risks and complications have been severely downplayed, while the benefits have been quite overstated. It may work as a temporary fix for some, but it does not work the majority of the time. It will likely lead to more of the same; pain medication and surgery repeats themselves more times than not.wait cause8-10 Master Your Health 508 MOVEMENT Alignment and Y our Health Alignment is key to your structural health.

There are two primary groups of muscles that you must incorporate in your lifestyle exercise routine: 1. Big muscles (phasic or movers) - actually exert the most energy and force to move your body. Big muscles are the major muscle groups that you can \"see\" working and moving under your skin. These groups of muscles are not the primary stabilizing agents, so they are not as involved in balance and coordination as you might think. 2. Little muscles (tonic or postural) - stabilize your skeletal system and are the basis of holding bones and joints stable during movements. Little muscles are the small muscle groups that line the spine and joints and lie beneath the major muscle groups. Little muscle groups actually fire first when you make a movement. Or at least they are sup - posed to... These groups are key to proper posture and having good balance and coordination.holistic8-11 508 movements should I include in my weekly routine? 1.

Below are some tips on putting together a plan that is right for you. In-Home Exercise For many of us, a portion, if not all of, our movement routine takes place at home. Here are some things to consider when preparing to build a move - ment routine that includes at-home exercise: 1. Resistance training - It will be useful to have some resistance bands, dumbbells, kettle bells, wrist/ankle weights, or any other weighted ob - ject that you can use while following a routine. We recommend to get DVD's that guide you through these routines to help you with form and variety. 2. Cardiovascular exercise - I always recommend walking or jogging outside rather than using a treadmill or other machine. However, if you have weather limitations or physical limitations that impede your ability to start outside, a stationary bike or elliptical trainer will be a good fit to begin with. There are many benefits to taking your cardio workout outdoors as the sun, fresh air and the scenery are extremely therapeutic and have many proven health benefits. 3. DVD-based programs - Looking for the right program can always be a little confusing when you are not sure what you are looking for. We recommend looking for programs that include a lot of functional ex - ercise and body-weight movements that include core strength, flex - ibility, and balance training. Yoga and Pilates programs online can also be very helpful and a wonderful way to relieve stress from your body. 4. In-home personal training - It is extremely helpful to work with a per - sonal trainer to learn the foundational basics that will help your exer - cise at home be more productive and safe. Look for trainers that have experience working with people in their own homes.8-15 508 MOVEMENT Fitness Centers or Studios It is always important to know what you are looking for prior to going out and researching fitness memberships or programs. Your search should be based on your current level of fitness and the fitness goals you have. You can then, and only then, find the right gym or studio to join. Here are some things to consider: 1. 24-hour fitness centers - These centers can be extremely valuable re - sources when looking for convenient and affordable options for your movement routine. With lower monthly memberships and lower-cost personal instruction, 24 hour gyms are a great option to get started on fitness or help you maintain your desired fitness level. 2. Full-service gyms - Facilities like the YMCA and Bally's can be a little more pricey than the 24-hour gyms, but they also offer a lot of variety when it comes to your movement options. On top of the fitness equip - ment, cardio machines and free weights, these bigger fitness centers also offer classes like Pilates, yoga, Zumba and other functional fitness classes. These facilities are great options when you are looking for some diversity in your movement routine. These gyms also commonly include child care options, just ask them if it is something you are in - terested in. 3. Kick boxing/kettle bell/functional training gyms - When you are looking for a challenge as well as a lot of encouragement and cama - raderie, these gyms are absolutely wonderful. The only consideration that you want to make is your current fitness level. Some people tend to get hurt just jumping into programs like these without a period of time where you build up a little stamina and strength elsewhere. 4. Independent trainers and instructors - There are so many great fit - ness instructors out there that have started their own practice and op - erate out of various different facilities. This option is a wonderful way to build new, supportive relationships and find an instructor that really understands your needs and can give you personal attention when needed.8-16 Master Your Health 508 MOVEMENT Take it Further Visit the health resources area at www.HealthyForLifeU.com .

How to Avoid Spreading Y our Sickness or Elongating It When you are sick, clean your bedding, especially pillow cases, hand tow - els and toothbrush every day. Use a clean cup with every drink.

It does not interact with any medication. It usually does not produce side effects unless it is a healing response. These medica - tions are great to keep in the medicine chest for use as needed. \" - Dr. Leslie Adams, M.H., Pharm.D. Balance Rx Integrative Pharmacy, Pleasant Hill, IA.9-6 Master Your Health509 - NATURAL FAMILY CARE Homeopathic medicine is based on the principle \"like is cured by like, \" re - ferred to as the Law of Similars. What this means is that the homeopathic remedy you should take for your symptoms would be one that would also cause the same symptoms if you took it in excess. For example, if you had poison ivy, you could either take the remedy made from poison ivy, called Rhus Tox, or a similar remedy, one that would, in ex - cess, cause poison ivy-like symptoms. Nitroglycerin, a popular remedy used in hospitals to stop heart attacks, will, if taken in excess, also cause a heart attack. By taking the right remedy, it is as if you signal the body to take care of something or react to something (poison ivy, heart attack symptoms) that for some reason, it had been neglecting. Homeopathy is also so safe to use that, to date, there are no recorded instances of anyone who has ever been harmed by it. There are no nutrients provided to the body with homeopa - thy, as there are with herbs. Homeopathy only ____________________ a response in the body, which engages the body's ________________ built-in intelligence and ability to heal. The body itself does all the ___________________, not the remedy. The making of a homeopathic remedy Homeopathic preparations, called ___________________, are prepared by a unique process called \"potentization, \" referring to a method of dilution and continual shaking. Most homeopathic remedies are made from dilutions of herbs, plants or minerals. Some are made from poisons and are used to antidote poisonous reactions from bites, stings and drug reactions. encourages own healing remedies9-7 509 - NATURAL FAMILY CARE Remedies are used for the purpose of ____________________ the body to better absorb and utilize nutrients from vitamins, minerals, amino acids or other nutrients. This is done by mixing a base substance with nine drops of distilled water, alcohol or lactose sugar. Or, for a more potent remedy, one part is mixed with 99 parts of the water, alcohol or lactose sugar. Then one part of this is taken out and mixed with another nine or 99 parts of the water, sugar or alcohol. This process is repeated anywhere from three times to several thousand times. The standard levels of potentization include 3, 6, 12, 30, 200, 1,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 or 500,000. These are marked \"C\" or \"X, \" depending on whether they were diluted with nine parts or 99 parts of the water, alcohol or lactose. Homeopathic potencies and their work with the body The primary difference between potencies of the same remedy is not only how they were made (dilutions) but more importantly, the level at which they elicit a response in the body. For example, a 6x potency of a remedy will work at the peripheral level, i.e., the peripheral nerves, or the skin. Examples of these include: Arnica 6x, a trauma remedy, which works on trauma at the skin level; Hypericum 6x, a nerve trauma remedy, works on trauma to the nerves in the fingers and toes; and Ferrum phos. 6x works on the tender, peripheral area of swollen glands. retraining9-8 Master Your Health509 - NATURAL FAMILY CARE The 30c potency of a homeopathic remedy, depending on the remedy, works a little deeper, on the peripheral blood vessels and thin muscle tis - sue. A more diluted \"c\" potency, such as a 90c, will work at the level of the tendons, and the 200c potency will work on deeper muscle, nerve and bone tissue. Acute illness An acute illness is an illness that is short-lived, meaning it should clear up within 1-3 days. Acute illnesses are caused by bacteria or viruses, both of which your body was designed to eliminate within a short period of time. Homeopathy experiences its most _____________________ results when used for acute illness. Besides food, it is also the ____________________ and most successful form of medicine to use for acute illness. Usually ________________ than one dose of a remedy is needed to assist the body in eliminating viruses or bacteria. When taking homeopathy for an acute illness, results should be seen within 10-15 minutes. If no changes occur, try taking a second dose. If positive results are noted but symptoms then __________________, the remedy should be repeated. Remedies for acute illness are often taken 3-6 times, 6-8 minutes apart for best results. Other reasons for poor results include severe dehydration, a ruined remedy, or in the case of a chronic illness, an immune system that is too weak to respond. If no change occurs after the second dose, consult your homeopathic book for a different remedy that more appropriately matches your symptoms. successful safest more return9-9 509 - NATURAL FAMILY CARE Chronic illness As stated earlier, homeopathy provides no nutrients to the body. It works by gently stimulating a _________________________ response that will in turn promote healing of _____________________ or damaged tissue. If the body is too weak to elicit a response, homeopathy will not help. In the case of chronic illness, it may be necessary to ____________________ up the reserve nutrients in the body before homeopathy is implemented. A response to homeopathy can then be expected, although results will be gradual, as the body is able to heal. Watch for differences in the usual way of responding to life's situations, such as the response to stress, differences in sleep patterns, also elimination of food sensitivities, allergies and fears. Improvement in concentration and learning disabilities may also occur. While some changes may be noticeable right away, more improvement will be noted over time.

Essential oils are aromatic essences ___________________ from plants, flowers, trees, fruit, bark, grasses and seeds with distinctive therapeutic, psy - chological and physiological properties, which improve and prevent illness. ______________________ oils are used in a variety of ways, most of which you can do at home. Here are some of the ways that oils can be used: Inhalations Diffusers Vaporizers Massage Baths and showers Compresses Inhalations - can be direct inhalations or steam inhalations. One or two drops of your chosen oil on a handkerchief and you can inhale the oils while at work or traveling. A couple of drops of a relaxing oil on a tissue inside your pillow helps you sleep. Steam inhalations with three or four drops in a large bowl of hot water help clear congestion or catarrh. Diffusers and vaporizers - release scent of essential oils into the air, provid - ing natural fragrance, while distributing their therapeutic benefits. Diffusers can be electrical, burners that use candles, or a simple ceramic ring that is warmed by a light bulb. extracted Essential9-11 509 - NATURAL FAMILY CARE Massage - the most common form of treatment used by aromatherapists, simply because it is so effective. The combination of touch and the thera - peutic benefits of the oils improves circulation and releases trapped energy from tense muscles. The fragrance also promotes a feeling of well-being. The essential oil is diluted in a vegetable carrier oil such as grapeseed or sweet almond oil. Aromatherapists recommend proportions of five drops of essential oil to 5ml. (1 tsp.) of carrier oil for adults; half the strength for children under three. For newborn babies it is best to avoid essential oils altogether. Baths - any oil can be used. Choose your scent and add up to eight drops for adults, four for children over two and stir through the water with your hand. Showers - any oil can be used. Choose your scent and add up to eight drops for adults, four drops for children over the age of two. Drops can be put in the corners of the showers and will be released by the steam. Compresses - help relieve bruising, skin problems, and muscle and men - strual pain. Use 1-2 drops of oil-like lavender in a bowl of warm water. Soak a piece of cotton in the water and wring out so it does not drip. Put the cot - ton over the area to be treated and cover with a warm towel. Leave at least two hours.

The mind is considered to con - trol, or consist of, so-called mental processes. Dualist philosophers, such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes, have distinguished between mind and matter as two to - tally independent entities. Idealism suggests that the world is a product of the mind and dependent on experience. Materialism begins with a concept of a material world independent of expe - rience; the mind is not separate from the physical but derives from it. \"Mind\" World Encyclopedia. Philip's, 2008.

Neuropeptides Peptides are compounds consisting of two or more amino acids (the build - ing blocks of proteins), chained together by what is called a peptide bond. They have been described as chemical messengers that act like little float - ing brains, communicating messages with cells all over the body. Neuropeptides are peptides released by neurons (brain cells) as intercellular messengers. Some neuropeptides function as neurotransmitters, and oth - ers function as hormones. Neuropeptides do just about everything. They can be either pro-inflamma - tory or anti-inflammatory, with anti-inflammatory being preferred and in - flammatory seen in crisis or chronic dysfunction. They control our mood, energy levels, pain and pleasure reception, body weight, and ability to solve problems; they also form memories and regulate our immune system. \"neuropeptides\" A Dictionary of Biomedicine.

You believe in the body's ability to fight disease if given the appropri - ate tools, resources and environment. 2. You eat food that is as close as possible to the source and form of growth. 3. You eat food that was grown in its natural environment and with natu - ral practices. 4. You are supplementing any nutritional deficiencies in your meal plan with whole food supplements that are from the earth and preferably grown organically. 5. You execute a well-balanced movement routine and your structural health is based on flexibility, strength, balance and stress-reduction. 6. You are conscious of your \"thought health\" and aware that positive thoughts and beliefs will help keep you well and thriving. 7. You have eliminated as many environmental challenges in your life as possible from your home, work place and exposure through foods. 8. You have a health maintenance/vitality schedule for seeing your cho - sen professionals (acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, holis - tic psychotherapy, etc.). 9. When a symptom shows up in your body, you ask, \"How did this hap - pen?\" or \"What caused this?\" 10. You invest your money in the things that will prevent disease.11-5 511 - MEDICINE REVIS - ITED Reactive This is waiting until disease or symptoms ________________ and then act - ing to alleviate or resolve them. In this definition, the type of treatment is irrelevant... even when seek - ing natural treatment, you are still in a reactive health and lifestyle cycle. Symptoms of disease (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, under-active/ over-active thyroid, etc.) are not life-long labels that anyone should believe are ____________________. These levels were once normal and __________________, and they can re - turn that way. Our current medical model has operated this way because their only treat - ments are life-long symptom managers...not true resolution of the under - lying causes. The conventional medical model lacks disease prevention tools. \"Modern Western medicine is a disease care system; it is not preventive nor does it teach patients how to stay well. In fact, what we call preventive medicine in modern Western medicine...pap smears, breast exams, certain blood tests etc., are really early detection medicine. They are not teaching patients how to stay healthy. Unfortunately, it does not suit the drug industry to have patients take a drug that cures or eliminates the problem. It is much more lucrative for them if the drug can manage the symptoms, so you have to stay on them for life (e.g., statins, anti- hypertensives, etc.). So the best medicine is using modern Western medicine for what it is good at... crisis care medicine, acute medical and surgical emergencies, when you break a bone, when you are acutely ill, etc., and using diet, supplements, exercise, stress management and other benign modalities for prevention and initially for most non-acute problems. \" - Dr. Frank Lipman, M.D.arise permanent healthy11-6 Master Your Health 511 MEDICINE REVISITED The top signs that you are living a reactive lifestyle: 1.

One of the biggest _______________________ in your health is to only do what your health insurance will pay for, as health insurance is only built to react to disease. \"Health insurance\" is improperly named...just like \"life insurance. \" \"Sick insurance\" would be a proper description, as would \"death insurance. \" Y ou can never use your health insurance to _______________ a disease. Plan terminology Explanation of benefits (EOB) - The statement that you receive from your insurance company after a service or visit to a medical professional. This statement will explain the initial amount of the charges by your doctor, the adjusted service amount, and what you are responsible to pay based on your insurance policy agreement. conventional reactive mistakes prevent11-8 Master Your Health 511 MEDICINE REVISITED Network discounts/adjusted service rate - A reduced service cost that your insurance company sets with the doctors or health systems that sup - ply the services. Example: Your service cost for an office visit is $110. The doctor sub - mits your bill to the insurance company and they reduce the visit to $90 based on the network discounts. The $90 fee will now be calculated for payment with your co-insurance amount and/or applied to your de - ductible. Deductible - A predetermined dollar amount that needs to be met (you pay out-of-pocket) in a calendar insurance year prior to your monetary coverage beginning. Example: A high-deductible plan requires that the insured person(s) must pay $4,000 out-of-pocket for the medical services accessed prior to the health insurance company paying for any of the services. These plans normally have an HSA attached, which allows tax-free dollars to be saved to pay these out-of-pocket medical expenses. Co-pay - A pre-determined amount of money that you need to pay prior to accessing office visits, specialist visits or undergoing a procedure. The rest is normally paid by your insurance company, or you may be responsible for a co-insurance of 10-30% of the end total cost of the visit. Example: A co-pay will normally be listed on your insurance card. Co- pays for office visits can range from $10-$40 per visit, depending on the type of care provided. Co-insurance - A percentage of each service that you are required to pay once the final total is calculated on your EOB (explanation of benefits). Example: Your doctor visit costs $150. When you get your EOB, it will tell you that you owe 20% of that fee if your co-insurance policy rate is 80%/20%. The 80% is the percentage that your insurance company pays and the 20% is your responsibility after network discounts.11-9 511 - MEDICINE REVIS - ITED Premium - The amount of money that you spend monthly for your health insurance policy. Health savings/flexible spending account (HSA/FSA) - A tax-free medical spending account that can be used to cover deductible, co-pay, co-insur - ance and pharmacy expenses on prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Normally these accounts will allow tax-free contributions up to $2,500 per person or $5,000 for a family, per year. In some plans, you can utilize these dollars to purchase supplements, weight loss or health education programs. What Health Insurance Plan Best Fits My Needs? Comprehensive These plans cover the vast majority of the cost for each visit (70-100%) and may require a co-pay and/or co-insurance for a portion of the expenses re - lated to your office visit or service. These plans normally have smaller deductible amounts These plans always have the highest monthly premiums Comprehensive plans are more appropriate (to begin with) for people who highly utilize their health insurance plans (frequent doctor visits, constant prescription refills and multiple medications, etc.). However, over time, high plan utilization causes drastic increases in monthly premiums and makes your health insurance expenditures dramatically increase year over year.11-10 Master Your Health 511 MEDICINE REVISITED Catastrophic These plans have high deductibles ($3,000-$7,500/year) but will cover 100% of large medical expenses after the deductible is met. These plans normally carry large out-of-pocket expenses prior to cov - erage kicking in. These plans normally have the lowest monthly premiums and allow you to utilize tax-free dollars (HSA/FSA) to pay out-of-pocket expenses. Catastrophic plans are ideal for people who want to spend less per month on a premium and invest in a tax-free HSA/FSA account and lifestyle (pre - vention) expenditures.

Naturopathic doctors (NDs) teach their patients to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and cutting-edge natural therapies to enhance their bodies' ability to ward off and combat disease. NDs view the patient as a complex, interrelated system (a whole person), not as a clogged artery or a tumor. Naturopathic physicians craft comprehensive treatment plans that blend the best of modern medical science and traditional natural medical approaches to not only treat disease, but to also restore health.

Often, herbal medicines in the United States are derived from European or North American plants, but herbal practitioners may use medicinal plants from all over the world.
