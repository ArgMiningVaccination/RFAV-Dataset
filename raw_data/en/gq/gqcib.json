Critics pointed out there was no scientific evidence it actually worked. Indeed, both the British Medical Association and the Commons Science and Technology Committee have said the NHS should stop funding homeopathic treatments. Sceptics say the therapies are no better than placebos, yet some medics argue they are backed by strong evidence. And a report from website NetDoctor says half of all GPs are thought to provide access to 'therapy outside conventional medicine', including osteopathy and acupuncture. There are also 400 GP members of the Faculty of Homeopathy, and 900 GP members of the British Medical Acupuncture Society. GPs are the most likely of all doctors to want to fit in with patients' agendas and beliefs, says Dr Michael Dixon, an NHS GP and chairman of the NHS Alliance, which campaigns to improve healthcare within the service. 'But more and more, we are also recognising that conventional medicine doesn't have all the answers,' he adds. 'It is great for diagnosing patients, but not always able to treat the problems it identifies. 'At our practice (in Cullompton, Devon) we refer patients for osteopathy, hypnosis, massage, acupuncture and reflexology. And we frequently recommend herbal remedies. 'The main criticism levelled against alternative medicine is that it lacks evidence to support it, but some herbs have a lot of evidence to back them up. For example, St John's Wort is well-proven to treat mild to medium depression, and peppermint has long been used (and prescribed by GPs as Colpermin) for bowel spasms. Sceptics say the therapies are no better than placebos, yet some medics argue they are backed by strong evidence 'When our practice offered patients the choice of a herbal or an orthodox medicine for common complaints such as insomnia, arthritis, coughs, and migraine, seven out of ten chose the herbal. Fifty per cent said it helped, and 40 per cent said they'd buy it next time before booking a GP appointment.' Here, we talk to GPs who are going against the tide of medical opinion by offering alternative remedies . . . HOMEOPATHY GP Dr Tim Robinson, who treats one or two patients a day with homeopathy Dr Tim Robinson, an NHS GP at the Barton House Medical Practice, Beaminster, Dorset, is a member of the Faculty of Homeopathy. He says: I had been a GP for four years when my wife, Jenny, who was pregnant with our first child, started suffering leg cramps for which I could not prescribe any medication. I heard about a homeopathic remedy, Cuprum Met, that could help - and it worked. At the time, in the early Nineties, there had been many times I could not prescribe drugs because of contra-indications. For example, a man with a stomach ulcer couldn't take certain painkillers because they could further damage the stomach lining. There were also conditions for which there was very little I could offer medically - growing pains in children, chilblains, glandular fever, chronic fatigue syndrome. A year after treating Jenny's leg cramps homeopathically, I enrolled on a four-year, part-time course at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, and since 2000 I have been a fully qualified homeopath, as well as a registered GP. Typically, I will treat one or two patients a day with homeopathy, having made the medical diagnosis and considered the options - conventional and homeopathic. Critics say homeopathy doesn't work because there's nothing in the pills - the basic remedies are too diluted. (Homeopathy differs from herbal medicine in that it relies on substances being diluted many times.) But in 63 human trials, homeopathy has been proven to work better than a placebo. In veterinary studies, too, homeo-pathy has trumped the placebo for conditions such as kennel cough in dogs. 'Homeopathy means I have an extra tool in my kit when conventional medicine doesn't have much to offer, or my patients want an alternative.' Remedies are very carefully chosen, based on the precise nature of the patient and symptom. Sceptics say science cannot explain homeopathy, and therefore scientists should not support it. But I've seen that homeopathy can be extremely effective in many conditions, such as anxiety, depression, grief, hay fever, catarrh, IBS, menopausal symptoms, PMS, osteoarthritis and eczema. In babies and children, there are effective remedies for colic, teething, sleep problems, night terrors and car sickness. Another common criticism is that homeopathy is a waste of money. It costs the NHS \u00a34 million a year to run homeopathic hospitals and pay for remedies. This is against an annual drugs bill of \u00a37 billion, with \u00a3230 million going on antidepressants alone. Homeopathy can provide effective remedies for colic, teething, sleep problems, night terrors and car sickness, but there are times when conventional medicines are best, says Dr Tim Robinson But there are conditions I'd never attempt to treat with homeopathy - it is no substitute for baby immunisations, as it will not produce the antibodies needed to protect against diptheria, polio, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. And it cannot be used to protect against malaria. I would also never prescribe it if I suspected a patient had cancer, and it cannot be used to lower cholesterol or treat an underactive thyroid. But homeopathy means I have an extra tool in my kit when conventional medicine doesn't have much to offer, or my patients want an alternative. ACUPUNCTURE Dr Tanvir Jamil was initially sceptical of acupuncture but is now a practitioner Dr Tanvir Jamil, an NHS GP and senior partner at the Burnham Health Centre, Buckinghamshire, has offered acupuncture to his patients for 22 years. He says: I was a sceptic, but when I first started as a GP, I had a number of patients asking about acupuncture, and I looked into it. I found it intriguing, and ended up training as an acupuncturist. Although acupuncture does not help many ailments, it does have a specific role in certain conditions. It's now recognised and accepted by many Western doctors, with a growing number of studies in medical journals. Recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend it for osteoarthritis of the knees. In fact, any sort of musculoskeletal problem often benefits from acupuncture - such as back and knee pain, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder. Chronic migraine also responds very well. Patients often find they can come off some of their medication. The general consensus in Western thinking is that it works by stimulating nerve fibres, which go on to inhibit pain-carrying nerves. It can also trigger a chain of events that lead to a rush of natural anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving chemicals - endorphins. I have also successfully used acupuncture for conditions that do not involve pain - such as insomnia, anxiety, PMS and even irritable bowel syndrome. There's no clear reason why placing needles at certain points can be so effective, so I accept there may be something in the Chinese theory of meridians or 'energy channels' that run through the body. I am an orthodox GP first. Acupuncture is just a tool I use to complement my other skills as a GP. There are many conditions I would never use it for, including diabetes, psoriasis, eczema and indigestion, because it doesn't work for these, and hypertension needs treatment with drugs. Acupuncture's success is not a placebo effect - I have treated sceptical patients successfully, and some vets treat animals with acupuncture, too, with good results. HYPNOTHERAPY Dr Kate Barnes believes hypnotherapy is the perfect antidote to anxiety Dr Kate Barnes, an NHS GP from Great Missenden, Bucks, offers hypnotherapy at a local private clinic and in Harley Street. She says: I have been an NHS GP since 1991, and have always been interested in how a patient's emotional state affects their physical well-being. In my first decade as a doctor, I was seeing a lot of problems that were not purely physical and cured by popping a pill. Studies showed hypnosis - learning to retune our minds - could produce changes on a brain scan, as well as measurable physiological benefits and a better quality of life. This intrigued me, and I trained at the London College of Clinical Hypnosis in 2009. Hypnotherapy enables deep relaxation, the perfect antidote to anxiety. Any condition exacerbated by stress or anxiety - be it chronic pain, shortness of breath, eczema, IBS, insomnia or high blood pressure - can be helped by hypnosis, if the patient is open to the idea. But it should never be used for treating patients with severe depression, as the inner focus will make a severely depressed patient feel worse. In a hypnotic state (something we slip into while daydreaming or just before we drift off to sleep) the mind is deeply relaxed. And it's then I can make positive suggestions. I have seen impressive results. Just three sessions can help a patient reduce or come off medication - and that may be painkillers and blood pressure tablets, not just antidepressants. Studies show hypnosis can produce measurable physiological benefits and a better quality of life AYURVEDA Dr Don Brennan, a practitioner of the traditional Indian medicine Ayurveda, thinks that a person's personality and body type influence the way they cope with life, which in turn affects their health Dr Donn Brennan, a private GP and practitioner of the traditional Indian medicine Ayurveda, works in London, Skelmersdale and Dublin. He says: Since 1990, I have treated all my patients using Ayurvedic principles - these are that a person's personality and body type (called their dosha), influence the way they cope with life, and this in turn affects their health. Treatment involves meditation, and I also prescribe a specific change of diet, together with herbal remedies or even massage with specific oils, according to the dosha. Herbs are also used in Ayurveda - for example, turmeric (which can reduce inflammation in the joints and lower blood cholesterol) - and now have scientific evidence to support centuries of traditional use. Others are less well-known to Western doctors and herbalists, such as Kanchanar Guggulu, which enables the thyroid gland to function normally again in patients with an underactive thyroid, while also giving them more energy. However, the herb may take three months to make a difference, so with my GP hat on, I will also prescribe a short course of the standard treatment, with the hormone thyroxine. I always examine patients medically before concluding they can be treated Ayurvedically, and my idea is that it should work alongside modern medicine, not against it. HERBAL MEDICINE Dr Sarah Brewer, a nutritionist and proponent of herbal medicine, says that herbs help the patient suffer fewer side-effects than you might get from drugs Dr Sarah Brewer is a Guernsey-based GP and medical nutritionist. She's been recommending herbal medicine since gaining a diploma in phytotherapy in 1998. She says: My interest in herbal medicines was an adjunct to my passion for nutrition. In the early Nineties, while working in an extremely deprived part of Plymouth, I realised that many of my patients' health problems - diabetes, obesity, lack of energy - were not being helped by their bad diets. I started prescribing vitamin supplements and saw their health perk up. After doing a masters degree in nutritional medicine, I started recommending a change of diet before medicine whenever I thought it would help. At least 40 per cent of the drugs doctors prescribe are originally derived from herbs - aspirin originates from an extract of willow bark. But when we use the whole plant, instead of just a small part of it, we get other ingredients, and these help the patient suffer fewer side-effects than you might get from drugs, because the dose of the active ingredient is lower than in conventional medicine. Many doctors are sceptical about herbs, citing cases when something has gone wrong. But since 2011, regulations have been in place to ensure the safety of herbal medicines. The Traditional Herbal Remedy (THR) label, for instance, shows the product contains the herbs it claims to, and has been assessed for quality and safety. These products also come with a patient-information leaflet. GPs cannot prescribe herbal remedies on the NHS, but there are many I recommend. For example, black cohosh for menopausal hot flushes, feverfew for migraine, and the herbal remedy pelargonium to get rid of cold and flu symptoms within 24 hours. But if someone needs treatment, such as antibiotics, for more serious conditions, I wouldn't feel ethically comfortable suggesting anything other than conventional medication. NATUROPATHY Dr Deborah McManners was the first GP in the UK to qualify as a naturopath, which seeks balance in life Dr Deborah McManners works at The Hale Clinic, London, and in 1996 became the first GP in the UK to qualify as a naturopath. She says: Naturopathy means 'healing through nature'. Before blood tests, scans, and all the diagnostic magic of modern medicine, all physicians were naturopaths, relying on their own instincts and intuition. The original physicians had to look carefully at every aspect of a patient's life and circumstances, and naturopathy still does this. I look at all elements of a person's lifestyle, such as sleep, quality of diet and stress levels. I also look at their face for clues of illness - for instance, a puffy face can signal underactive thyroid. I then tailor treatments. As a new GP, patients would hand me a list of their symptoms, then leave me to it, as if their health was my problem, not theirs. I tried to give each patient a little insight into the simple things they could do to improve their health - such as looking at their diet or the amount they sleep. This became so important I trained as a naturopath. To the naturopath, the patient with chronic constipation, eczema and sinusitis, or the patient who feels physically exhausted and mentally depleted, share the same underlying problem: lack of balance in their life. My goal is to help my patients restore balance. I will always wear my medical hat first to ensure no underlying condition is missed. And I will treat with orthodox drugs, or refer to a specialist. But, with my naturopath's hat on, I will also use simple therapies such as good nutrition, sunlight or water, to help patients achieve what I see as the basis of total health: longevity and quality of life.
