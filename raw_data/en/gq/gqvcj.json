This page describes requirements applicable to demolition permits issued on or after September 1, 2021. These new requirements also apply to applications started before that date if a permit was not issued by August 31, 2021. You must obtain a demolition permit before beginning work to demolish an entire building or structure, to demolish substantially all of the above-grade portion of a building or structure, or to alter an existing building and permanently reduce its building area. Exceptions to this requirement apply to wood frame private garages being replaced with an [easy permit](/content/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/permits/svcs/easy-permits.html), small sheds and other structures that [do not require a building permit](/content/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/permits/svcs/no-permit-reqd.html) to construct, and demolition work authorized by the Building Commissioner or another city official on an emergency basis. Demolition work must be performed by a general contractor licensed by the City of Chicago. Starting a Demolition Permit Application A demolition permit application may be submitted by the property owner, the contractor who will be performing the work, or a City-licensed expediter. A separate permit application is required for each building or structure to be demolished, except a private garage (for five or fewer cars) may be demolished on the same permit as an associated residential building. To start a demolition permit application, complete the first page of [Form 480 (Demolition Permit Application) ](/content/city/en/depts/bldgs/supp_info/permitforms.html)and email it to [DOBDemoPermits@cityofchicago.org](mailto:DOBDemoPermits@cityofchicago.org) along with at least two clear exterior photographs of the building or structure to be demolished. You will be assigned an application number. If any information on Page 1 of Form 480 changes after your application number is assigned, you must start a new application. You will receive an email with your permit application number or requesting missing information. You will also be notified of any address-specific holds that must be resolved before a demolition permit can be issued. After you receive a permit application number, you will need to obtain the required approvals and documents described on Page 2 of the permit application. Additional information about each of these requirements is provided below. A demolition permit application expires if there is no activity with the Department of Buildings for more than 120 days. One 90-day extension may be requested before the 120-day period expires. Instructions for Form 480, Page 1 When completing Page 1 of the Demolition Permit Application (Form 480) please follow these instructions. Providing incorrect or incomplete information in your application will delay processing of your application and issuance of your permit. Preparer: Provide the name and contact information for the person preparing the permit application. This person can be the property owner, the demolition contractor, or a licensed expediter. The Department of Buildings will contact the preparer if there are any questions about the application or if the application expires. Address and Secondary Address: Provide the street address of the building or structure to be demolished. Use the [Chicago Online Zoning Map](https://gisapps.chicago.gov/ZoningMapWeb/) to confirm street addresses. If the building has a range of addresses or is on a corner, provide all addresses in the secondary address field. PIN(s): Provide all affected Permanent Identification Numbers (PINs). PINs are assigned by Cook County for property tax purposes. You can look up PINs using the [Chicago Online Zoning Map](https://gisapps.chicago.gov/ZoningMapWeb/) or the [Cook County Property Tax Portal](https://www.cookcountypropertyinfo.com/). Type of Demolition: Use the questions in the box on the right side of Page 1 to determine if the planned work is classified as an \"ordinary demolition\" or \"complex demolition.\" Incorrect classification of the planned work will delay issuance of your permit. Fire Damage: If the building or structure to be demolished has been damaged by fire, you must indicate this on the application. Location of Structure on Site: Indicate the location of the structure to be demolished relative to the primary street address. For example, if the building to be demolished is behind a building that faces the primary street address, select \"Rear.\" If you select \"Other,\" provide more information in the Secondary Address field or Description of Work field. Building Contains Dwelling Units: Indicate if the building contains dwelling units. If the building contains dwelling units, you will also need to submit [Form 483](/content/city/en/depts/bldgs/supp_info/permitforms.html) to the Department of Housing. Additional information about the definition of \"dwelling unit\" is found on [Form 483](/content/city/en/depts/bldgs/supp_info/permitforms.html). Main Occupancy Classification: Select one occupancy classification from the list that best reflects the primary occupancy of the building or structure to be demolished. For a building that contained multiple occupancies, select the occupancy with the greatest floor area. For more information on occupancy classifications, see Chapter 3 of the Chicago Building Code. Describe Work to be Performed: Provide a concise description of the work to be performed under the permit. The description should include the height (in feet or stories), material, and occupancy classification of the structure. For example: \"WRECK AND REMOVE A 3-STORY BRICK SCHOOL BUILDING, INCLUDING FOUNDATIONS\" or \"WRECK AND REMOVE A 2-STORY FRAME RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WITH 2 DWELLING UNITS (FRONT BUILDING).\" Describe Method of Demolition: Provide a brief description of the method of demolition to be used. For example: \"MECHANICAL DEMOLITION\" or \"HAND DEMOLITION.\" Note: Use of explosives for the purpose of building demolition requires an additional permit for Demolition by Implosion. This permit is issued by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) after a separate multi-departmental review and public notification process. A demolition permit cannot be issued by the Department of Buildings until the Demolition by Implosion permitting process is complete. Estimated Cost of Work: Estimate the cost of work to be performed in connection with this permit application, including associated utility disconnections and environmental work. Permit Applicant: Provide the name and contact information for the property owner who is applying for the permit. (The permit applicant must be a property owner, except where the City of Chicago is pursuing demolition for public safety reasons.) If there are multiple property owners, you do not need to identify all property owners. The name provided in this section will be printed on the permit certificate. Contractor: Provide the name, City of Chicago ID number, and City of Chicago General Contractor License number for the contractor who will perform the demolition. Changing the demolition contractor after a permit application number is assigned requires starting a new permit application.

Performing Demolition Work The demolition contractor must post a copy of the permit certificate at the work site, in a location that is visible and legible from a public street or sidewalk, before beginning demolition work. The permit certificate must remain posted until the final inspection is completed. Where applicable, a copy of the written Site Safety and Operations Plan and Structural Condition Report must be available on site whenever work is occurring. You may not start work before the start date provided to the Department of Public Health (CDPH) and you must notify CDPH if your start date changes.

Inspections: Complex Demolition For complex demolition work, the contractor must request the progress inspections decided upon during the pre-permit inspection. The fee for these inspections is charged at the time of permit issuance. The contractor must also request an inspection when all demolition work is complete and again after the site is graded. If additional inspections are required, either at the request of the contractor or as determined by the Department of Buildings, an additional fee will be charged. Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling Compliance Pursuant to the [Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling Ordinance](/content/city/en/depts/streets/supp_info/construction_anddemolitionsites.html), compliance paperwork must be provided to the Department of Public Health (CDPH) at the conclusion of demolition work.
