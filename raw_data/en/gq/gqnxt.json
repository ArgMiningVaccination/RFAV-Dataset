Along with proper diet, low stress, and getting enough sleep, we can use Chinese Medicine to prepare for the change of seasons. [Many people count on Acupuncture](https://www.healingvibesacupuncture.com/what-is-acupuncture) for the Immune System. These amazing treatments include Moxibustion, Acupuncture, and Chinese herbs. [Moxibustion is a Chinese herb called Mugwort](https://www.healingvibesacupuncture.com/blog/blog/how-can-moxibustion-therapy-help-you) [,](https://www.healingvibesacupuncture.com/blog/blog/how-to-strengthen-your-immune-system) which is safely burned during treatments on specific acupuncture points on the body. A really amazing scientific fact about this herb is that when used on these acupuncture points, it actually triples your white blood cell count within 10 minutes! These white blood cells are what your body uses to help fight against many viruses and bacteria in common colds, flues, and other respiratory disorders. Chinese herbs have truly amazing properties that help strengthen the immune system. Most commonly used in my clinic is the formula Immune +Plus. This herbal formula has the herbs Astragulus and Ganoderma Mushroom just to name a few. These two herbs are very powerful at keeping your body balanced, and keep you from getting sick! This formula is taken a few times per day in capsule form. It's also great to take when traveling, a time when we are confronted with many germs on airplanes and in airports. Using these powerful natural medicine modalities to prevent our bodies from getting sick is much safer than getting sick and resorting to antibiotics. Antibiotics harm the digestive system, making it even easier for us to get sick next time around. Along with Chinese herbs, diet can play a major role in our immune system! Here is a great example of a smoothie to make at home which will definitely benefit our immune systems. Immunity Booster Smoothie 1 orange 1 apple 2 handfuls of spinach or kale \u00bd of a lemon (peeled) Tip of your thumb size nodule of ginger \u00be cup berries of your choice 3 ice cubes (optional) (it's better to keep our bodies warm and not ingest too much cold foods during the winter months) "}
