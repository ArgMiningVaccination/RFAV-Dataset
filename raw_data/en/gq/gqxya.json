With this in mind, I wanted to take the opportunity to share my understanding of the rapidly changing information currently available on the virus. All of the information in my letter is based on early data developed from rapidly evolving and changing situations globally and only with time will the world have a better idea about the true nature of the infectiousness of this virus and its dangers. It is our sincere hope at vpk that any global health concerns will be dealt with effectively, pass quickly, and not re-emerge. The Ayurvedic Perspective I would start by stating first and foremost, try to stay healthy and stay balanced. A balanced body and immune system respond in a balanced manner to any illness. An unbalanced system does not. There is a profound adage in Ayurveda that disease is not caused by germs, bacteria, or viruses, rather disease is precipitated by these pathogens in a susceptible host. To the extent you can control your life and lifestyle, do not be a susceptible host. How serious are our concerns with the Covid-19? Very. High Mortality Comparing Covid-19 to the flu... Last year the flu had a .10% (1/10th of 1%) mortality rate with over 34,200 deaths in the US alone. This year is no exception with the flu mortality rate quite high. \" [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018-2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza.\" In China, where the numbers are being closely watched, Covid-19 now has a 3.5% mortality rate, anywhere from a 35 to 70 times higher mortality rate than the flu, depending on the flu year analyzed. If we use the US 2018/2019 flu numbers of over 35 million and apply this to Covid-19, in the US alone, over 1.2 million people could lose their lives. This is why we are seeing governments quite concerned with stemming the spread of this virus. Additionally, the number of individuals that develop serious symptoms is quite high, with many developing some form of pneumonia and, in the most severe cases, respiratory failure. With some of the most severe cases, individuals develop an immune reaction known as a cytokine storm, whereby their immune system becomes overzealous and a flood of immune cells and biochemicals destroy lung tissue and other organs. Also, it has been observed that permanent or long-term lung tissue damage can take place in a high percentage of those with the virus, regardless of severity or symptoms. The highest mortality rate is found in those over the age of 60 and those with already compromised immune systems, but no one is immune from this serious illness, and younger adults and children have also fallen seriously ill from Covid-19. As mentioned earlier, regardless of age or symptoms, long-term lung damage is being noted in a high percentage of cases. Highly Contagious Covid-19 is highly contagious. Current statistics show Covid-19 to be over 2 times more contagious than influenza. The virus is passed from person to person through respiration, touching objects contaminated by those contagious and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes, and it is also passed through feces. Many with the virus are completely symptom free and thus circulate in society unintentionally infecting others. Also, the virus is contagious in the early stages before symptoms appear. Prevention and Cures Although many countries are working on vaccines and medical treatment, to date there is no definitive cure or prevention from a western medical standpoint. What You Can Do First and foremost, if you can, don't allow yourself to be exposed. When possible, try to avoid unnecessary public trips and large crowds, especially in locations with known incidents of the illness and where a large percentage of people that travel internationally are found. Follow good general hygiene practices and wash your hands regularly. Second, and as mentioned at the start of my letter, stay rested, follow a healthy lifestyle, and stay balanced. A balanced body and immune system respond in a balanced manner when exposed to pathogens. Follow a seasonal routine that is appropriate to your Prakriti (dosha makeup) and Vakriti (current state of balance), including going to bed early, eating food that balances your unique physiology, following a regular routine, and reducing stressful activities. Are You Sick? If you are having flu-like symptoms, it is best to stay home. If you feel you need medical care, contact your health provider or hospital first and tell them your symptoms, especially if you have reason to believe you have been in proximity or contact with individuals you believe may have contracted the virus. Your health professionals will guide you on how to handle your visit. Avoid using mass transit for your visit to the doctor or hospital. Even the flu is highly contagious and dangerous for the elderly and very young, so please remember to be especially careful and considerate of others. Protect Yourself and Community Whether one feels susceptible based on health or age, or not susceptible at all, for the sake of our family, friends, and communities each of us has a responsibility to limit our exposure to this virus. Keep in mind that if this illness were to spread unabated, our health care system could become overwhelmed, and this could result in an even higher mortality rate. For the sake of all those you care about, our nation, and world, now is a good time to be conservative and not needlessly expose yourself to this illness thereby endangering yourself and others.
