PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS xi Preface Human beings are social by na ture, and high-quality social relationships are vital for health and well-being. Like many other social dete rminants of health, however, social isolation (an objective lack of social contact with others) and loneliness (the subj ective feeling of being isolated) are significant ye t underappreciated public health risk s. Social isolation and loneliness are associated with poor physic al and mental health outcome s, including higher rates of mortality, depression, and cognitive decline. Recent research doc uments the high prevalence of social isolation and loneliness among older adults . For example, data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study found that 24 percen t of community-dwelling older adults are considered socially isolated, and a 2018 surv ey by the AARP Foundation found that more than one-third (35 percent) of adu lts aged 45 and older are lonel y. Additionally, a 2018 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 22 percent of adults in the Un ited States say the \"often or always feel lonely, feel that they lack companions hip, feel left out, or feel isolated from others.\" While the science of social relationships a nd their consequences on health and well-being has been documented for decades, the topics of social isolation and loneliness have recently garnered increased attention in the mass media. Fo r example, in the past few years, articles in The New York Times featured headlines such as \"How So cial Isolation is Killing Us\" and \"The Surprising Effects of Lo neliness on Health.\" In particular, the AARP Foundation has played a key role in bringi ng attention to the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness . In this context, the AARP Foundation came to the National Academies of Sc iences, Engineering, and Medicine for an examination of the health and medical dimensi ons of social isolati on and loneliness and for recommendations on the role of the health care system in helping to reduce the incidence and adverse health impacts of social isolation and loneliness among olde r adults in clinical settings. This exploration is notable in that relatively few st akeholders have paid atte ntion to the particular role that health care profe ssionals and providers can play. During this broad-based review of the issues of social isolation and loneliness, the committee identified several overarching challenges. Most prominently is the multiplicity of terms for different aspects of social relationshi ps (such as social is olation, social support, loneliness, and social networks, among others). Furthermore, the term s social isolation and loneliness are often conflated, but they represent distinct concepts , each with their own measures. As a result, the literature base on the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness, as well as potentia l interventions are c onfounded by this confusion of terminology.

All rights reserved.xii SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS the report, the committee sought to carefully repo rt the evidence accurate ly in terms of the specific aspects of social isolat ion and loneliness that were ac tually targeted and measured. This report presents a comprehensive review of the impacts of social isolation and loneliness on mortality and morbid ity, the risk factors for social isolation and loneliness, the mechanisms by which social isolation and loneline ss impact health, the factors that affect those mechanisms, and the ways in which researchers m easure social isolation and loneliness and their resultant impacts on health. Furthermore, the co mmittee discusses the role of the health care system in addressing these issues, the ways in which we can better educate and train our health care workforce, and which interventions (particular ly for the clinical setting) show the most promise. Finally, the committee discusses general principles of dissemination and implementation that will be important for transla ting research into practice, especially as the evidence base for effective interventions continues to flourish. Overall, this committee comes to the firm c onclusion that the health care system is well poised to develop and evaluate methods and proce sses to identify social isolation and loneliness among older adults in clinical settings. In fact, the committee notes that a single interaction with the health care system may repr esent the only opportunity to id entify those individuals who are the most isolated and lonely. However, we em phasize that the health care system cannot solve the problems of social isolat ion and loneliness alone; rather, the goals and recommendations presented in this report represent a vision for how the health care system can help as part of a larger global effort to combat the adverse health impacts of social isol ation and loneliness among adults aged 50 and older in the United States. As chair of the committee I would like to recognize and thank each committee member for his/her contributions to th e report. Our committee was most engaged with, even passionate about the topic yet throughout our discussions and drafting of the report the committee maintained the highest level of critical thinking and reliance on the evidence available to us. The entire committee owes a special thanks to Tr acy Lustig, Jennifer Cohen, Caroline Cilio, and Kendall Logan. We could not have asked for a mo re dedicated and thoughtful staff from the National Academies. Finally I offer thanks to A ndy Pope, the Director of the Board on Health Sciences Policy at the National Academies and to the AARP Foundation for supporting this exciting and meaningf ul exploration.

All rights reserved.PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-1 Summary Social isolation (the objective st ate of having few social relati onships or infrequent social contact with others) and loneli ness (a subjective feeling of be ing isolated) are serious yet underappreciated public health risks that affect a significant po rtion of the olde r adult population. Approximately one-quarter (24 percent) of community-dwelling Americans aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated, and a si gnificant proportion of adults in the United States report feeling lonely (35 percent of adults aged 45 and older and 43 percent of adults aged 60 and older). While there are challenges in measuring so cial isolation and loneli ness precisely, there is strong evidence that many older adults are socially isolated or lonely in ways that puts their health at risk. For example: Social isolation has been associated with a significantly increased risk of premature mortality from all causes; Social isolation has been associated with an approximately 50 pe rcent increased risk of developing dementia; Loneliness among heart failure patients has b een associated with a nearly four times increased risk of death, 68 percent increased risk of hospitalization, and 57 percent increased risk of emergency department visits; and Poor social relationships (cha racterized by social isolati on or loneliness) have been associated with a 29 percent increased risk of incident coronary heart disease and a 32 percent increased risk of stroke. Understanding the full scope and complexity of the influence of so cial relationships on health is challenging. In addition to the absolute number or exte nt of social relationships, the quality of such relationships is also an important factor in their impact on health. Two aspects of social relationships, social isol ation and loneliness, have become increasingly prominent in the scientific literature. While both social isolation and loneliness can affect health throughout the life course, this report focuses on the health impacts of social isol ation and loneliness among adults aged 50 and older. Of note, it is incorrect to assume that all older adults are isolated or lonely or that aging, independent of other factors, causes social isolation and loneliness. Rather, older adults are at increased risk for social isol ation and loneliness because they are more likely to face predisposing factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness, and sensory impairments. Over a life course, soci al isolation and loneliness may be episodic or chronic, depending upon an individual 's circumstances and perceptions. Many approaches have been taken to improve social connections for individuals who are socially isolated or lonely, but opportunities to intervene may be most challenging for those who Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.S-2 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS are at highest risk. For example, people who do not have consistent interac tions with others (e.g., have unstable housing, do not belong to any social or religious groups, or do not have significant personal relationships) may never be identified in their own communities. However, nearly all persons 50 years of age or older in teract with the health care system in some way. Therefore, this report focuses on the role of the health care syst em as a key and relatively untapped partner in efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate the a dverse health impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. STUDY CONTEXT AND CHARGE A systematic and rigorous science of soci al relationships and their consequences, especially in terms of health, em erged in the latter part of the 20th century as part of a broader recognition of the role of social determinants of health. By the beginning of the 21st century, several aspects of social relations hips were being studied systematic ally in research and had been identified as potential influences on human health . Only recently have the adverse health effects of social isolation and loneliness received publ ic attention nationally and internationally. For example, in January 2018, Teresa May, the prim e minister of the United Kingdom, established and appointed a Minister of Loneliness to de velop policies for both measuring and reducing loneliness. With support from the AARP Foundation, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Acad emies) formed the Com mittee on the Health and Medical Dimensions of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Olde r Adults in the fall of 2018. The committee's charge essentially c onsisted of two parts. First, the committee was charged with summarizing the evidence for how social isolation and loneliness affect hea lth and quality of life in adults aged 50 and older, particularly among low-income, underserved, and vulnerable subpopulations (groups the committee refer to as \"at-risk\" populations). Second, the committee was charged with identifying and recommending opport unities specifically for c linical settings of health care to help reduce the incidence and a dverse health impacts of social isolation and loneliness (such as clinical tools and met hodologies, professional education, and public awareness) and to examine avenue s for the dissemination of information targeted to health care practitioners.1 While this report focuses on the role of the health care system, the committee emphasizes that the health care system alone cannot solve all of the challenges of social isolation and loneliness; rather, the health care system need s to connect with the broader public health and social care communities. Furthermore, the committ ee recognizes that in the larger context of addressing social isolation and l oneliness, the most effective in terventions may not require the participation of the health care system. However, this does not mean that the health care system should not strive to help impr ove the health and well-being of those who suffer the adverse health impacts of social isolati on and loneliness. In fact, health care providers may be in the best position to identify individuals who are at highe st risk for social is olation or loneliness\u2014 individuals for whom the health care system may be their only point of contact with their broader community. In this way, the health care system can help those i ndividuals to connect with the most appropriate care, either insi de or outside the health care syst em. Therefore, the health care system has the potential to be a critic al component of a much larger solution. 1 The complete Statement of Task is presented in Chapter 1 of this report.

All rights reserved.SUMMARY S-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS DEFINING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS The broad, interdisciplinary scie ntific fields that together form the modern science of social relationships have used a variety of te rms\u2014social isolation, so cial connection, social networks, social support, social relationships, loneliness, and so forth\u2014to refer to related situations. There are important dis tinctions among these terms in wh at they describe or measure, but they are often erroneously used interchangeab ly. An individual can be isolated and not feel lonely, or can feel lonely even if he or she is not isolated. Social isolation and loneliness represent distinct phenomena. Social isolation typically refers to the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others and is marked by a person having few social network ties, having infrequent social contact, or, potentially, living alone. Loneliness , by contrast, refers to the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of bein g lonely. Although those who lack social contact may feel lonely, social isol ation and loneliness ofte n are not significantly correlated. Thus it is important to distinguish between the two states. The term \"social relationships\" is arguabl y the most common way of referring to the connections and intersections among human bei ngs, and it derives from and is employed in broader common usage. In 1979 Berkman and Syme documented the strong association between social relationships and all-cause mortality and, hence, life exp ectancy, using networks\" and \"social inte gration\" to denote a broad pattern of social relationships (with both individuals and groups). Additionally, there ha s been much research on the concept of social support , the actual or perceive d availability of resources from others. Over the last several decades there has been a new focus on loneliness as a risk factor for heal th. While each of these terms have been linked to important health outc omes, they are not highly correlated, suggesting that they may influence health through different mechanisms. Thus, the term \"social connection\" has been proposed to encompass the different conceptual and measurement approaches (see Figure S-1). Social isolation is reflected in Figure S-1 as a st ructural indicator of social connection while loneliness is functional indicator. The literature concerning social isolation and lo neliness uses all of these terms. To describe the evidence base as accurately as possible, when the evidence does not differentiate among or combines several related terms, this report uses the term social connection to refer to the various structural, functional, and quality aspects of social relationships . This report uses the specific terms \"social isolation,\" \"loneline ss,\" or other terms when the da ta are specific to these terms.2 2 While social integration can describe high social connectio n, low scores on measures of social integration (e.g., on the Berkman Syme Social Network Index) are frequently us ed an indication of social isolation. Thus, the term \"social isolation\" will also be used to represent these data.

GOALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The committee formulated its recommendations in accordance with five goals, each of which addresses an aspect of e nhancing the role of the health care system in addressing the health impacts of social isolati on and loneliness in older adults (see Box S-1). While not all the recommendations are explicitly directed to clinic ians or clinical settings of care, the committee identified recommendations that would be most helpful to reach the ultimate goal of developing and improving clinical interventions to mitigate th e negative health impacts of social isolation and loneliness. Furthermore, the committee emphas izes that the preservation of an individual's own decisions regarding his or her life is essent ial as a guiding principle for all interventions. The following sections discuss the overall goals a nd recommendations of this report, all of which apply to interventions in health care settings for adults 50 and older. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY S-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Goal 1: Develop a More Robust Evidence Base While a substantial and growing body of evid ence demonstrates the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness, the evidence base for interventions for specific populations or settings is less robust. Recommendations are prov ided for meeting the goal of developing a more robust evidence base on effective assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies. Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Mortality Social isolation and loneliness ar e as prevalent and play as la rge a role in today's society as many other well-established risk factors for health, yet limited resources and attention have been committed to better understanding social isolation and loneliness and their individual and collective impacts on health. Over four decades of research has produced robust evidence that lacking social connection\u2014and, part icularly, scoring high on meas ures of social isolation\u2014is associated with a significantly increased risk for premature mortality from all causes. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the magn itude of the effect of social connection on risk for mortality may be comparable to or greater than other well-est ablished risk factors that are widely recognized and acted on by the pub lic health and health care systems. While there is evidence that loneliness is a ssociated with mortality, the existing evidence does not yet approach the cumulative weight of evidence for the association between social isolation and mortality. More res earch is needed to establish th e strength and robustness of the predictive association of loneliness with mortality in relation to social isolation and to clarify how social isolation and loneliness rela te to and operate with each other. BOX S-1 Goals for Enhancing the Role of the Health Care Sector in Addressing the Impacts of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults 1. Develop a more robust evidence base for effective assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies for social isolation and loneliness; 2. Translate current research into health care practices in order to reduce the negative health impacts of social isolation and loneliness; 3. Improve awareness of the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness across the health care workforce and among members of the public; 4. Strengthen ongoing education and training related to social isolation and loneliness in older adults for the health care workforce; and 5.

All rights reserved.S-6 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS RECOMMENDATION 2-1: Major funders of health research, including the government (e.g., the National Institutes of Health, the Cent er for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Cen tered Outcomes Research Institute), foundations, and large health plans should fund research on social isolation and loneliness at levels that reflect their associations with mortality.3 Risk Factors and Health Impacts The relationships between risk factors, social isolation or loneliness, and health impacts can be reciprocal in that not onl y can being socially isolated or lonely have an impact on health, but the resultant health conditions can increase an individual's likelihood of expe riencing social isolation or loneliness. Furtherm ore, some factors may increase th e risk for social isolation and loneliness (and ultimately, result in negative hea lth impacts) while other factors may provide protective benefits. Substantial evidence indicates that social isolation, lonelin ess, and other indicators of social connection have associations with major fo rms of physical, cognitive, and psychological morbidity; health-related behaviors; and health-related quality of life. However, the evidence for specific impacts in the at-risk populations is sparse. Beyond these associations, the mechanisms by wh ich social connection, or lack thereof, affects the development and course of disease ha ve been elucidated by a growing evidence base. Strong evidence links social isol ation, loneliness, and other indi cators of social connection to changes in biological and behavioral responses wh ich may in turn influence health risk. Thus, current evidence supports plausible biological an d behavioral mechanisms that explain how social isolation and loneliness ultim ately influence health outcomes. The committee identified the in creased funding of basic resear ch as key to developing a more robust evidence base on effective assessmen t, prevention, and interv ention strategies for social isolation and loneliness (Goal 1). Specifically, the comm ittee concluded that identifying, prioritizing, and developing ways to translate scientific knowledge about the impacts of social isolation and loneliness on health into effec tive and efficient clinical and public health interventions first requires a better understand ing of how social isol ation and loneliness are connected with each other and how they im pact health. This includes understanding the mechanisms through which social isolation and lonelin ess affect health, the ri sk factors for social isolation and loneliness, and the factors that aff ect those relationships. RECOMMENDATION 3-1: Major funders of health research, including the government (e.g., the National Institutes of Health, the Cent er for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Cen tered Outcomes Research Institute), foundations, and large health plans shou ld fund research to improve the basic scientific understanding of the links between social conn ection and health, including the study of risk factors and mechanisms. The Current Evidence Base for Interventions The overall quality of the evidence for specific clinical and public health interventions for social isolation and loneliness in older adults is mi xed. In part, this is due to the heterogeneity of older people themselves and among the underlying causes of their isolatio n or loneliness. While 3 The committee's recommendations are numbered according to the chapter of the main report in which they appear. Thus, Recommendation 2-1 is the first recommendation in Chapter 2.

All rights reserved.SUMMARY S-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS there is some evidence for promising approach es, the committee concludes that researchers are only beginning to understand which specific appr oaches work best for which populations and which risk factors. In particular, the committee em phasizes that different intervention approaches may be needed for social isolation versus lonelin ess. Furthermore, in th e case of technological interventions, many gaps in understanding remai n, particularly related to possible unintended harms and ethical concerns as well as the impact of current trends, such as the use of social media on future generations of older adults. The committee identified three major aspects of the evidence base for effective clinical and public health interventions that need to be addressed in order to determine best practices and approaches: quality, funding, and research gaps. That is, the overall quality of the evidence base needs to be improved, adequate funding of resear ch will be required, and research on major gaps in the current evidence base need to be priori tized. Therefore, the committee makes the following recommendations: RECOMMENDATION 9-3: Funders should prioritize research that builds a scientific foundation for clin ical and public health inte rventions that reduce the health and medical impacts of social is olation and loneliness based on standard theoretical frameworks. Researchers and health care providers and systems that study interventions for social isolation or loneliness should consider the following key elements in the design and evaluation of any intervention in order to enhance the ability to compare across studies: A theoretical framework that drives particular approaches Appropriate choice of measure A specific target population Scalability Sustainability Ways to encourage data sharing RECOMMENDATION 9-4: Major funders of health research, including the government (e.g., the National Institutes of Health, the Cent er for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Cen tered Outcomes Research Institute), foundations, and large health plans should fund research on interv entions in clinical settings to identify, prevent, and mitigate the effects of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. RECOMMENDATION 9-5: Those who fund, develop, and operate programs to assess, prevent, and intervene in social isolation and loneliness should prioritize research on the following major gaps in the evidence base: Tailored interventions based on a pub lic health framework of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. In particular, researchers should examine improved measures to identify individuals who may be at high risk for social isolation or loneliness and pr imary interventions in order to target such individuals.

All rights reserved.S-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Trends among current younger adults as they age (e.g., use of technology, economic trends) to gain knowledge that informs future approaches to addressing social isolation and loneliness. Flexibility in funding to allow for the pilot testing and evaluation of innovative funding mechanisms for interventions Approaches for assessments of and interventions among understudied groups of older adults (e.g., low income, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) and those who face unique barriers to health. RECOMMENDATION 9-6: System designers as well as those who are developing and deploying technology in interventi ons should ensure that technological innovations related to social isolation and loneliness are properly assessed and tested so as to understand their full range of bene fits and potential adverse consequences in order to prevent harm, and they sh ould work to understand and take into account contextual issues, such as broadband access and having sufficient knowledge and support for using the technology. Goal 2: Translate Current Resear ch into Health Care Practices Older adults are high-volume and high-fre quency users of the health care system. Targeting the major social and behavioral risk factors for health offers a way to improve population health and even reduce he alth disparities. Health care delivery systems are exploring the feasibility and impact of us ing practice-based strategies to identify and address the social determinants of health, includi ng social isolation a nd loneliness. Many intervention efforts for social isolation and loneline ss focus only on community-based organizations, but given the evidence for the broad-reaching impacts of social isolation and loneliness on the health of older adults and the emerging evidence for their imp acts on health care utilization, the committee concluded that the health care system is well pois ed to develop methods for beginning to identify social isolation and loneliness in health care set tings. By first identifying those at highest risk, clinicians and health care researchers may be able to use these findings to better target meaningful clinical and public heal th interventions to individual pa tients as well as to high-need populations served by a practice or health care sy stem. Furthermore, this will support a step-wise approach to care that includes th e identification of individuals at risk, the provision of education, and ultimately, intervention. RECOMMENDATION 7-1: Health care providers and practices should periodically perform an assessment using one or more va lidated tools to identify older adults experiencing social isolation and loneliness in order to initiate potential preventive interventions after having identified indivi duals who are at an elevated risk due to life events (e.g., loss of a significant relat ionship, geographic move, relevant health conditions). In the case of older adults who are curren tly socially isolated or lonely (or at an elevated risk for soci al isolation or loneliness ), health care providers should discuss the adverse health outcom es associated with social isolation and loneliness with these older ad ults and their legally appointed Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY S-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS representatives. Providers should ma ke appropriate efforts to connect isolated or lonely older adul ts with needed social care. For older adults who are currently social ly isolated or lonely, health care providers should attempt to determ ine the underlying causes and use evidence-based practices tailored to a ppropriately address those causes (e.g., hearing loss, mobility limitations). A variety of established res earch tools can be used to measure social isolation and loneliness, each with its own strengths and wea knesses. Despite the limits of the evidence base concerning how best to implement these tools in clinical settings, the committee concluded that an important aspect of selecting a tool for use in clinical settings is standardization. This means that within a specific health care system or orga nization, all clinicians sh ould use the same tool or set of tools; they should use only validated tools and refrain from using only parts of existing tools or creating new, unvalidated tools. While the committee recognizes that some variation in choice of appropriate tool s may be necessary for assessing cert ain specific populations or health conditions, it emphasizes that the chosen measurem ent tool needs to match the research question. (That is, if assessing for loneliness, for instance, the tool needs to be validated specifically for the measurement of loneliness, as opposed to other indicators of so cial connection.) In spite of limitations to existing tools, their use is necessary to address social isolation and loneliness more fully in clinical settings. More effort is needed to update ex isting tools and to develop and validate better tools that can fu lly capture the experi ence of social isolation and loneliness among today's older adults. Additional research is needed to evaluate the ethical implications and unintended consequences of clinical assessments and also to determine specific implementation details, including who should receive the assessment, who should conduct the assessment, the ideal frequency of assessment for different subpopulations, and the appropriate interventions, referrals, and follow-up care. Many initiatives to address social isolation a nd loneliness in clinical settings are being undertaken by individuals without formal research training. Linking clinicians and others who are implementing new interventions with formally trained researchers early on in the design of the intervention can help to en sure robust research design, an d thereby improve the evidence concerning the use of validate d tools in clinical settings. RECOMMENDATION 7-2: Health care syst ems should create opportunities for clinicians to partner with researchers to evaluate the application of currently available evidence-based tools to assess soci al isolation and loneliness in clinical settings, including testing and appl ications for specific populations. Finally, the committee concludes that assessme nt data need to be included in clear locations in the electr onic health record. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.S-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS RECOMMENDATION 7-3: The committee e ndorses the recommendation of previous National Academies reports that so cial isolation should be included in the electronic health record or medical record. Research will be needed to determine how to best integrate informa tion from a patients' assessments into their health record in order to make determinations a bout future care and the identification of risk. Goals 3 and 4: Improve Awareness and St rengthen Ongoing Education and Training Educating and training the health care workfo rce about addressing social isolation and loneliness will require a broad approach similar to educating the workforce to address the social determinants of health. Workforce development is needed within formal degree and postgraduate programs for health professionals, in training pr ograms for direct care workers and community members, and in lifelong learning opportunities. It will be necessary to educate and train all members of the health care work force, including professionals, di rect care workers, community health workers, volunteers, family caregivers, and members of the larger community, such as police officers and mail carriers, who provide a broa d array of services to or regularly interact with older adults.4 Improving Overall Awareness Based on the significant evidence base concer ning the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness, the committee concluded that, as with other public health issues of the same magnitude, a critical step toward preventing, mitigating, or eliminating negative health impacts will be to improve awareness among the general public and, specifically for this report, among the health care workforce itself. RECOMMENDATION 8-1: The U.S. Departme nt of Health and Human Services should advocate for including measures of social isolation and loneliness in major large-scale health strategies (e.g., Healthy People) and surveys (e.g., National Health Interview Survey). RECOMMENDATION 8-2: Health and aging organizations, relevant government agencies, and consumer-facing organizations should create public awareness and education campaigns that highlight the he alth impacts of social isolation and loneliness in adults. Health care systems, associations re presenting all types of health care workers (e.g., American Medical Associat ion, American Nurses Association, American Psychological Association, Nati onal Association of Social Workers, American Geriatrics Society, American A ssociation for Geriatric Psychiatry, organizations representing direct care workers), health-related organizations (e.g., American Heart Association), consumer-facing health-related 4 This report focuses on the education and training of hea lth care workers, particularly health care professionals and direct-care workers. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY S-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS organizations (e.g., AARP), associations (e.g., American Society on Aging, Gerontological Soci ety of America), aging services organizations (e.g., area agencies on agi ng, state departments on aging), and organizations working with at-risk older adults (e.g., National Hispanic Council on Aging) should actively comm unicate information about the health impacts of social isolat ion and loneliness through print and digital media. Organizations representing health plans and providers should include consumer-friendly information about the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness in their repository of patient resources (e.g., where the organization provide information abou t the self-management of various chronic diseases). Strengthening Education and Training While research-based eviden ce is not yet available to support curricular content on specific interventions for social isolation and loneliness in older adul ts, enough is known about the health impacts to warrant broad curricular recommendations for all health professions and careers. Education is needed about the prevalence of social is olation and loneliness in older adults, the health outcomes and risk factors for so cial isolation and loneli ness, and how to assess for these problems. Health professionals also need to learn how to work directly with older adults and their significant others to support and encour age ways to prevent or reduce social isolation and loneliness, including how to make and fo llow up on referrals to appropriate community- based services. This will include learning to work with direct care workers, community health workers, family caregivers, and other community members as part of a team-based approach to helping older adults. Health care professionals al so need to learn how to work with community partners to develop, implement, and evaluate programs for preventing or mitigating social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Comp etency in each of these areas will become increasingly important as systems of care ar e developed for preventi ng, assessing, and treating the negative health impacts of soci al isolation and loneli ness in older adults. Therefore, as a first step, the committee makes the following recommendations: RECOMMENDATION 8-3: Health professions schools and colleges as well as direct care worker training programs should incl ude education and training related to social isolation and loneliness in their curr icula, optimally as interprofessional team- based learning experiences. Health education and training progra ms should include information on clinical approaches to assessing and in tervening when an older adult is at risk for social isolation and loneliness. As evidence on effective interventions develops, health education and training programs should provide educ ation on integrating care related to social isolation and loneliness into clinic al practice and as part of discharge planning, care coordination, and transi tional care planning with community organizations. RECOMMENDATION 8-4: Health professional associations should incorporate information about the health and medical im pacts of social isol ation and loneliness on older adults in their advocacy, pr actice, and education initiatives. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.S-12 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Health professional associations should include social isolation and loneliness in conference programming, webinars, t oolkits, clinical guidelines, and advocacy priorities. RECOMMENDATION 8-5: Health profes sional associations, membership organizations, academic institutions, health insurers, researchers, developers of education and training program s, and other actors in th e public and private sectors should support, develop, and test differe nt educational and training approaches related to the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults across different segments of the he althcare workforce (including health care professionals and direct care workers) in orde r to determine the most effective ways to enhance competencies. In addition to in itial clinical education, these approaches should apply to professional educatio n, continuing education modules, online learning, and other forms of lifelong learning. Depending upon the complexity of the knowledge to be disseminated or the evidence- based practices to be implemented, a variety of teaching strategies can be considered. As the evidence for interventions evolves, the educational and training opportunities need to expand to include new and updated evidence-based practi ces for preventing, assessing, and treating the negative health impacts of soci al isolation a nd loneliness. Goal 5: Strengthen Ties Between the Health Care System and Community-Based Networks and Resources Like other social determinants of health, social isolation and l oneliness are community- wide problems and some solutions will require c oordinated solutions between the health care system and community-based social care providers. National, state, and local coalitions of public and private health care leaders, including minorit y-based community organizations, need to work collectively to develop strategies to address social isolation a nd loneliness in older adults. RECOMMENDATION 9-1: Health care prov iders, organizations, and systems should partner with social service provi ders, including those serving vulnerable communities, in order to create effective te am-based care (which includes services such as transportation and housing suppo rt) and to promote the use of tailored community-based services to address social isolation and lonelin ess in older adults. Many health care organizations (e.g., hospitals) are required under federal law to submit community benefit reports. Efforts by such entities to partner with social service providers could be used as an example of their community benefit. The 2019 National Academies' report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care cites the provision of transportation vouchers and the investment in co mmunity ride-sharing programs as examples of activities that can improve the integration of care. Such services could allow indivi duals to travel to health care appointments and to overcome individual transportati on-related barriers to being more integrated into local community events, both of which could help to reduce social is olation and loneliness. A variety of stakeholders, both within and outside of the form al health care system, are testing new approaches to prev enting, identifying, and intervening in social isolation or Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.SUMMARY S-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS loneliness for older adults. The committee conc luded that as new evidence develops, a centralized sharing of resources and best practices would benefit all stakeholders. RECOMMENDATION 9-2: Given the public heal th impact of social isolation and loneliness, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services should establish and fund a national resource cente r to centralize evidence, res ources, training, and best practices on social isolation and loneliness, including those for older adults and for diverse and at-risk populations. DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION The dissemination and implementation of evid ence into regular and effective use is complex because of the multiplicity and varying capacities of health care systems and providers and the diversity of the target audiences. However, such effo rts are imperative in order to improve quality of care, outcomes, and populatio n health. Two main challenges exist for the dissemination and implementation of evidence relate d to the social isolat ion and loneliness of older adults. First, better disse mination is needed of the eviden ce of the health impacts. Second, the best practices of implementation science need to be used in order to ensure that health care systems and providers are able to more quickly adopt evidence-based practices. This will be particularly important as the evidence base on the effectiveness of specific interventions improves.

PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-1 1 Introduction A social instinct is implanted in all [people] by nature.... Aristotle, Politics , 350 B.C.E. (Jowett, 2009) The scientific evidence is convincing. Str ong social ties are good for one's health. Lubben, 2017 Social isolation (the objective st ate of having few social relati onships or infrequent social contact with others) and loneli ness (a subjective feeling of be ing isolated) are serious yet underappreciated public health risks that affect a signifi cant portion of the population. Approximately one-quarter (24 percent) of community-dwelling Americans aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated, and a si gnificant proportion of adults in the United States report feeling lonely (35 percent of adults aged 45 and older and 43 percent of adults aged 60 and older) (Anderson and Thayer, 2018; Cudjoe et al ., 2020; Perissinotto et al., 2012). In spite of some challenges related to the measurement of so cial isolation and loneliness, current evidence suggests that many older adults are socially isolated or lonely (o r both) in ways that put their health at risk. For example: Social isolation significantly increases a person's risk of mortality from all causes, a risk that may rival the ri sks of smoking, obesity, and phys ical activity (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2017); Being socially connected in a variety of wa ys is associated with having a 50 percent greater likelihood of survival, with some indicators of social integration being associated with a 91 percent greater likeli hood of survival (Holt- Lunstad et al., 2010); Social isolation has been associated with a 29 percent increased all-cause risk for mortality and a 25 percent increased risk fo r cancer mortality (Fleisch Marcus et al., 2017; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015;); Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.1-2 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Loneliness has been associated with higher rates of clin ically significant depression, anxiety, and suicidal idea tion (Beutel et al., 2017); Loneliness has been associated with a 59 pe rcent increased risk of functional decline and 45 percent increased risk of death (Perissinotto et al., 2012); Poor social relationships (cha racterized by social isolati on or loneliness) have been associated with a 29 percent increased risk of incident coronary heart disease and a 32 percent increased risk of str oke (Valtorta et al., 2016a); Loneliness among heart failure patients has b een associated with a nearly four times increased risk of death, 68 percent increased risk of hospitalization, and 57 percent increased risk of emergency departme nt visits (Manema nn et al., 2018); and Social isolation has been associated with an approximately 50 pe rcent increased risk of developing dementia (Kuiper et al., 2015; Penninkilampi et al., 2018). Understanding the full scope and complexity of the influence of so cial relationships on health is challenging. In addition to the absolute number or exte nt of social relationships, the quality of such relationships is also important for their impact on health. As such, two aspects of social relationships, social isola tion and loneliness, have become mo st prominent in the scientific literature. While both social is olation and loneliness can affect health throughout the life course, this report focuses specifically on the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness among adults aged 50 and older. Of note, it is incorrect to assume that all older people are isolated or lonely. Ra ther, older adults are at increased ri sk for social isol ation and loneliness because they are more likely to face predisposing factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness, and sensory impairment s. Over a life course, social isolation and loneliness may be episodic or chronic, de pending upon an individual's circumstances and perceptions. Many approaches have been taken to improve social connections for individuals who are socially isolated or lonely, but finding opportunities to interven e may be most challenging for those who are at highest risk. Fo r example, people who do not have consistent interactions with others (e.g., have unstable housing, do not belong to any social or religious groups, or do not have significant persona l relationships) may never be iden tified in their own communities. However, nearly all persons who ar e 50 years of age or older interact with the health care system in some way, regardless of where they fall on the social isolation or loneliness continuum, and so this interaction may serve as a touchpoint to iden tify those who are isolated or lonely. Therefore, this report focuses on the role of the health car e system as a key and relatively untapped partner in efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate the adverse health impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. STUDY CONTEXT A systematic and rigorous science of soci al relationships and their consequences, especially in terms of health, em erged in the latter part of the 20th century as part of a broader recognition of the role of social determinants of health. By the beginning of the 21st century, several aspects of social rela tionships were being studied sy stematically in research and identified as potential influences on human health . Only recently have the adverse health effects of social isolation and loneline ss received public attention nati onally and internationally through governmental initiatives, the work of nonprof it organizations, and mass media coverage Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION 1-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2018; Frank, 2018; Hafner, 2016; Khullar, 2016). For example, in January 2018, Theresa May, prime minister of the United Kingdom, established and appoint ed a minister of loneliness to develop policies for both measuring and reducing l oneliness (Yeginsu, 2018). In his keynote address for the Accreditati on Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) 2019 Annual Educational Conference, Vivek Murthy, the 19th Surgeon General of the United States, spoke of an \"epidemic of lone liness\" which he recogniz ed during his tenure as Surgeon General, stating, I see [loneliness] actually as a primary conc ern, not just a health concern but as a concern as a society. . . . While the negativ e impact of loneliness cannot be denied, the treatment can be relatively simple. Part of treating loneline ss is creating moments for genuine human interaction, which can be achieved on several levels (ACGME, 2019). Prevalence of Social Isolation and Loneliness Understanding the prevalence of so cial isolation and loneliness is important in two ways. First, the population health impact of any risk factor is a func tion of the strength of its impact and its prevalence in a population. Second, whethe r a risk factor is becoming more or less prevalent is an indicator of whether its impor tance for population health is waxing or waning. However, it is very difficult to measure social isolation or loneliness in any population or to ascertain the degree of increase or decrease. A range of estimates have been made for the prevalence of social isolation and loneliness amo ng different segments of the adult population in the United States. For example: Data from the National Health and Agi ng Trends Study find that 24 percent of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older in the United States were categorized as being socially isolated and 4 percent were severely socia lly isolated (Cudjoe et al., 2020); A 2012 study by Perissinotto and colleagues f ound that 43 percent of adults aged 60 and older reported feeling l onely. Furthermore, among thos e who reported at least one symptom of loneliness, 13 percent repor ted the symptom as occurring \"often\" (Perissinotto et al., 2012); A survey by the AARP Foundation found that mo re than one-third (35 percent) of adults age 45 and older in the United St ates report feeling lonely (Anderson and Thayer, 2018); A 2018 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundati on 2018 found that \"more than a fifth of adults [aged 18 and older] in the United Stat es (22 percent) . . . say they often or always feel lonely, feel that they lack co mpanionship, feel left out, or feel isolated from others\" (DiJulio et al., 2018); A study by Hawkley and colleagues (2017) usin g data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project found that 19 per cent of adults aged 62-91 report frequent loneliness (with an additional 29 percent reporting occasional loneliness); and A study by Cigna of adults aged 18 and older found that 46 percent reported \"sometimes or always fee ling alone\" (Cigna/Ipsos, 2018). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.1-4 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Depending on how social isolation or lonelin ess is measured, the demographic trends contributing to it may include an increase in the number of people living alone, decreased marriage rates, higher rates of childlessness, or decreased community involvement (e.g., volunteerism, religious affiliation) (Holt-Luns tad, 2018b; Putnam, 2001). Social isolation and loneliness may occur unequally across age groups, including within the gr oup of adults 50 years of age and older who are the focus of this report. Furthermore, the oldest adults may not be the most isolated or lonely. For example, the 2018 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 59 percent of the respondent s who reported feeling lonely were under age 50 (DiJulio et al., 2018); the Cigna study found that adults aged 18 -22 were the loneliest, and that loneliness decreased with age Cigna/Ipsos, 2018); and a study by Hawkley and colleagues (2019) found that \"loneliness decreased with age through the early 70s, after which it increased\" (p. 1144). Aside from looking for differences among vari ous age segments of the adult population, several studies have examined whether there are va riations in the prevalen ce of social isolation or loneliness among subsets of adults related to demographic factors su ch as socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, gende r, educational status, employment status, and marital status. Several studies have found that those who report feeling lonely ar e more likely than others to report lower incomes and assets, having poorer health, and not being married (Anderson and Thayer, 2018; DiJulio et al., 2018; Hawkley et al., 2017). According to the study from Hawkley and colleagues (2017), \"loneliness is not significantly more prevalent in the oldest old adults, nor in minority groups relative to whites, nor in wo men relative to men\" (p. 6) and Anderson and Thayer (2018) found that individuals who identif y as LGBTQ are more likely to say they are lonely. Cudjoe and colleagues (2020) found that \"being unmarried, male, having low education, and low income were all independently associated with social isolation\" (p. 107). They further found that \"Black and Hispanic older adults had lower odds of social isolation compared with white older adults\" (p. 107). Differences in findings among many studies on the prevalence of social isolation and loneliness may be due, in part, to the challenges of defining and measurin g social isolation and loneliness, including the use of di fferent measures to assess differe nt aspects of social isolation and loneliness in various groups that may differ by various dem ographic factors. Despite the variance in measurement, there are clearly a vast number of people who are socially isolated or lonely. Furthermore, the implications of these findings for physical or me ntal health, morbidity, and mortality underscore the urgency surrounding th ese issues and render them topics of highest concern to both public health and clinical health care. CHARGE TO THE COMMITTEE With support from the AARP Foundation, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Acad emies) formed the Com mittee on the Health and Medical Dimensions of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Olde r Adults in the fall of 2018. The committee's charge essentially cons isted of two parts. First, the committee was asked to examine how social isolation and loneliness affect health and quality of life in adults aged 50 and older, particularly among low-income, underserve d, and vulnerable subpopulations. Second, the committee was charged to identify and recommend oppor tunities specifically for clinical settings of health care to help reduce the incidence and adverse health impacts of social isolation and loneliness (such as clinical tools and met hodologies, professional education, and public Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION 1-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS awareness) and to examine avenues for translati on and dissemination of information targeted to health care practitioners (see Box 1-1). The committee was asked to focus on adults aged 50 and older. Social connections are considered to be a fundamental human need and thus are vital across the lifespan. The committee acknowledges the importance of so cial connection at all ages and recognizes that social processes at earlier ages influe nce the trajectory of risk as one ages. For example, there is evidence that social disruptions (e.g., adverse childhood experiences) at early ages can place individuals on a worse health trajectory (Anda et al., 2006; Uchino, 2009a). However, for the purposes of this study and the specific task, the committee did not examine the evidence base related to the health impacts on younger generations or interventi ons aimed at those populations. Furthermore, the committee notes that studies both of the health impacts of social isolation or loneliness and of potential interv entions also often include differe nt segments of the population over age 50, which can make comparis ons across studies challenging. Box 1-1 Statement of Task An ad hoc committee under the auspices of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will examine how isolation and loneliness impact health outcomes in older adults aged 50 and older, particularly among low income, underserved and vulnerable subpopulations. The committee will: Summarize and examine the evidence that social isolation and loneliness predict poor health outcomes and increase a person's risk for premature morbidity, including evidence for: o Predictors of social isolation and loneliness; o Impact of social isolation and loneliness on the cognitive, emotional, medical, and quality of life outcomes; and o Factors that moderate and mediate the links between social isolation/loneliness and health outcomes. Explore how social isolation and loneliness affect health care access and utilization. Make evidence- based recommendations on translating research into practice within the clinical setting that could facilitate progress in reducing the incidence and adverse health impacts of social isolation and loneliness among the low-income 50+ population. These recommendations will focus on the following issues: o Opportunities for the identification of, prevention of, and interventions for social isolation and loneliness that can be incorporated into clinical environments that may include : social and environmental programs; the education of health care professionals; tools and methodologies that can be used in clinical settings; and public awareness. o Current financing for social isolation and loneliness interventions and future opportunities. Examine avenues for translation and dissemination of new findings and communication of new information targeting health care practitioners.

Furthermore, the committee recognizes that in the larger context of addressing social isolation and loneliness, the most effective interventions may not require the participation of the health care system. However, the committee argues that th is does not mean that the health care system should not strive to help impr ove the health and well-being of those who suffer the adverse health impacts of social isolati on and loneliness. In fact, health care providers may be in the best position to identify individuals who are at highe st risk for social is olation or loneliness\u2014 individuals for whom the health care system may be their only point of contact with their broader community. In this way, the health care system can help those i ndividuals to connect with the most appropriate care, either insi de or outside the health care syst em. Therefore, the health care system has the potential to be a critical compone nt of a much larger solution. As noted by Lisa Ryerson, President of AARP Foundation, in an open session of the committee's first meeting: \"We have been working in the space of social isolation and loneliness among older adults since 2010 and we have been working on advancing a variety of solutions as well as funding and examining the research. But for us this study fills an important research and recommendation gap because from our point of view we will not make measurable significant steps toward solving [social isolation and loneliness] unless we figure out the path for health care.\" RELEVANT NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORTS The National Academies has produced many reports related to the social determinants of health, and several of them are directly relevant to this current study. Th e work, conclusions, and recommendations of the current committee reinforce, extend, and elaborate on the work, conclusions, and recommendations of prior Nati onal Academies' committees. Box 1-2 provides some examples of previous Nati onal Academies' work related to the work of this committee. BOX 1-2 Previous Reports of the National Academies In The Second Fifty Years (IOM, 1992), the committee noted \"a lack of family and community supports plays an important role in the development and exacerbation of disease\" (p. 8). The report further indicated that \"clinicians, family, friends, and social institutions bear a responsibility for diminishing social isolation\" (p. 8). The committee recommended the identification of at-risk individuals, noting \"there are indications that the first opportunity for such an identification of needs is at the source of medical care\" (p. 256). In Capturing Social and Behavioral Domains and Measures in Electronic Health Records: Phase 2 (IOM, 2014), the committee recommended social isolation as one of 10 domains best suited for inclusion in all electronic health records. In assessing the usefulness of collecting data on social connections and social isolation, the committee noted: If health care providers know the social integration/isolation, social support, and loneliness of individual patients, they may better understand not only the patient's health but also his or her use of and need for health care services. . . . If the health system is aware that social integration/is olation, social support, and loneliness can be Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION 1-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS major risk and protective factors for health, it can use this information to identify patients and work to assess and intervene at a population or community level. . . . For researchers, the availability of more data on integration/isolation, social support, and loneliness can advance the knowledge of how much these determinants affect health and enable the establishment of better screening and treatment programs for loneliness and interventions within the health system (pp. 97-98). That committee further concluded that the updated and adapted Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (as used for NHANES III) could be adopted into EHRs. They acknowledged that specific tools exist to assess \"social isolation and disconnectedness\" in geriatric populations, but decided that this measure was appropriate for use in all adults (p. 197). In Cognitive Aging (IOM, 2015), the committee described how social isolation and loneliness are associated with declines in global cognition, psychomotor processing speed, and delayed visual memory; Alzheimer's disease; and other physical problems. In particular, the committee noted that \"cognitive declines may lead to lower social engagement, creating a downward spiral of social isolation and loneliness\" (p. 121). Overall, the committee concluded that \"although evidence from some epidemiological and observational studies indicates that increases in social activity and social engagement may be associated with higher levels of cognition, evidence from RCTs is needed before recommendations can be made for specific social interaction interventions\" (p. 123). In A Framework for Educating Health Professionals to Address the Social Determinants of Health (NASEM, 2016a), the committee developed a framework to \"align the education, health, and other sectors, in partnership with communities, to educate health professionals in the social determinants of health\" (p. 4). The committee recommended use of the framework to \"guide and support evaluation research aimed at identifying and illustrating effective approaches for learning about the social determinants of health in and with communities while improving health outcomes, thereby building the evidence base\" (p. 13). In Accounting for Social Risk Factors in Medicare Payment (NASEM, 2017), the committee identified social relationships as one of five domains of social risk factors \"that are associated with health care outcomes independently of quality of care\" (p. 2). In Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care (NASEM, 2019), the committee defined social risk factors as \"social determinants that may be associated with negative health outcomes, such as poor housing or unstable social relationships\" (p. 28). The committee recommended that \"health care organizations should take steps to integrate social care into health care\" and that effective strategies for screening and assessing social risk factors \"should include standardized and validated questions, as available, and should use interoperable data systems to document results\" (p. 10). Furthermore, the committee noted that clinical personnel who should address social needs includes nurses, physicians, community health workers, home health aides, and geriatricians, among others. STUDY APPROACH The Committee on the Health and Medical Dime nsions of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults consisted of 15 members with expertise in bioinformatics, economics, epidemiology, geriatrics, health care, health care administration, medici ne, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, rural health, soci al work, and sociology. (See Appendix B for biographies of the committee members.) Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.1-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS A variety of sources informed the committ ee's work. The committee met in person five times, and during three of those meetings it held public sessions to obtain input from a broad range of relevant stakeholders, including th e sponsor. (See Appendix A for public meeting agendas with topics and speakers listed.) In addition, the committee conducted extensive literature reviews, reached out to a variety of public and private stakeholders, and commissioned one paper. To address their charge, the comm ittee set the following parameters Created a guiding framework that highlighted the role of the health care system Addressed relevant definitions Defined the scope of health care providers and settings Identified the populations at risk and age groups to be studied Considered the quality of the existing evidence base Guiding Framework Pursuant to its charge, the committee focused heavily on the clinical health care setting. This focus also seemed appropriate as clinical care is itself an aspect of, or an intervention related to, social connection. C linical settings offer major oppor tunities for iden tifying problems related to social isolation a nd loneliness and for advancing in terventions to alleviate these problems either within the clinical care setting itself or by mobilizing broader social and policy resources that may be needed for effective intervention. To guide its deliberations, the committee de veloped a conceptual framework to better understand the relationships among several aspect s of social connections and how they are embedded in the overarching public health focus on social determinants of health (see Figure 1- 1). The framework in Figure 1-1 has a pres umed causal flow (indicated by the thicker unidirectional arrows) from risk factors (for social connections and other variables in the framework) through social connectio ns (i.e., social isolation and l oneliness and other aspects of social connection such as social support, consid ered both independently a nd in relation to each other) to mediators (e.g., medical, biological, behavioral, social, and psychological pathways) through which social isolation or loneliness aff ect health outcomes and, potentially, mortality. In this report and more genera lly, variables or boxes that intervene between a presumed causal factor and any subsequent variables or box es that the cause is presumed to affect are termed mediators of that causal effect. Mediators (i.e., mechanisms or pathways) are the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Most notably, variables in the box labeled pathwa ys are hypothesized to mediate th e effect of risk factors or social connections on health impacts, which in turn usually mediate these effects on mortality. Any of the variables in Figure 1-1, as well as other variables not specified there, may also act as moderators of any of the relationships between variables in the framework. Moderators are the factors that can influence the magnit ude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.1-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS on health. For example, the existence, nature , or strength of any empirical relationship hypothesized in Figure 1-1 may vary as a f unction of age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, geographic locati on, or pre-existing health status. Many of the relationships in the model are pot entially bidirectional, as indicated by the thinner arrows. For example, soci al isolation and loneliness do causa lly affect health, but they, in turn, may also be affected by health status. That is, a chronic condition, for example, can be both a risk factor for or a consequen ce of social isolation or lonelin ess. The committee recognizes that separating discussions of health impacts (see Chap ter 3) from risk and protective factors (see Chapter 4) can be challenging and confusing gi ven that the same health condition is often discussed in both chapters, albe it for different reasons. Simila rly, factors that mediate the relationship between social isola tion/loneliness and health can also serve as moderators of those relationships Therefore, the committee emphasizes th at the conceptual framework serves in part to highlight the complexity of all these interrel ationships. Individual elements of this framework will be discussed in more detail throughout the firs t half of this report. Specifically, the different aspects of social connections are discussed later in this chapter, mortality is discussed in Chapter 2, health impacts are discussed in Chapter 3, and risk (and protective) factors are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses the potential role of many variables as mediators or moderators of the relationships among variable s in the Figure 1-1 framework. All of these concepts and pathways offer opportunities for intervention (bot h directly and indirect ly) by the health care system as a way of improving the ultimate health outcomes. Finally, all of these relationships fit within a typical ecological m odel of health wherein factors contributing to social is olation and loneliness at the indi vidual level are also potentially affected by the broader contextual factors at the levels of the community and society. Factors that influence social isolation and loneliness at the community leve l may include factors such as availability of transportation, broadband access, natural disasters, and gentrification, and housing displacement. Factors that influence social isol ation and loneliness at th e society level may, for example, include racism, ageism, changes in family structure (e.g., lower rates of intergenerational living, higher ra tes of divorce and ch ildlessness), trends in use of technology, and broader laws and policies that may a ffect social isolation and loneliness. These influences at the level of the commun ity and society are key to understanding risk for social isolation and lonelin ess and often have a reciprocal relationship with risk and protective factors at the individua l level. For example, a key lif estyle feature of Blue Zones (geographic areas characterized by populations with low levels of chronic disease and long lifespans) is social connection. This may be in pa rt due to how the overall social norms of these communities impact individual-level factors for so cial isolation and lone liness; Blue Zones are often characterized by living in proximity to one 's family, belonging to a faith-based community, and supporting healthy behaviors (e .g. healthy diets and exercise). These ideas are captured in the person-environment fit theory which \"focuses on the interaction between the characteristics of the individual and the environment, whereby the individual not only in fluences his or her environment, but the environment also affect s the individual\" (Hol mbeck et al., 2008, p. 33). This may be particularly importa nt for individuals with disabil ities for whom their social and physical environments influence participation, en gagement, inclusion, and social relationships. Chapter 4 provides some insight for the contextual factors at the levels of the community and society, but an extensive discussi on of all of these br oader concepts and the bio-psycho-social model of health, is beyond the scope of this report.

However, because social isolation and loneliness are seldom included together in the same study as predicto rs of health outcomes , the evidence concerning the impact of each on health largely exists in parallel literature bases. Social isolation and loneliness need to continue to be independently examined as pot ential predictors of the other related aspects of social connection as well as of health outcomes. More importantly, they need to be examined together (1) to discover pot ential pathways by which one may be operating through, or in combination with, the other in de termining health outcome s; and (2) to better estimate the relative strength of their imp acts on health outcomes and mortality. Defining Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Related Aspects of Social Relationships The broad, interdisciplinary scie ntific fields that together form the modern science of social relationships have used a variety of term s (e.g., social isolation, so cial connection, social networks, social integration, so cial support, social exclusi on, social deprivation, social relationships, loneliness) to re fer to empirical phenomena rela ted to social relationships. Although there are important distin ctions among these terms concer ning what they describe or measure, they are often, incorrectly, used interchangeably. Some of the key terms that will be used throughout this report are presented in Box 1-3. BOX 1-3 Key Definitions Loneliness : the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely. Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. Social Isolation and Loneliness Social isolation and loneliness represent distinct phenomena. Social isolation typically refers to the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others, and it is marked by an individual having few social netw ork ties, having infrequent social contact, or, potentially, living alone. Markers of social isolati on objectively and quant itatively establish a dearth of social contact and network size. Loneliness refers to the perception of soci al isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely that \"occu rs when there is a significant mismatch or discrepancy between a person's actual social relations and his or her needed or desire d social relations\" (Perlman and Peplau. 1998, p. 571). While loneliness is subjective, there are measurement tools that can help to quantify the degree of loneliness (see Chapter 6). Although those who l ack social contact may feel lonely (Yildirim and Kocab iyik, 2010), social isolation and loneliness are often not highly Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.1-12 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER Covinsky, 2014). Thus, it is important to distinguish between social isolation and loneliness. Related Aspects of Social Relationships \"Social relationships\" is arguably the mo st common term for the connections and intersections among human beings , and it derives from and is employed in broader common usage. The term \"social networks\" has been used for some time as a similarly broad rubric for the connections among human beings and also other creatures, but it is also used more specifically to refer to the structure and way of analyzing relationshi p data (Scott, 1988). Berkman and Syme (1979) documented the powerful im pact of social relationships on all-cause mortality and hence life expectancy, using th e terms \"social networ ks\" and also \"social integration\" to denote the broad pa ttern of social relationships th at they were examining; these terms are now part of the concept of social isolation. Beginning before the Berkman and Syme study and continuing over the succeeding four d ecades, the study of social relationships and health came to focus on social support. Social support is defined as the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., in formational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network (Cohen and Wills, 1985). While each of these terms used to describe social relationships have been linked to important h ealth outcomes, they ar e not highly correlated, suggesting that each may influence health throu gh different pathways (C ohen et al., 2000). Thus, the literature often refers to organizing themes\u2014t he structure, functions, a nd quality of our social relationships\u2014that categorize th e broader class of terms that have been termed social relationships by sociologists and epidemiologists or soci al connection by psychologists (Berkman et al., 2000; Holt-Lunstad, 2018b; Holt -Lunstad et al., 2017; House et al, 1988). \"Social connection\" is an umbrella term whic h some have proposed using to encompass the different conceptual and measurement approaches represented in the scientific literature. (Holt- Lunstad, 2018a). According to Holt-Lunstad et al. (2017), social connection encompasses the variety of ways one can conn ect to others socially\u2014through physical, behavioral, social- cognitive, and emotional channels. The extent to which an individual is socially connected takes a multifactorial approach, including (1) [ structural aspects ] connections to others via the existence of relationships and their roles; (2) [ functional aspects ] a sense of connection that results from actual or perceived support or inclusion; and (3) [ qualitative aspects ] the sense of connection to others that is based on positive a nd negative qualities. Figure 1-2 shows the three categories of indicators of social connection (i.e., structural, functional, and quality indicators) and provides examples of such indicators.

SOURCE: Holt-Lunstad (2018a). Reproduced with permission from the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 69 \u00a9 2018 by Annual Reviews, http://www.annualreviews.org. When considering risk factors and protective factors for social isol ation and loneliness, having indicators of high social connection is typically considered protective while having indicators of low social connec tion is typically considered detrimental. Social isolation and loneliness are examples of low social connection, with social isolation be ing a structural aspect and loneliness a functional aspect. Some indicator s of social connection are more stable than others, and the acute or chronic nature of thes e indicators will influence the degree of risk or protection. The committee recognizes that the literature on social isolation and loneliness uses all of these terms. To describe the evidence base as ac curately as possible, when the evidence does not differentiate among or combines several re lated terms, this report uses the term social connection to refer to the various structural , functional, and quality aspects of social relationships. This report uses the specific terms \"social isolation,\" \"loneliness,\" or other te rms when the data are specific to these terms. 1 The Health Care System and Its Providers For the purposes of this study, the committee ex amined the potential role of the formal health care system and settings where health care services are provided in reducing the impacts of social isolation and loneline ss in older adults. The committee considered health care settings broadly to include not just hos pital and professional offices, but also other community-based settings where clinical h ealth care services are provided (e.g., homes, long-term care settings). In 1 While social integration can describe high social connectio n, low scores on measures of social integration (e.g., on the Berkman Syme Social Network Index) are frequently us ed an indication of social isolation. Thus, the term \"social isolation\" will also be used to represent these data. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.1-14 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS accordance with discussions with the sponsor in open session at the committee's first meeting, the committee agreed to consider the settings of care broadly, but to focus on the provision of clinical care by qualified clinicians and health care workers (not including family caregivers). Therefore, the committee used the le ns of the health care system its elf on the role of health care professionals (e.g., nurses, physicians, social wo rkers), direct-care workers (e.g., home health aides, nurse aides, personal care aides), and others involved in th e delivery of health care (e.g., community health workers, health care ad ministrators, health information technology professionals). While the committee recognizes the vital importance of family caregivers (the family, friends, and others who provide care, sometimes called informal caregivers) to the delivery of health care as well as their role in mitigating the so cial isolation and loneliness of their family members, the committee and sponsor ag reed that the focus for this study was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how social isol ation and loneliness affect the individual and then explore the role of the formal h ealth care system as described above. The committee also limited its examination largely to literature from the United States. The committee based this approach not only on th e likely differences amon g different countries that can affect social isolati on and loneliness (e.g., societal no rms, cultural expectations, and family structures), but also on the fact that the health care systems in other countries are markedly different from the U.S. health care system, and could make comparisons of clinical approaches quite challenging. However, the comm ittee did review and include notable examples from other countries wherever relevant. Finally, the committee considered general pub lic health principles, including connection to the community and other public health partners , to be considered a part of comprehensive clinical care, especially given that the statemen t of task calls for the committee to consider \"opportunities that can be incorporated into he alth care environments\" (e.g., education, tools, public awareness). While the committee's ultim ate recommendations ar e not all explicitly directed to health care professionals and other health care workers, the committee asserts that their recommendations are the ones that would be most helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of improving the role of individuals involved in clin ical care in particular to help mitigate the negative health impacts of soci al isolation and loneliness. Identifying Populations at Risk Pursuant to its charge, the committee primar ily focused their efforts on addressing the health and medical dimensions of loneliness and social isolation as they pertain to adults aged 50 and older. The committee's work was necessari ly limited by the available research on this population. Also in response to the charge, the committee sought to include relevant research pertaining to low-income, underserved, or vulnerable populations. To address these subpopulations of older adults, the committee incl uded available research on specific populations as defined by race, geographic area (e.g., rural versus urban), immigration status, sexual orientation, and other characteri stics. Although the research on many of these subpopulations is sparse, examinations of studies focusing on these subpopulations are included throughout the report as part of the evidentia ry data for each topic area. A separate section specifically addressing particular subpopulat ions (i.e., gay, lesbian, and bi sexual populations; minorities; immigrants; and victims of elder abuse) is incl uded in Chapters 4 and 5. However, the committee emphasizes that the literature base specific to at risk populations is quite sparse, and much more research is needed to determine the risks, impact s, and appropriate interventions for a variety of at-risk subpopulations.

All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION 1-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Quality of Available Evidence A significant and robust literat ure demonstrates the impact of social isolation and loneliness on health and well-being (see Chapters 2 and 3). However, the literature on effective interventions, particularly for the role of th e health care system, is less robust. The existing studies of interventions vary in their terminology, measures, and measured outcomes. While this variability made comparing the studies and their overall conclu sions quite challenging for the committee, the variability can also be a strength in the sense that it makes it possible to look for convergent validity (i.e., robustness of the empirical relati onships among conceptual variables even in the face of some va riation in measures and study designs; see Lykken, 1968) in establishing the effect of social isolati on and loneliness on health and well-being. The committee prioritized the available l iterature according to known principles of evidence-based health research intended to redu ce the risk of bias affecting study conclusions (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Important factors include how participan ts are allocated to different types of interventions, the comparability of st udy populations, controls for confounding factors, how outcomes are assessed, how representative the st udy group is of the older U.S. population, and the degree to which statistica l analyses help reduce bias. OVERVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT The work of the current committee reinforces, extends, and elaborates on the work of prior National Academies committees. Chapter 2 ex amines the history and context of how social isolation in particular (and lone liness to a lesser extent) came to be recognized as a factor influencing mortality and how soci al support can to be recognized as a protective factor. Chapter 3 summarizes the evidence base for the impacts of social isolation and loneliness on morbidity and quality of life, while Chapter 4 summarizes th e evidence base for the factors that put people at risk for social isolation and loneliness. Chap ter 5 discusses the moderators and mediators of the relationships of social isol ation and loneliness with hea lth. Chapter 6 presents a brief overview of the tools used for measurement and asse ssment in research settings as well as of the use of information technology to identify individuals at risk for social is olation or loneliness. Chapter 7 discusses the role of the health care system specifically in a ddressing social isolation and loneliness. Chapter 8 considers the importa nce of education and training of the general public and the health care workforce, particularly in raising awareness of the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness. Chapter 9 pres ents an overview of interventions for social isolation and loneliness, focusing on approaches that are most appli cable to health care providers and settings. Chapter 10 reflects on the principles of dissemination and implementation in order to explore avenues for translating research into pr actice. The citations for all chapters have been merged into a single reference list that follows Chapter 10. Appendix A provides the agendas of the committee's open sessions, including the topi cs and speakers. Appendix B contains the biographical sketches of the comm ittee members and project staff.

PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-1 2 Evaluating the Evidence for the Impacts of Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Other Aspects of Social Connection on Mortality Strong social relationships are e ssential for a good life. The consequences of neglecting this fact become especially apparent in old ag e. Thus it is urgent that more attention be given to social isolation as a potential killer. Lubben, 2017 Developing the current understa nding of the health impact s of social isolation and loneliness as well as other aspects of social c onnection has been part of a larger development regarding the importance of social determinan ts of health\u2014that is , the recognition that biomedical treatments are actually not, on averag e, the most significant determinants of the health outcomes of individuals. A major endpoint of this historical trend has been the scientific identification of social isolation as a major ri sk factor for human mortality, morbidity, and well- being. Loneliness and other aspects of social connection are also emerging potential risk factors for mortality. This chapter considers the evidence for social isolation, loneliness, and other aspects of social connection as a potentially causal risk f actors for mortality, while Chapter 3 will do the same for morbidity and well-bei ng. (Unless otherwise specified, mo rtality in this chapter is defined as all-cause mortality.) Both chapters co nsider the current evidence for social isolation, loneliness, and other aspects of social connectio n being risk factors for health and well-being. The development of any area of scientific inquiry is rarely a simple, logical linear process. Knowing how we have gotten to where we are in any area of science is essential to understanding how and why we know what we do and what we do not. It can also clarify issues such as concepts and their definitions (see Chap ter 1), their empirical measurement (see Chapter 6), and the nature of the scientific evidence re garding putatively causal relationships. Thus, this chapter begins with an overview of how social factors (e.g., the social determinants of health), including major social disparities and inequali ties, have come to be recognized as major determinants of or risk factors for health a nd especially how and w hy social isolation and loneliness have come to be particularly pivotal at this point in time. This chapter represents the portion of the committee's guiding framework relate d to mortality (see Figure 2-1). Given the complexity of the terminology used in relation to social isolation and loneliness, a reminder of key definitions is provided in Box 2-1.

A HISTORY OF UNDERSTANDING THE CONTRIBUTORS TO HUMAN HEALTH For most of human history human life was, in the famous words of Thomas Hobbes, \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\" (H obbes, 1965, p. 97). The life expectancy of human individuals and populations never exceeded 30-3 5 years of age until the beginning of the eighteenth century, and it was not until the end of th e first half of the twentieth century that life expectancy increased to about 65 years of age, af ter which it increased to almost 80 years by the end of the 20th century. The period since the 18th century saw the de velopment of modern biomedical health science as well as such public health advances as th e decline in infectious disease between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries and the decline in ra tes of smoking in the last half of the 20th century. Thus it seemed logi cal to attribute the dramatic rise of human life expectancy to the application of biomedical scie nce, clinical medicine, and biomedically based public health. Such an attributi on continues to dominate much th inking about hea lth policy even to the present day, though its validity has been in creasingly challenge d, and most health researchers now agree that clinical medicine, public health and social changes all contributed to this increase in life expectan cy (cf. House, 2015, especially Chapter 4; McGinnis et al., 2002; McKeown, 1976, 1979, 1988; Szreter, 1988, 1997, 2000). This growing appreciation for the impact of public health and so cial changes on health has given rise to a new appreciation of non- medical (e.g., environmental, health behavi or, social and commun ity, psychological, and socioeconomic) factors in heal th, most often referred to as social determinants of health . The Role of Public Health The era of the industrial revolution of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries saw the development of a public health approach to en sure \"the conditions in which people can be healthy\" (IOM, 1988, p. 1). Immunizations, impr ovements in drinking water and sanitation, increasing food safety, and the pharmacological trea tment of infectious diseases resulted in reductions or eradication of ma ny acute illnesses (CDC, 2001). Th ese public health approaches led to an \"epidemiological transition\"\u2014a shift from acute to chronic il lnesses as the leading causes of death (Omran, 1971). As a result, \"public health has shifted its primary focus from Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.2-4 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS addressing infectious disease to tackling chro nic disease\" (IOM, 2012, p. 3). Understanding the impacts of the physical, chemical, and biological environments on health led to the recognition of a broader set of determinants of health that is beyond clini cal medicine, though still largely within the biomedical framework. The identification of cigarette smoking and othe r negative health behaviors as major risk factors for mortality and morbid ity was pivotal to the movement toward a conception of the broader social determinants of health. The rec ognition of the danger of tobacco was considered one of the 10 greatest public he alth achievements of the 20th century (CDC, 2001). However, in spite of compelling evidence linking cigarette sm oking to lung cancer and other causes of death, it took almost a quarter century to move from th e strong scientific evid ence to an effective comprehensive public health policy and then a nother quarter century to see major health improvements. The case of cigarette smoking and hea lth gave rise to broader science, policy, and practice regarding the impacts of other health-related behaviors such as excessive consumption of alcohol, overeating, and th e lack of physical activity (Berkman and Breslow, 1983). Increasingly, these behaviors jo ined cigarette smoking as major targets of intervention in both health care and broader public health policy (HHS, 2001, 2010). Social Disparities in Health As the understanding of the importance of social determinants of health grew in the last decades of the 20th century, there was also a rene wed recognition of the disparities in health by socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and various combinations thereof. Most notably, in the late 1970s a nd early 1980s a commission in the United Kingdom found that differences in mortalit y by occupational status had not declined at all and perhaps had even grown in the quarter-century after the Na tional Health Service had presumably equalized access to health services (Black, 1982). Others fo und similar trends of differences in mortality by education and income in the United States (P appas et al., 1993) and Canada (Wilkins et al., 1989). The World Health Organization (WHO) has focu sed attention on the social injustices that underlie inequities and inequalities in longevity and quality of life. A 2008 report of the WHO's Commission on Social Determin ants of Health stated: These inequities in health, avoidable h ealth inequalities, arise because of the circumstances in which people grow, live, wor k, and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. The conditions in which people live and die are, in turn, shaped by political, social, and economi c forces. (CSDH, 2008) The identification of social disparities in th e prevalence of any or all risk factors for health or in their impact became another majo r component of the growing science, policy, and practice regarding the social determinants of health. DISCOVERING SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AS A DETERMINANT OF HEALTH AND LONGEVITY Despite a long history of suggestions that so cial connections were integral to human health and well-being, a systematic investigation of social relationships, es pecially in relation to health, did not emerge until several decades after re search on the social determinants of health had begun following World War II. In the mid 1970s, two physician social epidemiologists, John Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MORTALITY 2-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Cassel and Sidney linked so cial support to health (Cassel, 1976; Cobb, 1976). Cassel and Cobb each reviewed a wide ra nge of evidence from humans and animals showing that social connections we re protective of health, especially in the face of biological and psychosocial risk factors for dis ease, most notably psychosocial stress, and both emphasized the ability of social support to buffer or moderate the adverse effects of such risk factors to health across a wide range of health outcomes. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, multiple researchers had identified vari ous issues concerning the resear ch on social support and health, including (1) what the causal as sociations between social support and health were, (2) \"whether social relationships and supports [only or mainly] buffered the imp act of stress on health or had more direct effects,\" and (3) how consequential the effects of social relati onships on health really were\" (House et al., 1988, p. 541). A number of researchers began to explore existing prospect ive longitudinal cohort studies for evidence of the long-term impacts of so cial connection on mortality which would be analogous to the evidence that had been used to identify other ma jor biomedical and behavioral risk factors for mortality. Researchers focused on measures of the presence, extent, and types of social ties or relationships (e.g., marital status, contacts with friends and relatives, membership in\u2014or at least attendance at serv ices or meetings of\u2014religious congregations or other formal and informal voluntary organizations or groups ). These types of measures at baseline (individually and, especially, collectively) proved to be highly predictive of mortality, even after controlling for a large number of other predictors of mortality. In the seminal study of this type, Berkman and Syme (1979) analyzed four measures collected in the Alameda County Study: (1) marital status, (2) frequency of contacts with other friends and relatives, (3) member ship and frequency of particip ation in voluntary organizations, and (4) frequency of attendance at religious serv ices. They found that all four of these factors predicted mortality over the succeeding 9 years in multivariate analyses that controlled for self- reports of physical health, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and the use of preventive health servi ces. A \"social network index\" combining all four factors produced a relative risk ra tio for all-cause mortality of a bout 2.0 for the socially isolated versus the more socially integrated\u2014that is, socia lly isolated individuals were twice as likely to die in any given year as those who were more socially integrated (Berkman and Syme, 1979). A similar analysis in the Tecumseh Community Health Study which added biomedical baseline measures (e.g., blood pressure, chol esterol, respiratory function, electrocardiogr ams) to a similar set of self-reported controls at baseline obtai ned similar results (Hous e et al., 1982). Further replicating studies came from the United States (Schoenbach et al., 1986) and Europe (Orth- Gomer and Johnson, 1987; Tibblin et al., 1986; Welin et al., 1985), and in 1988 House and colleagues summarized these data and other experimental and quasi-experimental evidence from animals and humans as follows: [S]ocial relationships, or the relative lack thereof, constitute a major risk factor for health\u2014rivaling the effect of well establishe d health risk factor s such as cigarette smoking, blood pressure, blood lipids, obesity, and physical activity. (House et al., 1988, p. 541) The conclusions of House et al. (1988) ha ve remained valid ove r the succeeding three decades, and research on the mortality impacts of lack of social relationships or connections, increasingly called \"social isolat ion,\" have continued. Furthermor e, the number of studies has expanded tremendously.

THE CURRENT STATE OF EVIDENCE ON IMPACTS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION, LONELINESS, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ON MORTALITY As described in Chapter 1, the scientific evidence concerning social isolation and loneliness is based on a variety of different related conceptual and measurement approaches that all characterize related aspects of social relationships. To describe this evidence as accurately as possible, when the evidence does not differen tiate among several related terms or perhaps combines them this report uses the term \"socia l connection\" (or \"connectedness\") as an umbrella term to refer to the structural, functional, and quality aspects of social relationships (Holt-Lunstad, 2018a,b; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2017). So cial isolation and loneliness are common indicators of low social connection, while social support is a common indi cator of high social connection. (See Chapter 1 for additional indicator s of high and low social connection.) This report uses the specific terms \"social isolation,\" \"loneliness,\" and \"social support\" only when the data are specific to these terms. The following sections summarize the evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews that synthesize the overall evidence for the mortality impacts of social isolation, loneliness, and social support across many studies as well as data from important individual studies. Evidence Establishing Social Isolation as a Major Risk Factor for Mortality A comprehensive meta-analysis by Holt-Lunsta d and colleagues (2010) has been widely cited and influential in refocusing attention on the impacts of social connections on mortality. This analysis included 148 prospective studies that measured the structural (e.g., social integration, 1 network size, marital status, living al one), functional (e.g., perceived support, received support, perceived loneliness), or comb ined aspects (e.g., complex social integration) of social relationships and that followed particip ants over time (an average of 7.5 years) to determine the predictive association with mortalit y. This analysis, which examined studies with data from more than 300,000 pa rticipants, found that having a stronger social connection was associated with a 50 percent greater odds of survival. Furthermore, these findings were consistent across age, gender, cause of death, and country of origin. Since this publication, several additional prospective st udies and meta-analysis have re plicated these findings (Holt- Lunstad et al., Luo Anttila, 2016). Figure 2-2 provides their estimate s, as well as more recent estimates, of the odds of decreased mortality of various indicato rs of social connection and other major risk factors for health. The strongest results co me from studies that used comple x measures of social integration (which essentially correspond to the absence of social isol ation). One example of such a measure is the Berkman and Syme Social Network I ndex, which is now included in several ongoing national surveys and recommended for inclusion in electronic medical records by a prior IOM 1 While social integration can describe high social connectio n, low scores on measures of social integration (e.g., the Berkman Syme Social Network Index) are frequently used to measure social isolation. Thus, the term social isolation will also be used to represent these data.

All rights reserved.MORTALITY 2-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS committee (IOM, 2014). Low scores on this measure are often used as an indicator of social isolation. The measure has been and can be va ried modestly across epidemiologic studies and could also be adapted slightly for clinical us e. (See chapters 6 and 7 for more on the use of Berkman-Syme and other measures in clinical settings.)

The effect sizes were estimated from meta analyses: A = Holt-Luns tad et al., 2010; B = Shavelle et al., 2008; C = Critchley and Capewell, 2003; D = Holman et al., 1996; E = Shor et al., 2012; F = Fine et al., 1994; G = Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; H = Katzmarzyk et al., 2003; I = Fleg al et al., 2013; J = Schwartz, 1994. In sum, over four decades of research has produced robust evidence that lacking social connections has been associated with significan tly increased risk for premature mortality\u2014and this is strongest among measures of social isol ation. Furthermore, in spite of a variety of challenges in the definitions and subsequent measur ement of both social is olation and loneliness, there is some evidence that the magnitude of the effect on mortality risk may be comparable to or greater than other well-establish ed risk factors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity (which also have their own challenges in terms of determining causality). Importantly, this effect is independent of age and initial health stat us, which argues against reverse casuality (Holt- Lunstad et al., al., 2018; Shor and Roelfs, 2015).

All rights reserved.2-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Evidence on Loneliness as a Risk Factor fo r Mortality, Considered Independently and in Relation to Social Isolation In addition to the compelling evidence regarding social isolation as a major risk factor for mortality, evidence is emerging on the association between mortality and loneliness. Attention to loneliness grew because of two main factor s: (1) the development of the concept and measurement of loneliness as a cognitive/emotional personalit y state or trait and (2) the development of social neuroscience. Russell an d colleagues (1980) developed the concept and the still-dominant measure of loneliness, the UC LA Loneliness Scale, while a related scale was developed in the Netherlands (de Jong Gierveld and Kamphuis, 1985). (See Chapter 6 for more on the measurement of social isolation and lone liness in research.) Ma ny researchers have explored a causal link between loneliness and health, and, as a result, a growing number of predictive associations of lone liness with mortality have been found (e.g., Drageset et al., 2013; Luo and Waite, 2014; Perissinotto et al., 2012). In a recent meta-analysis focused exclusively on the association between loneline ss and mortality, which included 35 prospective studies with 77,220 participants, the researchers concluded that loneliness signifi cantly increases the risk for all-cause mortality\u2014by 22 percent\u2014 independent of depression (R ico-Uribe et al., 2018). The authors did note that the variability in the in struments used to meas ure loneliness among the studies may be a limitation of interpreting the resu lts. However, the finding was consistent with a previous meta-analysis which f ound that loneliness was associated with a 26 percent increased risk for premature mortality (Hol t-Lunstad et al., 2015). Thus the predictive effect of loneliness on mortality (independent of depression) appears to be replicable , if smaller than that for social isolation. Evidence on Social Isolation a nd Loneliness Considered Together While substantial research has documented the risk of premature mortality posed by both social isolation and loneliness, most studies have examined these factors separately. And because only a handful of studies have examined both lone liness and isolation in the same sample, there is currently limited ability to explore and comp are their effects on mortality as independent or joint factors or to explore the degree to which lone liness is more a mediator of the health impacts of social isolation. Among studies that have examined both social isolation and loneliness in the same sample, most have tested which had the most important unique contribution\u2014in essence, pitting social isolation and loneliness against each other. The strongest study that contained good measures of both social isolat ion and loneliness was done in a large nationally representative sample in the United Kingdom, which found that both social isolati on and loneliness were associated with mortality when considered inde pendently and with limited control variables. The effect of loneliness though was not independent of demographic f actors such as age or health problems and did not increase the ri sk associated with social is olation. Therefor e the subjective experience of loneliness, which may be the psyc hological manifestation of social isolation, appears not to be the primary mechanism explaini ng the association between social isolation and mortality in this study (S teptoe et al., 2013). Similarly, the UK Biobank cohort study, wh ich included 479,054 men and women, found that social isolati on, but not loneliness,2 predicted increased mortality in those with a history of 2 In this study the authors used a two-item scale to measur e loneliness (i.e., \"Do you often feel lonely?\" and \"How often are you able to confide in someone close to you?\"). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MORTALITY 2-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: al., 2018) . Thus, it appears that social isolation has an independent influence on the risk for mortality which remains significant even when adjusting for loneliness, but the same is not true for loneliness. Ong et al. (2016) reached similar conclusions in a review focused specifically on older adults which considered broader indicat ors of health as well as mortality: Although there is growing intere st in studying the prevalence and detrimental effects of loneliness in later life . . . [q]uestions re main about whether the associations between loneliness and health reflect the effects of loneliness, the effects of objective social isolation, or the effects of unmeasured variables. Thus longitudinal and experimental studies addressing the direct, indirect [mediating], and moderating effects of social isolation and loneliness on h ealth are urgently neede d. (Ong et al., 2016, pp. 448-449) A 20-year prospective study with a nationally representative sample of more than 4,800 middle-aged and older adults in Germany suggest s there may be synergistic effects of social isolation and loneliness (Beller and Wagner, 2018a). The evidence i ndicates that the greater the social isolation, the larger the effect of lonelines s on mortality and that th e greater the loneliness, the larger the effect of social isolation (Be ller and Wagner, 2018a,b). To summarize, there is a large literature of studies that examine social isolation and loneliness separately as predictors of prematur e mortality; however, to date only five published studies have examined both social isolation and loneliness within the same sample. These five studies are all large population-ba sed studies, but none were conducte d within the United States. While these studies confirm their respective eff ect on risk for prematur e mortality, they also begin to elucidate more complex finding when c onsidering their joint cont ributions. When social isolation and loneliness are consid ered together, social isolation has remained a robust predictor of mortality, but loneline ss appears more tenuous. Evidence Regarding Social Support and Mortality Social support is one of the three major components of soci al connection, and it has been extensively studied in relation to health. Among the 148 studies included in the meta-analysis by Holt-Lunstad and colleagues (2010) on mortality risk, roughly half included measures of social support, and its role as a major independent risk factor for mortality has substantial support. However, the term \"social support\" has many different specific meanings and measures. For example, support may be instrumental, emotional, or informational; it may also be received, perceived 3 (as helpful or available if needed), or pr ovided to others. When the effect of social relationships on mortality was broken down by measurement approach, perceived support and received support were found to have different effects. Perceived social support significantly predicted 35 percent increased odds of survival, which is stronger than the effect of loneliness (see Figure 2-2). However, the effect of receive d support, which was in the moderate range, was non-significant (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). Uchino (2009a,b) a nd Uchino et al. (2011) have discussed multiple possible reasons why received support may be less predictive than perceived support (or other indicators of social connection). Research on social support as a construct has also been distinct from the literature on social isolation, although the two are intimately intertwined. Thus we do not know the degree to 3 Perceived social support is conceptually similar to loneliness.

As with loneliness, more re search in this area is needed. Evidence of the Impact of Social Isolation a nd Loneliness on Specific Causes of Mortality While all-cause mortality provides the most compelling evidence of the impact of social isolation and potentially loneline ss, these two factors are also n ecessarily associated with the elevation of certain specific major causes of d eath. For example, indivi duals who are socially isolated or lonely and have a hi story of acute myocardial infarcti on or stroke have been shown to be at increased risk of death (Hakulinen et al., 2018). Among n early 15,000 patients with chronic heart disease, living alone was related to a hi gher risk of cardiovasc ular death, while being married (compared to being widowed) was associat ed with a lower risk of cardiovascular death (Hagstr\u00f6m et al., 2018). Among heart failure patient s, those reporting high levels of loneliness had a nearly four times greater risk of death than patients who self-reported low levels of loneliness (Manemann et al., 2018 ). (See Chapter 3 for a discu ssion of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.) A FURTHER NOTE ON SOCIAL ISOLAT ION, AND SOCIAL CONNECTION MORE GENERALLY, AS A POTENTIAL CAUSAL RISK FOR MORTALITY Substantial evidence supports an association between social connection (across varied measurement approaches) and both better health and a reduced risk for mortality; there is also substantial evidence for an associ ation between a lack of social connection (especially social isolation) and poorer health and an increased risk of mortality. However, some may ask whether, in the absence of randomized cont rol trials, this can truly be sa id to be a causal association. Causality is difficult to determine experimenta lly in this case because one cannot randomly assign individuals to be socially isolated. Fu rthermore, as discusse d previously, there is uncertainty related to the differe nt definitions of and measures for various aspects of social connection and so measurement uncertainties can make it difficult to determine causality with certainty. Table 2-1 outlines the Bradford Hill crit eria, a framework for determining causality in epidemiology studies, and applies them to social isolation, including whet her the criteria have been met, and also provides a summary of the evidence that satisfies each criterion. Adapting the Bradford Hill criteria for social connections in general, evidence is found to support a potential causal link between social isolation and mortality.

Experimental evidence in animals shows that isolation increases mortality. Humans randomly assigned to loneliness induction, exclusion, or support conditions show different health-relevant physiological responses. Strength Is the effect size greater than combined effect of confounders? Overall magnitude of effect (risk ration) is about 2.0, which is strong and comparable to or greater than other accepted risk factors. Temporality Does the cause occur before the effect? (temporal precedence) Prospective evidence establishes direction of effect. Poor social connection precedes mortality and poor health. Biological gradient Is there a dose-response effect? Animal and human evidence demonstrates a dose-response effect. Biological plausibility Are there plausible mechanisms of action? Established biological, behavioral, and cognitive pathways (see Chapter 5 for details). Coherence Is the evidence coherent with (does not contradict) other known mechanisms? Coheres with animal and human studies showing that increasing care support for children and neonates improves their health. Replicability Can the effect be repeated across multiple studies? Many studies in 2010 meta-analysis plus several more now have replicated these findings. Similarity Do similar studies show consistent results? Across the varied measurement approaches of social isolation and other aspects of social connection, there is converging evidence. SOURCE: Adapted from Howick et al., 2019.

There is some evidence that the magnitude of the effect of social isolation on mortality risk may be comparable to or grea ter than other well-established risk factors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity. While there is evidence of a significant a ssociation between lone liness and mortality, existing evidence does not yet approach the cumulative weight of evidence for of the association between social isolation and mo rtality. Further research is needed to establish the strength and r obustness of the predictive association of loneliness with mortality in relation to soci al isolation and to clarif y how social isolation and loneliness relate to and operate with each other (as well as other aspects of social connection, such as social support). NEXT STEPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In today's society social is olation and loneliness are as prevalent as many other well- established risk factors for heal th, yet limited resources and attention have been paid to better understanding social isolation and loneliness and their indivi dual and collective impacts on health. To enhance the role of the health care se ctor in addressing the imp acts of social isolation and loneliness among older adults, the committee identifies the following goal: GOAL: Develop a more robust evidence base for effective assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies for social isolation and loneliness. Achieving this goal will require increasing f unding for basic research on social isolation and loneliness. The body of evidence for the asso ciation of social conn ection (particularly of social isolation) with all-cause mortality is st rong, and the magnitude of this association may rival that of other risk factor s that are widely recognized and acted upon by the public health and health care systems (e.g., smoking, obesity, physical inactivity). However, given this evidence, current funding for social isolation and loneliness is not adequate. The committee concludes that in particular, further research is needed to establish the strength and robustn ess of the predictive association of loneliness with mortality in relatio n to social isolation and to clarify how social isolation and loneliness relate to and operate with each other in order to inform effective clinical interventions. Therefore, the committee recommends: RECOMMENDATION 2-1: Major funders of health research, including the government (e.g., the National Institutes of Health, the Cent er for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Cen tered Outcomes Research Institute), foundations, and large health plans should fund research on social isolation and loneliness at levels that reflect th eir associations with mortality.

Cacciopo and Patrick, 2008 As described in Chapter 2, studies of all-cause mortality provide compelling evidence of the health impacts of social is olation, and several aspects of social connection have been associated with specific causes of death (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer). But the health effects of social isolation and loneliness exte nd beyond mortality. Social isolation, loneliness, and other aspects of social conne ction can also significantly affect the risk of developing certain health conditions as well as the course of thes e health conditions and various measures of the quality of life. While most of the studies in this area evaluate social is olation and loneliness as risk factors and the health condi tions as outcomes, the relationship between social isolation or loneliness and health is often bidi rectional. (See Chapter 4 for more on health conditions as risk factors for social isolation a nd loneliness.) This chapter focuses on the evidence base for the impact of social isolation and loneliness on a wide range of physical, cognitive, and mental health conditions as well as on self-reported health and quality of life among adults aged 50 and older. The material presented in this chapte r provides a summary of the relevant published literature. It is not intended to be serve as a comprehensive review of every study published on these topics. This chapter repres ents the portion of the committee's guiding framework related to health impacts (see Figure 3-1).

Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES In addition to the robust evid ence linking social isolation a nd loneliness with mortality, (see Chapter 2), other research has established that social isolation and l oneliness are linked with specific health conditions. As described in previous chapters, the scientific literature concerning social isolation and loneliness draws on a variet y of conceptual and measurement approaches that collectively characterize related aspects of so cial relationships. In the following sections, the committee presents evidence of the effects of diff erent aspects of social connection on health, using the terminology and definitions as describe d by the individual authors of the cited studies. Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke Cardiovascular disorders and morbidities have been studied extensively as outcomes of social isolation and loneliness. A meta-analysi s of 23 studies using 16 longitudinal datasets found that poor social relations hips (e.g., social isolation, lone liness) increased the risk of developing coronary heart diseas e and stroke, independent of tr aditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (Valtorta et al., 2016a). Despite variability in the meas urement of social isolation and loneliness across studies, poor social relationships were found to be associated with a 29 percent increase in risk of incident cor onary heart disease and a 32 percent increase in the risk of stroke, and this was consistent across genders (Valto rta et al., 2016a). Othe r studies support these findings. For example, studies of patients after myocardial infarction have consistently found low social support to be a marker of poor prognosis and to be associated with increased mortality, readmission, and re-infarction rates (B arth et al., 2010; Gl ozier et al., 2013) . An earlier review found both low social integration and loneliness to be associated with an increased risk for hypertension (Cuffee et al., 2014). A longitudinal study of nearly 5,400 adu lts over the age of 50 found loneliness to be associated with an increas ed risk for cardiovascular disease (defined by coronary heart disease and stroke), but not social isolation (Valtorta et al ., 2018a). Data from the United Kingdom biobank found that is olated and lonely persons were at increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke (Hakulinen et al., 2018). One st udy of heart failure patients who self-reported high \"perceived soci al isolation\" (i.e., loneliness) found a 68 pe rcent increased risk Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Consistent with this evidence fo r social isolation or loneliness as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a review of currently available and wide ly used cardiovascular risk assessment models concluded that traditional scr eening for cardiovascular risk may be improved by taking social relationships into ac count (Ruwanpathirana et al., 2015). Dementia and Cognition Numerous observational studies have examin ed the associations of high levels of loneliness, a low frequency of contact with family and friends, and low levels of participation in community groups with the risk of dementia a nd cognitive decline in older adults. A 2015 meta- analysis found an increased risk of dementia to be associated with high levels of loneliness, infrequent social contacts, a nd low-level group participation (K uiper et al., 2015). Furthermore, this meta-analysis indicated that these social factors increased the risk of dementia by approximately 50 percent, which was comparable to such dementia risk factors as physical inactivity, low education, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and late-life depression (Diniz et al., 2013; rton al., and Eslick, 2013). Similarly, another meta-analysis which includ ed more than 2.3 million participants found that living alone, having a limited social network, having a low fre quency of social contact, and having poor social support were all risk factors for dementia (Penninkilampi et al., 2018). The risk ratios for a weak social network and few so cial contacts were even stronger after adjusting for the presence of depression, in dicating that low social conn ection has discrete effects on dementia risk that are distinct from the eff ects of depression (Penninki lampi et al., 2018). An elevated risk of dementia was also associat ed with low social support. Findings for an association between loneliness and risk of demen tia in studies were mixed and, being based on a small number of studies, were non-significant overal l. Furthermore, a reduced risk of dementia was reported to be associated w ith high levels of social contact s and social activity, indicating possible protective effects of hi gh social engagement (in additi on to the increased risk of dementia at low levels of social e ngagement) (Penninkilampi et al., 2018). Social isolation and loneliness have also been examined in multiple cohorts for their association with cognitive decl ine (Bassuk et al., 1999; Crooks et al., 2008; Ertel et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2017). The evidence indi cates that less frequent social contacts and lower levels of participation in community groups are associated with declines in global cognition, processing speed, executive function, and vi suospatial abilities (Braak and Del Tredici, 2012). These associations were found to be independent of many factors, including age, sex, educational attainment, wealth, levels of depression, and phys ical activity (Saczynski et al., 2006; Shankar et al., 2013). Greater loneliness in older adults has also been associated with worsening performance on measures of global cognition and on specific tests of immediate and delayed recall (Holwerda et al., 2014; Shankar et al., 2013 ; Tilvis at al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2007). Notably, social isolation a nd loneliness have been found to have independent and cumulative effects on cognitive decline and dementia risk in some but not all studies, suggesting that the structural and functi onal aspects of social connectio n may influence cognitive health through both shared and distinct mechanisms (D onovan et al., 2017; Ho lwerda et al., 2014; Shankar et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2007). Social interactions are thought to enhance cognitive Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.HEALTH IMPACTS ON MORBIDITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE 3-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS capacity by activating and ma intaining the efficiency of brain networks (Stern, 2012). This effect may point to the existence of a form of neural reserve that supports c ognitive function as age- related and pathological brain ch anges accrue over time (Bennett et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2015). In older adults greater emotional support has been associated with both higher serum levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor and a reduced risk of demen tia, suggesting that enriching relationships may also promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Salinas et al., 2017). In addition, higher loneliness in mid-late life has been associated with elevat ed cardiovascular and neuroendocrine markers of stress, impaired sleep , and pro-inflammatory physiological effects, which may accelerate neurodegeneration in th e hippocampus and in other brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease and vascul ar cognitive impairment (Cacioppo et al., Hackett et and Lawlor, 2013). In cognitively normal older adults, greater loneliness has been associated with higher levels of brain amyloi d and regional accumulation of tau protein, linking loneliness with the pathological changes of early Alzheimer's disease (d'Oleire Uquillas et al., 2018; Donovan et al., 2016). Furthermore, less so cial engagement with friends, family and community groups has been associated with a more rapid cognitive decline in these unimpaired older adults with high brain am yloid, indicating an adverse inte ractive effect of low social connection and early Alzheimer's pathology on cognitive health (Biddle et al., 2019). A small number of observational studies have investigated the possibility of reverse causation (i.e., the possibility that low cognitive function may precede declines in social function). These studies have found inconsiste nt and, most often, opposing evidence that low cognitive function leads to subs equent social disengagement or loneliness in population-based cohorts; however, other research has demonstrat ed that older adults with declining cognitive performance experience disruptions in their larger and more divers ified social networks (Aartsen et al., 2004; Ayalon et al., 2016; Donovan et al., 2017; Ellwardt et al., 2015; James et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2007). These and other complementar y findings raise the possi bility that social function and cognitive abilities are reciprocally related and, in cer tain aging adults, may decline in tandem (Biddle et al., 2019). Depression and Anxiety In cross-sectional studies, soci al isolation and loneliness have been associated with both depression and anxiety throughout adulthood, including in older adul ts. In one of the largest studies to date, which included more than 15,000 German adults aged 35 74 years, greater loneliness was related to higher rates of clinic ally significant depressi on, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, independent of age, sex, partnership, an d socioeconomic status (Beutel et al., 2017). A systematic review of this topic included eight cross-sectional studies of adults age 60 and older and found loneliness to have been associated w ith depression in seven studies and low social engagement to have been associated with depr ession in one study (Choi et al., 2015). In a cross- sectional study of 314 older U.S. adults living in retirement communitie s, loneliness was found to be associated with both depression and a nxiety, but not with pe rceived health, medical conditions, or functional status (Bekhet and Za uszniewski, 2012). While loneliness is commonly associated with clinically si gnificant depression, lone liness and depression are recognized as distinct constructs that can also be experien ced independently of each other. A study of over 8,000 older adult participants from the U.S. H ealth and Retirement Study found that nearly 18 percent of the sample reported frequent feelings of loneliness. Within this lonely group, 53 percent reported levels of depr essive symptoms above the thres hold for clinically significant Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

A systematic review by Schwarzbach and colleagues (2014) of 25 cross-sectional and 12 longitudinal studies (but not in cluding studies of loneliness) evaluated the relationship between depression and a range of social suppo rt and social network measures for older adults. Qualitative aspects of social relations, such as social support, the quality of relations, and a confidant relationship, were most consistently associated with the presence or absence of depressi on in the cross-secti onal studies. However, in the longitudinal studies a lower quantity of social interactions was most often associated with depression over time. Schwarzbach and colleagues (2014) interpre ted this to mean that having fewer social interactions or connections may predispose adults to later having inadequate social support when it is needed during stressful events, thereby elevating the risk of incident depression. Correspondingly, close relationships and social support may be experienced as more acutely inadequate in those who are depressed because of the distress and disabilities imposed by these symptoms. A cross-sectional study of more than 1,400 older U.S. adults also found that the qualitative aspects of social re lationships were more strongly related to depression than the quantitative aspects when the depression and soci al relationships were measured at the same time-point, which was consistent with the patter n observed earlier (Taylor et al., 2018a). Also consistent were findings from a longitudinal st udy of more than 11,000 older U.S. adults, which quantified the number and types of social contacts as a potential predic tor of future depression. A lower frequency of in-person social contacts wa s related to higher rates of depression over 2 years. Notably, the frequencies of telephone, writte n, or email contacts were not associated with depression at 2 years, indicating that in-person modes of contact were un iquely protective (Teo et al., 2015). A growing number of international studies have employed validated instruments for measuring loneliness and have found positive associa tions of loneliness with higher depression and anxiety over time. These include analyses from the Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing, which found both loneliness and low social networ k to be associated with rates of clinically significant depression and anxiety over 2 years; from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, which found that loneliness at baseli ne predicted a poorer course of de pression in person s with late-life depression; and from the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study, which found greater loneliness, but not social support or social network, to be associat ed with higher depression scores over 5 years (Cacioppo et al., 2010; Dom\u00e9nech-Abella et al., 2019; Jeuring et al., 2018). One German study that sought to compare different measurement approaches found that subjective loneliness and network quality best predicted mental health, wher eas network size and living alone best predicted physical and cognitive health (Beller and Wagner, 2018b). Collectively, these studies establish that social support, social isola tion, and loneliness are strongly linked to depression and anxiety. While th ese associations do not establish causality, the temporal associations suggest that social is olation and loneliness likely cause or worsen depression and anxiety, with in-p erson contacts and the perceive d adequacy of relationships having the largest impacts. The re lationships of social isolati on and loneliness with depression and anxiety have also been shown to have re ciprocal effects over time.

In a Danish sample, self-reported loneliness was associated with a more than 2.5 times highe r risk for poor self-rated health, 91 percent higher risk of limited physical abilities, and a 77 percent higher risk of multiple diagnoses (Jessen et al., 2017). In the United States th e relationship between loneliness and functional decline or death was assessed in 1,604 subjects, 60 years of age and older, who participated in a longitudinal cohort study between 2002 and 2008; the assessments were conducted every 2 years (Perissinotto et al., 2012). Partic ipants who self-identified as l onely (as measured by the three- item UCLA loneliness scale) were more likely to have experienced reductions in the activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, eating), in mobility, and in stair-climbi ng ability, and they had more difficulty with upper extremity tasks (e.g., pushi ng or pulling large obj ects, lifting weights heavier than 10 pounds), ultimately resulting in a 59 percent increased risk of function loss. A longitudinal community-based cohort study of 985 older adults who reported loneliness and being alone examined the loss of motor function (Buchman et al ., 2010). Assessed loneliness at baseline was found to correspond with the rate of motor function decline, with a higher assessed loneliness at baseline resulting in more rapid ra tes of motor function decl ine. (See Chapter 4 for information regarding risk factors associ ated with frailty in older adults.) Several aspects of the structur al and functional characteristic s of social connection have been associated with newly and previously di agnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One study found that individuals with a smaller social network size were more likely to have newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed T2DM; no such relationship was found for pre-diabetes (Brinkhues et al., 2017). On the ot her hand, pre-diabetes was found to be associated with a lack of social participation, and living alone was associated with a greater likelihood of previously diagnosed T2DM in men, but not in women (Brinkhues et al., 2017). Loneliness may also have a reciprocal rela tionship with diabetic outcomes. Diabetes- related complications can limit phys ical mobility, which may in turn limit an individual's ability to initiate social interactions or may strain relationships, thus lead ing to greater loneliness (Jaremka et al., 2013b; Ribu and Wahl, 2004). In a population-base d study of adults without diabetes, low satisfaction with one 's social network (perhaps an indirect indication of social isolation and loneliness) was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing T2DM, and the risk for incident T2DM was still signifi cant after controlling fo r social isolation and living alone (Lukaschek et al., 2017). Social connections even appear to influence susceptibility to colds. In viral challenge studies, where all participants are infected with a cold virus, loneliness was associated with greater self-reported cold symp toms (LeRoy et al., 2017). Sociabi lity (assessed using measures of extraversion, agreeableness, and positive relationshi p style) has been linearly associated with a decreased probability of developing a cold, inde pendent of baseline, de mographics, emotional styles, stress hormones, and heal th practices (Cohen et al., 2003) . Having more diverse social networks has been associated with having a grea ter resistance to upper respiratory illness (Cohen et al., 1997). Furthermore, having a greater numbe r of social roles has been associated with better pulmonary function in older adults (Crittenden et al., 2014).

All rights reserved.3-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS IMPACT ON HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS Different aspects of social connection may affect health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, substance use, exerci se, diet, sleep patterns), both positively and negatively. Health-related behaviors have been studied fo r decades, and early theories held that being married or being a parent helped inhibit risk -taking behaviors such as drinking, smoking, or illicit substance use because these roles afford ed a sense of importance or purpose or because having a partner helped to favorably regulat e these health behaviors (Gove, 1973; Syme, 1974; Umberson, 1987). Social connections and supports have been a ssociated with levels of use (as well as the cessation and relapse) of tobacco and al cohol (Christakis and Fo et al., 2010; Seeman and Anderson, 1983). That is, an individual's levels of alcohol and tobacco use may be a ffected by the degree of use of their social contacts or, in the case of cessation, by the stre ngth of their social supports. However, these effects can be positive or negative. For exam ple, studies have shown that smoking cessation among one's social contacts improves the lik elihood that an indivi dual will stop smoking, while living with a smoker or having smokers among one's soci al networks decreases the likelihood of smoking cessation (Holahan et al ., 2012; Lacey et al., 1993; Moore et al., 2014). Evidence specifically related to the connec tion between social isolation and health- related behaviors has sh own that older people who are isolated are more likely to have less healthy behaviors such as poor di ets, tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, and a lack of physical activity (Choi and DiNitto, 2015; Ho et al., 2018; Kharicha et al., Steptoe, 2018; Locher et al ., 2005; Schrempft et al., 2019). While some research has found no relations hip specifically betw een loneliness and certain health-related behaviors (Canham et al., 2016; Hawkley et al ., 2009; Kobayashi and Steptoe, 2018; Schrempft et al., 2019), other st udies of adults and ol der adults have found associations of loneliness with low physical activity, being overweight, higher levels of smoking, and greater alcohol consumption (Ake rlind and Hornquist, 199 2; Barretta et al., al., 2006a; Shankar et al., 2011; Stickley et al., 2013). Also, limited evidence links loneliness with risky sexual behaviors and psychotropic drug use among older adults (Boehlen et al., 2015; Go lub et al., 2010). (See Chapter 5 for more on health-related behaviors as a mediator of the relationship between social connection and health.) Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts Suicide is a concern for families and co mmunities, and both social isolation and loneliness have been identified as risk factors for suicide for indivi duals of all ages (Calati et al., 2019; Kochanek et al., 2019). Between 1999 and 2017 suicide rates increased among adults aged 45-74 (from 6.0 to 9.7 per 100,000 adults aged 45-64 and from 4.1 to 6.2 per 100,000 adults aged 65-74), and white males over the age of 85 have been identified as being most at risk for suicide (Hedegaard et al., 2018; Steele et al., 2018). Depression has been found to be the most relevant cause of suicide attempts, but both lo neliness and social isol ation have also been identified as major contributing fa ctors (Minayo and Cavalcante, 2015).

All rights reserved.HEALTH IMPACTS ON MORBIDITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE 3-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS A number of studies have evaluated the relatio nship of social isola tion with suicide in older adults. In a review of nine studies published between 2010 and 2017 that focused on suicide attempts or suicide id eation in adults 60 years of ag e and older, the authors found a relationship between both loneli ness and social isolation and suicidal thoughts or ideation (Heuser and Howe, 2019). Similar findings were seen in a systematic review of studies examining suicide risk in nursing homes and ot her long-term-care faci lities conducted between 1985 and 2013 (Mezuk et al., 2014). Re searchers found that both lone liness and social isolation were correlated with su icidal ideation among reside nts in these settings. The majority of studies examine either soci al isolation or lone liness when evaluating suicide risk. Several recent inte rview studies found a relationshi p between suicid al ideation or self-harm in older adults and f eelings of loneliness or \"aching loneliness\" (Huang et al., 2017; Wand et al., 2018; van Wijngaarden et al., 2015). Self-harm in olde r adults was evaluated in a recent systematic review which included 40 articles published through February 2018. This study, which included a total of 62,755 older adul ts, found that increased loneliness was among the primary motivations reported for self-harm (Troya et al., 2019). Wi ktorsson and colleagues (2010) interviewed 103 suicide attempters aged 70 or older treated at five emergency departments in Western Sweden and compared th em with matched community controls. A strong relationship was found between perceived loneli ness and attempted suicide, independent of depression. The association between social relationships and suicid al ideation were evaluated in a meta-analysis by Chang et al. (2017) whic h included findings from 31 studies published between 2000 and November 2016. In that analysis, elderly adults were found to be 57 percent more likely to experience suicide ideation if they had discordant so cial relationships, and perceived loneliness along with elderly mistreatment and poorly perceived social support were found to be the measures associated with the gr eatest effect (Chang et al., 2017). Furthermore, death wishes, which may lead to suicidal ideatio n or future suicide attempts, were found to be significantly associated with l oneliness, depression, and poor self -reported health in a study of more than 35,000 people over 65 years of age (Cheung et al., 2017). Bernier et al. (2020) evaluated Seniors Health Surv ey results from 2,787 French-s peaking community dwellers between the ages of 65 and 69 and found that the 5 percent of respondents who wished for death were significantly more isolated than other respondents. Taken together, these results i ndicate that social isolation and loneliness are related to both suicidal ideation and suicid e attempts. None of these studies were designed to determine whether social isolation or lone liness cause suicidality, but they are clearly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, even apart from depression. IMPACT ON QUALITY-OF-LIFE OUTCOMES A growing body of research indicates that soci al isolation and loneli ness negatively affect quality of life among older adults, although the empirical literature on these relationships remains relatively limited. The variability in the m easures of social isolation and loneliness used in these studies, coupled with th e small number of the studies, allows for only a limited scientific understanding of how both phe nomena relate to an older adult's quality of life. The definitions of quality of lif e vary across the available res earch on social isolation and loneliness among older adults. Many of these studi es define quality of life as a health-related construct\u2014either as health-related quality of life (HRQL), which offers a broad, multi-dimensional picture of a person's health and well -being from the individual's perspective, or as Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.3-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS health status, which captures a person's physical and mental health in narrower terms and represents only one aspect of health-related quality of life (Golden et al., 2009). Other studies employ a more expansive definition of quality of life, including factors such as perceived financial adequacy, satisfaction with life, a nd \"global happiness,\" among others (Chappell and Badger, 1989). Holm\u00e9n et al. (1999) commented that while the common definitions of quality of life at the time focused on health and illness, emerging definitions were generally more expansive in that they allowed for subjective dimensions such as ove rall life satisfaction. Current evidence indicates that social isolat ion negatively affects th e quality of life of older adults. Hawton et al. (2011) found that so cial isolation\u2014defined by a person's level of contact with others\u2014has a signifi cant, independent, and negative effect on HRQL among older adults, even when accounting for factors such as depression, physical comorbidity, age, gender, living alone, employment stat us, and accommodation type. In the Hawton et al. (2011) study, older adults who were severely socially isolated were found to have particularly low HRQL scores when compared to peers of similar age in the general population. Other work done in the context of older people's social networks has found social isolation to be associated with decreased satisfaction with one 's life, hopelessness, increase d risk of depressed mood, and decreased happiness (Golden et al., 2009). Additionally, research has illustrated how certain dimensions of social isolation might have a greate r effect than others on an older person's quality of life. Chappell and Badger (1989) interviewe d 743 older adults aged 60 years or older to examine 10 indicators of social isolation\u2014wheth er an older person lives alone, is married, has children, or interacts with c onfidants or companions, and so on\u2014and they observed that companionship and confidants were more rela ted to an older person's well-being than the individual's marital stat us, living arrangements, or presence of children. While few studies have documented the impact of loneliness on quality of life among older adults, the research that has been done indicates that both severe and moderate loneliness significantly reduce the physical and mental quality of life am ong older adults. Being lonely might also lead to reduced satisfaction with one 's life and lower levels of happiness, and one study concluded that older adults who were not lonely showed fewer depressive symptoms (Ekwall et al., 2005; Lim and Kua, 2011; Musich et al., 2015). The combination of loneliness and social isolation might also have an advers e effect on the quality of life among older adults. Golden et al. (2009) discovered that the pr evalence of hopelessness\u2014an indicator for a diminished quality of life\u2014was higher among older adults who did not have an integrated social network. Elders at Risk for Abuse Elder abuse, which can affect an older adult's physi cal health, mental health, and quality of life, is burgeoning globally, and isolated or lonely individu als can be more vulnerable to mistreatment. According to the World Health Orga nization, approximately one in six adults aged 60 years or older have experienced at least one form of abuse\u2014financial exploitation, physical abuse, psychological (or verbal) abuse, sexual abuse, or outright neglect\u2014during the past year (WHO, 2018). In the United States it has proved difficult to determin e the precise extent of elder abuse. Efforts to evaluate the sc ope of abuse have been hampered by the lack of standardization in how cases of abuse are defined, prosecuted, and reported from one jurisdiction to the next as well as by the large numbe r of abuse cases that go unreporte d (Acierno et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015). However, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of olde r adults in the United States fall victim to some form of abuse (Lachs and Pillemer, 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Based on projections of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.HEALTH IMPACTS ON MORBIDITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE 3-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS aging, the number of older victims of abuse could grow from an estimated 2.5 million to 4.9 million in 2016 to as many as 9.8 million by 2060 (ACL, 2018; Ortman et al., 2014). Physical or social isolation can increase a person's susceptibility to abuse. Socially isolated individuals are both more vulnerable to abuse (Acierno et al., 2010) and more likely to become abusers (Amstadter et al., 2011). In ad dition to any psychological anguish it may cause, elder abuse can lead to housing displacement or disruption, worse physical health, or, in extreme cases, even death (Wong and Waite, 2017). Perpetrato rs of elder abuse are most often family members\u2014spouses or adult childre n\u2014or unrelated caregivers and ar e often male and financially dependent upon the abused adult; substance abuse problem or having a history of mental health issues are common in abusers (Fulmer et al 2012; Wong and Waite, 2017). Many cases of abuse go unreported by both the abused individuals and the perpetrators of abuse because of other factors, such as the possibility of losing housing or a caregiver, or emotional or financial reasons that could be at stake (Wong and Waite, 2017). FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Substantial evidence shows that social isola tion and loneliness are strongly associated with a greater incidence of major psychol ogical, cognitive, and physical morbidities and lower perceived well-being or quality of life. Strong evidence indicates that social isolation and loneline ss have effects on the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mo rbidities. A smaller amount of evidence indicates that social connection has effect s on the course of other chronic health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, or on health characteristics, such as mobility and functioning in the activities of daily living. Substantial evidence links social isolati on and loneliness with accelerated cognitive decline in older adults and an incr eased risk of incident dementia. Social connection is strongly linked to depres sion and anxiety. Temporal associations suggest that social isolati on and loneliness likely cause or worsen depression and anxiety. Complementary research suggests th at depression and a nxiety increase the likelihood of low social connection, whic h is further addressed in Chapter 4. While some research shows no relationshi p specifically betw een loneliness and certain health-related behaviors, other stud ies have found associations of loneliness with lower physical activit y, being overweight, higher le vels of smoking, and greater alcohol consumption. Emerging evidence suggests that social isol ation and loneliness negatively affect the quality of life of older adults. However, the existing empirical literature on this relationship is relatively small, and interp retations are limited by variability in the measures and definitions of social isolation and loneliness used. Reports of elder abuse, including financia l exploitation, physical abuse, psychological (or verbal) abuse, sexual abuse, or outrig ht neglect, are disturbingly common. In the United States there is a lack of infrastr ucture for reliably measuring this problem.

Existing evidence suggests that certain aspects of social connection may be especially pr edictive of certain health outc omes and that the relationship between social connection and h ealth is often bidirectional. As discussed in Chapter 2, the committee identified the increased funding of basic research as a key to achieving the goal of developing a more r obust evidence base on effective prevention, assessment, and intervention for soci al isolation and loneli ness. Specifically, the committee concludes that identifyi ng, prioritizing, and developing ways to translate scientific knowledge of the impacts of social isolation and l oneliness on health into effective and efficient clinical and public health inte rventions (see Chapter 9) first requires a better understanding of how social isolation and loneline ss impact health, including the risk factors for social isolation and loneliness (see Chapter 4), the mediators (o r mechanisms) by which social isolation and loneliness affect health (see Chapter 5), and the moderators that affect the magnitude of those relationships (see Chapter 5). Furthermore, more needs to be determined about whether and when (e.g., at what stage of the life course, or when the situation is acute or chronic) an intervention will have downstream effects on health outcomes. Therefore, drawing from information in all of these chapters, the committee makes the following recommendation as a strategy to mitigate or eliminate the negative hea lth impacts of social isolation and loneliness: RECOMMENDATION 3-1: Major funders of health research, including the government (e.g., the National Institutes of Health, the Cent er for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Cen tered Outcomes Research Institute), foundations, and large health plans should fund research to improve the scientific understanding of the links between social connection and health, including the study of risk factors and mechanisms.

However, people who are 50 years of age and ol der are more likely to experience many of the risk factors that can cause or exacerbate social is olation or loneliness, such as the death of loved ones, worsening health and chronic illness, new sensory impairment, retirement, or changes in income. The relationships between risk factors and social isolation or loneliness can be bi- directional in that being socially isolated or lonely can aff ect health, while these same health conditions can make experiencing so cial isolation or l oneliness more likely. This chapter focuses on the risk factors for social is olation and loneliness while also providing some context regarding the health impacts of these two factors, reflec ting the frequent bi-dir ectionality of these relationships. (See Chapters 2 and 3 for a fuller discussion of the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness on health.) When considering the risk fa ctors for social isolation and loneliness, it should be noted th at some factors may increase the risk of negative health effects while other factors may lower those risks. Mech anisms and moderators will be discussed in Chapter 5 This chapter reviews the risk and protective factors for social isol ation and loneliness, including predisposing physical health factors (e.g., chronic diseases, functional impairments); psychological, psychiatric, and cognitive factor s (e.g., depression, anxiety, dementia); socio- cultural factors (e.g., social supports, disruptive life events); and social environmental factors (e.g., transportation, housing). The ch apter then summarizes the ri sks of social isolation and loneliness among specific subpopulations. As describe d in earlier chapters, research outcomes pertaining to social conn ection have included a variety of rela ted terms; the specific terms used in individual studies are noted th roughout the chapter for greater clarity. It should be kept in mind that the material presented in this chapte r provides a summary of the relevant published literature rather than a compre hensive review of these topics . Gaining a broad understanding of risk factors for social isolation and loneliness and also elucidati ng which factors are most closely linked to them can lead to new initiatives to im prove health outcomes at primary, secondary, and tertiary stages of prevention. This chapter represents the por tion of the committee's guiding framework related to risk factors (see Figure 4- 1). Given the complexity of the terminology used in relation to social isolation and loneliness, a re minder of key definitions is provided in Box 4-1.

Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. PHYSICAL HEALTH FACTORS Various physical health factors are related to social isolat ion and loneliness, including many common chronic diseases, impairments, an d geriatric syndromes. As mentioned earlier, these relationships are often bi-dir ectional. That is, social isolation or loneliness may increase the chances of developing a chroni c health condition (see Chapter 3), while, conversely, a chronic health condition may contribute to social isolation or loneliness by interfering with the quality, quantity, or structure of rela tionships or by worsening pat hophysiological processes. The relationships between combinations of conditions and social isolation or loneliness are less well studied, but having multiple chronic conditions has been associated with a lower participation in social activities (Cantarero-Priet o et al., 2018). Similarly, among olde r adults discharged after an acute coronary syndrome, a greater number of co-existing chronic conditions has been associated with having a limited social network (Tisminetzsky et al., 2016). This section focuses on the role of physical health as a risk factor for e xperiencing social isolation or loneliness. Chronic Disease and Conditions Roughly 60 percent of all adults and about 80 percent of adults aged 65 and older have at least one chronic disease (e.g., heart disease, diab etes, cancer, stroke), a nd 77 percent have at least two chronic diseases (CDC, 2019; NCOA, 2019). Research indicates that some chronic diseases and conditions can be risk factors for social isolation and lone liness. There is robust evidence, for example, that cardiovascular dise ase and stroke can increase the risk of social isolation and loneliness and also of low soci al support; conversely, ther e is also research indicating that people who have cerebrovascular or cardiovasc ular disease may have worse outcomes if they are socially isol ated or lonely (Air et al., 2016) . The deficits that occur as a result of having a stroke can increase the risk of social isolation, whic h in turn can affect recovery from the stroke (Alun and Mur phy, 2019; Glass and Maddox, 1992; Hinojosa et al., 2011). For example, lasting symptoms of stroke may include visual field deficits and dysphagia, which can impair an individual's ability to intera ct with others (Cichero and Altman, 2012; Rim et al., 2020).

All rights reserved.4-4 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Other common chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Castelino et al., 2018) and advanced heart fail ure (Leeming et al., 2014) as well as many less common and less frequently studied conditions may also increase the risk for social isolation or loneliness. The English Longitudinal Study of Ag eing has revealed, for in stance, that chronic pain (largely due to musculoskeletal disease) sometimes results in a reduction in physical and social activity, which may lead to social isolation or reduced social participation (Blyth and Noguchi, 2017). A small study of people with wounds infected with meth icillin-resistant staph aureus found that fears of infecting someone else or of being re jected made social isolation more likely (Andersson et al., 2011), and older adults li ving with HIV may face gr eater social isolation and loneliness as a result of decreased social participation and engagement due to a loss of friends and social networks and to HIV-related stigma (Greene et al., 201 8; Greysen et al., 2013; Nachega et al., 2012; Rueda et al., 2014). Others specific conditions that may influence social isolation and loneliness include Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and spinal cord injury (Andreadou et al., 2011; Benito-Le\u00f3n et al., 2009; Buhse, et al., 2016). Geriatric Syndromes and Impairments In addition to specific diseases, geriatric syndromes 1 and impairments may also increase social isolation and loneliness as a result of the associated embarrassment and stigma or because of associated deficits in co mmunication or comprehension, lim ited functional abilities, or impaired mobility. For example, oral-health-related quality of life is an independent risk factor for loneliness among older adults , possibly due to embarrassment or stigma (Rouxel et al., 2017; Tonetti et al., 2017). These issues may be exacerb ated among some racial or ethnic minorities and low income older populations who lack preventative and corre ctive dental care (Griffin et al., 2012). Frailty and Functional Status Frailty is a medical syndrome th at involves a vulnerability to stressors and a greater risk of worse outcomes from new or co-existing cond itions. Different frailty assessment tools differ in their questions pertaining to social connecti on, and some frailty measures lack a social connection question altogether (e .g. the Fried phenotype defined frailty using five criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, low phys ical activity, slowness, and w eakness) (Fried et al., 2017a,b). This variab ility contributes to an inco mplete understanding of the association of frailty with social isolation a nd loneliness and the extent to which it is bi- directional. Over a 6-year period the English Longitudinal Study of Aging found that loneliness predicted frailty for men and women, while social isolation predicted frailty only for men (Gale et al., 2018). These findings provide evidence for fra ilty as a health outcome related to low social connections. In a study based on patient intervie ws conducted 1 week after discharge from a hospital stay, frailty was found to be a risk factor for social isolation (A ndreasen et al., 2015). 1 Geriatric syndromes are \"clinical cond itions common among older adults that often do not fit into discrete disease categories. Examples include delirium, depression, falls, sensory impairment, incontinence, malnutrition, and osteoporosis. The syndromes tend to be multifactorial and result from an interaction between identifiable patient- specific impairments and situation-speci fic stressors\" (IOM, 2008, p. 43). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The co-existence of other geriat ric syndromes, such as urinary and fecal incontinence, with frailty compounds the specific contribution of fr ailty to social isolation and loneliness. Functional status (measured by factors such as gait speed or difficulties in the activities of daily living) is bi-directionally associated wi th social isolation and loneliness. Loneliness predicts long-term care admission, independent of functional status (Hanratty et al., 2018). Patients' perceived social isolation may moderate the relationship between a chronic illness, such as lower back pain, and the degree of functional impairment that they experience related to that illness (Oliveira et al., 2015). Fear of falling has been associated with the risk of falling, poorer mental health, and social isola tion (Kumar et al., 2014). Older adu lts who restrict their activities or avoid leaving their home due to a fear of fa lling may increase their risk of becoming socially isolated or lonely (Finch et al., 2014; Parry et al., 2016). A recent study also found an association between frailty and social isolat ion and a fear of falling in olde r adults; however, physically-frail study participants who were also socially isolat ed reported having fewer fa lls than participants who were either physically frail or isolated, but not the two combined (Hayashi et al., 2020). Incontinence Urinary incontinence increases the risk of social isolation becaus e individuals tend to avoid activities with limited bathroom access or avoi d social contacts alto gether (Becher et al., 2013). Among the women surveyed in the National So cial Life, Health and Aging Project (Yip et al., 2013), daily urinary incontinence was associat ed with often feeling isolated. In one large study urinary incontinence was found al so to be associated with great er loneliness, but this effect was largely explained by comorbid depressi on (Fultz and Herzog, 2001; et al., 2017). Fecal inco ntinence increases the chances of nursing home referral and has effects on social isolation that are similar to thos e of urinary incontinence (Ditah et al., 2013). Furthermore, the so cial isolation of caregivers may be affected by the incontinence of their care recipients (Santini et al., 2016). Sensory Impairment Hearing loss contributes to both social isolation and loneline ss (Davis et al., 2016; Mick 2016; Strawbridge et al., 2000; Wallhagen et al., 1996). Hearing loss has been associated with being less willing to engage in social inte ractions, and living in a community where access to hearing health care is limited\u2014such as in some rural communities\u2014 can lead to greater isolation than living in an urban community where these services are more accessible (Hay-McCutcheon et al., 2018). Untreate d hearing loss has been associated with greater social isolation in the adult population under 70 years of age in particular (Mick and Pichora-Fuller, 2016). Hearing loss as measured by both self-report and an objective measure has been associated with loneliness, particularly among individuals who do not use hearing aids (Mick and Pichora-Fuller, 2016; Pronk et al., 20 11). Hearing loss contributes to the broader category of communication difficulty, and such difficulty often has multi-factorial causes. Communication disorders have been linked to social isolation, re duced social participation, and higher rates of loneline ss (Palmer et al., 2016). Visual impairment is associated with lone liness and may be moderated by self-efficacy, which may thus be a target for intervention (Alma et al., 2011). Self-reported visual impairment is associated with social isol ation, even after adju stment for demographics, chronic illness, functional limitations, and disability, and it may be a stronger pr edictor of social isolation than a Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Furt hermore, some data suggest that the spouse of a person with visual impairments is at greater risk for social isolation (S trawbridge et al., 2007). Dual sensory (vision and hearing) impairm ent has been associated with loneliness (Guthrie et al., 2018). In one study, the highest rates of loneliness\u201417 percent\u2014were in the group that experienced dual sensory impairment in addition to cognitive impairment, while the group without any impairments had a 9 percent pr evalence of loneliness (Guthrie et al., 2018). Both impairments are associated with worse qual ity of life, in part due to the mechanism of social isolation (Schneider et al., 2011; Tseng et al., 2018). Ev en olfactory dysfunction may be associated with loneliness (Sivam et al., 2016). PSYCHOLOGICAL, PSYCHIATRIC, AND COGNITIVE FACTORS Psychological symptoms, syndromes, and stressors can all influence whether an individual experiences l oneliness or becomes socially isolated. Several of these factors, including anxiety and depression as well as cognitive factors such as dementia, are briefly discussed below. The impacts of social isolation and loneline ss on subsequent depres sion and anxiety and on cognitive decline and incident dementia are summarized in Chapter 3. Anxiety and Depression Social isolation and loneline ss are more common in older adults with depressive and anxiety disorders than in their non-depressed and non-anxious peers (Evans et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2016). Psychiatric disorders such as major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder have been shown to in crease the risk of deve loping loneliness during middle and late adulthood (Dom\u00e8n ech-Abella et al., 2019; Falk Da hl and Dahl, 2010; Lim et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2012; McHugh Power et al., 2020). Loneliness, in turn, has been linked to increasing social isolation (likel y due to the negative social biases and avoidance characteristic of lonely individuals) and to higher rates of depression and anxiety over time (Cacioppo et al., 2010; Dom\u00e8nech-Abella et al ., 2019; Luo et al., 2012). The relationship between depression and loneli ness is bidirectional, and these constructs are closely associated. Yet depr ession and loneliness are not th e same. Depression, particularly major depression, is a clinical s yndrome characterized by pe rsistent feelings of sadness or loss of interest and such symptoms as sleep problems, decreased appetite, loss of energy, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal thoughts. Loneliness is not a core diagnostic feature of depression but may be an associated symptom. In some ol der adults, depression is accompanied by broad deficits in social function and well-being, including high levels of loneliness, low social support, and fewer social connections (B arger et al., 2014; Dom\u00e8nech-Abella et al., 2017). In other older adults depression has been associated with high le vels of loneliness that are unrelated to social network size, the level of social support, or individual factors such as personality traits and cognitive function (Dom\u00e8nech-Abella et al., 201 7; Evans et al., 2018; Peerenboom et al., 2015). Loneliness may stem from depression-related cogn itive biases in which social interactions are appraised more negatively or experienced as less rewarding (Burholt and Scharf, 2014; Lewis et al., 2017). Older adults with genera lized anxiety disorder may also be vulnerable to high levels of loneliness even with levels of social contact s that are equivalent to those without anxiety (Evans et al., 2018). Personality characteristics, such as extraversion, neuroticism, and resilience have been shown to increase the ri sk of loneliness as well as to m oderate this risk in the setting Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS of depression and anxiety (Peerenboom et al., 2015; Teo et al., 2013a; von Soest et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2016). Cognitive Function and Dementia Social withdrawal and other changes in so cial function are recognized features of dementia in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Lewy body dementia (McKhann et al., 2011). These changes can also arise in pre-dementia stages of impairment when neurocognitive deficits are less severe or not yet apparent (d'Oleire Uquill as et al., 2018; Donovan et al ., 2016; Ismail et al., 2016). Primary deficits in the core cognitive doma ins such as memory, reasoning, or language skills may degrade social function. With incr easing cognitive impairment, individuals often disengage from community gr oups and reduce their social ties as they are experiencing parallel functional losses in other aspects of daily living (Morris, 1993). Th is global process culminates in severe deficits in comprehension, communicati on, and interpersonal func tion in late dementia (Reisberg et al., 1982). Neurodegenerative disorders may also give ri se to specific impairments in such social processes as interpreting inform ation from faces (social perc eption), recognizing the thoughts and feelings of others (theory of mind), displaying empathy a nd regulating emotions (emotional processing), and behaving within soci al norms (Desmarais et al., 2018). Altered neuropsychiatric function may also im pair social functioni ng in individuals who are affected by neurodegenerative disorders. For ex ample, social withdrawal may be part of a broader apathy syndrome, a neur opsychiatric state that is common across dementia types (Lanct\u00f4t et al., 2017). Misperceptions or overest imations of social threat may predispose a person with dementia to agitation and aggression (Rosenberg et al ., 2015). Anxiety or depressive symptoms may underlie or contribute to social avoidance or withdraw al (Geda et al., 2013). A small number of studies have examined th e experience of loneliness in persons with dementia. A single population-based study of 589 Sw edish old adults with a mean age of 84 years found that loneliness was more prevalent in those with demen tia (33 percent) than in those without dementia (22 percent) (H olm\u00e9n et al., 2000). Dementia ca regivers, particularly spouses, are also at risk for greater l oneliness and depression both during th e course of disease and after the caregiving ends (Adams, 2008; Eloniemi-Sulkav a et al., 2002). In semi-s tructured interviews of 70 persons with early-stage dementia and their caregivers, the st udy participants with dementia spoke of experiencing relationship lo ss and of the importance of having meaningful relationships and people to conve rse with (Moyle et al., 2011). Th e loss of memory function was acknowledged as a barrier to social relationships , whereas an involvement in arts, crafts, and music was identified as a way of reducing feelings of loneliness (Moyle et al., 2011). Caregivers tended to perceive loneliness from observed emo tions and behaviors even if loneliness was not explicitly expressed by the person wi th dementia (Moyle et al., 2011). Other research in dementia care has led to the concept of \"unmet needs\" among persons with dementia who are unable to communicate or fulfill their own basic needs (Black et al., 2013; Cohen-Mansfield, 2001). This work has provi ded insights into the importance of social relationships to persons with demen tia, even in late stages. In a re view of studies of persons with dementia living in nursing homes, those interv iewed identified meaningful relationships and support for grief and loss as two of their eight ma in concerns (Shiells et al., 2019). The residents with advanced dementia in particular expre ssed having a fear of loneliness. Many of these participants wrongly believed that family had not visited them even when they had (Cahill and Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.4-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Diaz-Ponce, 2011). In a separate study, 70 percen t of nursing home resi dents with dementia reported feelings of loneline ss (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2015). Studies of agitated behaviors in nursing home settings have found that ve rbal agitation (e.g., constant requests for attention, complain ing, screaming) was more common in nursing home residents who were cognitively impaired (Cohen-Mansfield and Libin, 2005) and in those who were lonely (Cohen-Mansfiel d et al., 2015). An understanding of behavioral symptoms as a form of distress related to unmet needs has led to the development of interventions to reduce loneliness and behavioral symptoms in nursing ho me residents. In a study of 30 nursing home residents with dementia, both simulated family presence and a music inte rvention reduced verbal agitation more than usual care (Garland et al., 2007). In a loneliness-focused study of 38 nursing home residents with and without cognitive impair ment, individuals who received animal-assisted therapy with either robotic or living dogs, but not those in th e control group, reported reduced loneliness ratings (Banks et al., 2008). (See Chapter 8 for more on interventions.) Loneliness and social isolation are not curr ently assessed in standard dementia care (Johnston et al., 2011; Sanders et al., 2017), and the established instruments for measuring these constructs have not been validated in persons with dementia. At the same time, there is an emerging interest in understanding how to measure engagement and provide effective opportunities for meaningful activity and engagement in pers ons with dementia, including those with advanced disease (Cohe n-Mansfield et al., 2017). SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS This section explores the societal and cultura l factors that can aff ect how people interact with their environments and whether they experien ce social isolation or l oneliness. Such factors include social support characterist ics (including marital status a nd the quality of relationships with family and friends, or pets) and the occu rrence of disruptive life events (including bereavement, illness, and retirement). Social Support Characteristics Various characteristics of a society, including customs, lifestyles, and values, can affect an individual's everyday interactions\u2014with fami ly members, friends, or complete strangers\u2014 and influence how people live their lives and perc eive their places in society. This interplay between individuals and their soci al and cultural milieus has given rise to a wide array of inter- related research areas. The potential impacts of social support networks as well as the influence of different relationships\u2014with spouses and family members, friends and neighbors, or caregivers\u2014are discussed below. Impact of Social Support Networks Individuals' social suppo rt networks directly affect how they interact with and perceive their environments. The individu als who make up a person's ne twork (e.g., family members, friends, caretakers, spouse, and neighbors) can play important roles in the person's life and lessen his or her chances of experiencing social isolation or loneline ss. Having an extensive social network is not required in order to achieve a rewarding social network, but rather the rewards of a social network are greatest when th e relationships that do exist are of high quality (Chatters et al., 2018; Cohen-Mans field et al., 2016; Lauder et al., 2006a; Pinquart and S\u00f6rensen, Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1985). Supportive rela can decrease self -reported loneliness, while difficult or unfulfilling relationships can increase feelings of loneliness (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2016; Shiovitz-Ezra and Leitsch, 2010). Lonely older adults (m ean participant age = 68.5) reported less frequent sexual activity and reduced feelings of intimacy, although not less frequent sexual thoughts, in a study us ing items from the UCLA Loneliness scale; however, the directionality of this association was not dete rmined (Kolodziejczak et al., 2019). Relationships with one's family or spouse have been shown to be beneficial for some facets of health, while relationships with friends, nei ghbors, community members, and others can help prevent poor mental health and psychological distress (Christa kis and Allison, 2006; Fiori et al., 2006; Haslam et al., 2014; Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton, 2001). Th e totality of these relationships\u2014voluntary and otherwise\u2014can help lead an individual live a lif e with a sense of meaning, value, and interconnection (Berkman and Glass, 2000). Family and Marriage Family can be an important source of social support for older adu lts, providing social and emotional connection as well as contributing to an individual's financia l and physical well-being (Verdery and Margolis, 2017). Indivi duals who lack family are more apt to be socially isolated and to experience higher rates of lone liness (Verdery and Margolis, 2017). Marriage can also protect against lonelin ess and conditions such as poor cognitive function, stress, and dementia; how ever, the benefits gained fr om a spousal relationship are proportional to the overall quality of that relationship, including whet her a spouse is considered a trusted confidant (Gow et al., 2007; H\u00e5kanss on et al., 2015; Stack, 1998; Victor and Bowling, 2012; Xu et al., 2016). The close, long-term nature of th e spousal relationship tends to make an individual's partner the mo st likely person to provi de support if and when assistance is needed (Ha et al., 2019). However, the spousal relati onship can be eith er beneficial or detrimental, as loneliness has been found to be inversely associated with spousal support (Hawkley and Kocherginsky, 2018). In particular , remaining in an unhappy relationship can negatively affect an individual's health a nd well-being and can be the source of ongoing emotional distress (Evans et al., 2019; Xu et al ., 2016). Furthermore, negative spousal behaviors are associated with poorer physical health, and the adverse effects of marital strain are greater at older ages (Bookwala, 2005; Robles and Ki ecolt-Glaser, 2003; Umberson et al., 2006). Relationships with other family members can also affect an i ndividual's likelihood of being lonely, as close family bonds are often th e source of social, ec onomic, physical, and other forms of support (Berkman et al., 2000; Redfoot et al., 2013; Verdery and Margolis, 2017). As with other social relationships, the amount of support realized fr om close familial ties varies depending on the geographical distance between fa mily members, the amount of interpersonal contact (in-person or through other means), and e ach person's willingness to be emotionally and personally invested in maintaining mutually be neficial relationships (Quirke et al., 2019; Verdery and Margolis, 2017). Among older African Americans, family relationships often take precedence over relationships with friends, and soci al networks tend to be primarily made up of family members (Chatters et al., 2018; Cornwell et al., 2008; Griffin et al ., 2006; Taylor et al., 2013). Some families choose to create intergenerati onal co-residences or in very close proximity, however, these familial living arrangements are not as prevalent in the United States as in other parts of the world, and their impact on social is olation or loneliness in older adults is mixed (Caputo, 2019; Takagi and Saito, 2019; T eerawichitchainan et al., 2015; Tian, 2016).

Pare nt-child relationships are subj ect to the same limitations described above for social relationships, and th erefore these relationships can range in their quality and level of support. Virtual interactions with children and grandchildren are becoming more common, but the success of these interacti ons is dependent upon the computer literacy of the participant (regardless of age), the comfort level with this form of communication, and the availability of and accessibility to computers with reliable In ternet access (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2016). (For more on the use of technol ogy, see Chapter 8.) Incr easingly couples\u2014both unmarried and married\u2014are not having children; in 2018 the numbe r of births in the United States reached its lowest level in 32 years (H amilton et al., 2019; Verdery and Margolis, 2017). The effect of these demographic dynamics on the rates of social isolation and loneliness among future generations of older adults is unknown. Single Adults Single adults\u2014unmarried, widowed, or divorce d\u2014may experience social isolation or loneliness differently than adults with partners. While single adults are not destined to be lonely, feelings of loneliness can be more prevalent in this population because of such factors as the lack of a trusted confidant or the lack or loss of a partner (Pa\u00fa l and Ribeiro, 2009; Theeke, 2009, 2010; Verdery and Margolis, 2017). For others, re maining single is a conscious choice, and many older couples opt to forego marriage and c hoose cohabitation withou t marriage (Brown et al., 2012; al., 2012; de Jong Giervel d, 2004; Verdery and Margolis, 2017). Rates of divorce are also increasing in adults over 50 years of age, with divorce rates highest among individuals who have been married two or more times, among those with less education and a lower income, and among African Americans (Brown and Lin, 2012). Regardless of the circumstances, single adults are more apt to live alone, which can tend to make them more lonely and isolated than pe ople who cohabitate (Eva ns et al., 2019; Finlay Kobayashi, 2018; Perissinotto and C ovinsky, 2014). For lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals, living alone may be a symptom of larger discriminatory practices or societal stigma (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2013; Kim and Fred riksen-Goldsen, 2016). Some older adults who live alone may go for days without seeing or talk ing with another person (Finlay and Kobayashi, 2018). Living alone should not ne cessarily be equated with be ing sequestered from society, however, as many people who live alone still enjoy active social lives and are no more lonely or isolated from friends than those who live with ot hers (Evans et al., 2019). For some, periods of solitude represent opportunities to reenergize, relax, or engage in other pursuits. The disparate reactions to solitude may be explained by diffe ring reasons for being alone; that is, some individuals may choose to be alone, while others may lack opportuni ties to interact with others. Friends and Neighbors Unlike the case with their family members, individuals have c hoices concerning whom they become friends with, and these non-familial re lationships have the potential to affect social isolation or loneliness. Generally, friendships ar e based on individuals having similar interests, activities, hobbies, experi ences, or beliefs and are likely to occur among people in the same peer group (Chatters et al., 2018; Ha et al., 2019). Feelings of lone liness can be minimized by having friends that can be relied upon (Henning-Smith et al., 2019). Though so me friendships are situational or fleeting, friendshi ps that last into older ages tend to be characterized by Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

These long- term friendships tend to be superior in quality and richness than friends hips that have not stood the test of time (Nicolaisen and Thorsen, 2017; Pinquart and S\u00f6rensen, 2000). On the extreme end of the friendship continuum are older patient s who have been identified as \"unbefriended.\" This term is used to describe individuals who, for example, are incapacitated and unable to make medical decisions for themselves; lack an advanc ed directive; and lack friends, family, or an authorized surrogate to assist in maki ng medical decisions (F arrell et al., 2017). Proximity to other individuals can influen ce whether friendships develop. Neighbors can often provide a measure of support when family members or close friends are not geographically close, but engagement with neighbors tends to be more limited in commitment and scope (Ha et al., 2018; Messeri et al., 1993; Nocon and Pearson, 2000). Communi cating with neighbors or others via the telephone can also have an impact on one's sense of social isolation or loneliness. Loneliness was found to be increas ed in individuals who had fewer daily phone calls; this was most evident for people who received fewer inco ming calls (Petersen et al., 2016). Whether one lives in a rural or an urban area can also influe nce the likelihood and qual ity of friendships. (See discussions on rural versus urban living later in this chapter.) Caregivers With the rapid aging of the population, th e number of older adults who need care continues to grow rapidly (NASEM, 2016b). In the 2-year period of 2015-2016, more than 41 million people provided unpaid elder care for ad ults 65 years of age and older (BLS, 2017). Typical services provided by family and friends range from routine household activities (e.g., housework, food preparation, transp ortation) to providing direct physical or medical care (e.g., providing exercise, bathing, or to ileting assistance or dispensi ng medication) (BLS, 2017). Most often a spouse, partner, or adult child will fu lfill this family caregiv er role, but caregiving responsibilities can also be undertaken by other family memb ers (e.g., siblings or elderly parents), friends, neighbors, or vol unteers, and they can be provid ed in private homes, assisted care, or retirement facilities (BLS, 2017; Li and Loke, 2013). Increasingly, medical care for older adults is taking place in private homes, often for long periods of time. As a result, home care that i nvolves complex and dive rse care needs is more often falling on family caregivers with or without assistance from a member of the formal health care workforce (Li and Loke, 2013; Ris et al., 20 19). Having care provided in the home can help older adults and their caregivers maintain relatio nships with family, friends, and others in the community; however, social isol ation and loneliness are often byproducts of this arrangement (Evans et al., 2019; Wiles et al ., 2012). The quality of the relati onship between the patient and an informal family caregiver is an important factor determining the effectiveness of these arrangements. For example, better relationship qual ity between patients and their informal family caregivers has been linked to a reduced risk fo r patient mortality (Hooker et al., 2015). But older adults and their caregivers often must navi gate new or different interpersonal roles, responsibilities, or r outines and deal with stressful, em otional, and sometimes life-altering changes. These difficult situati ons can impede communication be tween older adults and their caregivers or visitors, creating fee lings of social isolation or lone liness. This can be especially true if friends' visits taper off over time (Northcott et al., 2016). In addition to the day-to-day interpersonal challenges faced by family caregivers and older adults, families can also experience negative psychological, financial, and social effects; these effects can be especially acute for female spouses, as they generally bear the largest burden Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.4-12 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS of et al., 2019; Zivin and Christakis, 2007). Caregivers commonly suffer from physical issues such as illn ess, loss of appetite or sleep, or exhaustion as well as mental health issues, trouble maintain ing relationships with friends, or difficulty participating in community or social activit ies (Blum and Sherman, 2010; Dhruva et al., 2012; Haines et al., 2018; Li and Loke, 2013). These diff iculties can be compounded by such factors as immigration status, language and cu ltural barriers, stigma or disc rimination issues related to an older adult's sexual orientation, or the specific needs of patient s (Kim and Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016; Kim H. et al., 2016; Moukouta et al., 2017; Shiu et al., 2016). It can be particularly challenging to care for older adults with mobility issues or those who suffer from dementia or other mental illnesses (Riffin et al., 2019). Human-Animal Interactions Interacting with an animal or a pet has long been thought to have health-related benefits, but research into the benefits of these huma n-animal interactions, including their effects on loneliness or social isolation, has had mixed results (Gilbey an d Tani, 2015; et al., 2014). Needell and Mehta-Maik (2016) examined the impact of pet ownership on th e risk and severity of geriatric depression and concluded that \"loneliness and so cial isolation seemed to be am eliorated by pet ownership\" (p. 5). Conversely, a review carried out at about the same time th at looked at the association between companion animal interactions and loneliness found \"no convi ncing evidence that companion animals can help to alleviate loneli ness\" (Gilbey and Tani, 2015, p. 195). The studies agree in their observations that research is spar se and insufficient in this area and that many of the available studies are underpower ed or inadequately designed. Other aspects of human-animal relationships may be related to subsequent social isolation or loneliness in older adults. Interacti ons with animals can prom ote social interactions and participation; can add struct ure, routine, meaning or purpose to an individual's day; can increase exercise and physical activity opportunities; and can pr ovide emotional support (Brooks et al., 2018; Friedmann and Krause-Parello, 2018; Gee and Mueller, 2019; Hui Gan et al., 2019; Mueller et al., 2018). Dogs may serve as a stimulus for social interactions and engagement since daily walks with pets have been found to incr ease the likelihood of engaging with others and increasing one's sense of community (McNicho las and Collis, 2000; Toohey et al., 2013). A study by Muraco et al. (2018) f ound that interacting with a companion animal was also associated with increased perceived social support, emotional support, and companionship among older pet owners (>65 years of age) in the LGBT community, especially among individuals who were disabled or who lacked social networks. On the other hand, the emotional difficulties that pet owners may experience when a pe t is ill or dies can rival the effects of caring for a sick family member or coping with the tr auma of the death of a close relative (Friedmann and Krause-Parello, 2018; Muraco et al., 2018). Disruptive Life Events At any age people can experience disruptive lif e events that alter their interpersonal relations and how they perceive their lives or th eir feelings of isolati on and loneliness. While older adults are not unique in having these life-altering experien ces, some disruptive events are more likely to occur, or to occur at a great er frequency, for people over the age of 50. Such disruptive life events include bereavement, illness or poor health, and retirement. Although Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS research on these topics is sparse, it provides insight into how these experiences can disrupt people's lives and how they could lead to so cial isolation or fee lings of loneliness. Bereavement The loss of a loved one\u2014be it a child, sibling, s pouse, partner, or friend\u2014can result in a critical loss of emotional intimacy and everyda y support. Bereavement leads to feelings of sadness and loneliness in grieving re latives and friends, and in some cases these feelings can lead to individuals becoming socially withdrawn, isolat ed, or depressed and can also affect an older adult's risk for premature mortality (Fried et al., 2015; Holm et al., 2019; Robinaugh et al., 2014; Roelfs et al., 2012). The extent of symptoms a ssociated with grieving can vary depending on the cause of death, when it occurred, the context in which the death occurred, and whether the grieving party believes the deceased individual may have hastened his or her death through habits or lifestyle (Carr, 2009; Fried et al., 2015). Family careg ivers may have an especially difficult time after the passing of a loved one unde r their care since the death may result in the loss of a companion or friend as we ll as the loss of the personal pride, purpose, or satisfaction they derived from providing care (Holtslander et al., 2017). The loss may be particularly acute when caregivers' responsibilities have compromise d their regular social network while they were providing care, thus leaving them w ith diminished social support or feelings of isolation after the loved one's death (Holts lander et al., 2017). The death of a spouse typically increases feel ings of loneliness in the surviving spouse, and these feelings can act as a gateway to subse quent depressive symptoms (Fried et al., 2015). Many widowed individuals report that loneliness is something th ey cope with on a daily basis (Fried et al., 2015). Data from more than 500 million persons examining spousal bereavement, which increases the risk of social isolation and loneliness, revealed that, after adjusting for age, widowers had a 23 percent increased risk of deat h in any given year compared with married people (Roelfs et al., 2012). (See Chapter 2 for additional information on mortality risk.) In another study, late-life bereavem ent was found to be associated with decreased mortality in widows who had cardiovascular disease and with increased mortality in widowers who did not have cardiovascular disease (Stahl et al., 2016 ). The authors suggested that the decreased mortality in widows could be due to a decrease in stress or in exposure to suffering or to an increase in self-care after th e death of the spouse. Over th e long term, however, having been widowed is an enduring risk fact or for loneliness in late life, regardless of subsequent marital status (von Soest et al., 2020). Men have a higher likelihood of adjusting poorly to widowhood than women and also have greater feelings of loneliness (Carr et al., 2018). Male veterans may be the exception to this, however; as research in dicates that some veterans who were exposed to death while serving in the military may experience less loneliness than civilian widowers (Carr et al., 2018). Social support provided by family or friends has been shown to be more helpful for grieving spouses than support from other sources ; support from family and friends can help restore function and a sense of cohesion (Chow et al., 2018; Merz and de Jong Gierveld, 2016; Utz et al., 2014). Support is most helpful when it is readily available and when the surviving partner has the opportunity to fr eely express himself or hersel f (Merz and de Jong Gierveld, 2016; Utz et al., 2014). Psychological resilience (e.g., emotional stabilit y, extraversion, and conscientiousness) is associated with a more favo rable resolution of loneli ness in bereaved older adults (Spahni et al., 2015). Addressing the risk factors for loneliness in bereaved individuals may be an important way to reduce the risk of psychiatric morbidity and help shorten the bereavement period and alleviate suffering (C how et al., 2018; Robinaugh et al., 2014).

All rights reserved.4-14 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Illness and Poor Health Poor health in older adults has been associat ed with increased lone liness, and chronically ill individuals are especially vuln erable to becoming socially isolated (Goll et al., 2015; Holley, 2007; Merz and de Jong Giervel d, 2016). Chronic illness is associated with emotional or psychological issues, mobility limitations, a lack of or limitation in trans portation or employment options, new or ongoing issues rela ted to coping with disabling c onditions, and strained social relationships (Holley, 2007; Warn er et al., 2017). In some cases , chronic illness may increase individuals' social suppo rt networks and decrease their li kelihood of being socially isolated because addressing health issues may increase so cial interactions in th e form of medical or therapy appointments and other health-relat ed activities (Finlay and Kobayashi, 2018). Functional Impairment or Disability Individuals with functional impairment or a disabilit y\u2014including physical, mental, intellectual, sensory, or other\u2014face many uniqu e challenges that leave them especially susceptible to being socially is olated or lonely (von Soest et al., 2020). The degree to which a person's disability affects how they live thei r life, and the magnitude to which they are dependent on others for some or all of their n eeds, have both been found to be correlated with their likelihood of experi encing increased feelings of loneliness or vulnerability (Lykke and Handberg, 2019). Impacts on life satisfaction for those with disabilities or functional impairments have been shown to fluctuate depend ing on age, gender, residency (rural vs urban), and degree of extraversion (Hudson and Dooga n, 2019; and Ipsen, 2020; von Soest et al., 2020). The existing social networks of people with functional impairment can impact whether people experience loneliness a nd to what extent. Unmarried individuals with functional limitations experien ce higher loneliness than happ ily married individuals with comparable limitations (Warner et al., 2019). Wo men with functional limitations have been found to experience greater loneline ss if they have strained mari tal relationships while men may experience increased loneliness if they have overly supportive relationships, and people who lacked contact with friends all experienced grea ter loneliness (von Soest et al., 2020; Warner et al., 2019). In general, individuals with greater mobility impairments or functional limitations tend to have fewer friends (Chatters et al., 2018; Ha et al., 2019). Additio nally, certain life events (e.g., retirement, illness, death of loved ones or fr iends) can lead to a marked decrease in an individual's social netw ork; this decrease in friends and in friendships, especially among the oldest older adults, can lead to feelings of loneliness or to becoming isolated (Nicolaisen and Thorsen, 2017). In many cases it is not uncomm on for individual with functional limitations or disabilities to avoid openly expr essing feeling of loneliness to others (Wormald et al., 2019). Employment and Retirement There is evidence that the relationship betw een loneliness and occupational function is bidirectional. Loneliness has been shown to be pred ictive of future work disabilities that occur when mental or physical impairments bring abou t functional limitations that make it impossible for an individual to perform th e duties necessary to maintain paid employment (Morris, 2019). Being lonely can also result in depression, whic h can then lead to functional limitations and subsequent work disability. Along this pathway, depression can act a partial mediator between loneliness and work disability.

All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Retirement can also affect an individual's lik elihood of being socially isolated or lonely. The number of post-retirement individuals in th e United States is risi ng quickly, and retired individuals are living longer (Boyle, 2019, Pew Research Cent er, 2019a). Baby boomers (i.e., those born between 1946 and 1964) make up of 26 pe rcent of the U.S. population, and their exit from the workforce (due to retirement) will dr amatically change their lives (Boyle, 2019; Pew Research Center, 2019a). Each day between 2011 and 2030 an estimated 10,000 baby boomers will reach the age of 65, an age when many people are on the cusp of retiring or have already exited the workforce (Pew Research Center, 2019a ). Ideally, most of these workers will decide when and under what conditions they will retire , but unplanned exits due to unexpected health problems (either an individual's own health problems or those of a loved one) or employment changes (e.g., downsizing, redundancy, payouts fo r early retirement) are becoming more frequent (Boyle, 2019; Donaldson et al., 2010; Edge et al., 2017). Wh ether the decisions to retire is planned or unplanned and whethe r the retiree believe he or she has a choice in the decision can affect how smoothly the transition between be ing a paid employee and a retiree progresses (Donaldson et al., 2010; Quine et al., 2007). Being employed can be protective against lone liness as it provides a convenient social environment for workers (Segel-Karpas et al., 2018). The disruption of these daily social interactions and structured r outines upon retirement can lead to subsequent socialization difficulties (Morris, 2019). Workers who are lonely are at an increased risk of having difficulty transitioning to retirement and can experience a worsening of depressive symptoms since they often lack an established social network outsi de of the workplace (Gum et al., 2017; Segel- Karpas et al., 2018). Some retirees feel a loss of identity without their former job title and responsibilities, and some miss the challenges, de mands, or appreciation they received at work (Schaap et al., 2018). For others, retiring can mean more time with family and friends and more enriching social interact ions (Schaap et al., 2018). Thus, de pending on the individual, retirement can favorably or unfavorably influence soci al connection and fee lings of loneliness. Factors related to a successful retirement in clude having good physical and mental health, financial stability, good social integration, the option of retiring by choice, and knowing how to enjoy leisure time (Barbosa et al., 2016; Donaldson et al., 2010; Sch aap et al., 2018). In general, most retired people are less lonely than employed workers or people who are simply unemployed, and women typically have an easie r time transitioning into retirement than men (Lauder et al., 2006a; Perren et al., 2003). Roughl y 26 percent of people who retire from their careers end up embarking on second careers, which can be similar to their previous jobs but more likely will involve some type of vol unteerism (Boyle, 2019; Cook, 2015). These bridge jobs and volunteer positions help to ease the transition into reti red living by allowing people to find new meaning in their post-car eer lives and can help retirees remain active, fulfilled, engaged, and connected within their communities (Boyle, 2019; Cook, 2015). Religious and Spiritual Organizations Many people feel that being part of a religious organization is central to their identity, and such affiliations can also be foundational to a person's social networks . Challenges related to the previously described disruptiv e life events may lead some ol der adults to seek supportive social connections through associations with re ligious organizations (Idler et al., 2003; Levin and Chatters, 1998; Rote et al., 2013). Active involvement in a religious organization can be a source of social support, and this affiliation may help ease an individual's feelings of loneliness or social isolation and, some argue, even make people happier (Gonzales et al., 2015; Rizvi and Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.4-16 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN al., 2001). The intens ity of one's faith may also influence an individual's feeli ng of loneliness, as individuals who hold stronger re ligious beliefs may feel less lonely than those who do not hold such strong beliefs (Lauder et al., 2006b). Higher levels of social support and social inte gration have been associated with religious attendance and also with lower levels of loneliness (Rote et al., 2013). Older women are much more likely to be widowed than older men, and religious organizations may help to meet many of their social needs and help them cope with illness (Idler et al., 2017; Strawbridge et al., 2001). Additionally, several studies have found that women are more likely to be active members and experience greater overall benefits from participation in religious organizations, to have stronger social support and social networks, and to genera lly be less lonely than men (Gray, 2009; Idler et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 1999; Lauder et al., 2006b; Strawbri dge et al., 2001). One study did, however, find that men have stronger social ne tworks\u2014defined as the number of close friends and the frequency of interactions with thos e friends\u2014than women (G allicchio et al., 2007). SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS The interactions between indivi duals and the environments in which they live, work, and play can profoundly influence their propensities for becoming socia lly isolated or lonely. This section reviews the relationships of several envi ronmental factors, incl uding transportation and housing situation, with social isolation and loneliness. Transportation In 2017 nearly 37 percent of the more than 225 million licensed drivers in the United States were 50 years of age or older (FHA, 2017). Driving is impor tant for adults who want to maintain independence and mobility; however, declin es in physical health or cognitive function or deficits in reaction time or coordination can lead older adults to stop driving (Chihuri et al., 2016; Hwang and Hong, 2018; Johnson, 1999, 2008). Additional reasons for driving cessation include an increased insecurity in driving skills or ability; having had previous car accidents or traffic citations; the high cost of driving; bei ng compelled to comply with requests by family members, friends, or a medical professional; or forfeiting driving privileges in compliance with state driving licensure laws (Johnson, 1999; Ratnapradipa et al., 2018). Driving cessation has been associated with a decrease in social enga gement and an increase in social isolation and feelings of loneliness (Barrett and Gumber, 2019; Chihuri et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 2009; Johnson, 1999, 2008). Driving cessation is especially di fficult for older adults who live in areas that lack alternative tr ansportation options, such as rural or lower-densi ty neighborhoods (Finlay and Kobayashi, 2018; Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). Without reliable and affordable alternatives to driving, some former drivers may resume thei r driving despite their initial reasons for stopping (Johnson, 2008). Impact of Housing or Geographic Location Different living environments can shape olde r adults' interactions with their social networks and with their community at large. Whether one's home is a private residence, an apartment, or a room in a retirement community or nursing home, this space\u2014and a person's acceptance of this space\u2014can aff ect that person's physical, psyc hological, mental, and financial Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

A particular housing situa tion may represent a risk factor or protective factor for social isola tion and loneliness, depending on the sp ecific details and the characteristics of the individual. Regardless of where or in what type of hous ing a person lives, the degree of social isolation or loneliness an individu al experiences can be affected by whether or not they feel safe in their community. Prior direct or indirect exposure to community violence can lead to increased loneliness or a reduction in perceive d social support from fr iends, thus increasing socially isolation (Tung et al., 2019 ). Even when older adults are motivated to be more socially engaged, living in a high-crime neighborhood can make pe ople reluctant or afra id to leave their residence or engage with others (Portacolone et al., 2018). These concerns can be exacerbated by personal vulnerabilities (such as ha ving chronic health issues or disa bilities, limited social ties, or experiencing poverty), derelict or dangerous environmental condi tions in the neighborhood, or a lack of opportunity or interest in engaging with other commun ity members (Portacolone, 2018; Portacolone et al., 2018). Furthe rmore, the rapidly changing de mographic trend continues to influence the need for additional, adequate, and appropriate housing for older adults (Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). Though the available research on issues related to housing t ype or location is sparse and can be somewhat inconsistent, it pr ovides insight into po ssible links between a person's living arrangement and soci al isolation or loneliness. Aging in Place In 2018 more than 32.9 million households were h eaded by adults aged 65 and older, and that number is projected to increase by 11.1 million households between 2018 and 2028 (Census Bureau, 2018; JCHS, 2018). Finding affordable, accessi ble, and safe housing for older adults will become increasingly challenging (Wick, 2017). Many older adults are choosing to stay in their privately owned houses for personal, practical , and financial reasons, a situation known as aging in place (Benefield and Holtzclaw, 2014; Granbom et al., 2014; 2019; Pearson et al., 2019; Wick, 2017). Years of shared history and memories become associated with one's home, and leaving can be untenable for some (Granbom et al., 2014). In addition, the desire to remain independent and enmeshed in es tablished social networks close to home can be a compelling reason to stay (Benefield and Holtzclaw, 2014; Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). It should be noted, however, that all housing choices, especially fo r those with disabilities or special needs, are constrained by financial and othe r limitations, and staying in one's home is not always a tenable option. Often, accessible housing options are not readily available (Greiman and Ravesloot, 2015). Aging in place may be both a risk and protectiv e factor for social is olation and loneliness. While a private home can provide comfort and securi ty, it can also become a hazard if occupants are faced with changes in functi onal abilities (e.g., trouble walking or navigating stairs) (Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). Aging in place can be isolat ing if social networ ks or opportunities for affordable and convenient transportation are not readily available, especially for people who cannot afford sociable leisure activities outside the home (Finlay and Kobayashi, 2018; Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). Changes in physical heal th can often be accommodated with home modifications (e.g., adding accessible bathrooms or installing ramps) and with increased in-home support services which provide needed assistan ce and connection with others, although the expense associated with these accommodations may, in many cases, be cost prohibitive and untenable without outside suppor t (Herbert and Molinsky, 2019; Lane et al., 2019).

For successful agi ng in place to occur, a coordinated plan is needed that addresses issues rela ted to health care, housing, financ ial concerns, social needs, and the use of resources, including technology (Benef ield and Holtzclaw, 2014). Older adults who live alone without such support systems in place ar e more likely to report symptoms related to loneliness and depression (Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). Co-Housing or Living Groups A more recent approach to housing may provide some protec tion against social isolation and loneliness. Resistance to traditional long -term care options and reductions in government resources have led to the development of new and innovative housing options for older adults (Glass and Skinner, 2013; Glass and Vander Pl aats, 2013; Herbert and Molinsky, 2019). Older adults in the United States are increasingl y choosing to live in supportive co-housing communities which can increase these adults' social connections (Glass and Vander Plaats, 2013; Graham 2019; Wick, 2017). Resident-managed co- housing communities are often intergenerational and feature private units built around a common green space. Inclusion a nd participation are valued and encouraged as cohabitants share common meals and activities and help w ith day-to-day operational ma tters (Glass and Vander Plaats, 2013). Such living arrangements increase the like lihood of socialization opportunities, which can lead to an open exchange of information and ideas, emotional and mutual support, and shared communal coping and can help alleviate social is olation and loneliness (Glass and Vander Plaats, 2013). Federally Subsidized Housing and Senior Housing Subsidized housing and senior housing are optio ns for older adults who may not be able to afford alternative living arrangements. This lower-cost rental option ai ms to provide general support, assistance for people with disabilities, op portunities for social connections, and security (Taylor et al., 2018b). Compared with community-d welling non-renters, ol der adults living in subsidized housing tend to liv e alone, have lower fixed incomes (averaging about $10,000 per year), have greater functional limitations or disa bilities, have more ps ychiatric conditions, and have more chronic co-morbid conditions (G onyea et al., 2018; Henning-Smith et al., 2019; Parsons et al., 2011; Redfoot and Kochera, 2005 ; Taylor et al., 2018b). Although subsidized housing communities, senior housing, and retirement communities (e.g., interactions with peers, planned activities, meeting spaces ) all offer similar socializati on opportunities, studies suggest that loneliness is pervasive among residents living in the subsidi zed and senior housing communities. An estimated 30 to 70 percent of residents in subsidized housing classify themselves as having high rates of loneliness, compared with only 19 to 29 percent among older adults living in homes or unsubsidized apartm ents (Gonyea et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2018b). The combination of poor health a nd difficult financial circumstances may be at the root of the loneliness, but other situations that plague so me subsidized housing communities (e.g., crime, alcohol and tobacco use, the use of abusive language) may also lead to social withdrawal (Finlay and Kobayashi, 2018; Gonyea et al., 2018; Ke mperman et al., 2019). Subsidized housing residents may also experience depression or nega tive psychological outcomes stemming from the long-term effects of racial discrimination or liv ing lives marked by disadvantage (Gonyea et al., Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2018; Park et al., 2018). Other housing options for low-income or homeless individuals (e.g. permanent supportive housing for ch ronically homeless individuals) are an option for some older adults, but information regarding their impact on social isolation or loneliness is lacking (Henwood at al., 2019). Retirement Communities Many older adults transition from private hom es to retirement communities, which offer amenities such as social activitie s, health-related supervision, a nd 24-hour supervision (Bekhet et al., 2009). The ease and success of an individual's move into such a community has much to do with the person's motivation for moving. For exampl e, such things as the failing health of an individual or the individual's s pouse or partner, a need to mi nimize responsibility, or social isolation and loneliness all can encourage older adults to relocate to a retirement community (Stimson and McCrea, 2004). Alternatively, older adul ts may move to be with friends, to relocate to a specific locale or community, to live closer or have more access to medical facilit ies, to feel safer, or to live more affordably (Bekhet et al., 2009; Crisp et al., 2013; Stimson and McCrea, 2004). Voluntary moves, where individuals feel they have options and can make their own decisions and maintain autonomy, are more likel y to have a positive outcome than non-voluntary moves (Bekhet et al., 2009). In creasingly, retirement communities offer options that allow residents to transition from indepe ndent living arrangements to assist ed living if needed (Jeste et al., 2019). Yet these moves are limited to those olde r adults who have the financial resources to \"buy in\" to such communities. Long-Term Care Service Options: Residential Care and Nursing Homes Locations that offer long-term care services such as adult day care, nursing homes, and residential care provide older ad ults with a range of health ca re, personal car e, and supportive services. In 2016 long-term care services provid ers served more than 8.3 million people in the United States, including 1,347,600 in nursing homes and 811,500 in residential care facilities (Harris-Kojetin et al., 2019). Long-term care providers offer older adults aid with physical functioning and general quality-of-life tasks by providing a wide range of serv ices such as assistance with daily activities, medication management, and health maintenance tasks (Harris-Kojetin et al., 2019; Rijnaard et al., 2016). Many of these organizations aim to provide home-like accommodations by focusing on psychological and social fact ors (e.g., autonomy and relationshi ps with family, friends, and pets) and the built environment (e.g., comfortabl e private spaces, helpful technology, personal belongings) (Rijnaard et al., 2016). In some cases , providing person-centered care that includes fulfilling personal preferences related to care and recreation may be helpful in alleviating loneliness in long-term care resi dents (Andrew and Meeks, 2018). Nevertheless, long-term care can increase social isolation and loneliness for ol der adults living in such residencies, a portion of whom may be living far from friends and loved ones. Long-te rm care residents often may not be able to engage in meaningful social interactions and, in some cases, ma y share a room with people with whom they ar e not compatible (Trybusi ska and Saracen, 2019). Rural Versus Urban Environments Compared with adults who live in urban set tings, adults who live in rural environments are more apt to face challenges related to the long distances between homes and businesses or medical facilities, limited public transportation options, unreliable or nonexistent access to Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Research on the relationship of social isolati on and loneliness with living in rural versus urban areas has had mixed result s. Henning-Smith and colleagues (2019) found that individuals who lived in areas with fewer than 10,000 people reported having more family members they could count on and more friends than urban dwellers, but these same rural residents also said they felt more left out. I ndividuals who lived in mi d-size-population areas (up to 49,999 residents) reported less loneliness overall than people who lived in urban environments, but they were more likely to report not having any frie nds. On the other hand, Mullen and colleagues (2019) failed to find a si gnificant difference in perceived loneliness between rural and urban primary care patients. Finlay and Kobayashi (2018) found that people who lived closer to a city center reported more so cial interactions than individuals who lived in the suburbs. City dwellers credited those social interac tions to daily connections with others in their residential spaces, relationships with build ing staff or caretakers, and the existence of numerous places for socialization (e.g., parks, stores, movies, libraries, coffee shops) which provided avenues for impromptu so cial interactions. Generally, st udy participants in the outer suburbs reported greater loneliness than those closer to the city center, w ith loneliness decreasing with moves into the inner suburbs and closer to the city center. Many of the inner suburbs lacked communal places in which to gather, and people w ho lived in the outer suburbs reported that isolation from neighbors and the lo ng distances to opportunities fo r socialization increased their social isolation and loneliness, although th ese results were not consistent among study participants. AT-RISK POPULATIONS Determining how the lives of older adults ag ed 50 and over may be affected by social isolation and loneliness is cen tral to the committee's charge ; however, the scope of the committee's work also extends to the particular impacts for at-risk (i.e., vulnerable) populations. While it is difficult to specifically define all the sub-populations or gr oups of people who would be included as at risk, the committee endeavored to include information pe rtaining to any special populations for which there is rele vant social isolation or lone liness research. Some of these populations include people who were studied on the basis of their raci al or ethnic background, sex (i.e., male or female), age, socioeconomic st atus, health status, or place of residence (e.g., rural, urban). Research pertaini ng to these populations is included throughout the report. While a fair number of international stud ies look at the status of at-ris k populations in other countries (e.g., Steptoe et al., 2013; Zebhauser et al., 2014), studies focusing on at-risk sub-populations in the United States are sparse. Two populations in the United States that have been researched more extensively than others are immigrants a nd individuals who identify as part of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual community. Re search pertaining to these two groups is described below. Immigrants Evidence suggests that immigrants are more likely to experience social isolation and possibly loneliness than non-immigr ants. For example, Latino immigrants have fewer social ties and lower levels of social integration than U.S. -born Latinos (Ramos et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2011; Steele et al., 2018; Viruell-Fuentes et al., 2013). On the other hand, one study found no difference in loneliness between more and less ac culturated Latinos (Gallo et al., 2012).

All rights reserved.RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS 4-21 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS of older, highly acculturated Korean immigrants found lower levels of depression in people who had stronger social support ne tworks (Kim et al., 2012). In general, immigrants experience many stressors that can increase th eir social isolation, including language and communi cation barriers; differences in community, family; or intergenerational dynamics; and new relationships that lack depth or history. This social isolation can be especially acute in first generation older immigrants (Barrington et al., 2012; Curtin et al., 2017; Gerst-Emerson et al., 2014; Miyawaki, 2015). Immigrants also experience physical, cognitive, and mental health cons equences associated with increas ed loneliness, and this can be especially true for women or people who are unmarried or lack a close confidant (Dong and Chen, 2017; Gerst-Emerson et al., 2014). A study in England found that immigrants, including those from China, Africa, the Caribbean, Paki stan, and Bangladesh, had much higher rates of social isolation and loneliness than their nonim migrant peers, although Indian immigrants were an exception to this finding (Victor et al ., 2012). In a Dutch study of immigrants, Moroccan, Turkish, and Surinamese immigrants reported feeling less healthy and more discriminated against that did Dutch natives, and these factors were related to increased loneliness (Visser and El Fakiri, 2016). Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Populations A small number of studies have found that an individual's sexual or ientation can affect his or her feelings of loneliness or social isolation, but the findi ngs are inconsistent. In general, studies have found that gay, lesb ian, and bisexual individuals tend to experience more loneliness than their heterosexual peers. For example, in the Swedish National Public Health Survey of more than 79,000 individuals 18-84 years of age, the 1,673 who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual reported higher levels of social isolation than did those who identified as heterosexual, and social isolation was associated with increa sed measures of substance use and psychological distress in these populations (Br\u00e4nstr\u00f6m and P achankis, 2018). On the other hand, a small study in the Netherlands by Bos et al. ( 2015) failed to find a similar resu lt in a comparison of primarily middle-aged same-sex and heterosexual coupl es (median age = 43), and a study by Beam and Collins (2019) did not find that loneliness varied between sexual minority and heterosexual men and women across multiple age ranges. Several studies have looked at the factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation among gay, lesbian, and bisexual populations. Ja ckson et al. (2019) analyzed perceived discrimination and health and well-being in 304 middle-aged and older lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (aged 41-85) who participat ed in surveys in 2010-2011 and 2016-2017. The prospective analysis found that perceptions of discriminatio n based on sexual orientation increased loneliness. In a study of 912 gay Latin o men recruited in bars (primarily aged 20-40 years), experiences of homophobia, racism, financial hardship, a nd low resiliency all predicted loneliness (Diaz et al., 2001). In a large, nationally representativ e study of adults in the United States 18 years of age or older, Hatzenbuehler et al. (2011) found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals who were lonely repo rted higher levels of mood and a nxiety disorders than did those who were not lonely. However, the correlation between social isolation and mood disorders differed between those who lived in states with high concentra tions of same-sex couples and those who did not. Furthermore, a small study of older lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in the Netherlands found that those who had experien ced negative social re actions or expected those reactions relative to their sexual pref erence had the highest levels of loneliness (Kuyper and Fokkema, 2010).

All rights reserved.4-22 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Physical Health Factors Physical health risk factors for social isolation and loneliness include many common chronic diseases and conditions, includi ng heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The relationships between physical health risk factors and social isolation and loneliness are often bi-directional. Functional status (measured by factors such as gait speed or difficulties in the activities of daily living) is bi-directiona lly associated with social isolation and loneliness. Strong evidence links sensory impairment to communication difficulty and, further, to reduced social participation, social is olation, and higher rates of loneliness. Hearing loss contributes to bot h social isolation and lone liness, and remediation of hearing loss has been found to reduce l oneliness and improve social functioning. Psychological, Psychiatr ic, and Cognitive Factors Psychiatric disorders, such as major de pression, generalized a nxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder, have been shown to increase the risk of developing loneliness. Social isolation and loneline ss are more common in older adults with depressive and anxiety disorders than in their non-depressed and non-anxious peers. The relationship between depression and loneliness is bidirectional, and these constructs are closely associated. Yet de pression and loneliness are not the same. The impairments related to dementia pred ispose an individual to feelings of loneliness, and caregivers are al so at risk for loneliness. Social, Cultural, and Environmental Factors Supportive relationships\u2014especially those w ith family, friends, and caregivers\u2014can decrease self-reported loneliness, while difficult or unfulfilling relationships can increase feelings of loneliness. Losing a spouse is a frequent disruptive event for older adults, particularly for women. Loneliness is a primary symptom of bereavement. Research on the benefits of hu man-animal interactions is mixed. Retirement can affect an indi vidual's likelihood of being so cially isolated or lonely. Social environmental factors such as drivi ng status or housing st atus or location can affect the levels of social isolation and loneliness. At younger ages men and women experience si milar rates of social isolation and loneliness, but women ma y be at higher risk as they get older. Literature focusing on social isolation and loneliness in at-risk subgroups is sparse. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals tend to experience more loneliness than their heterosexual peers. Immigrants appear more likely to experien ce social isolation a nd loneliness than non- immigrants.

PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-1 5 Mediators and Moderators The Statement of Task charged the committee to consider \"factors that moderate and mediate the links between social isolation/loneliness and health outcomes.\" By identifying the moderators and mediators of the effects of soci al isolation and loneline ss, one can explore the mechanisms underlying those effects as well as w hy the effects may differ from one population to another and under which conditions an eff ect may be stronger or weaker (MacKinnon and Luecken, 2008). Mediators (i.e., mechanisms or pa thways) are the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness a ffects health outcomes, while mode rators are the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the eff ect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Identifying mediators helps explain the mechan isms, or plausible pathways, by which social isolation and loneliness influen ce health outcomes, while identif ying moderator variables helps to determine whether the health effects of social isolation or loneliness are stronger for some groups than for others. This chapter represents the portion of the co mmittee's guiding framework related to the mediators and the moderators (largely at the indi vidual level) of the associations between social connections and health outcomes (see Figure 5-1). (For more on moderators at the level of the community and society, see Chapter 1.) Current evidence suggests that there are multiple mediators that each may influence health (see Figure 5-2). This report does not provide an exhaustive review of all known mechanisms. Ra ther, the following sections summarize the current evidence concerning a few key mechanisms that exert critical roles in explaining the association between social connections and heal th outcomes. Then the chapter identifies and summarizes the evidence for several variables that have been identified as potential plausible moderators.

Social isolation and loneliness are referred to spec ifically in line with availabl e evidence. Given the complexity of the terminology used in relation to social isolation and loneliness, a reminder of key definitions is provided in Box 5-1. BOX 5-1 Key Definitions Loneliness : the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely. Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. MEDIATORS: BEHAVORIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS The mechanisms by which social connec tion\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014affects the development and course of disease have been elucidated by a robust and growing evidence base. Much of this evidence emerged in the context of examining the protective effects of social relationships and social support; however, this work relates specifically to both social isolation and loneliness. Relevant to soci al isolation are the experiment al studies that randomly assign participants to either a social or an alone condition. In animals, this meant studying some animals housed in isolation versus others housed so cially. In humans, many experimental studies examined physiological responses in an individual performing a task (typically stressful) in either the presence of or receiv ing support from someone (e.g., stra nger) and contrasted that with a control condition (e.g., being alone). Later, more nuanced approaches were used to systematically examine aspects of social connecti on. Examples include testing in the presence of a stranger versus a friend (or other relationship types, such as spouses), having a wide social network versus a small network (even if not pr esent), and observing th e effects of perceived availability of social suppor t. Evidence about biological me diators also comes from non- experimental studies. For example, it may not be possible to use random assignments to examine biological responses in everyday li fe or to study clinical populations . Thus, field studies are often employed in which biomar kers are collected. Several reviews and meta-ana lyses link social support to changes in cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune function (Uchino, 2006). Figure 5-2 illustrates different theoretical perspectives of the mechanisms that mediate the relationship between social connection and morbidity and mortality (Berkman et al., 2000; Cohen, 1988; Thoits, 1995; Umberson, 1987). The committee highlights some of these pathways in the following sections. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS 5-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Health-Related Behaviors (Lifestyle) As discussed in Chapter 3, heath-related be haviors can mediate the relationship between social isolation or loneliness and health outco mes. Social isolation and loneliness or the characteristics of one's social networks ma y affect health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity), which in turn can affect h ealth, either positively or negatively. One study of nearly 8,600 older adults found th at \"physical inactivity, daily smoking, and poor sleep mediated the association between loneliness and adverse health c onditions\" (Christianse n et al., 2016). As with other factors, heal th-related behaviors may have a bi-d irectional relationship with social isolation and loneliness in that health-related behaviors can also exacerbate or reduce social isolation and loneliness. For example, househol d-based physical activity is associated with reduced social isolation (Robins et al., 2018). In one study with older adults, participation in the SilverSneakers group exercise program directly decreased social isola tion through membership in the program; that is, the greatest impact cam e from the membership itself in that members were less likely to be socially isolated than nonmembers (Brady et al., 2020). Furthermore, SilverSneakers members had decreased feelings of loneliness associated with their improved overall health. The practice of ta i chi has been associated with reductions in loneliness (Chan et al., 2017; Park and Park, 2010). (See Chapter 9 fo r more on exercise as an intervention.) Participation in an exercise program for health may lead to reductions in social isolation or loneliness due to the social nature of the program rather than the exercise itself. However, there is some evidence that exercise can help to improve sleep patterns and reduce inflammation (Asian Scientist Newsroom, 2014; Kline, 2014 ; Park and Park, 2010; Woods et al., 2012). Sleep While much of the research on health-enha ncing behaviors focuses on smoking, nutrition, and physical activity, a growing body of research poi nts to sleep as vitall y important to health. Sleep influences a variety of physical health co nditions, including cardiovascular disease, weight gain and obesity, diabetes, and me tabolic syndrome, and poor sleep has been associated with an increased mortality risk. Multiple studies have de monstrated a robust association between social support and favorable sleep outcomes, and a lack of social and emotional support significantly predicts insufficient sleep (Kent de Grey et al ., 2018; Williams et al., 2016). Social isolation and loneliness have been identified as key factors that alter the quantity and qu ality of sleep, which in turn influences health and safety at work (M agnavita and Garbarino, 2017). Loneliness has been linked to increased sleep frag mentation and sleep quality, l eading to negative effects on metabolic, neural, and hormonal regulations (C acioppo et al., 2002; Davidson and Rossall, 2015; Hawkley et et al., 2011; Valtorta et al., 2016a). Thus, social isolation and loneliness may influence heal th via poorer sleep, while greater social support may lead to better health via more favorable sleep. Medical Adherence One way in which social relationships infl uence health is thro ugh their influence on adherence to medical advice. Adherence, or cooperati on with medical treatment recommendations, can have a significant impact on medical outcomes; how ever, 25 to 40 percent of individuals are non-complia nt, which leads to poorer he alth outcomes (DiMatteo, 2004; DiMatteo et al., 2000). Support from signifi cant relationships can encourage greater responsiveness to recommendations. A system atic meta-analysis, including 122 empirical Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.5-6 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS studies, examined the effects of structural and functional aspects of soci al connection on medical adherence (DiMatteo, 2004). The study found that most measures of so cial connection were significantly related to medical adherence; how ever, functional measures (e.g., social support) were stronger predictors of adherence than structural measur es (e.g., marital status, living alone). When examining social support specifically, pract ical support more strong ly predicted adherence than did emotional support. Thus, being socially isolated and lacking soci al support significantly reduces medical adherence, which may pa rtially explain poorer health outcomes. Psychological Pathways As noted in Figure 5-2 there are there are several potential psyc hological pathways by which social connections influence morbidity a nd mortality. The following sections provide the evidence for stress and depression being examples of these pathways. Stress Relationships can help indivi duals cope with stress thr ough the presence of other people who can provide advice on how to handle a pr oblem (i.e., informational support), provide assistance or resources to handle the actual situation (e.g., tangible support such as a ride, loan, or meal), help the individual feel better (i.e ., emotional support), or communicate that one is loved or cared for (i.e., belongi ng support). The stress-buffering m odel argues that this social support in turn buffers the pathogenic influence of stress (Cohen and Wills, 1985). A number of studies show that social support attenuates the physiol ogical stress response (Che et al., 2018). Many reviews have looked at the mechanisms by which the stress-buffering effect operates (Brown et al., 2018; Ditzen 2015; Robles and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003). Conversely, not having relationships that one can rely upon (i.e., social isolation) in times of need can be expected to resu lt in poorer physiologica l stress responses. In a systematic review of 11 studies on loneliness, highe r levels of loneliness were as sociated with heightened blood pressure and inflammatory reactivity to stress (B rown et al., 2018). Stress reactivity may be one potential way in which social is olation, loneliness, and social s upport influences biomarkers of health. It is important to not e that the behavioral and ps ychological mechanisms are not independent and may influence the other. For ex ample, stress can negatively influence health behaviors (e.g., Ng and Jeffery, 2003) while he alth behaviors (e.g., exercise) can reduce perceptions of stress (e .g., Rejeski et al., 1992). Anxiety and Depression Additional research points to other psyc hological pathways, including anxiety and depression. Several studies have linked social support to lower ra tes of depression and greater subjective well-being. For example, one study found that that depression in creased as in-person social contact decreased and that individuals with lower rates of in-person social contact had \"a significantly higher probabil ity of clinically significant depre ssive symptoms 2 years later\" (Teo et al., 2015, p. 2). Furthermore, in older adults bo th social isolation a nd loneliness have been show to independently affect th e probability of suffering from depression or anxiety (Dom\u00e8nech- Abella et al., 2019), providing ev idence of the bi-directionality of anxiety and depression with social isolation and loneliness. Thus, social isolation, lone liness, and social support may Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS 5-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS influence health via the impact on these psychological factors which in turn influence biomarkers of health. Biological Mechanisms (Biomarkers) While social connection may influence bi ological mechanisms via behavioral and psychological pathways, there is also evidence of a direct influence (as noted in Figure 5-2). Indeed, much of the evidence es tablishing the overall effect of social connection came from studies that adjusted for re levant lifestyle (e.g., smoking, al cohol, physical activity) and psychological (e.g., depression) factors, indicating that social connection influences mortality independently of such factors. Further evidence documents the direct influence that social connection may have on health-re levant physiological pathways. According to Cole and colleagues (2007), \"a large body of epidemiological research has linked characteristics of the so cial environment to human phys ical health, but the genomic mechanisms of these effects remain largely unexplored\" (p. R189.2). Re search is emerging on how social conditions influen ce gene expression. While most studies of gene expression differences in lonely and socially isolated indi viduals versus socially connected individuals are not focused on older adults, many studies provide in sight as to the role of gene expression in mediating the relationship between social connec tion and health, and the potential to identify biomarkers as targets for intervention (Cole et al., 2007, 2011, 2015a,b; Murray et al., 2019; Slavich and Cole, 2013). Intersecting with gene expression, activity of the central nervous system may also have a role in mediating the e ffects of social isolati on and loneliness on health (Cacioppo et al., 2014; Canli et al., 2018). The following sections summarize the evidence for several biological pathways, including cardi ovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune or inflammatory pathways. Cardiovascular Given the strong links that social isolation and lonelin ess have with risks for cardiovascular disease (see Chap ter 3), it is critically impor tant to understand how social relationships influence the underl ying molecular processes. Recu rring interpersonal experiences and their physiological effects may be an important pathwa y linking social relationships and coronary heart disease. Loneliness and social stre ss have been associated with the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) ax is and the sympathetic nervous system, and \"repeated and chronic social st ress leads to glucocorticoid re sistance, enhanced myelopoiesis, upregulated proinflammatory ge ne expression, and oxidative st ress\" (Xia and Li, 2018, p. 837), although how loneliness-associated cardiovascular disease may de velop as a result of these mechanisms is unclear. Researchers have linked social isolation and l oneliness to elevated vascular resistance and height ened blood pressure (Hawkley et al., 2006, 2010b) and to higher rates of metabolic syndrome (Blanquet et al., 20 16; Whisman, 2010). Meta-analyses indicate that loneliness is associated with atypical physio logical reactivity to acute stress, including exaggerated blood pressure and inflammatory reactiv ity (Brown et al., 2018). Social isolation is associated with a higher resting heart rate, higher systolic blood pressure, and larger total/HDL cholesterol ratio response to stress (Grant et al., 2009; McCrory et al., 2016). Strong evidence also links greater degrees of social support to car diovascular functioning that confers lower risk for disease (Uchino, 2006) . This evidence comes from laboratory-based studies that experimentally ma nipulate social situations, from field studies that monitor Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.5-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS cardiovascular function in daily life, and from longitudinal studi es that examine the long-term effects of social conditions. Lab-based paradigms examine conceptual links between social isolation, loneliness, or social support and the reac tivity hypothesis of di sease (Lepore, 1998)\u2014 that is, that high levels of cardi ovascular reactivity (e.g., blood pre ssure or heart rate) are related to a higher risk for the development and exacerb ation of cardiovascular disease (e.g., Brindle et al., et al., 2010; Gianaros et al., 2007; Smith and Jordan, 2015; Uchino et al., 1996). Several studies have also found that particularly for older adults, social support is associated with lowe r resting blood pressure (Ong and Allaire, 2005; Uchino et al., 1995, 1999). Social support has al so been linked to lower ambulatory blood pressure in everyday life (Gump et al., 2001; Lind en et al., 1993; Spitzer et al., 1992; Steptoe et al., 2000). Finally, higher cumulative social support has been associated with lower odds of high blood pressure (Hernandez et al., 2014). Neuroendocrine The major neuroendocrine systems involved in the stress response are the HPA and the sympathetic adrenomedullary axes. Given that social connections (or the lack thereof) can either blunt or exacerbate stress res ponses, these may be important path ways to consider. For instance, loneliness is associated with increased HPA activ ity, specifically an increase in the level of stress-sensitive glucocorticoids (cortisol in human s). Research has linked the HPA axis with trait loneliness (associated with a flatte ning of the diurnal cortisol curv e), daily loneliness (an cortisol awakening response on the following day), and mo mentary increases in loneliness (momentary cortisol increases in youth w ho also had high interpersonal stress) (Doane and Adam, 2010). Research in animal models that experimentally manipulate social threat and social isolation has demonstrated that social is olation can have a causal eff ect on neuroendocrine functioning (Cacioppo et al., 2015a). And loneline ss in older adults has been a ssociated with lower cortisol output (Schutter et al., 2017). Glucocorticoids regulate physiological functions, including immune, metabolic, cardiovascular, and reproductive functioning, as well as neurodegeneration and apoptosis (Cacioppo et al., 2015a; Xia and Li, 2018). This suggests that the a ssociation between loneliness and health may be mediated in part by the dysre gulation of the neuroend ocrine system (Hackett et al., 2012). Conversely, there is a vast literatu re documenting the buffering effects, or better regulation of the HPA, associated with soci al bonding and social support. Hostinar and colleagues (2014) provide a review of the psychobiological mechanisms underlying social buffering of the HPA. Inflammation Chronic inflammation has been linked to dis eases such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers, and autoimmune disorders, so it is po ssible that there is a common pathway underlying the broad health effects of social connection on multiple disease outcomes. In particular, a meta- analysis of 41 studies (including more than 73,00 0 participants) establis hed the influence of social connectedness (specifica lly, social support and social integration) on inflammation (Uchino et al., 2018), suggesting th at social connectedness may be implicated in inflammatory- related disease development and exacerbation. Ot her research has shown that objective markers of social connection may be just as important as indivi dual perceptions in terms of their effects on these health risks. For example, in one study, ra tings of an individual's social connections as assessed by friends and family were more pred ictive of fibrinogen levels (a biomarker of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS 5-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS inflammation and cardiovascular risk), than that individual's own ratings (Kim, D. et al., 2016). These data suggest that the social connections themselves may have an objective influence on inflammation that is just as important as\u2014i f not more important than\u2014the individual's perceptions. Conversely, a lack of social connections ha s been linked to worse inflammation. Another review finds \"(1) that exposure to social stressors increases pr oinflammatory activity, (2) that individuals who are more socially isolated (i.e., lonely) show in creased proinflammatory activity, and (3) that individuals who are more socially isolated show in creased proinflammatory activity in response to an inflammatory challenge or so cial stressor\" (Eisenberg er et al., 2017, p. 242). In the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) st udy, a positive significant relationship was seen between loneliness and three systemic inflamma tion (Nersesian et al., 2018). This finding is consistent with research that has linked loneliness to stronger inflammatory responses (Cole et al., 2007, 2011; Hackett et al., 2012; Jaremka et al., 2013a; Steptoe et al., 2004). As mentioned earlier, studies of gene expression may provide insight regarding opportunities for intervention. For example, a sma ll randomized controlled trial showed that a mindfulness-based stress reduction program dow nregulated the lone liness-related pro- inflammatory gene expression in older a dults (aged 55-85) (Creswell et al., 2012). Summary of the Evidence for Mediators Social connection has a dose-response eff ect on physiological risk markers across age groups. Yang and colleagues (2016) used data fro m four nationally representative longitudinal samples of the U.S. population to assess \"the pr ospective association of both structural and functional dimensions of social re lationships (social integration, soci al support, and social strain) with objectively measured biomarkers of physic al health (C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index) within each life stage, including adolescence plus young, mi ddle, and late adulthood, and compare such associations across life stages\" (Yang et al., 2016, p. 578). Th ey found that \"a higher degree of social connection was associated with a lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose-response manner in both early and later life\" (Yang et al., 2016, p. 578). Conversely, lower social connection (social isolation) was associated with higher risk. Th is provides strong evidence that social relationships influence health a nd longevity via these risk markers. Growing evidence from both animals and human s suggests that the social environment, particularly social adversity,1 influences the regulation of genes, and it has also been linked to epigenetic changes (Tung and Gilad, 2013). Thus, in addition to the cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune consequences of social relationships, there is now evidence (both correlational and causal) that an individual's social environment pl ays a critical role in regulating a large number of genes, many of wh ich are also associated with su sceptibility to other external stressors and some diseases (Tung and Gilad, 2013). 1 Social adversity includes \"acute or chronic exposures wh ich hypothetically would impact on health mainly by directly threatening salient relationships\" (Gustafsson et al., 2012, p. 119). Examples include parental loss, mother-infant separation, residential instability, social isola tion (Gustafsson et al., 2012; Tung and Gilad, 2013).

All rights reserved.5-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS MODERATING FACTORS INFLUENCI NG MORTALITY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES The effects of social connection on mortality risk are well-established (see Chapter 2), as is the evidence of plausible biological mechanisms that explain these effect s, which has led to a growing interest in factors that may influence the strength or direc tion of these effects. Examining such moderators helps determine whether some groups may be more affected by social isolation and loneliness than ot hers. The previous section summarized how social connection influences health, but the data suggest that biological systems are also influenced by early experiences, developmental f actors, and genetics, which can moderate this effect (Ditzen and Heinrichs, 2014; Hennessy et al., 2009; Uc hino, 2009a,b). While there may be several other potential moderators, this section specifically considers factors relevant to the committee's statement of task, such as age, gender, ethnic ity, and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, the evidence concerning relationship quality as a m oderator of the association between social connection and health outcomes is described. Age and Developmental Processes Naturally, the risk of mortality increases with increasing age. The question arises, however, of whether the effects on mortality of social isolation, l oneliness, or social support also increase with age. The meta-analysis by Holt- Lunstad and colleagues (2010) summarized in Chapter 2 synthesized data acro ss 148 prospective studies and f ound no effect of age, suggesting no difference in the overall effect of various indicators of soci al connection on mortality risk. However, the majority of these studies used olde r samples. In a subsequent meta-analysis which focused specifically on the effects of social is olation, loneliness, and living alone on mortality risk, the authors compared the effects among in dividuals above 65 years old with the effects among younger individuals and found that the mo rtality risk for those under 65 was more affected by the social factors th an the mortality risk for those over 65 (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). Additional prospective studies have examined the effects of age more directly. For example, a recent study examining social isolation acro ss young, middle-aged, and older adults found a dose-response effect on a variety of health outcomes (H\u00e4mmig, 2019). Early life experiences may also influence one's risk trajectory late r in life. For example, several studies now demonstrate that adverse childhood experiences have lasting negative conse quences (Caspi et al., 2006; Danese et al., 2009; Lacey et al., 2014). Therefore, while the da ta in this area is not robust, newer evidence seems to suggest that age may moderate the impact of social isolation and loneliness on mortality risk, with greater risk seen among younger ages. Demographic Factors Demographic characteristics in cluding gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and ethnicity all may influence the relationship between social connections and health outcomes. Gender Examining the larger literature via available meta-analytic data indicates that the protective effect of social relati onships and the risks associated w ith social isolation broadly and with loneliness and living alone specifically we re similar for men and women (Holt-Lunstad et Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS 5-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS al., 2010, 2015). Despite prior resear ch suggesting that women have larger social networks than men (Antonuci and Akiyama, 1987; Matud, 2004), ge nder is not a signifi cant moderator of the relationship between social suppo rt and mortality. Similarly, wh en looking just at loneliness across studies of the risk for all-cause mortality , no significant differences were found by gender, though the strength of the association was slightly higher in men than in women (Rico-Uribe et al., 2018). These data suggest that the effect of relationships on mortality from all causes is consistent for both men and women. These result s are consistent with work looking at gender differences in the prevalence of loneliness. A meta-analysis by Maes and colleauges (2019) covering nearly 400,000 individuals synthesized the available evid ence on gender differences in loneliness across the lifespan and demonstrated nearly a zero overall effect; furthermore, any effect of age was negligible. Thus levels of loneliness are similar for males and females across the lifespan. Socioeconomic Status (SES) Given the research suggesting that SES ma y significantly influence health outcomes, many epidemiological studies statistically cont rol for SES, making it difficult to determine whether the impact of social isolation and loneliness on health and mortality may depend on SES. There is some evidence to suggest that the prevalence of loneliness may differ by SES. For example, one study found that among the (e conomically) poorest people, older adults were less likely to be lonely than those in the younger groups, while among the richest there was no difference in loneliness by age (Dom\u00e8n ech-Abella et al., 2017). Cundiff and Smith (2017) found the colle ctive effect of recurrent and ch ronic exposures to a variety of stressful interpersonal experien ces (e.g., reduced support, work stress, negative stereotypes) may help explain the increased prevalence of chronic psychosocial vulnerabilities among individuals in lower socioeconomic envir onments, and further link those psychosocial vulnerabilities to the transien t physiological mechanisms (i.e., stress responses) that directly affect coronary heart disease. Nonetheless, th e evidence base is not robust, and more large- scale research is needed to further elucid ate the potential moderating effects of SES. Race and Ethnicity The majority of epidemiological studies do not report effect sizes fo r social isolation, loneliness, social support, or other aspects of social connection that are broken down by race or ethnicity. Therefore, researchers have not been able to adequate ly examine this factor meta- analytically. Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of loneliness may differ by ethnicity (Jamieson et al., 2018); however, most of these st udies did not examine th e moderating effect of ethnicity on health or mortality. Nonetheless, some studies provide some illuminating evidence. For example, one study found that, contrary to exp ectations, social isolation in older black men did not significantly predict metabolic disord ers (Das, 2013). In another study both loneliness and social disconnectedness had a significant ne gative association with physical and mental health among white older adults; however, am ong African American older adults social disconnectedness was associated with worse physical health and loneliness was associated with worse mental health (Miyawaki, 2015). One of the strongest studies to da te was a 10-year U.S. population-based prospective study that examined ethnic and racial variation in social Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.5-12 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS integration2 and its effect on mortality among participan ts of the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (Barger and Uchino, 2017). This study found no significant effect of received social support on mortality among any of th e groups (i.e., white, black, Hispan ic), but social integration demonstrated a significant effect on survival among all three groups. Consistent with other research, there was a dose-response effect amon g whites, but the gradient was flatter among blacks, and a survival advantage was found only at the highest levels of social integration. Among Hispanics the survival advantage was presen t at all but the lowest levels. Thus, \"extreme group contrasts (i.e., contrasting the highest and lowest social integration categories) also obscures different forms of the mortality gradie nt for black, white and Hispanic participants\" (Barger and Uchino, 2017, p. 4). Relationship Quality While the absence of others (i.e., social isolati on) is detrimental to he alth, the presence of others may not necessarily be entirely positive or protective. While social relationships can be characterized by a myriad of positive attributes (e.g., intimacy, companionship, nurturance, joy and compassion), some relationships are charac terized by negative attributes (e.g., conflict, insensitivity, jealousy, burden, rejection, neglect, or even ab use) (Rook and Charles, 2017). These attributes may influence the magnitude and direction of the associations between relationships and health. Multiple studies have dem onstrated that negativity in social relationship predicts greater risk for mortal ity (Birditt and Antonucci, 2008; Friedman et al., 1995; Tanne et al., 2004; Tucker et al., 1996). For example, in a study of breast-cancer patients by Kroenke and colleagues (2013), women with sma ll social networks and low leve ls of social support and small networks had a significantly higher risk of mort ality (Kroenke et al., 2013). Additionally, \"larger social networks predicted better prognosis after breast cancer, but associations depended on the quality and burden of family relationships\" (K roenke et al., 2013, p. 261). Similarly, poor-quality relationships and relationship strain were found to more than double the risk of depression 10 years later (Teo et al., 2013b). Thus, in medical se ttings if relationship qu ality is ignored it may lead to higher risk rather than lower risk. Indeed, a broad literature documents the pr otective effects of ma rriage in terms of reducing risk for mortality (Manzoli et al., 2007; Rendall et al., 2011) and loneliness (Cohen- Mansfield et al., 2016); however, not all marriages are high quality, and there is evidence that marital quality is an important moderator. For example, a meta-analytic review of 126 studies found that marital quality was inve rsely associated with a variety of health outcomes, including mortality risk (Robles et al., 2014). Similarly, distressed marriages have been associated with poorer immune outcomes (Price et al., 2018) and greater morbidity and mortality risk (Choi and Marks, 2011; Kimmel et al., 2000; King and Re is, 2012; Robles and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003; Robles et al., 2014). Thus, when assessing for soci al isolation or lonelin ess practitioners should not assume a lack of risk based on marital status alone. Studies done in clinical setti ngs offer evidence that relationship quality can significantly influence treatment adherence. A meta-analysi s by DiMatteo (2004) found that adherence to medical regimens was lower in patients from families in conflict and higher in patients from cohesive families. Furthermore, the social conflict that arises as a result of a well-intended efforts to encourage medication adherenc e (that may be interpreted as nagging or attempts to exert 2 Low social integration scores are a marker of social isolation. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS 5-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS control), has been shown to re duce (rather than increase) medi cation adherence (Warner et al., 2013). However, another study among people with a chronic illness showed that negative social relations at baseline were asso ciated with decreased risk for mortality (Birditt and Antonucci, 2008), and the authors suggested that this may be due to the buffering effect of social control. Thus, it cannot be assumed that medical adherence will be always be enhanced by increasing family or staff involvement. There is substantial evidence that the quality of relationships also influences biomarkers of health. For example, studies examining the influences of cardiova scular functioning have found that positivity in social relationships (e .g., support, satisfaction) is associated with protective effects, while negativ ity (e.g., strain, conflic t) and ambivalence in relationships are associated with deleterious cardiovascular functioning (e .g., elevated blood pressure, cardiovascular reactivity) (B irmingham and Holt-Lunstad, 2018; Holt-Lunstad 2014). Similarly, poor quality relati onships more than doubled the risk of depression 10 years later (Teo et al., 2013b). FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Mediators Strong evidence links loneliness, social is olation, and social support to changes in cardiovascular, neuroendocri ne, and immune function as we ll as to the physiological stress response. A lack of social connec tions has been linked to higher levels of inflammation, which may point to a pl ausible biological mechanism for the association of social isol ation and loneliness with a variety of negative health outcomes. Social isolation and loneline ss have been linked to decreas ed quality of sleep, which itself can influence a variety of physical health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, weight gain and obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and increased risk for mortality. Moderators There is some evidence that demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, SES) moderate the influence of social connecti on and health. Recent evidence suggests that social isolation and loneliness may carry a higher risk among those under age 65 relative to those over age 65. No relia ble gender differences have emerged. Both the positive and negative attributes of relationships can significantly influence the magnitude and direction of the associati on between these relationships and health. Higher quality and more numerous relationships is associated with protective health effects and a lower risk of mortality. Having poorer quality and fewer relationships is associated with harmful effects on health including higher risk for morbidity and mortality, poorer treatment adherence, and poorer health-relevant biological responses. Understanding both the negative and the positive attributes of social relationships is needed to fully understand how thes e relationships impact health. Decreasing social isolation may not reduce risk if attention is not paid to the quality of the relationships; thus, indicators of quality need to be included in assessments.

Research using these tools has focused on defining th e prevalence, the risk factors, and the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness. More recently, there has been a focus on using these tools to assess the effectivene ss of interventions by using measures of social isolation and loneliness as outcomes. (See Chapte r 9 for more on interventions.) This chapter will examine the use of different tools related to social isolation and loneliness primarily in the research setting, and it will e xplore research on the use of in formation technology to identify individuals at risk for social isolation and lone liness. Chapter 7 will discuss the application of these tools in clinical settings. Given the complexity of the termi nology used in relation to social isolation and loneliness, a reminder of ke y definitions is provided in Box 6-1. BOX 6-1 Key Definitions Loneliness : the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely. Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS The concepts of social isolation and loneline ss have been defined in different ways (see Chapters 1 and 2), which has led to some variab ility in how these concepts are measured. When Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.6-2 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS examining social isolation and l oneliness in research, a number of tools capture elements of both social isolation and loneliness, which may obscure differences between these two concepts. In addition, in both research and clin ical settings social isolation and loneliness may fluctuate over time. This underscores the need for serial testing to better ascertain changes over time, including the trajectories of these changes and their clinic al relevance. However, measures that encompass elements of both social isolation and loneline ss or, more broadly, soci al connection could be advantageous in clinical settings as they may probe both concepts, which would be more efficient, and they could possibly provide a stronger clinical signal. Because of the variability in existing measurement tools for social isolati on and loneliness, Valtorta and colleagues (2016b) suggested that these tools can be classified al ong two dimensions: whether the measure looks at the structural or the functional aspects of social relationships and the degree of subjectivity required by respondents (see Figure 6-1). The researchers examin ed 54 measurement instruments and found that \"tools explicitly designed for m easuring loneliness ... tend to be based on more subjective questions, whereas soci al network indices primarily us e more objective measures\" (p. 6). It is well accepted that the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (described later in this chapter) captures loneliness\u2014a subj ective self-reported measure. In contrast, the Duke Social Support Index (also described later in this chapte r), while classically thou ght to measure social isolation, does include some subjective questions . Therefore, if a study uses the Duke Social Support Index and says it measures social isolation and not lone liness, the study may incorrectly conclude that it is only social isol ation that has an effect or that is being affected. The differences in measurement and how studies report outcome s as being either related to loneliness or social isolation may present challenges when compari ng studies and even in meta-analyses if the studies are grouped according to how authors define social isolation and loneliness rather than according to the measurement tools used. Some of this variability in measurement likely accounts for the range of prevalen ce rates and inconsistencies in study conclusions. This creates a landscape in which the effects of social isolation and loneline ss on health are demonstrated, but it is not always clear as to which has a greater influence. Because of th is, when evaluating the literature it is imperative to examine how social isolation and loneline ss are being defined and measured. The following sections provide a list of and brief explanations for some of the most widely used measurement tools for social is olation and loneliness. The committee emphasizes that this is not a comprehensiv e list of all avai lable tools and does not represent an endorsement of this committee but rather serves to demonstrat e the range of tools bein g used. Ultimately, one size does not fit all. For any give n intervention, the tool picked s hould be tailored to assess what change in social isolation or loneliness is expected to be a ffected, over what time period, and whether the effect is sustained. Unless th ere is compelling evidence to suggest a new measurement tool, researchers and program evalua tors should try to us e existing and validated tools (see Recommendation 7-1 in Chapter 7). Ho wever, questions remain as to how existing tools can be used in clinical setti ngs (for more on this, see Chapter 7).

This measure was recommended for inclusion in electronic health reco rds as a measure of soci al isolation by a prior Institute of Medicine committee (IOM, 2014). (S ee Chapter 7 for more on electronic health records.) The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale The Revised UCLA (R-UCLA) Loneliness Scale is a 20-item, self-administered questionnaire that has become a standard meas urement of subjective lo neliness (Russell, 1996). The Three-Item UCLA L oneliness Scale was developed for us e in telephone surveys in which questions are posed to the pers on being assessed (Hughes et al., 2004) (see Box 6-3). The three- item scale is being used widely in both research and clinical settings in the United States as a brief assessment of loneliness.

The index involves a fi ve-point scale, with one point being assigned for each of the following factors: Unmarried/not cohabiting Less than monthly contact (including face-to -face, by telephone, or in writing/email) with children Less than monthly contact (including face-to -face, by telephone, or in writing/email) with other family Less than monthly contact (including face-to -face, by telephone, or in writing/email) with friends No participation in social clubs, reside nt groups, religious groups, or committees People with a score of 2 or more were defined as being socially isolated. Duke Social Support Index The Duke Social Support Inde x is a 35-item measure of va rious dimensions of social support, including social network (e.g., proximity of family), so cial interaction (e.g., frequency of interactions), subjective s upport (e.g., perceptions of relations hips), and instrumental support (e.g., availability of help) (Koeni g et al., 1993). However, the inte rview required for this measure is lengthy. As a result, two abbr eviated versions of the tool ha ve been developed: an 11-item scale which includes subscales fo r social interaction and subjec tive support and a 23-item scale which adds a subscale for instrume ntal support (Koenig et al., 1993). Lubben Social Network Scale The Lubben Social Network Scale is an adaptation of the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index developed to focus specifically on older adults (Lubben, 1988). At that time, Lubben found that marital status and participation in religious activities va ry less in the older adult population. Therefore, this 10-item measure focuses mo re heavily on the quality and frequency of an individual's re lationships with family and friends. Lubben and colleagues have published revised versions of the Lubben Social Network Scale including an abbreviated six- item version (Lubben and Gironda , 2003; Lubben et al., 2006). The de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale The de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale is an 11-item questionnaire designed to assess both overall loneliness and two specific types of loneliness (de Jong Gierveld and Kamphuis, 1985) (see Table 6-1). This scale includes two subscales: a th ree-item emotional loneliness subscale (aimed at loneliness due to the lack of a close, intimat e relationship) and a three-item social loneliness subscale (aimed at loneliness du e to the lack of a broa der social network) (de Jong Gierveld and Van Tilburg, 2006). As with th e R-UCLA Loneliness Scal e, the length of this instrument can be challenging to use in large su rveys. As a result, a shortened six-item scale comprised of two of the 3-item subscales within the original 11-item questionnaire has been used (de Jong Gierveld and Van Tilburg, 2006; Weiss, 1974) (see Table 6-1).Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The first six items came from asking individuals the following que stions: \"How often can you open up to your family if you need to talk about your worries?\" a nd \"How often can you rely on them for help if you have a problem?\" (Cornwell and Waite, 2009). These same questions were then asked again in relation to their friends and th en in relation to thei r spouse or partner. Th e last 3 items come from the Three-Item UCLA Loneliness Scale (des cribed above). For this scale, the authors standardized each item and averaged scores, wi th a higher score indicating greater perceived isolation.

MEASURING IMPACT FOR SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS The committee's review of the literature on social isolation and loneliness revealed a number of measurement and interpretation ch allenges pertaining to prevalence rates and outcomes that need to be addressed. These chal lenges are summarized in the following sections. Measuring the Prevalence of Social Isolation and Loneliness The committee emphasizes the importance of using validated tools in the assessment of social isolation and loneliness (r ather than using only parts of existing tools or creating new, unvalidated tools). Validation means that the tool has been shown to accura tely reflect the level of social isolation or loneline ss (and is not biased). When st udying the prevalence of loneliness or isolation, it is most importa nt to choose a measurement tool that matches the research question. For example, if one is looking to es tablish the prevalence of loneliness in a given population, it is necessary to pick a measurement tool that is validated to measure loneliness rather than other aspects of soci al connection. (See Chapter 7 furt her discusses the importance of using validated tools in clinical settings.) Given the confusion surrounding the definitions of social isolation and loneliness, using a validated tool for the specific c onstruct being evaluated is of the utmost importance. Employing an unvalidated tool or, as mentioned previousl y, a tool that was desi gned to assess social isolation for a study that is ac tually examining loneliness, ma y yield inaccurate results.

Although numerous measurement tools are available, in those cases where a researcher seeks to compare the impacts of different interv entions, it is be important to use the same measurement tool for the different interventions being compared. In observational or longitudina l studies, it is critical to use a common, standardized assessment at all time points during the study du ration. The length of follow-up and frequency of measurement are particularly important for a few reasons. For example, because social isolation and loneliness may be episodic for some, it is important to have several time periods of measurement in order to determine if observed di fferences are true reflections of changes in outcomes or if they represent measurement variabili ty or natural fluctuati ons over time. There is no set standard for the number of time points or numbers of assessments per unit time used to determine social isolation and loneliness. As a general principle, having more than two data points (the beginning and the end of the study) can he lp to reliably measure trajectories of social isolation and loneliness. Because of the large health effects of soci al isolation and loneliness (see Chapters 2 and 3), studies with longer follow-up periods that can demons trate sustained effects during an intervention (and even months after an intervention) will be more useful. (See Chapter 9 for more on interventions.) Overall Measure Quality As is discussed in more detail in Chapte r 7, concerns exist regarding the quality and relevance of current tools, and particularly as to whether the tools developed decades ago can fully capture the expectations and values of older adults today. This is li kely to be especially relevant for measures of social isolation as m odes of interaction have changed significantly in recent years and decades. For example, questions a bout living alone or participation in religious activities may not fully reflect preferences in today's society. Also, alternative modes of communication to the \"telephone\" (e.g., social media, instant messaging, video conferencing) may not be fully captured in these measures. On the other hand, measures of loneliness may not be influenced by social changes since responses are s ubjective to the curre nt context. While current tools may have limitations, the committee asserts that the use of existing validated tools is important to advance the role of the health care system in addressing social isolation and loneliness (see Chapter 7). Furthermore, research ers need to strive towards a goal of measure development and evaluation in this space to ensure that the available tools for social isolation and loneliness can fully capture the experience of today's older adults. IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL S AND POPULATIONS AT RISK In addition to the measures described above, information technology offers the possibility of detecting or predicting pattern s of social isolation and loneline ss in older adults. This can be done without using specific tools or measurement scales. For inst ance, data mining can be used to assess or predict patterns of social isolation and loneliness (Austin et al., 2016); to this end various sources of data have been explored, in cluding passive monitoring sensors, wearables, Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ASSESSMENT OF SOCIAL ISOLATIO N AND LONELINESS IN RESEARCH 6-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS and programs to track social media. However, the development of algorithms to accurately predict social isolation or loneliness has proved challenging because of th e lack of a specific outcome measure that is available at a large scale in electronic h ealth records or other sources of data (e.g., hospital readmission or death). One benef it may be that for both research and clinical settings this could reduce the burden on individuals, providers, and researchers in terms of the time needed to answer certain questionnaires. Prediction Multiple approaches exist for identifying individuals at risk for social isolation or loneliness, including self-referral, community re ferral, formal assessments, and predictive analytics. In health care, pred ictive analytics have been widely used to enable better decision making and to support preventive care (Wang et al., 2018). For example, one hospital system used predictive analytics on da ta from medical sensors to pr edict patients' movements and monitor their actions throughout their hospital st ay, allowing the health system to provide services more efficiently, optimize operations, an d reduce medical risk (W ang et al., 2018). The section on predictive anal ytics in Chapter 7 describes opportun ities for health care systems to develop predictive strategies ba sed on the vast datasets within health information systems. Identifying Social Isolation and Lo neliness at the Individual Level In clinical research, machine learning1 technologies have been used to analyze social media data to predict depressi on (Eichstaedt et al., 2018), suicid ality (Braithwaite et al., 2016), and posttraumatic stress disorder (Coppersmith et al., 2014). Natural lang uage processing (NLP)2 technologies and machine learning are also bei ng used to examine electronic health record (EHR) data to identify individuals at risk for a variety of behavioral issu es, including suicidality (Walsh et al., 2018). Given the lack of sta ndardization for assessing social isolation and loneliness in clinical documenta tion, researchers have used NLP t echniques to identify mentions of social isolation in clinical notes. In one study, investigators us ed validated scales and expert opinion to develop a lexicon representing concepts related to social is olation (Zhu et al., 2019). Among the terms in the algorithm were \"lack comp anionship,\" \"isolated,\" and \"feel left out.\" The algorithm was tested in a dataset of clinical notes from 1,057 prosta te cancer patients, and the performance was evaluated us ing chart review as a gold st andard. The algorithm correctly identified 36 cases of social is olation, and an additional four ca ses were determined to be false positives. Reviewers found one false negative in a sa mpling of the algorithm's negative cases. In another study, NLP was used to analyze transc ripts of psychotherapy sessions to identify symptom and diagnostic information using not on ly language but also in teractional variables such as turn-taking in the conversation betw een provider and patient (Gaut et al., 2017). Some health care organizations use fields in the EHR to document \"living alone\" as a proxy for social isolation. Given the many life ci rcumstances implied by living alone (e.g., being independent), these data alone are of little us e in identifying patients at risk for negative 1 Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, refe rs to the \"algorithms, tools, and techniques that give computers the ability to learn from experience and data\" (CTA, 2018). 2 Natural language processing is \"tech nology that produces conversational text or speech un derstandable by humans\" (CTA, 2018).

(See Chapter 7 for more on the use of information technol ogy in clinical settings.) Population-Level Identification and Targeting In general, technologies that analyze large public and private datasets are being used both in and out of clinical settings to identify target groups of i ndividuals according to behavioral characteristics, which has raised various ethi cal and social concerns (Eubanks, 2018; Zuboff, 2019). For example, in industry, video games a nd other web-based mobile interventions are designed for targeted appeal and subsequent loyalty. However, ther e is a dearth of research on how individuals experiencing soci al isolation and loneliness ar e targeted by such industry interventions. That is, the outco me of the product design could encourage increased use of their products, leading to increased so cial isolation or loneliness. Key ethical issues related to the use of larg e datasets to predict social isolation and loneliness include the violation of privacy and the creation of new, harmful stereotypes, though various other ethical concerns may also arise, depending on the way in which identification is conducted and used for targeting. Implications and Ethical Concerns While the use of data to identify, predict, and potentially mitigate social isolation and loneliness is considered promis ing by many, some concerns exist about the ways in which data might be used and the ways in which assessment may be ethically problematic. This section will consider various ethical issues concerning the measurement and monitoring of social isolation and loneliness. The ethical considerations descri bed here pertain not only to research studies examining social isolation and l oneliness but also to clinical pr actice and the implementation of interventions or strategies by health care orga nizations. This list is not comprehensive, and serious thought should be given to other potential ethical concer ns that may arise due to the nature of a specific assessment tool or monitoring program. Informed Consent Informed consent is a requisite for all clinic al care, beginning with the assessment of the problem and continuing through a ny provided treatment or interv ention (whether social or medical in nature). Adequate informed consent entails ensuring that a patient understands the facts of the medical issue at ha nd, the implications of choosing to treat or forgo treatment, and the potential risks and benefits of the assessment or treatment. Informed consent enables older adults to weigh the pros and cons of an in tervention. Informed consent is ongoing and provides an opportunity for older adults to have a dialogue with their practitioners about the course of their treatment (Price et al., 2012; Reid et al., 2018). Individuals are c onsidered capable of providing consent only if they ha ve adequate reasoning faculties and are in possession of all the relevant facts. It is possible that older adults with cognitive limitations such as dementia or memory loss may not be able to give informed co nsent, and in this case individuals with proxy status or legally authorized representatives (suc h as family members or spouses) may be asked to provide consent. In situations where a person is not fully able to make a decision but still not quite at the surrogate decision- making stage, a joint decision- making model can be invoked in which trusted family members or legally authorized representatives or both assist the older adult with the decision-making process, taking into co nsideration the person's past and present wishes Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ASSESSMENT OF SOCIAL ISOLATIO N AND LONELINESS 2009 ). It is important to note, however, that for assessments in health care settings (e.g., questions about smoking and other health care risks), while patients have the option to not answ er questions, clinicians would rarely provide informed consent for each question asked. Autonomy In addition to issues of informed consent, a va riety of bioethical prin ciples relevant to the use of data for the assessment of social isolat ion or loneliness also n eed to be considered. Broadly speaking, the concept of autonomy stipulat es that individuals have the right to make their own decisions about what en tails \"living a good lif e.\" In medicine specifically, patients are understood to have the right to make decisions re garding what medical care or procedures they accept and the circumstances surrounding that care. Importantly, autonomous decision making is free of outside coercion. In orde r for a patient to make an aut onomous decision, he or she must understand the potential risks and benefits of a given procedure and the likelihood of the procedure's success. Notably, it is possible fo r individuals to lose the ability to make autonomous decisions if they are suffering from me ntal or cognitive deficits and are unable to fully grasp the implications of a medical procedure or treatment. Regarding social isolation and loneliness, as social relations hips typically fall outside of the realm of medical care, some individuals ma y object to the health care system assessing\u2014or \"judging\"\u2014their relative levels of social isolation or l oneliness. For example, respecting an older adult's autonomy may mean respecting a person's choice to live alone or to be alone. In these situations, periodic assessment and monitoring of older adults' social isolation and loneliness may be the approach that is requ ired to respect their living prefer ences. (See more in Chapter 7.) Privacy With the increasing digitalization of inform ation and health records, concerns about medical privacy have become more widesprea d. Respecting individual pr ivacy entails ensuring that health information is captured and stored in a protected way and that protected health information is not shared without an individual's specific approval. The Privacy Rule, part of the U.S. federal law known as the Health Insuranc e Portability and Acc ountability Act (HIPAA), gives individuals rights over thei r own protected health informa tion and sets rules and limits on who can access and share or receive that information when it is documented in electronic format. Health care staff are required to comply with such regulations when sharing any information in the health record, including any assessment inform ation on social isolation and loneliness. It is also important that older adults be given the opportunity to designate how and with whom their health information should be shared. Once an understanding is reached about information sharing, the necessary permissions and releases should be documented. A periodic review of these sharing preferences should occur and any changes be noted formally. Individuals experiencing isol ation or loneliness may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable acknowledging their isolation to ot hers, and it is possible that individuals might experience stigma after being labeled as \"lonely\" by a health care provider. Because of this potential harm from stigma, it is extremely important that info rmation about isolation captured in the health record be treated as protecte d health information. An olde r adult should be provided the opportunity to determine how and with whom a ssessment information on social isolation and loneliness is shared.

All rights reserved.6-12 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS access to this information will help ensure that in formation is shared within the parameters set by the older adult. Additionally, the way in which pa tients' data is used in research also falls under HIPAA and other related human-subjects research protections. Beneficence and Non-Maleficence The principles of beneficence and non-ma leficence are related, t hough they are not the same. Beneficence requires that medical procedur es be provided with the intent of doing good for the patient and serving in the patient's best in terest, and it demands that health care providers continuously maintain their own skills and knowledge in order to provide the best treatment for their patients. Non-maleficence refers to making su re that medical procedures and treatments do not harm patients nor others in society (Beau champ and Childress, 2013). Both are core moral principles which are incorporated into health pr ofessions' codes of conduct. When applied in the area of social isolation and loneliness, these pr inciples require knowledge of the adverse risks and benefits associated with the intervention unde r consideration and with alternative courses of action as well as the risks and be nefits of not intervening at all (Bantry-White, 2018; Beauchamp and Childress, 2013; Reid et al., 2018). Additionally, concerns about the exploitation of individuals suffering from isolation or loneliness must be taken into account when considering possible assessment tools or interventions. It is possible, for instance, that in dividuals who are isolated are more susceptible to exploitation or abuse (either physic al, emotional, or financial). It is also possible that certain technologies might exploit lonely or isolated elders, such as ro bo-calls, phishing emails, or other financial scams. And it is possibl e that technologies used to id entify individuals at risk of isolation or loneliness could be exploited for commercial marketing and monetary gain. Populations at Risk Certain populations, such as low-inco me, minority, and LGBT elders, may be disproportionately affected by the so cial determinants of health. It is critical to have assessment tools for isolation and loneliness that do not further exacerbate inequalities between minority or at-risk groups and the general population. One way to ensure ethical assessment is to implement assessments across entire practi ce populations, rather than targ eting specific subgroups. Focusing on groups of a particular social st atus may have negative implications for trust in the health care system and could very well be unethical in certain circumstances. In addition, assessing populations more broadly allows fo r a focus on primary prevention. As mentioned in the above section on priv acy, assessment might involve stigmatizing the conditions of isolation and lone liness, which is an undesirable outcome for various reasons: individuals may avoid seeking help for social isolation or lonelin ess if they are embarrassed or ashamed, leading to negative health consequenc es, and the implementa tion of assessment for social isolation or loneliness mi ght itself bring about the creation of new, harmful stereotypes. For example, public health campaigns have b een successful in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the American population. However, mu ch of this success has to do with shaming individuals who smoke cigarettes. Shaming individuals for health i ssues that may be out of their control (like isolation and loneline ss) could be extremely harmful.

All rights reserved.ASSESSMENT OF SOCIAL ISOLATIO N AND LONELINESS IN RESEARCH 6-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS The concepts of social isolation and lonelin ess have been defined in different ways, which has led to variability in how these concepts are measured. Picking assessment tools that match the rese arch question or inte rvention is critical. The length of time for follow-up in an in tervention is an important part of determining the clinical utility of an outcome. The use of standardized and validated m easurement tools will help build a more robust evidence base where results are comparable to other studies. Measures developed decades ago may not a ppropriately account for newer modes of interaction and communica tion (e.g., social media, instant messaging, video conferencing). More effort is needed to update existi ng measures as well as to develop better instruments for assessing social isolation and loneliness that can fully capture the experience of today's older adults. Technological advances such as machine le arning, electronic health records, and predictive analytics show promise as potential ways to identify social isolation and loneliness. A variety of ethical concerns are associ ated with measuring and assessing an individual's levels of isol ation and loneliness. As furt her work is done to identify individuals at risk of isolat ion or loneliness and to identify promising treatments for these conditions, serious cons ideration should be given to ethical issues that might arise from the use of a specific assessme nt tool or intervention technique.

All rights reserved.PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-1 7 Role of the Health Care System As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, the heal th consequences of social isolation and loneliness are significant across the age spectru m and worsen as people age. Specifically, as discussed in Chapter 2, data from 148 studies with more than 300,000 participants showed that being socially connected was associated with 50 percent increased odds of survival (Holt- Lunstad et al., 2010) Additionally, as discussed in Chapter 3, a meta-analysis of 23 studies using 16 longitudinal datasets found that poor social relati onships (e.g., social is olation, loneliness) increased the risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke, independently of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (Valtorta et al., 2016a). Gi ven the significan t evidence for the negative impacts of social isolat ion and loneliness on the health of older adults, this chapter explores the role of the health care delivery syst em in identifying and addr essing social isolation and loneliness. Recognition of the role of the health care system in addressing social isolation and loneliness is not new. In 1985 Jone s et al. drew attenti on to the role of phy sicians in addressing loneliness, noting: General practitioners have unique opport unities to reduce the suffering caused by loneliness. The lonely elderly consult their doctors more often (because of their higher degree of physical disability), and so gene ral practitioners are the professional group most likely to come into contact with the l onely person. By listening to lonely patients and gaining their confidence, the doctor can re fer them to appropriate bodies such as the social services, voluntary organizations, neighbourhood schemes and local churches. (Jones et al., 1985, p. 139) In 2018, Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of th e Royal College of Ge neral Practitioners in the United Kingdom, expressed the following to this committee: I know as a clinician an d as a physician that I cannot solv e the problems of my patients' lives with respect to their social challenges, but if I identify them, if I recognize that those problems are impacting adversely on health, then it is my responsibility to call that out, to signpost people to help.

BOX 7-1 Key Definitions Loneliness : the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely. Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION Older adults are particularly high-volume and high-frequency users of the health care system, especially as compared with younger groups. The 2008 report Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce found that adults over age 65 use a disproportionate number of hea lth care services, stating Although older adults make up only about 12 percent of the U.S. population, they account for approximately 26 percent of all physician office visits, 47 percent of all hospital outpatient visits with nurse practitioners, 35 percen t of all hospital stays, 34 percent of all prescr iptions, 38 percent of all emergenc y medical service responses, and 90 percent of all nursing-home use. (IOM, 2008, pp. 3-4) Research on the impact of social isolati on and loneliness on health care utilization and access is limited, and it has had mixed results. While the available research indicates that social isolation and loneliness among adults lead to a heightened focus on utilization, few studies have examined access issues for older adults who are is olated or lonely. Extensive research has been conducted in countries outside the United States, includi ng the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. These studies can be used as a foundation to inform what we know about how social isolation and l oneliness affect access and utiliza tion. However, the U.S. health care delivery system is very different from those of other countries, so it is necessary to conduct research within the United States in order to elucidate issues of particular concern to the U.S. health care system. As noted previously in this report, the existing evidence base shows that a variety of indicators are used to evaluate social isolat ion and loneliness, incl uding the strength of an individual's relationships and social a person's living arra ngements, and a person's psychosocial functioning. Similarly, health care utilization is of ten determined differently in different studies, with readmission rates, length of hospital stay, number of hospitalizations, the use of outpatient services, and primary care visits being examined in various studies.

All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Furthermore, some types of increases in uti lization are desirable (e .g., preventive care) while other types of increases in utilization (e.g., hospital read missions) are not desirable. Evidence of Increased Utilization Social relationships are one of many factors that affect h ealth care utilization. Social isolation and loneliness have been found to be as sociated with an increased rate of hospital readmissions, perhaps as a result of the indi vidual having a smaller so cial support network to contact when health care issues emerge (H awker and Romero-Ortuno, 2016; Valtorta et al., 2018b). A similar finding was noted in a study of older American veterans enrolled in a psychogeriatric program (Mistry et al., 2001). However, other evidence suggests a higher number of previous hospitaliza tions among those with larger fa mily networks (Ha et al., 2019). Social isolation and loneliness ha ve also been associated with increased hospitalizations among older adults and older ve terans (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana al. , 2011), and social isolation has been linke d to an increase in Medicare spending, primarily on costs associated with inpatient care and skilled nursi ng facility care (Flowers et al., 2017; Shaw et al., 2017). However, these sp ending patterns changed when adjusted for socioeconomic and health status. Despite the in creased use of health care, these individuals experiencing social isolation and loneliness ar e more vulnerable to adverse outcomes and are a greater risk of death (Shaw et al., 2017). Older adults who have been iden tified as being at risk for so cial isolation and loneliness experience longer length of stays when hos pitalized (Hawker and Romero-Ortuno, 2016; Mitchinson et al., 2008; Valtorta et al., 2018b), which may be due to having smaller social networks and less social support to provide pos t-hospitalization care (Mit chinson et al., 2008; Valtorta et al., 2018b). Chronic lone liness is also positively associ ated with increased physician visits, with the physician-patie nt relationship providing both social support and medical treatment (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015). In behavioral health settings, adults (not limited to older adults) living with family make greater use of rehabilitative and social care services, including day care, rehabi litation, socialization, and work-re lated activities; by contrast, those living alone have a higher number of home visits (Donisi et al., 2013). In one study of veterans enrolled in a psychogeriatric program, the veterans with highe r social connections reported increased access to services (Mistry et al., 2001). Living with others and having a stronger social system may serv e as a motivator to participat e in health care services. Evidence of No Impact on Utilization Some studies have found that having fewer social supports has limited to no impact on health care utilization by older adults. In one study, older pa tients with weaker social relationships did not place grea ter demands on ambulatory care (as defined by physician visits and community or home-based serv ices) (Valtorta et al ., 2018b). In addition, social isolation (as measured by living alone) was not a predictor of potentially preventable readmissions to hospitals (LaWall et al., 2019). Flowers and colle agues (2017) found \"no difference in outpatient use or spending for socially isolated Medicare beneficiaries.\" Living al one may actually provide some protective health factors, and having such a living arrangement may be an indicator of a person's level of independen ce or personal preferences.

All rights reserved.7-4 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Evidence of Decreased Utilization There is limited evidence indicating a decrease in health care utilization by those older adults who are socially isolated and lonely. In particular, there is some evidence for a lower use of preventive health services (a undesirable decrease in usag e), including mammograms, dental visits, immunizations, colonoscopy, general practitioner visits, and an exercise program for joint pain (Vozikaki et al., 2017). Loneliness has been linked to lower Medicare spending when adjusted for health status (Shaw et al., 2017). Ho wever, these examples of decreased usage could be a reflection of fewer supports and resources being available to enable such individuals to access outpatient and preventative services. Concerning prevention, a connection exists be tween an individual's level of physical activity and his or her use of health care. Engagement in a physical activity program was found to be associated with fewer emergency room vis its and hospital visits (Jacobs et al., 2013). In that study, participants who became more active we re more likely to be male with higher self- reported health and functional independence and reduced rates of loneliness. Engagement in physical activity programs, while beneficial, may be more challenging for older adults who have chronic health conditions and more functional im pairments and who are at risk for loneliness. (See Chapter 9 for more on physical activity programs as an interv ention for social isolation and loneliness.) Primary Care and Utilization As discussed above, social isol ation and loneliness affect the quantity and type of health care services used by older adults. Among community -dwelling older adults in the United States aged 60 and older, one study found that chronic lone liness (defined as being lonely at two points of time over 4 years) was a predictor of an incr eased number of both physic ian visits and hospital visits; the correlation was independent of soci odemographic variables, subjective and objective health measures, depressive symptoms, insuran ce status, and financial situation (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015). Reporting feelings of chronic loneline ss and having higher rates of health care utilization were associated with a va riety of factors, includ ing depressive symptoms, being married, having difficulty w ith activities of daily living (e .g., bathing, toile ting, dressing), having a higher number of chronic conditions, and having at least a high school or GED-level of education (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015). These examples suggest that individuals living with social isolation or loneliness are more likely to use outpatient, emergency departme nt, and inpatient services. However, there is no evidence that these individuals will isolate themselves from the benefits of primary care, and, in fact, loneliness is associated with increased visits to the physician's office (Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015). Comprehensive and advanced primary care settings serving older adults are well suited to the task of individuals living with social is olation and loneliness and could ultimately help link these individuals to effective interventions. For example, a collaborativ e of practice-based networks in Colorado and Virginia assessed the prevalence of lone liness and associated characte ristics and behaviors through a survey of registered adult patients presenting fo r routine primary care (Mullen et al., 2019). The prevalence of loneliness for indi viduals 65 years and older screen ed during the study period was 11 percent. As had been found in other studies, loneliness was associated with an increase in health care utilization across outpatient, emergenc y department, and inpati ent settings and also with poorer health status. The study found no ev idence that loneliness was associated with Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The authors c oncluded that \"the primary care setting has the potential to identify solutions and implement interventions\" (Mullen et al., 2019, p. 113). Long-Term Care Settings and Utilization The literature on utilization rela ted to social isolation and loneliness among older adults in long-term care (LTC) settings is scant. One study of da ta from the National Study of Caregiving and the National Health and Aging Trends Study demonstrated that a sense of community engagement was a significant predictor of likelihood of older a dults remaining in the community (Moon et al., 2018). Flowers and coll eagues (2017) found that \"socially isolated individuals were 29 percent more likely to use [skilled nursing facility (SNF)] care and their monthly SNF costs were $75 higher on average.\" The authors suggested one explanation being that these individuals may lack adequate support following a hosp ital stay, and th erefore require higher use of SNFs for rehabilitation. Shaw a nd colleagues (2017) similarly found that social isolated individuals used more SNF care. They noted that \"future study of social isolation in managed care and nursing home popul ations is warranted\" (p. 13). Data from other countries also suggest that social connection affect s utilization in LTC settings. Godin and colleagues (2019) examined \"the association betwee n social vulnerability and the odds of [LTC] placement within 30 days of discharge following admission to an acute care facility\" (p. 1) among patients with acute resp iratory illness admitted to hospitals in Canada. The authors created a social vu lnerability index, which included attention to social support, living situation, and social engagement, among ot her factors. They found that \"at younger ages (e.g., 70 years), social vulnerability was associat ed with lower odds of LTC placement for those who were the frailest, while at older ages (e.g., 90 years), social vulnerability was associated with increased odds of LTC placemen t in those adults who were non-frail or only mildly frail but did not impact odds of LTC placement among the fra ilest participants\" (p. 9). Another Canadian study of residents of assisted livi ng facilities showed that those with poor social relationships had a significantly increased risk fo r placement in a nursing home. (M axwell et al., 2013). Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing show ed that loneliness pr edicts LTC admission, independent of functional stat us (Hanratty et al., 2018). Factors Associated with Access A limited number of studies have examined access to health care and its relationship with social isolation and loneliness. A lack of trans portation resources limits one's ability to get to medical appointments, for instance, and living in remote areas limits an individual's social networks and other resources, incl uding rural health services (H adley Strout et al., 2016; King and Dabelko-Schoeny, 2009). Moreover, for lesbia n, gay, and bisexual older adults, living in rural communities has been f ound to reduce social networks (King and Dabelko-Schoeny, 2009). As people experience functional dec lines and adverse health events, access to resources is further compromised by increased isolati on (King and Dabelko-Schoeny, 2009). Having better and more robust social networks makes it more likely that individuals will make greater use of health and social servic es, as demonstrated in the Village model, a consumer-driven housing model for aging in place in which the coordinati on of needed health and social services is provided by the resident s and delivered within these communities (Graham et al., 2014).

Howe ver, the benefits were lessened for those who had worse self- reported health. As noted earlier, Ha and colleag ues (2019) found that those with larger family networks are likely to have had a higher number of previous hospitalizat ions. In these cases, family served as the primary source of support dur ing times of medical need and provided more people to call on to access care. Summary of the Evidence on Access and Utilization The results of studies of the impact of social isolation and lo neliness on health care access and utilization are mixed, with the evidence suggesting an association between loneliness and an increased use of inpatient care, more doc tor's visits, increased re-hospitalizations, and longer length of stays. Persons with larger so cial networks tend to rely more on outpatient services (as opposed to inpatient stays) than those with smalle r networks. Physical functioning and health status are linked with both social isol ation and loneliness. Olde r adults who are higher functioning and have higher percei ved health status have more op tions to be socially connected. The oldest of the older adults appear to have fewer options for social connection, thus placing them at greater risk. Furthermore, most of the re search examines utilizatio n at the systems level, not at the level of the individual, and therefore individual characteristics (such as the impact of comorbidities like depression) are not the focus of the analysis. Issues of access such as transportation, geographical location, and socioeconomic status all contribute to an individual's risk for social isolation and loneliness. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Targeting the major social and behavioral risk factors for health offers a way to improve population health and even reduce he alth disparities. Healthy People, 1 a program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \"pro vides science-based, 10-y ear national objectives for improving the health of all Americans\" ( HHS, 2019a). The program establishes benchmarks and monitors progress in order to: Encourage collaborations across communities and sectors, Empower individuals toward making informed health decisions, and Measure the impact of prev ention activities (HHS, 2019a). Addressing the social determinants of hea lth is a priority in the Healthy People 2020 agenda (HHS, 2019b). Social cohesi on is noted as a key issue w ithin the determinant area of social and community cont ext and social support. On a macro level, public health and manage d care organizations affect large populations of older adults through policy and programs (e.g., the fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid special needs plans). These health plans are st ructured to take a ho listic and comprehensive approach to addressing the social determinants of health. For ex ample, one of the social risk factors observed most frequently by those in the Care Wisconsin program was limited social supports (Fouad et al., 2017). Gottl ieb et al. (2016) assessed th e efforts of 25 geographically 1 For more information, see healthypeople.gov. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS dispersed Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCOs) that designed programs to address the social needs of beneficiaries. The authors suggest that one way to address the non-medical factors related to health is to design programs that are integrated into clinical settings. However, the authors found that MMCOs are \"not yet syst ematically engaged in comprehensive [social determinants of health] strategies to improve h ealth or change health care utilization patterns\" (Gottlieb et al., 2016, p. 374). On an individual level, older adults in th e United States will ideally experience first- contact care that is comprehe nsive, continuous, and coordina ted through the primary care experience. Comprehensive and advanced primar y care delivers signifi cantly more high-value care and better health care acces s and experience than typical pr imary care without significantly altering the overall volume of outpatient, emergenc y department, or inpatie nt visits (Levine et al., 2019). Newer models of primary care have built upon this success. A 3-year primary care medical home intervention, which included a shared sa vings initiative that created incentives for specific structural transformation, resulted in statistically signif icant improvements in performance on selected quality measures in al l-cause and ambulatory care-sensitive emergency department visits as well as a reduced use of specialty care and higher rates of ambulatory primary care visits (Friedberg et al., 2015). Comprehensive prim ary care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older has been shown to be associated with fewer emergency department and hospital admissions as well as lo wer Medicare expenditures per beneficiary per month (Bazemore et al., 2015; O'Malley et al., 2019). Assessing the social determinants of health (including social isolat ion and loneliness) is key to comprehensive primary care. Primary Care and Assessment of So cial Determinants of Health Many health care delivery systems are explori ng the feasibility and impact of practice- based strategies to identify and address such social determinants of health as social isolation and loneliness. The 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care noted that \"patients visiting health care organizations are increasingly being asked to answer social risk screen ing questions in the context of their care and care planning\" (NASEM, 2019, p. 38). However, the study also notes that collecting data on social determinants of health in the health care se tting \"may be affected by unconsci ous or implicit biases held by program leaders and practitioners\" (NASEM, 2019, p. 38). When Tong and colleagues (2018) evaluated the experience of c linicians conducting assessments for social needs (e.g., transportati on, food access, housing, social connections), they found three themes that were associated with positive outcomes: 1. knowing the patient better, 2. understanding the patient's so cial circumstances, and 3. addressing self-management through such st eps as exercise and dietary counseling, addressing financial barriers to medica tions, and helping with transportation. However, the process of screening was labor intensive, and the yield varied by how well the clinician knew the patient over time and the willingness of patients to discuss their social needs. The individuals in a prac tice who may need such assistance most may be the least likely to come in for assessment. Furthermore, if n eeds are found, connecting patients to resources in the community is difficult. Tong and colleagues (2018) took a targeted a pproach to the clinic ian screening of a subset of registered patients who resided in a geographic region likely to predispose those living Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.7-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS there to having social needs. In this study, 57 per cent of the targeted cohort visited the practice during the study period and agreed to screening. Of these, more than 70 percent reported at least one social need, yet only 3 percent of those i ndividuals accepted assistance with meeting that need. The authors suggest that the limited number of individuals who were willing to receive help may represent a manageable first step fo r primary care clinicians who may be otherwise overwhelmed by the volume and prevalence of soci al needs within the population of patients served by their practice. However, since the ap proach only addresses t hose who are willing to participate in an intervention, ad ditional consideration is needed concerning how to address those who are in most need of inte rvention but who may not initially be willing to participate. Adding assessments of the social determinants of health to busy he alth care practices may be considered a burden. In the United Kingdom, Walters et al. ( 2017) studied the feasibility of embedding a health and social risk appraisal tool into the electronic health records of five English National Health Service (NHS) primary care practices. The Well-Be ing Interventions for Social and Health (WISH) study assessed 454 co mmunity-dwelling people aged 65 and older. The fact that the \"already burde ned\" practices were interested in implementing the tool and willing to implement it universally was a posi tive finding. However, Walters and colleagues (2017) expressed concern that th e subset of patients who comp leted the case-finding tool may not be representative of the needs of the entire population served. They concluded that a practice- based case-finding approach may li mit access to services for the high-risk populations who need them, such as the poor, severely ill, and home bound. Furthermore, in a study of strategies for collecting data on the social determinants of h ealth for the EHR, \"clinicians did not want to collect [social determinants of health] data them selves, preferring to transfer that responsibility to another team member\" (Gold et al., 2017, p. 6). C oncerns were also rais ed about the impact on workflow. Researchers are considering how informatics migh t be used to make social determinant of health data collected in the EHR accessible, the use of implementati on science to address program development and deployment, and natura l language processing to identify information related to the social determinants of health, su ch as an individual patient experiencing social isolation, in clinical notes (Bazemore et al., 2018 ; Hripcsak et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). (See later in this chapter for more on the EHR.) The following sections highlight the general opportunities and challe nges related to the clinical assessment of social isolation and loneliness. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF SOCI AL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS The evidence strongly indicates that social isolation and loneliness affect health. Because of this, the health care sector has a role to play in identifying indi viduals at risk for, or already experiencing, social isolation and loneliness in order to mitigate the health consequences. However, clarity is needed about whether the be st approach is a formal screening process or identification of these issues within the patient population. Th e differences between screening and identification and why the committee chose to highlight these differences are discussed below. General Principles of Screening The National Institutes of Hea lth (NIH) suggests that screen ing tests can help detect conditions or illnesses early in an illness cour se or before symptoms are apparent (NIH, 2017). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The purpose of such screening is thus to d ecrease the risks of certa in illnesses, their complications, and their related mortality. Other definitions of screening are: Screening is the process of identifying healthy people who may have an increased chance of a disease or condition. The screening provider then offers information, further tests, and treatment. This is to reduce associat ed risks or complicat ions. (Public Health England, 2019) Screening refers to the use of simple tests acr oss a healthy population in order to identify individuals who have disease, but do not yet have symptoms. (WHO, 2019a). However, all tests have associated risks a nd benefits, and the dete rmination of when a screening test is warranted is a source of much debate. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviews the evidence and makes recommendations about whether a particular screening test has sufficient support to be widely adopted into cl inical practice.2 The task force focuses on primary prevention (i.e., when there are no symptoms or si gns of the illness or behavior). To date, the majority of screening recommendations by the ta sk force have focused on disease-specific or medication-specific concerns. There are few, if a ny, categories of screening that relate to the social determinants of health in general or certainly for social isolation and loneliness specifically. Thus, there are currently no recommenda tions for screening for social isolation and loneliness at a national level. Ultimately, the basic concept underlying screenin g is that the early detection of risk factors or of early disease will result in better clinical or public health outcomes. See Box 7-2 for criteria commonly used to determ ine if screening is warranted. BOX 7-2 Wilson and Jungner Classic Screening Criteria The condition sought should be an important health problem. There should be an accepted treatment for patients with recognized disease. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available. There should be a recognizable latent or early symptomatic stage. There should be a suitable test or examination. The test should be acceptable to the population. The natural history of the condition, including the development from latent to declared disease, should be adequately understood. There should be an agreed-upon policy on whom to treat as patients. The cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed) should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole. Case-finding should be a continuing process and not a \"once and for all\" project.

All rights reserved.7-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Screening Versus Assessment for So cial Isolation and Loneliness Loneliness and isolation have high prevalence rates in adu lts over age 60 (see Chapter 1) and have been linked to significant health cons equences and increased mortality risk (see Chapters 2 and 3), which indicate s that it might be valuable to have a national standard or recommendation for screening for social isolati on or loneliness. Ultimately, however, the value of such a standard or recommendations will depend on several factors, not just the prevalence and health consequences of social isolation and loneliness, but also whether there is a potential treatment or way to mitigate risks in such situations as well as the potential risks of screening and its possible unintended consequences (Garg et al., 2016). Several elements of the Wilson and Jungner criteria (see Box 7-2) suppo rt screening for soci al isolation or lone liness. However, at present there is a lack of the sorts of policies and data needed to guide clinicians in making decisions about specific treatments or interventio ns (see Chapter 9). Furthe rmore, a review of the existing literature finds no high-quality studies de monstrating that social isolation and loneliness can be prevented through primary prevention, a lthough there are some promising secondary and tertiary prevention areas of research (see Chap ter 9). Because of the paucity of literature on successful interventions for specifi c populations, it is difficult to c onclude that formal screening protocols for social isolation and loneliness could reduce preval ence rates or negative health consequences. Yet, because of the high prevalen ce rates and broad-reachi ng health effects, the committee concludes that the health care system is well poised to develop methods and processes for identifying social isolation and loneliness in health care settings, even if the methods do not rely on a formal screening protocol. As such, the committee concludes that it is more appropriate talk about the identification of loneliness and isolation as risk factors for health consequences rather than about how to screen for social isolati on and loneliness. Specific Concerns for Clinical Assessments Similar to the concerns about clinician burden that were rais ed earlier in this chapter, some people have voiced concerns that charging health care providers wi th identifying social isolation and loneliness or th eir risk factors among patient s may create a burden by asking providers to identify social problems that cannot be readily fixed. However, a recent study examining clinician burnout demonstrated that wh en clinicians felt they had the needed support to address problems such as social isolation, bur nout rates were actually lower (De Marchis et al., 2019a). As the health care delivery system mobilizes to incorporate assessments and, as the research develops, to integrate interventions for the social determinants of health, some researchers are cautioning that not all patients may view primary care interv entions of this type as positive. Kharicha and colleagues (2017) found th at individuals identifie d as lonely often did not perceive primary care and co mmunity interventions as desirable or helpful and that they perceived a stigma in being labeled as lonel y. In particular, many pa rticipants did not see loneliness as an illness and ther efore did not see a role for primary care physicians, whom they perceived as not being able to help with non- physical problems. \"For many, loneliness was a complex and private matter that they wished to manage without external support\" (Kharicha et al., 2017, p. 1733). However, another study found that a strong majority of adults reported screening for (or, in the committ ee's preferred language, identification of) risk to be appropriate; as such, a fear of stigmatization should not necessarily be considered as a barrier to implementation (De Marchis, 2019b). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Assessment Tools Chapter 6 describes many of the tools used in research settings to measure social isolation or loneliness. Unfortunately, few if any implem entation studies examine how to use these tools in clinical settings or define which are the most favorable tools to use in specific settings or populations. The committee suggests that a logical approach would be to consider how and why the tool is being used. For example, in health care encounters if clinicians are seeking to determine how to improve health care outcomes or how to reduce the risk of negative health care outcomes, it may be necessary to identify both so cial isolation and loneliness. In order to compare certain groups (e.g., by age or high-risk attribute), defining the target population (i.e., those who are isolated versus those who are lonely) will help determine what demographic factors underlie the context for their social isola tion or loneliness. Anothe r aspect of choosing the best tool is having a framework or theory of ch ange. For example, is th e intervention intended to decrease loneliness, to decrease social isolation, or both? Answ ering this question will help determine whether to use questions related to so cial isolation, loneline ss, or other composite measures. Implementing Assessment Tools Despite the limited data on implementation, when health care providers are adapting or selecting research tools for clinical settings they can consider various ge neral factors that are important to the successful implementation of an identification tool. These include the amount of training required to administer the tool; whether a tool can be administered by clinicians and, potentially, ancillary sta ff and other clinical team members; the time required to administer the tool; and the tool's availability and validati on in other languages. Us ing this framework and working with the available evidence, the committ ee concluded that the existing tools likely to have the greatest success in clinical settings are the Berkman-Syme (for measuring social isolation) and the three-item UCLA Loneliness Sc ale (for measuring loneliness). (See Chapter 6 for descriptions of these measures.) No com posite measurement tools have been designed specifically to measure the overarching rubric of social connecti on (although some may approximate this). The three-item UCLA Loneline ss Scale alone does not ge t into the details of the quantification of isolation; similarly, the Be rkman-Syme does not delv e into the subjectivity of loneliness. As noted in Chapter 6, concerns exist rega rding the relevance of current tools, and particularly as to whether the measures develo ped years or decades ago can fully capture the expectations and values of older adults today. Th is is likely to be es pecially relevant for measures of social isolation as modes of in teraction and social pr eferences have changed significantly in recent years a nd decades. Some have suggested using \"living alone\" as a proxy measure for social isolation and loneliness. Howeve r, as living alone may be a distinct or even positive experience, particularly for those who choos e to live alone, and as it does not necessarily capture the distress of loneliness, this question by itself may not be sufficient to fully capture the health risks or the entire contex t of those experiencing social is olation or loneliness. Similarly, the Berkman-Syme measure, for example, has a single question that focuses specifically on religiosity and participation in religious group activities, which may create a bias against those who do not participate in religious groups but do participate in ot her social activities with equal benefit. Furthermore, the Berkman-Syme measur e also only asks about \"telephone use,\" which may not account for other modes of communication in today's society such as texting and video Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Another drawback of many of these tools is their limite d testing and availability in other languages. Predictive Analytics Advances in health technologies, including the digitization of medical records, has resulted in vast amounts of data from both \"forma l\" sources, such as clinical tests and imaging, and \"informal\" sources, such as wearable consum er devices and health-tra cking applications in smartphones. This explosion of population-level data, coupled with an emphasis on evidence- based medicine, has led to increa sing investment in predictive an alytics in health care. These technologies include machine learni ng and statistical risk scoring and have been widely used to enable better decision making a nd support preventive ca re (Wang et al., 2018). (See Chapter 6 for more on the use of these technologies to identify social isolation and loneliness.) Data for predictive analytics can be gathered from a variety of s ources, including various types of information captured in the EHR, such as visit patterns, medications, and patient portal messages; retail activity such as prescriptions filled or over-th e-counter medications purchased; social media and internet usage, including search history data3; and physical activity monitors such as wearable sensors and othe r consumer health devices. Othe r sources of data that may be of use for predictive analytics are information captured in files maintained in social service agencies and, in the future, outcomes data from the widespread implementation of assessment tools for social isolation and l oneliness and for potentially precipi tating life events (Weissman et al., 2020). Additional Implementation N eeds for Clinical Assessment In addition to selecting the ri ght tools for the valid clinical assessment of social isolation and loneliness, it is also necessary to determine: who should receive the assessment (i.e., ever yone or just those most at risk), who should conduct the assessment, the ideal frequency of assessment for different subpopulations, and the appropriate interventions, referrals, and follow-up care. When social isolation or loneliness are iden tified, it may be appr opriate to assess for other potential co-existing conditions (e.g., depr ession, safety concerns, cognitive impairment) and to engage in advanced care planning, particul arly if the individual has no friends. That is, advanced care planning may be needed in situ ations where the individual is not capable of making his or her own medical decisions but ha s no surrogates to make those choices. In addition, follow-up will be needed to determine the severity and the individual's response to any potential interventions or resour ces provided. This may be done at the next clinical encounter. No literature currently delves into the appropriate frequency of measurement, but following more established models (e.g., depr ession screening) may be a r easonable comparison. Also, the initiation of an intervention may depend heavily on the individual's willingness to participate in 3 A recent study of the Google search histories of those admitted into the emergency department found in the week leading up to admission, more than 50 percent of those patients searched for information about their symptoms or nearby hospitals (Asch et al., 2019). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS such an intervention (as is true for many issues of health care and a dherence to treatment). Finally, it is critical for health care systems to maintain these assessments in easily identifiable locations in the EHR. (See the next section fo r more on documentation of social isolation and loneliness in the EHR.) TECHNOLOGY AS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COORDINATION AND INTERVENTION The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committ ee on Recommended Social and Behavioral Domains and Measures for Electronic Health Records was commissioned \"to identify domains and measures that capture the social determinan ts of health to inform the development of recommendations for Stage 3 meaningful use of electronic health reco rds\" (IOM, 2014, p. 5). EHRs facilitate the systematic implementation of evidence-based interventions in clinical practice. Large-scale EHR products include modu les for tracking the soci al determinants of health. Features can be customized within the modules which also include functions for facilitating follow-up and linki ng to community agencies. The IOM committee issued its reports in two pha ses: first, an identification of domains and criteria for inclusion and, second, specific measures in each domain along with issues and opportunities related to the implem entation of the measures. The cr iteria for domain selection included 1. strength of the evidence associ ating the domain with health, 2. usefulness of the domain for deci sion making, monitoring, and research, 3. availability of standardized measures, 4. feasibility of using the meas ures in a clinical setting, 5. sensitivity of personal information, and 6. accessibility of data from other sources. The domains selected include (1) sociodemographic, (2) ps ychological, (3) behavioral, (4) social relationships, and (5) neigh borhoods and communities. The domain \"social connections and social isolation\" was described as an item not routinely collected in clinical settings but nonetheless a crucial domain for inclusion, with the evidence supporting its inclusion equivalent to the evidence supporting the inclusi on of race, education, physical activity, tobacco use, and neighborhood characteristics. The measures recommended in the Phase 2 re port (IOM, 2014) are included in Table 7-1. Importantly, the committee concluded that the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index could be adopted into EHRs (IOM, 2014). The inclusion of this information in the EHR may vary according to clinical setting (e.g., primary care, inpatient, emergency department), and decisions about its use in EHRs will need to take into account the purpose of the information, how it is used, how to track it over time, and how to ensure it is easily viewable and extractable. Some EHRs have modules for the social determinants of health that enable structured documentation and presentation of the data. Additional options for locations to capture this data in the EHR include the history review, the revi ew of systems, or \"flowsheets\" or \"questionnaires\" that are already seamlessly incorporated into intake wo rkflows. In order to highlight the clinical significance of loneliness and isol ation in the EHR, a best practice includes adding loneliness or isolation to problem lists with their corresponding ICD-10 codes.

SOURCE: IOM, 2014. The IOM committee's report outlin ed several potential implementation issues related to the general capture, storage, and use of data th at are self-reported or externally sourced (e.g., from community agencies or national surveys). The concerns discussed in the report included privacy, data quality, and the burden imposed on clinicians by incorporating additional data collection into the clinical workflow. The report had a pragmatic emphasis on choices that enable action in clinical settings, but it stopped short of making recommendations related to the communication and coordination infrastructure (e.g., between medical and community-based service providers) that would be needed to impl ement interventions to address issues related to social determinants for individual patients or groups. This infrastructure issue was subseque ntly taken up by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's (RWJF's) report Using Social Determinants of Hea lth Data to Improve Health Care and Health: A Learning Report (DeMilto and Nakashian, 2016). This report identified four key barriers to the widespread use of social de terminants of health data for improving health: 1. lack of knowledge and consensus on measures, 2. resource and power differences between soci al services and health care organizations, 3. lack of effective multi-sector collaboration, and 4. rigid technology systems. The RWJF report argues for sharing data acro ss sectors and suggests that EHRs may not be the right tool for this purpose. Resear ch has shown that effective coordination among community agencies, including health care orga nizations, requires not only an information architecture, but also a process for maintaining a social connection among the agencies (DeMilto and Nakashian, 2016).

All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS While information systems and other digital t ools provide a platform to facilitate the assessment and documentation of social isolation and loneliness and, ultimately, to inform action at an organizational level, there are many well documented challenges related to the use of information technology infrastructu re. A number of these challengers were identified by the National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care , including varying degrees of access to digital infrastructure, a lack of data standards and interoperability, and privacy and security considerations (NASEM, 2019). The key challenge in implementing effective interventions is linking the information to actions such as outreach, intervention, and follow-up (see Figure 7-1). This requires the following: 1. Incorporating assessment data into clinical workflow. 2. Establishing evidence-based clinical deci sion-support protocols for action that are based on assessment findings. 3. At the local level, establishing an infra structure for connections with community resources. 4. Using the infrastructure for communication with other c linical providers to support patients transitioning among clinical setti ngs, including secure electronic messaging that protects patient privacy when available. 5. Communication with patients via patient por tals and personal health records when available. FIGURE 7-1 Sustained intervention for social isolation and loneliness depends upon a social and technological infrastr ucture for coordinated action. Between 2016 and 2018 Kaiser Permanente Nort hwest (KPNW) used a combination of EHR capabilities and patient navigators to scr een more than 11,000 patients for the social determinants of health.

In a parallel process, OCHIN, Inc., a nonprofit health ca re innovation center in Oregon, reported on the process that was used and the lessons that we re learned through the implementa tion of a social determinants of health screening tool across a network of mo re than 400 federally qualif ied health centers in the KPNW region, taking advantage of the KPNW tool's social isolati on domain and questions (Gold et al., 2017). Researchers identified severa l considerations for using the tool, including striking a balance between standard ized data collection and the need to adapt to local context, identifying patients who do not want assistance, determining a method for updating lists of local resources and referrals, and accommodating different staffing structures. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Evidence strongly indicates that social is olation and loneliness have an adverse impact on health. Therefore, the health car e sector should play a role in identifying individuals at risk for, or already experiencing, social isol ation and loneliness in order to mitigate their health consequences. Evidence suggests an association between l oneliness and increased use of inpatient care, more health care provider visits, incr eased re-hospitalizati ons, and longer length of stays. Access to services is influenced by fact ors such as transp ortation, geographical location, and socioeconomic status, all of which may be associated with social isolation and loneliness. The health care system is well poised to develop and evaluate methods and processes to identify social isolation and l oneliness in health care settings. It is more appropriate to consider and plan for the identification of loneliness and isolation as risk factors for health co nsequences than to consider how to screen for social isolation and loneliness. The current identification tools most likely to be successfully implemented in clinical settings are the Berkman-Syme (for measur ing social isolation) and the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (for measuring loneliness). More effort is needed to update existi ng measures as well as to develop better instruments for assessing social isolation a nd loneliness in clinical settings that can fully capture the experience of today's older adults. A key aspect of selecting a tool for use in clinical settings is standardization within a specific organization so that everyone within the organization uses the same tool or set of tools rather than reso rting to different tools, ever yone uses validated tools, and everyone refrains from using only parts of existing tools or creating a new, unvalidated tool. Advances in health technologies, increases in data collection, and an emphasis on the use of evidence-based medicine have led to the application of predictive analytics to various health concerns. Predictive analyt ics may also be of value for identifying individuals at risk for is olation and loneliness.

All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS NEXT STEPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Chapters 2 and 3 show the strength of th e evidence for the mortality and morbidity impacts of social isolation and loneliness on older adults. As su ch, the committee concludes that the health care system has an important role to pl ay in the identification in clinical settings of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. In fact, a single interacti on with the health care system may represent the only t ouchpoint for the most isolated and lonely older adults. For example, a home health worker may provide the only face-to-face interaction for an older adult who is housebound, has no family, and does not belong to a religious institu tion or social group. However, no single clinical indicator (or measur e) serves as a marker for the presence or risk of social isolation or l oneliness. Because of the scarcity of literature on effective interventions (see Chapter 9), it is premature to conclude that formal screening for social isolation and loneliness could re duce prevalence rates or nega tive health consequences. Yet because of the high prevalence rates (see Chapter 1) and extensive health effects (see Chapters 2 and 3) of social isolation and loneliness, the co mmittee concludes that the health care system is well poised to begin the process of developing met hods to identify social isolation and loneliness in health care settings, even if providers are not using a traditional scr eening approach. By first identifying those at highest risk, and potentially whether their isol ation or loneliness is acute or chronic, clinicians and health care researchers may be able to use these findings to target appropriate clinical and public heal th interventions to individual patients as well as to target high-need regions and populations served by a practice or health care system. Furthermore, this will support a stepwise approach to care that includes the identification of individuals at risk, the provision of education, and, ultim ately, intervention. Finally, fo r many older adults who are socially isolated or lonely, hea lth care providers may be able to identify underlying causes for the isolation and loneliness which may be addressed through establ ished evidence-based practices. For example, as discussed in Chapter 4, hearing loss is associated with social isolation and loneliness. In this case, a practit ioner would be able to make a ppropriate referrals to a hearing health specialist. While some question the value of identifying individual s at risk for social isolation and loneliness when in many cases spec ific effective interventions have not been developed, the committee recognizes that many health care providers and professionals are already implementing programs for social isolati on and loneliness, and so program developers need to understand best practices for identifying at-risk individuals to engage in these programs. Finally, within this context, the committee emphas izes that the preserva tion of an individual's own decisions regarding his or her life is essent ial as a guiding principle for all interventions, including assessment. Therefore, the committee identifies the following goal and recommendations: GOAL: Translate research into health care practices in order to reduce the negative health impacts of social isol ation and loneliness. RECOMMENDATION 7-1: Health care providers and practices should periodically perform an assessment using one or more va lidated tools to identify older adults experiencing social isolation and loneline ss and to initiate potential preventive interventions after having identified indivi duals at elevated risk due to life events (e.g., loss of someone significant, geogra phic move, relevant health conditions).

All rights reserved.7-18 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS In the case of older adults who are currentl y socially isolated or lonely (or at an elevated risk for social isolation or loneliness), health care providers should discuss the adverse health outcomes a ssociated with social isolation and loneliness with these older adults and their legally appointed representatives. Providers should make appropriate effort s to connect isolated or lonely older adults with needed social care. For older adults who are currently social ly isolated or lonely, health care providers should attempt to determine th e underlying causes and use evidence- based practices tailored to address those causes (e.g., hearing loss, mobility limitations). As discussed in Chapter 6, there are a variet y of established tool s to measure social isolation and loneliness, each with different stre ngths and weaknesses. Despite the limits of the evidence base concerning how best to implement these tools in clinical settings, the committee concluded that an important aspect of select ing a tool for use in clinical settings is standardization. This means that within a spec ific health care system or organization, all clinicians would use the same tool or set of tools rather than re sorting to different tools; they should also use only validated tool s and refrain from using only part s of existing tools or creating new, unvalidated tools. While the committee r ecognizes that some va riation in choice of appropriate tools may be necessary for assess ing certain specific populations or health conditions, it emphasizes that the chosen measurem ent tool needs to match the research question. (That is, if assessing for loneliness, for instance, the tool needs to be validated specifically for the measurement of loneliness, as oppos ed to other indicators of social connection.) Furthermore, the committee notes that the thresholds for identifying socially isolated or lonely older adults and their risk of health impacts will vary with the tool us ed and the health prof ile of the person being assessed. While there are limitations to current tools, the committee asse rts that the use of existing validated tools is necessary in order to address social isolation and loneliness more fully in clinical settings. However, the committee recogn izes that more effort is needed to update existing tools and develop better tools that can fu lly capture the experience of social isolation and loneliness among today's older adults. The committee also notes that more research related to assessment is needed to evaluate the ethical implications and unint ended consequences of assessments as well as to determine specific implementation parameters, including who should receive the assessment, who should conduct the assessment, the ideal frequency of assessment for different subpopulations, and the appropriate interventions, referrals, and follow-up care. A variety of mechanisms for performing thes e assessments may need to be explored, including the Medicare annual wellness visit; hospital discharge planning; pre-admission, quarterly, or other assessments for long-term care settings, or other opportunities in which assessment for social isolation and loneliness may be incorporated. Linking those who are implementing new interven tions in clinical settings with formally trained researchers early on can help ensure r obust research design. Therefore, in order to improve the evidence around the use of specific t ools in clinical setti ngs, the committee makes the following recommendation: Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 7-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS RECOMMENDATION 7-2: Health care syst ems should create opportunities for clinicians to partner with researchers to evaluate the application of currently available evidence-based tools for assessing so cial isolation and loneliness in clinical settings, including testing and appl ications for specific populations. Finally, the committee concludes that assessme nt data should be included in clear locations in the EHR. Therefore, the committee makes the following recommendation: RECOMMENDATION 7-3: The committee endorses the recommendation of previous National Academies reports that so cial isolation should be included in the electronic health records or medical record. As noted in both this chapter, and Chapte r 6, the committee recognizes limitations of current measures of social isolation (e.g., Berkman-Syme) in capturing current modes of interaction. However, as stated previously the committee asserts th at the use of existing validated tools is necessary in order to move forward. The measures used and captured in the EHR need to be updated as better measures are developed. Th e committee further notes that research will be needed to determine how to best integrate information from a patients' assessments into their health record in order to make determinations about future care and the identification of risk (see Recommendation 9-4 in Chapter 9 for the need fo r more research on interventions in clinical settings).

Gerst-Emerson and Jayawardhana, 2015 Members of the health care workforce (including professiona ls and direct care workers) are vital in the effort to prevent, identify, reduc e, and eliminate the negative health impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. This chapter addresses th e education and training of this workforce. In addition to the imperativ e to increase the knowledge and skills of those employed by the health care delivery system, this chapter considers the o pportunity to increase awareness and knowledge about social isola tion and loneliness among patients, families, caregivers, volunteers, and the community at la rge. Given the complexity of the terminology used in relation to social isola tion and loneliness, a reminder of key definitions is provided in Box 8-1. BOX 8-1 Key Definitions Loneliness : the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely. Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network.

All rights reserved.8-2 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS FRAMEWORK FOR THE ROLE OF ED UCATION IN CATALYZING CHANGE The committee developed a framework to expl ain the role of education in addressing issues of social isolation a nd loneliness (see Figure 8-1). The framework emphasizes catalyzing change in clinical care delivery with the goals of preventing, ameliorating, and eliminating social isolation and loneliness in olde r adults and addressing the hea lth effects of chronic social isolation and loneliness. Clin ical care provides an impor tant\u2014and underused\u2014opportunity to address social isolation and loneliness in older ad ults. All types of health professions and careers need to be involved, and the n ecessary changes can be cataly zed through various types of education, including direct care worker educa tion, lifelong learning by hea lth professionals and direct care workers, and public educational campaigns. All lear ners need to understand how the educational and training context fo r social isolation and loneliness either creates higher risk or provides avenues for mitigating these problems. This context includes The impact of national standards and policy priorities; Current education and training approaches; How health system design can change prac tice behaviors and facilitate treatment strategies (e.g., through partnerships with academic environments and communities); and How payor policies facilitate or impede addr essing social isolati on and loneliness. NATIONAL STANDARDS AND POLICY PRIORITIES At the highest level, national standards and policy priorities can influence and shape the education of the formal health care workforce. As each profession sets its own standards for education and practice, the topics of social isolation and loneline ss can be incorporated into the standards and competencies expected of students. The compelling evidence base for the health effects of social isolation and loneliness provide faculty and e ducational leaders with a strong rationale for including this cont ent in educational programs. Th e following sections highlight several opportunities for influenci ng the education and training of the formal health care workforce. Interprofessional Groups Many interprofessional groups relate d to the care of older adults need to be partners in improving education and training re lated to social isolation and loneliness among older adults. Such groups include (but are not limited to) the American Geriat rics Society, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, Lead ingAge, the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, and other service provider organizations. The followi ng sections provide ex amples of a few key partners specifically engage d in professional education.

Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING 8-4 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The Interprofessional Education Collaborat ive (IPEC), formed in 2009 by a group of health professions education associations to de velop a set of competencies for interprofessional education (IPEC, 2016), could address social is olation and loneliness th rough its focus on team- based approaches. The four initial competencies and sub-competencies de veloped by IPEC were updated in 2016 to reflect interprofessional collab oration as the primary organizing construct and to focus more clearly on population health. Th e updated competencies emphasize collaboration with others outside of the formal health care system. This update d format is particularly germane to addressing social isolation and loneliness in olde r adults since much of the support needed may come from other sectors, including s ources within neighborhoods and communities. Because the interventions needed to address so cial isolation and loneliness draw upon so many different professions and disciplines, including a va riety of frontline workers such as direct care workers and community health workers, volunteer s, and family caregivers (sometimes called informal caregivers), it would be particularly helpful when promulgating recommendations to note their relevance to the IPEC competencies. Beyond Flexner1 is an interprofessiona l group that promotes th e inclusion of social determinants of health into all health prof essions curricula (Kaufman, 2016). Mullen (2017) argued that social, economic, and geographic conditions are f undamental in determining the presence or absence of health in equities and therefore that all health professions schools should educate students abou t the importance of the social mission. The name, Beyond Flexner, is intended to signify the inclusion of the social mission and learning experiences related to social determinants of health that go above and beyond the biologically and clinically based educational model the founders of this movement assert is curren tly in use. This social mission could incorporate issues related to social isol ation and loneliness and expand health professions education around these issues. Englander and colleagues (2013) proposed a fr amework composed of eight domains that they recommended for use within medical educa tion. The domains, developed to be sufficiently broad to be applicable to a ny health profession, have been adopted by one nurse practitioner residency program (Flintner and Bamrick, 2017) and are being discussed for use in nursing education more broadly (AACN, 2019). The eight domains are: 1. patient care; 2. knowledge for practice; 3. practice-based learning and improvement; 4. interpersonal and professionalism; 6. systems-based practice; 7. and, 8. personal and develo pment (Englander et al., 2013, pp. 1091 1092). The prevention and treatment of the health im pacts of social isola tion and loneliness in older adults fits within several of these domai ns. For example, incorporating evidence-based recommendations to prevent or ameliorate social isolation and loneliness in older adults fits within the domains of patient care, interper sonal and communication skills, system-based practice, and interprofe ssional collaboration. 1 In 1910, Abraham Flexner issued a report (now known as the Flexner report) which criticized the quality of medical education at that time and re sulted in a reorganization of the medical education system (Flexner, 1910). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING 8-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The Academy for Gerontology in Higher Education (AGHE) is a membership organization of colleges and univers ities that offer education, trai ning, and research in the field of aging. Interdisciplinary in nature, the goals of the AGHE include educating society about aging, preparing service delivery people who work with older adults, and providing leadership on policies and issues related to higher e ducation (AGHE, 2019). AGHE develops, promotes, and publishes gerontology competencies for undergraduate and graduate education. These recommended competencies include foundational co mpetencies, interactional competencies, and contextual competencies (AGHE, 2014). For exam ple, the foundational competencies are in the areas of the biological aspects of aging, the psychological aspects of aging, and the social aspects of aging. Content about social isolation and loneliness could be included with in these three aspects of aging and would serve to prepare the workforce with tool s to recognize social isolation and loneliness, to unde rstand its impact on older adults , and to ameliorate it. One interactional competency is interdisciplin ary and community collaboration. Community collaborative competency work could focus on solutions to address social isolation and loneliness from an interdisciplinary perspective. Finally, the contextual competencies include well-being, health, and mental health as one contextual competency and social health as another. Social isolation and loneliness could be integrated within these competencies. AGHE could provide the leadership to promot e social isolation and loneline ss in its recommended competency content, and infusion across curriculum standa rds and within the structure of the AGHE competencies would be possible. National Goals for He alth and Well-Being The Healthy People national goals provide ye t another opportunity for encouraging the inclusion of content related to so cial isolation and lone liness in health prof essions education as well as in programs aimed at pr acticing clinicians and other pr ofessionals who care for older adults. Since 1990 Healthy People goals have been developed for each decade, and social cohesion is one of the topics addr essed in the section on social dete rminants of health for Healthy People 2020 (HHS, 2019b). Foundational principles and overarching goals have already been proposed for Healthy People 2030, and the specific goals and objectives are under development at this time (HHS, 2019c). Healthy People goals provide important di rections for health professions education. Although the goals and objectives are not educational standards, they influence curricula because they represent nation al priorities. The overarching goals for Healthy People 2030 are based on a vision of \"a societ y in which all people can achieve their full potential for health and well- being across the lifespan\" ( HHS, 2019c). Addressing social isolation and loneliness fits clea rly within this broad vision. An Individual Health Professions Response Making the prevention and treatm ent of social isolation and loneliness in older adults a priority of individual he alth professions is another important strategy. One example has occurred within the social work profession, with the Am erican Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare having adopted the elimination of social isolation as one of gr and challenges (Lubben et al., 2015, 2018). The Grand Challenge initiative2 provides a framework for disseminating evidence-based strategies to solve important social problems and to bring a range of stakeholders 2 For more information, see https ://grandchallengesforsocialwork.org/ab out (accessed December 16, 2019). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.8-6 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS together in designing multifaceted solutions. The benefits of grand challenges, such as this one developed by the social work prof ession, are that they provide a focu s, bring leaders to the table, provide a framework for collaboration and interd isciplinary engagement, capture public interest, attract resources, and promote diplomacy (Uehara, et al., 2013). The success of this initiative will depend on participation across professional groups , organizations, and communities (Uehara, et al., 2013). Indeed, social isolation and loneliness in older adults is a co mplex issue that will benefit from cross-sector collabora tive initiatives such as this. CURRENT EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE In 2016 an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) developed a framework for educ ating health professionals to address the social determinan ts of health (NASEM, 2016a) (see Figure 8-2). The committee concluded that that there should be \"a holistic, consistent, and c oherent framework\" of education and training that promotes a syst ems-based approach aligned acro ss health, education, and other sectors in partnership with communities (NASEM , 2016a, p. 4). This call for a unified approach (based on the three pillars of transformative learning, dynamic partnerships, and lifelong learning) is especially important for a health care workforce concerned with social isolation and loneliness in older, vulnerable populations. Many health professi ons stress the incorporation of the social determinants of health in general into curricula for students an d trainees. However, the non-traditional components of education reco mmended by the 2016 committee (e.g., experiential learning, collaborative learning, an integrated curriculum, conti nuing professional development) are not universally deployed. The 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care Into the Delivery of Health Care discusses the role of education in develo ping a workforce that can understand and address social factors and recommends the incorporation of competency-based curricula on social care into health professions and continuing e ducation programs (NASEM , 2019). The following sections expand on that report's recommendati on and highlight specific examples and opportunities for the education and training of the health care work force on issues related to the social isolation and lone liness of older adults. Health Professions Education Many individual professions have paid attent ion to the education and training of their own professionals about the social determinants of health in general. However, except for a few notable examples, little is known about the level of education and training provided on the particular effects of social is olation and loneliness. Aside from formal education programs, the role of certification may be explored as a way to foster the infusion of these topics into the education and training of health care professionals. The committee recognizes that adding more requirements may add to burden and burnout among h ealth care professionals. However, given the significant impact of social isolation and loneliness on health, the committee asserts that all of these potential options need to be explored as ways to impart critical knowledge. Several examples of these efforts are described below. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

NOTE: SDH = social determinants of health SOURCE: NASEM, 2016a. Educational Efforts by Individual Professions The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medi cal Education sets standards for accrediting U.S. graduate medical education programs and the institutions that sponsor them. The common program requirements for residency govern the pr ofessional development of physicians. Program directors are required to \"desi gn and conduct the [residency] progr am in a fashion consistent with the needs of the community\" (ACGME, 2018, p. 9). Each program \"must understand the social determinants of health of the populations they serve and incorpor ate them in the design and implementation of the program curriculum\" (ACGME, 2018, p. 9). Similarly, \"residents must demonstrate an awareness of and responsivene ss to the larger context and system of health care, including the social determin ants of health, as well as the ability to call effectively on other resources to provide optimal health ca re\" (ACGME, 2018, p. 21). The common program requirements do not specifically addre ss social isolation and loneliness. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing publishes the Essentials documents that delineate expected core outcomes of nursing education at the baccalaureate, masters, and doctor of nursing practice levels (AACN, 2006, 2 008, 2011). While the Essentials documents are broad, they clearly indicate th e expectation that nurses care effectively for all age groups, including older adults. For example, Baccalaureate Essentials (AACN, 2008) st ates that nurses care for people of all age groups, with special atte ntion to \"older adults and the very young\" (p. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.8-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 32). The document also indicates that care should be holistic a nd account for patient and family preferences and community concerns and that pr ofessionalism in nursing involves integrating physical, emotional, and social concerns. Finally, this document indicates that nurses provide a link between hospitals and comm unity environments and suppor ts the importance of nurses' roles in assessing social and ps ychological needs as well as physical health needs and making referrals to community services as needed. Master's and Clinical Doctoral Essentials similarly focuses on comprehensive care based on a full bi opsychosocial model that includes the social determinants of health (AACN, 2006, 2008). Si milarly, the National League for Nursing has identified competencies for graduates of nursi ng education programs that address the full age continuum and a holistic approach to caregiving (AACN, 2011). The Council on Social Work Education's Educ ational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) sets forth guidelines fo r professional competence. These standards are used to accredit baccalaureate and master's level social work programs (CSWE, 2015). The EPAS consists of nine competencies which are guided by a pe rson-in-environment framework, a global perspective, and respect for human diversity (CSWE, 2015). These competencies outline the importance of working with diverse populations within the context of relationship building, interprofessional teamwork, and inter-organizational collaborat ion. Engagement, assessment and intervention occur within the intersectional of mu ltiple factors, including age, class, color, culture, disability and ability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, immigration status, marital status, political ideology, race, religion and spirituality, sex, sexual orientation, and tribal sovereign status. The focus on these fa ctors reinforces the impo rtance of understanding and recognizing the influence of the social dete rminants of health on the lifelong development of individuals (CSWE, 2015). The EPAS outlines the ro le that social workers have in assessing and intervening within a practice c ontext that includes working with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities toward mutu ally agreed-upon goals (CSWE, 2015). These competencies reinforce the expectation that social workers are trained to attend to the social and psychological needs of older adults and their families within the context of health and social service settings. Social workers ar e trained to serve as a bridge to the broader community and are well positioned to make connecti ons between health providers a nd the larger social service community (CSWE, 2015). Additionally, the social work profession, unde r the auspices of the Council on Social Work Education through its Gero Ed Center, de veloped a Geriatric Soci al Work Competency Scale with Lifelong Leadership Skills (CSWE, 2019). This scale lists skills recognized by gerontological social workers as im portant to social workers in thei r work with and on behalf of older adults and their families. Designed to be used at the baccalaureate, master's, and post- masters levels of curriculum, it is used for pr e-post evaluations of edu cation and field training. Students are rated in four areas of competence: 1. Values, ethics, and theo retical perspectives 2. Assessment 3. Intervention 4. Aging services, programs, and policies (CSWE, 2019) The assessment of social support and human c onnections is one of the factors that is included in the assessment competency section. A dding content on social isolation and loneliness to the intervention competence coul d strengthen social work pract itioners' response to at risk older adults.

GWEP provides grants to \"that improve health care for older adults and maximize patient and family engagement to health profes sions schools, health care facilities, and programs leading to certification as a certified nursing assistant.\"3 Key goals of the program are to \"educate and train the primary care and geriatrics wo rkforce to care for older adults in integrated geriatrics and primary care models,\" and \"to pa rtner with community ba sed organizations to address gaps in healthcare for older adults, pr omote age-friendly health systems and dementia- friendly communities, and address the social determinants of health.\"4 Social isolation and loneliness could be explicitly in corporated into some of these programs, particularly as a key social determinant of health. The Role of Certifications Certification exams use standa rds of practice as the basis for exam questions and could include questions about social isolation and loneliness. Specia lty gerontologic certification exams are available in, for example, medici ne, nursing, physical ther apy, psychology, and pharmacy. Certification examinations and credenti als are also available for more specific areas, such as diabetes educators (NCBDE, 2019), alth ough none exist for addre ssing social isolation and loneliness. The development of a certification exam related to preventing and treating social isolation and loneliness either as a stand-alone exam or by includi ng items related to this topic on currently existing gerontologic exam, is a potential opportunity for emphasizing the importance of this area. Direct Care Worker Education and Training Direct care workers are the paid frontline of long-term care in the United States, providing critical, daily support to millions of older people and people with disabilities. As a result, direct care workers, of which ther e were 4.3 million in 2017 (PHI, 2018a), are well positioned to support older people nationwide in a ddressing social isolation and loneliness. As interventions directed at social isolation and loneliness in older a dults gain traction, direct care workers will need to be properly trained, educated, and supported. Governing and shaping the direct care workfo rce are a variety of broad and inconsistent state and federal training requirements in addi tion to an under-resourced training and public education landscape. The current tr aining for the direct care workfo rce rarely explicitly addresses social isolation and lone liness in older adults. Core Competencies Ideally, a set of core competencies\u2014manifes ted as knowledge, skills, and abilities\u2014form the foundation of training for direct care workers, delineating the cap abilities that workers should acquire and demonstrate in order to effectivel y provide care.

All rights reserved.8-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS actors in the long-term care field have created core competency skill sets for direct care workers which vary widely in terms of content areas (and other aspects). While none of these competency sets explicitly address social isolation and loneliness, many of them include related areas that could allow for more focused attention on thes e two topics. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) direct se rvice workforce core competencies includes a competency area of \"community inclusion a nd networking\" (CMS, 2014, p. 7). The following two skill statements are included under that competency area: 1. The direct service worker \"encourages a nd assists individuals in connecting with others and developing social a nd valued social and/or work roles based on his or her choices,\" and 2. The direct service worker \"supports the indivi dual to connect with friends and to live and be included in the community of his or her choice.\" (p. 7) The National Alliance for Direct Support Pr ofessionals' direct support professionals competencies includes a section on \"community living skills and supports \" and notes that \"the competent [direct care worker] supports the par ticipant in the development of friendships and other relationships\" (NADSP, 2016, p. 5). Training Requirements and Credentialing Direct care workers are subject to an array of federal and state training requirements, which vary widely in terms of their durati on and content (among other dimensions) across different direct care occupations, states, and service delivery models.5 While these requirements need significant improvement, they provide opportunities to expand the skills of direct care workers on social isolation, lone liness, and older adults. For ex ample, federal guidelines for home health aides require that the aides must be trained in the \"physical, emotional, and developmental needs of and ways to work with the populations served by the HHA, including the need for respect for the patient, his or her privacy and his or her property.\" 6 Similarly, the federal guidelines for nursing assistants re quire that workers be trained in the \"mental health and social service needs\" of older adults.7 Guidelines for both direct care occupations could specify social isolation and loneliness as priority topics. Personal care aides\u2014the largest-growing segmen t of the direct care workforce\u2014lack any federal training requirement and have few stat e-level requirements (PHI , 2019c). A number of states require the use of state-sponsored curric ula or training outlines that set forth detailed training content for specific segments of the direct care workforce. Compared with broad regulatory requirements, these curr icula and outlines are more pr escriptive in terms of their 5 Federal regulations today require that home health aides an d nursing assistants receive at least 75 hours of training, including at least 16 hours of supervised practical or clinical training. They must also complete 12 hours of continuing education every 12 months. Only 17 states and the District of Columbia surpass this 75-hour requirement, and only 6 states and the District of Colu mbia meet the 120-hour standa rd encouraged by the then- Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2008). Personal care aides ha ve no federal training requirement, and state-level requirements vary considerably, typically with little to no uniformity across programs or requirements on duration, content, and methods (PHI, 2019a,b). 6 42 CFR \u00a7 484.36-Condition of Participation: Home 4504. 7 42 CFR \u00a7 483.152-Requirements for Approval of a Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluation Program.56 FR 48919, 75 FR 21179.

Arizona's Principles of Caregiving curriculum addresses social is olation and loneliness in multiple areas, including in a section on the \"em otional impact of aging\" (Arizona Direct Care Initiative, 2011). Washington State's state-spons ored curriculum encourages home care aides to help consumers stay socially connected. The curricul um also emphasizes the aide's role in the emotional well-being of c onsumers (WSDSHS, 2009). Maine's personal support specialist curriculum refers trainees to a companion textbook for content on social isolation (MDHS, 2003). Other Members of the Health Care Workforce Aside from health care profe ssionals and direct care worker s, many other members of the health care workforce may be especially important to addressing social isolation and loneliness since they are natural connectors of the heal th care system with the local communities. Community health workers (CHWs) are \"lay me mbers of the community who work either for pay or as volunteers in associ ation with the local health care system in both urban and rural environments. CHWs usually share ethnicit y, language, socioeconomic status, and life experiences with the community members they serve\" (NIH, 2014). CHWs have been shown to be particularly effective in creating linkages between communities and the health care system and in providing health education and info rmal counseling, particularly for underserved communities (HRSA, 2007). While CHWs typically come from the communities in which they serve and often serve as advocates for the indivi duals in these communities, patient navigators (or patient advocates) tend to be based within the health care sy stem. Patient navigators help patients acquire necessary information and services that may affect their health care (NCI, 2011). For example, patient navigators may assist patients with settin g up appointments, reaching out to insurers, and connecting to needed social s upports. Case managers (or care managers) focus particularly on coordinating health and social care for individuals with complex needs either in health care systems or with so cial service agencies (NASEM, 2019). These health care workers and others can serve an important role in c onnecting the health care system with community- based services. PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS Public education campaigns can be a power ful method for raising awareness of and support for key issues, among other objectives. Fo r example, public education campaigns have addressed various health topics , including tobacco use; nutriti on, physical activity, and obesity; heart disease and stroke; diabetes; and Alzhei mer's disease, among others (NIH, 2019).

Public education campaigns are often undertak en by specific health care professions and occupations. For example, nonprofit organizations in the direct care sector have used public education campaigns to: focus attention on the growing workforce s hortage in home care at the national and state levels, support specific policy goals, reach workers with information about their rights and benefits, and explore future solutions for the full eldercare workforce (EWA, 2019; PHI, 2018b, 2019d). The following sections highlight examples of the use of campaigns to spread awareness of issues related to aging in general as well as social isola tion and loneliness in particular. Public Education and Framing Strategies for Aging Public education campaigns have been increas ingly used in the aging and long-term-care sector to raise awareness about the realities of aging, the variet y of challenges and opportunities facing older people, and the demand for a strong eldercare workforce. In recent years, these campaigns have sought, among other goals, to ch ange perceptions of aging through personal stories of older people, to connect the millennial generation to aging-related concerns, and to inspire policy makers to address the worsening shortage in home care workers (Snelling, 2019). More broadly, an extensive body of research and applied practic e exists to guide communications planning, strate gy, and evaluation acro ss social issues, id entifying effective techniques for defining and establishing clea r goals, objectives, audi ences, and evaluation measures. When designed properly, public ed ucation campaigns can shape public policy by raising awareness, increasing the numbers of champions and supporters, building constituents, strengthening public will, and sp arking policy change. These campaigns can also influence such characteristics as awareness, salience, attit udes and beliefs, self-effi cacy, social norms, and behavioral intention and change (Communications Network, 2008). Furthermore, social scientists and strategi c communications experts have recently created and tested a variety of appro aches to promoting strong, positiv e messaging regarding health and older adults and to reducing harm ful ideas that perpetuate proble matic representations of older adults. This emerging trend bu ilds on a body of research and practice focused on \"collective action framing\" in social movements worldwide\u2014 intentional, large-scale efforts to transform how the public at large understa nds societal problems, solutions, and related actions (Benford and Snow, 2000). Two current exampl es related to health and aging are an effort to provide guidance on how to discuss the social determin ants of health, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the Refram ing Aging Project, which seek s to improve messaging about aging and to reduce ageism, led by the Frameworks Institute, a nonprofit organization focused on advancing ways to communicate about science (FrameWorks Institute, 2019; RWJF, 2010). The two efforts both created research-tested approaches and practical tools for the public and private sectors to frame concerns about health (the RW JF project) and aging (FrameWorks), guiding the creation of effective, strength- based narratives on the topics. Of note, the Reframing Aging Project was steered by a group of leading organizations in the ag ing services field: AARP, the Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Despite the potential and the pr oliferation of these types of approaches, researchers and communications strategists have not produced an y easily available, research-tested frames, messages, or communications campaigns and tool s that are specific to social isolation and loneliness in older adults\u2014a fact that limits strategic, collecti ve action on this pressing concern. Education by Campaigns and Coalitions Speci fically for Social Isolation and Loneliness As the complexities of mitigating isolation and loneliness are increasingly acknowledged, some stakeholders support large-scale campaigns and coalitions to disseminate information and best practices. The increased visibility from su ch media campaigns has the potential to change public attitudes and social norms, which in turn could indirectly influe nces behavior change (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2017). Campaign to End Loneliness (UK) The Campaign to End Loneliness, a larg e-scale media campaign, was founded in the United Kingdom in 2011 with the goal of sharing research, evidence, and knowledge in order to connect individuals and communities across the country (Campaign to End Loneliness, 2019b). The campaign is hosted by Independent Age, a ch aritable organization focused on the well-being of older people, and it is supported by the National Lottery Community Fund, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the Tudor Trust, and dona tions from the general public. The campaign has created a series of toolkits , research briefs, and events to raise awareness among public health and health care practitione rs about the deleterious health effects of social isolation and loneliness. The campaign has also created the Learning Network (Campaign to End Loneliness, 2019c), which links like-minded orga nizations, distributes the latest research on social isolation and loneliness, and shares examples of best pr actices for addressing loneliness, but does not necessarily perform evidence-ba sed assessments of these practices on their own. The campaign has been relatively successful in distributing in formation and bringing lone liness to the front of public discourse. An evaluation of the campai gn's outreach efforts found that 84 percent of National Health Service health and well-being bo ards targeted by the campaign had implemented written strategies for addre ssing loneliness (Cupitt, 2013). AARP Connect 2 Affect The AARP Foundation has partnered with the Ge rontological Society of America, Give an Hour, N4a, and United Healthcare to launch a campaign, Connect 2 Aff ect, to address social isolation and loneliness (AARP Fo undation, 2019). The major goal of the campaign is to create a network of resources that meets the needs of a nyone who is isolated or lonely and that helps build the social connections that older adults need to thrive. The campaign has helped to increase awareness of the impact of social isolation and loneliness on older adults, to provide information on service and training resources, and to crea te networks. The National Good Neighbor Day8 is an example of a community impact activ ity associated with this campaign. 8 For more on the National Good Neighbor Day, s ee https://connect2affect.org /goodneighborday (accessed December 18, 2019).

All rights reserved.8-14 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS CHANGING PRACTICE BEHAVIORS While education is one method for catalyzi ng change, dissemination and implementation science has shown that an individual's (or gr oup's) knowledge of what to do is never enough to institutionalize and sustain change. (For more on dissemination and implementation, see Chapter 10.) Educating users about evidence-based practices (EBPs) is a necessary but not sufficient step to change practice, and didactic education al one does little to cha nge practice behavior (Forsetland et al., 2009; Gigu\u00e8re et al., 2012). Users of the EBPs need to know the scientific bases for EBP recommendations and to have the knowledge and skill s to carry out such practices, and health system design and payor policies need to support the implementation of these recommendations. Lifelong learning opportunities are vital for the ongoing de velopment of health care workers who interact with older a dults. Given that the evidence ba se is continuing to develop in the area of social isolation and loneliness, th ose working with older adults, families, and communities will need ways to lear n about future research developments in this area. Multiple modalities are available for lifelong learning, including just -in-time learning, Web-based modules and webinars, other forms of online learning, conference presentations, and journal articles (IOM, 2009). Certain roles and responsibiliti es already present in health systems can be modified to address social isolation and loneliness in ol der adults. Discharge planning, case management, and transitional care planning are examples of the sorts of roles and functions that can be used to directly address the assessment of and interventi ons for social isolation and loneliness. Discharge planning and case management are most often provi ded by social workers and registered nurses. Transitional care planning may be provided by advanced practic e nurses and masters-prepared social workers (Altfeld et al., 2013; Alverez et al., 2016; Eaton, 2018; Naylor et al., 2018). For instance, Naylor et al. (2018) developed a transitional care model designed to prevent rehospitalizations and health complications in ol der adults with chronic illnesses. An advance practice nurse provides a thorough a ssessment prior to the discharge and leads the discharge and home follow-up process. Given th e extensive nature of the pre- discharge assessment, screening for social isolation and loneline ss could be integrated into the assessment process. If social isolation and loneliness are detect ed in the screening, interventi on and follow-up could occur in the community as part of the community visits. In the Bridge model (Altfeld et al., 2013; Al varez et al., 2016) a so cial worker with a master's degree connects with the patient and fam ily prior to discharge. Inpatient and outpatient providers are also connected with the patient and family to reinforce the continuity of care. This model encourages attention to the social dete rminants of health, and as social needs are identified, the social work care coordinator a ddresses them in both h ealth care and community- based settings. Using this model, social isol ation and loneliness coul d be identified before discharge and addressed throughout the care transiti on process and as the patient integrates back into the community. For example, current team-b ased models for identifying frail patients in hospitals (through the use of multi-dimensional assessments) could serve as models for the identification of social isolati on and loneliness in the inpatient setting (Ansryan et al., 2018; Borenstein et al., 2013, 2016). Stra ssner et al. (2019) describe a study planned in Germany that will prepare general practitioners to provide holistic disease management services for frail older adults. These services will include assessments of loneliness, suggesting that the inclusion of this aspect of managing chronic condi tions is gaining interest. Team -based approaches to helping Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING 8-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS older adults manage care over a period of time provide multiple perspectives for incorporating social isolation and loneliness into care plans. (See Chapter 7 for more on the role of the health care system.) As noted in the 2019 National Academies consensus study report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care , \"Understanding the ro le each member of an interprofessional team plays . . . is important for ensuring eff ective collaboration among team members and for maximizing their ability to address patients' so cial needs\" (NASEM, 2019, p. 77). This approach can be adopted when designing education and trai ning models to address social isolation and loneliness. Collaboration and coordination among all members of a health professional team is a critical component in educati on and training initiatives. Health Systems: Academic-Clinical Partnerships Academic-clinical partnerships can catalyze evidence-based practice (Noel et al., 2019). Education and research on the causes and outcomes of social isolation and loneliness in older adults, screening tools, assessment strategies, an d effective interventions need to be connected with clinical practice in ways that accelerate improvements in pr actice, change systems of care when needed, influence payment systems, increa se health, and highlight successful teamwork among health professionals, direct care wo rkers, and community members. The 2016 report Advancing Healthcare Transformati on: A New Era for Academic Nursing highlights the importance of intentional and systematic academia-practice partnerships in catalyzing improvements in nursing care (AACN, 2016). Albe rti et al. (2018) noted that action planning with communities is more likely to generate la sting results in health equity than are less intentional partnerships. The use of relevant clinical guidelines, such as those promulgated by the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing's Depression in Older Adults (Harvath and McKenzie, 2012), and the development of specific guidelines ta rgeted to the treatment of social isolation and loneliness in older adults can help improve practice. Boston College's Institute on Aging is another example of an academic-practice partne rship, with its emphasis on interdisciplinary education, research, and community partnerships . One product of this Institute is BC Talks Aging,9 which is a series of modules with free access, developed by es tablished scholars on topics related to aging, and one of these modul es specifically addresse s social isolation and loneliness. The aim of BC Talks Aging is to provide learning opportunitie s on aging issues for social workers, nurses, and other health practitioners in the field (BCIA, 2019). Partnerships between clinical organizations and community organizations are essential to ensuring that a full range of serv ices and care are available for ol der adults at risk for social isolation and loneliness. Th e 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care notes the importance of developing cr oss-sector coaliti ons and describes the success of multi-sector coalitions in impr oving health delivery. One successful partnership described in the report was between Johns H opkins University and the Homewood Community Partners Initiative, which led to the establishm ent of health enterprise zones, aligning and increasing activity coordination with health de partments, health providers, and community organizations. The impact of this partnership was a reduction in inpatient hos pital visits resulting in a net cost savings of $93.39 million (NASEM, 2019). 9 For more information on BC Talks Ag ing, see https://www.bc. edu/centers/ioa/videos.htm l (accessed December 17, 2019).

All rights reserved.8-16 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Health Systems: Payor -Clinical Partnerships Critical to the adoption of c linical interventions is unde rstanding payor policies and inviting payors to the table when changes may be needed. The 2018 Alliance of Community Health Plans (ACHP) report Accelerating the Adoption of Evid ence-Based Care: Payer Provider Partnerships found that collaboration among high-perform ing health plans to influence provider behavior can accelerate the dissemination and adoption of evidence- based practices. Although the research by ACHP did not sp ecifically address social isolation and loneliness, the report highlighted examples of consensu s building, customized education, tools, and access to extensive training as a means to disseminate and promote accelerated delivery of evidence-based care best practices across diverse types of payor -provider partnershi ps (ACHP, 2018). The 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care concludes that if social care is to be properly addressed in h ealth care, health care financing structures need to recognize th e importance of the unique contri butions of team members and to ensure adequate reimbursement of c linical partnerships (NASEM, 2019). FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Educating health care professionals, direct care workers, and th e general public on the health impacts of social isola tion and loneliness is essential. National standards and policy priorities influe nce the education of the formal health care workforce. Social isolation and lone liness can be incorporated into these standards and priorities in order to rais e awareness and educate current and future health professionals about these topics. Formal and informal education, lifelong learning, and educational campaigns can catalyze change by facilitating learners' know ledge of the risk factors for social isolation and loneliness and how to pr event and ameliorate these problems. Despite limited research on the effectivene ss of selected interventions for social isolation and loneliness, health professionals need to learn core content in areas such as the prevalence of social is olation and loneliness, morbidity and mortality related to social isolation and loneliness, risk factors, assessment st rategies, referral options and processes for making and following up on refe rrals, ways to support and encourage older adults and their signif icant others, partnering with community agencies, and program development and evaluation. This content crosses disciplinary lines and could be included in team-based instruction. No certification credential currently exists for health professionals who address social isolation and loneliness in older adults. A unique certifi cation process or questions added to existing gerontologic certificat ion exams could motivate more health professionals to address these topics in depth. Direct care workers are the paid frontline of long-term care in the United States and are well positioned to support older peopl e in addressing social isolation and loneliness. Providing educati on and training to these work ers about social isolation and loneliness is essentia l to their ongoing work. Although personal care aides are a growing segment of the direct care workforce, there is a lack of federal and state traini ng requirements for this sector. Instructive Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING 8-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS curricula and outlines for personal care aides should be created or updated in order to recognize social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Researchers and communications strategists in the United States have not produced easily available, research-tested frames, me ssages, or communications campaigns and tools specific to social isolation and lonelin ess in older adults, which limits strategic, collective action on this issue. Addressing social isolation a nd loneliness is a community-wid e concern and requires that health professionals, direct care workers, and members of the community work together to achieve solutions. NEXT STEPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Broadly based workforce development needs to account for the entire range of the health care workforce within formal degree and postgradua te programs for health professionals and in training programs for direct care workers and community members. Education and training of the health care workforce about addressing soci al isolation and loneli ness will require a broad approach similar to the one used to educat e the workforce about addressing the social determinants of health. It will be necessary to educate and train all members of the health care workforce, including professionals, direct care workers, community health workers, volunteers, family caregivers, and members of the larger community, such as police officers and mail carriers, who provide a broad arra y of services to or regularly interact with older adults. Improving Overall Awareness The 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care noted that \"activities seeking to increase social and health care integr ation frequently begin with elevating and sustaining awar eness about the influence of soci al risk and protective factors on health outcomes\" (NASEM, 2019, p. 36). Based on the significant evidence base concerning the health and medical impacts of social isola tion and loneliness (see Chapters 2 and 3), the committee concluded that, as with other public hea lth issues of the same magnitude, a critical step toward preventing, mitigating, or eliminati ng those impacts will be to improve awareness among the general public and, specifically for this report, among the health care workforce itself. The committee therefore offers the follo wing goal and related recommendations. GOAL: Improve awareness of the health and medical impact of social isolation and loneliness across the health care work force and among members of the public. RECOMMENDATION 8-1: The U.S. Departme nt of Health and Human Services should advocate for including measures of social isolation and loneliness in major large-scale health strategies (e.g., Healthy People) and surveys (e.g., National Health Interview Survey) RECOMMENDATION 8-2: Health and aging organizations, relevant government agencies, and consumer-facing organizations should create public awareness and education campaigns that highlight the he alth impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.8-18 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Health care systems, associations re presenting all types of health care workers (e.g., American Medical Associat ion, American Nurses Association, American Psychological Association, Nati onal Association of Social Workers, American Geriatrics Society, American A ssociation for Geriatric Psychiatry, associations representing direct care wo rkers); health-related organizations (e.g., American Heart Association), consumer-facing health-related organizations (e.g., AARP), aging profe ssional associations (e.g., American Society on Aging, Gerontological Soci ety of America), aging services organizations (e.g., area agencies on agi ng, state departments on aging), and organizations working with at-risk older adults (e.g., National Hispanic Council on Aging) should actively comm unicate information about the health impacts of social isolat ion and loneliness through print and digital media. Organizations representing health plans and providers should include consumer-friendly information about the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness in their repository of patient resources (e.g., where the organization provides information abou t the self-management of various chronic diseases). A large-scale, public-private sector investment could bu ild awareness and support among the various clinicians, direct care employers and workers, and community members about the need to address social isolati on and loneliness in older adults , creating a groundswell to develop comprehensive training and educat ional programs. These types of campaigns could have several audiences and purposes. For example, given that direct care workers often have the most interaction with the most vulnera ble populations of older adults, the direct care sector could create public education campaigns that build aw areness and support among direct care employers and workers about the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness. In addition, groups such as the Frameworks Institute c ould create a research-based fr aming strategy\u2014similar to initiative\u2014that assists in de veloping effective, strength-based frames and messages on social isolation and loneliness in older adults, including more vulnerable populations. Strengthening Education and Training While research-based eviden ce is not yet available to support curricular content on specific interventions for social isolation and loneliness in older adults (see Chapter 9), enough is known about the health impacts to warrant broa d curricular recommendati ons for all health professions and careers. Health pr ofessions students need to learn about the prevalence of social isolation and loneliness in older a dults, about its health outcomes a nd risk factors, and also about how to assess for these problems. The move to ward more comprehensive geriatric assessments by interprofessional teams (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2016) provides an ideal opportunity for evaluating social isolation and l oneliness. One example of an evidence-based assessment guide that can be helpful is Fulmer SPICES, which was developed as part of the Nurses Improving Care for Health System Elders project (Fulmer, 2007). This guide provid es assessment criteria for hospitalized older adults for six key problem s: \"sleep problems, problems with eating and feeding, incontinence, confusion, evidence of fall s, and skin breakdown\" (p. 40). While social isolation and loneliness are not included, each of these key problems can lead to or result from social isolation and loneliness and can indicate the need to look more deeply into causative Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EDUCATION AND TRAINING 8-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS factors and outcomes. The Fulmer SPICES tool can be used in conjunction with an evidenced- based assessment tool that assesses social isol ation and loneliness to gauge the influence of social isolation and lone liness on patient health. Health professionals also need to learn how to work directly with older adults and their significant others to support a nd encourage ways to prevent or reduce social isolation and loneliness. They need to know how to make a nd follow up on referrals to community services that may be helpful or that may specifically be intended to address social isolation and loneliness. This includes learning to work with direct care workers (e .g., home health aides, personal care workers), community health work ers, family caregivers, and lay community members as part of a team-based approach to he lping older adults. They also need to learn how to work with community partners to develop, im plement, and evaluate programs for preventing and ameliorating social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Competency in each of these areas will become increasingly important for he alth professionals as systems of care are developed for preventing and inte rvening with social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Therefore, the committee offers the following goal and recommendations: GOAL: Strengthen ongoing education and training related to social isolation and loneliness in older adults for the health care workforce. RECOMMENDATION 8-3: Health professions schools and colleges as well as direct care worker training programs should incl ude education and training related to social isolation and loneliness in their curr icula, optimally as interprofessional team- based learning experiences. Health education and training programs should include information on clinical approaches to assessing and intervening when an older adult is at risk for social isolation and loneliness. As evidence on effective interventions develops, health education and training programs should provide education on inte grating care related to social isolation and loneliness into clinical practice a nd as part of discharge planning, care coordination, and transitional care pl anning with community organizations. RECOMMENDATION 8-4: Health professional associations should incorporate information about the health and medical im pacts of social isol ation and loneliness on older adults in their advocacy, pr actice, and education initiatives. Health professional associations should include social isolation and loneliness in conference programming, webinars, toolkits , clinical guidelines, and advocacy priorities. RECOMMENDATION 8-5: Health profes sional associations, membership organizations, academic institutions, health insurers, researchers, developers of education and training program s, and other actors in th e public and private sectors should support, develop, and test differe nt educational and training approaches related to the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults across different segments of the heal th care workforce (including health care professionals and direct care workers) in orde r to determine the most effective ways Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.8-20 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS to enhance competencies. In addition to in itial clinical education, these approaches should apply to professional educatio n, continuing education modules, online learning, and other forms of lifelong learning. Concerning the above recommendations the committee notes that, as discussed in Chapter 10, depending upon the complexity of the knowledge to be disseminated or the evidence-based practices to be implemented, a va riety of teaching strategi es can be considered, including train-the-trainer ograms, high-fidelity 2018a; Titler and A nderson, 2019). Additionally, resource materials could be made available to faculty for inclusion in health professions courses. This information should be included in formal education progr ams, continuing education, and just-in-time learning. Other educational opportun ities include the dissemination of information and resource availability through presentations at scientific meetings and we binars, publications in peer- reviewed journals, toolkits, and other forms of media. Toolkits should contain enough detail for use in practice, including modules, slides, reading materials, interactive exercises, case studies, and other tools that can support a variety of health professional education programs. Real-time and archived webinars and podcasts with faculty development materials to support the inclusion of content and learning activit ies could be helpful. Aside from developing educational opportunities specific to social is olation and loneliness, the comm ittee recognizes that there are existing educational opportunities th at could incorporate issues of social isolation and loneliness, such as those focused on the social determinants of health and those that address the inclusion of social care needs into clinical practice. Finally, as the evidence for interventions evolves, these educational and training opportunities need to expand to include new and updated evidence- based practices for preventing, assessing, and trea ting the negative health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneliness.

This chap ter first describes a number of la rge-scale efforts to review the effectiveness of interventions for social isol ation or loneliness, with a focus on several approaches that are specific to health care sett ings. Next, the role of technology is considered, both as an intervention to ol and a factor that exacerbates or contributes to soci al isolation and loneliness. Then ethical issues pertaining to inte rventions are discussed an d potential sources of funding for interventions are explored. The comm ittee notes that educational approaches and awareness campaigns may be considered a type of intervention; howev er, these topics are covered in Chapter 8. Finally, the committee sugg ests ways to reframe interventions along a public health approach. Given the complexity of the terminology used in relation to social isolation and loneliness, a reminder of ke y definitions is provided in Box 9-1. BOX 9-1 Key Definitions Loneliness : the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely. Mediators : also known as mechanisms or pathways; the factors that help explain how social isolation or loneliness affects health outcomes. Moderators : the factors that can influence the magnitude or direction of the effect of social isolation or loneliness on health. Social connection : an umbrella term that encompasses the structural, functional, and quality aspects of how individuals connect to each other. Social isolation : the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Social support : the actual or perceived availability of resources (e.g., informational, tangible, emotional) from others, typically one's social network. LARGE-SCALE REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS Several studies and projects ha ve examined interventions intended to ameliorate social isolation or loneliness sp ecifically, or their associated health impacts; these interventions have generally not been limited to health care prov iders or settings (see Table 9-1). An extensive Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-2 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS review of all interventions for social isolation and l oneliness outside of the health care setting (e.g., efforts to create intergenerational comm unities) is beyond the scope of this report. However, the committee discusses these large-scale reviews here for two r easons: first, most of these large-scale reviews do not separate inte rventions by setting and therefore the committee wanted to capture as much evidence on the eff ectiveness of interventions as possible; second, health care professionals and others will likely need to be aware of efforts in the community for possible referral. Most of these large-scale re views note the poor quality of the evidence concerning the effectiveness of such interventions. In partic ular, the authors of these reviews note several weaknesses in the study designs, in cluding a lack of long-term fo llow-up, a limited range of ages included among \"older adults,\" vari ability in the definitions of so cial isolation and loneliness, variability in the measurement tools and outcome measures used, and small sample sizes. Several studies reported that successful interventions tended to have certain key features, including the active participation of older adults, having an educational focus, and using a group-based approach. In addition to reviews in the published literature, there have been other efforts to assess interventions for social isolati on and loneliness among older adults (again, not limited to health care settings). The committee summarizes several of these efforts other than the studies listed in Table 9-1 in the following sections. AARP Foundation Catalog Project The AARP Foundation commissioned Jessica Retr um of Metropolitan State University to do research toward the ultimate goal of creating \"an interactive tool de signed to serve as a resource catalog for evidence-based or promisi ng practices to address loneliness and social isolation in older adults.\" 1 In her analysis, Retrum examined both published and unpublished interventions.

Furthermore, Retrum noted3 the following persistent cha llenges to the evaluation of interventions for social isolation and loneliness: A limited number of studies quantifyi ng the impact of interventions; A tr ials and quasi-expe rimental studies; Variability in the concepts being measured; A targeting of either the general community or individuals who are \"easy to find\"; and Difficulty in recruiting those who ar e extremely isolated or lonely. The committee noted that many of these st udies, both published and unpublished, did not indicate that they had used a validated tool (as described in Chapter 6). Rather, many of these interventions assessed impact th rough qualitative interviews, su rveys, and internally designed measurement tools. AHRQ Rapid Review In 2019 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducted a review to \"rapidly evaluate the effect of interventions ta rgeting social isolation/loneliness in community- dwelling older adults (60 years and older) on outcome s of social isolation /loneliness, health, and health care utilization\" (Veazie et al., 2019). Th e researchers focused on 16 individual studies, but only half of these studies were deemed to be of good or fair quality. Ultimately, the researchers found limited evidence th at the interventions significantly affected health outcomes. Two studies related to health se rvices access interventions were found to be of poor quality. The researchers noted several challe nges overall with the evidence base, including differences in constructs and measures, the overall poor qual ity of the studies (based on their quality assessments of study design), short follow-up peri ods, a lack of measur ement of health care utilization or potential harms, a nd a failure to control for confounde rs. The researchers also noted that most studies were conducted outside of the United States. The report includes several recommendations for improving the quality of the evidence base, including: \"Collaborate with health systems, payers , and patient advocacy groups to agree upon standardized definitions and measures fo r social isolation and loneliness.

Campaign to End Loneliness The United Kingdom's Campaign to End Loneliness (see more in Chapter 8) noted that \"in recent years there have been a number of atte mpts to bring together what is known about the effectiveness of loneliness interv entions, however the conclusions drawn have been partial, and often contradictory\" (Jopling, 2015). As a result, th e campaign assembled an expert panel to hear about promising loneliness interventions happeni ng in communities that may not have been captured in the published literature. While conc eding that they found \"a lack of high quality evidence to demonstrate the impact of different interventions on loneliness,\" the members of the expert panel suggested that \"evidence exists on a spectrum, and even where the evidence is of a lower quality it can be an important step in th e development of a firmer understanding of what works\" (p. 8). The expert panel identified a vari ety of approaches that held the most promise, grouping them into four types of interventions: foundation services, direct interventions, gateway services, and structural enablers. However, most of these approaches have little evidence to support their effectiveness. Foundation Services The campaign describes foundation services as the first steps \"coming before and providing a way into the more commonly recognized loneline ss interventions\" (Jopling, 2015, p. 9) and focus on three main challenges surrounding the uptake and effectiveness of interventions. First, reaching individuals includes using data to identify individuals at high risk; training individuals in a community to r ecognize signs of loneliness, make referrals, and provide support; and linking interventions to health care. (See Chap ter 7 for more on the role of the health care system.) Second, understanding the nature of an individual' s loneliness and developing a personalized response includes guided discussi ons in which the individual's circumstances, needs, and wishes are identified. One key factor is the individual's trust in the person asking questions. Finally, supporting lonely individuals to access appropriate services includes providing links to a \"trusted buddy or mentor\" (J opling, 2015). The expert panel felt the most effective approaches were framed as \"holistic and person-centred services, aimed at promoting healthy and active ageing, building resilien ce and supporting independence\" that could be tailored to address loneliness (Jopling, 2015, p. 12) . The expert panel reco gnized the lack of a robust evidence base for the effectiveness of these approaches and suggested that these approaches warranted further study. Direct Interventions While the expert panel preferred more \"hol istic approaches,\" they also considered interventions that seek to addr ess loneliness directly. These in clude \"supporting individuals to reconnect with and/or maintain existing relati onships, fostering and enabling new connections, and helping people to change their thinking a bout their social conn ections\" (Jopling, 2015, p. 25).

All rights reserved.9-8 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS It is clear the vast majority of loneliness interventions currently available seek to reduce loneliness by increasing the quantity and quality of relationships, and most do this by supporting individuals to deve lop new relationships. Most experts believed that these kinds of interventions were effective in tackling loneliness, but few held up specific examples as showi ng significant promise over others. Instead they argued that any and all such interv entions could be helpful if they were chosen by the older person and well-suited to their needs (hence the importance of the foundation services). Ma ny experts talked about the need for communities to offer a menu of such a pproaches. (Jopling, 2015, p. 10) Experts varied in their opinions about whether group interventions or one-on-one approaches were more effective. The experts agre ed that the most effec tive direct group-based interventions target a specific gr oup, focus on a shared interest (o r on education), and include the older individuals in the planning pr ocess. They also felt that some people had significant barriers to making connections, and so, in spite of the la ck of evidence, they recognized the importance of one-on-one approaches such as \"befriending.\" Gateway Services Gateway services are services such as tran sportation and technology th at can affect social connection. In particular, the lack of access to such services coul d also impede the effectiveness of broader interventions. (See se ction below on access to technology.) Structural Enablers Structural enablers are defined by the cam paign as approaches that consider the environmental factors needed within communities to help reduce loneliness. These approaches are often used in conjunction with other interven tions and include working with an asset-based community development approach (wherein the intervention identi fies and takes advantages of community assets instead of identifying commun ity needs), promoting volunteerism, and using age-friendly approaches (see more on age-friendly health systems later in this chapter). TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS RELEVANT TO THE HE ALTH CARE SYSTEM Although the terms \"treatment\" and \"intervention\" are often used synonymously, they actually refer to different things. An individual suffering from an illness or disease receives treatment from a health care provider to mitigate the disease and its symptoms. Interventions , on the other hand, are designed to improve health status or encourage behavior change and are applied in the larger commun ity by public health authorities (WHO, 2019b). While only a few treatments have been suggested to mitigate so cial isolation or loneliness, a variety of interventions targeting isolation a nd loneliness have been proposed. Direct interventions are those that explicitly target soci al isolation, loneliness, or related social concepts. Direct interventions can fall in to one of several categories: changing cognition, social skills training and psyc hoeducation, supported socialization, and wider community groups which create a broader sense of so cial integration (Mann et al., 2017). Outside of the health care system, these types of interven tions often include one-on-one be friending approaches in which volunteers reach out through phone calls to individua ls identified as being socially isolated or Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS lonely. Within the health care system, this may include reaching out to individuals identified as being at risk for social isolat ion or loneliness in order to c onnect them to needed services. Alternatively, interventions may include conveni ng groups of at-risk individuals, in part to provide opportunities for social interaction. However, these types of approaches do not necessarily help individuals de velop high-quality relationships, a nd lonely people in particular may withdraw, for example, due to an unconsci ous predisposition or hype rvigilance to social threat (Caciopppo et al., 2015a,b). Indirect interventions are those that do not specifica lly aim to mitigate isolation or loneliness but may nonetheless have significant effects on an indivi dual's perceived or objective isolation (Mann et al., 2017). For example, a physician may recomme nd hearing aids to assist an individual with impaired hearing; as a result, the individual may find it easier to interact in social environments and make connections with ot hers, thereby reducing social isolation and loneliness. Similarly, participation in an exercise program for health may lead to reductions in social isolation or loneliness due to the social nature of the program rather than the exercise itself. The following sections describe several types of interventions that aim to address social isolation or loneliness that are particularly relevant fo r the health care system. Social Prescribing No agreed-upon definition of social prescrib ing currently exists, though it is widely accepted that social prescribing helps patients access non-clinical sources of support, which are often provided by the community sector (Moffatt et al., 2017). Social prescribing has been defined as a \"non-medical referral , or linking service, to help pe ople identify thei r social needs and develop 'well-being' action plans to promote, establish, or re-establish integration and support in their communities, with the aim of improving personal wellbeing\" (Carnes et al., 2017, p. 2). While community-based organizati ons have traditionally employed social prescribing as a way to help s upport individuals in their communities, social prescribing has been suggested as a way for health care practitioners to respond to isolation and loneliness in their patients. In her comments to this committee in 2018, Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in the Un ited Kingdom, described soci al prescribing as \"a fancy name for what good doctors have always d one, which is navigate our patients towards other resources outside of the health care sector that can help them.\"4 Community-based organizations have long used this approach. For the purposes of this report, social prescribing will refer to the steps that health care providers can take to link patients with existing social services programs. Connecting people with voluntee r organizations and community groups has the potential to affect health and well-being both directly (e.g., lowering stress) and indirectly (e.g., improving access to social services) and may be seen as a way of extending primary care (South et al., 2008). Social prescribing attempts to preven t worsening health by commissioning secondary services that can help allevi ate social concerns which aff ect health (e.g., food or housing insecurity), thereby reducing the costly interventi ons provided in specialist or inpatient settings (Dayson and Bashir, 2014). 4 Video presentation by Helen Stokes-Lampard to the commi ttee.

All rights reserved.9-10 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Various interventions to mitigate the negative effects of isolation and loneliness fall within the realm of the community sector. Co mmunity-based groups such as social welfare systems, community organizations, religious groups, and government groups may be natural partners for the health care syst em when it comes to addressing social isolation and loneliness. Because social prescribing is tailored to exis ting voluntary and community-sector-led programs, it is believed to result in better social and c linical outcomes for people with chronic conditions and their caretakers, a more cost-effici ent way to use health and social care5 resources, and a wider and more diverse and responsive local pr ovider base (Dayson and Bashir, 2014). However, despite the promising nature of many community -based programs, this type of support often remains underused due to the weak or nonexisten t link between health care practitioners and community-based services (South et al., 2008). Different models of social prescribing interventions are presented in Box 9-2. Little evidence exists concerning the results of social prescribing interventions on social isolation and loneliness, and what evidence does exist is mixed (Moffatt et al., 2017). However, social prescribing interventions do have a number of promising features , including that they are long- term in nature, they address the existence of mental and physical comorbidities and social isolation simultaneously, they ta rget specific groups (e.g., wome n, caretakers, or people with diabetes), they involve affected individuals in the intervention design process, and they address related socioeconomic issues (Centre for Polic y on Ageing, 2014; Moffatt et al., 2017; Polley et al., 2016). 5 Social care refers to \"services that address h ealth-related social risk f actors and social needs.\" Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The conceptual basis of PLANS was the notion that the needs of people with chronic health conditions cannot be adequa tely met through small ta rgeted interventions that are not integrated into ev eryday life. The website included a self-assessment questionnaire, the results of which provided users with a tailored set of social a nd health resources available in BOX 9-2 Models of Social Prescribing (SP) Model 1: Information service This service is an information-only service, with advertising and directory access to SP in a primary care practice. Model 2: Information service and telephone line This service advertises SP on leaflets and notice boards in the primary care practice. Based on this information, patients can self-initiate a telephone discussion with a worker. Model 3: Primary care referral Primary health care professionals assess patients during consultation and refer them to SP services if appropriate\u2014for example, if patients have nonclinical issues and require psychosocial support. Referrals to SP services are opportunistic. Model 4: Practice-based general care worker Primary care patients can be referred by health workers or self-refer to an SP link worker. Clinics are held in the general practice surgery so that it can act as a \"one stop shop.\" Model 5: Practice-based specialist referral worker A specialist worker works from primary care practice, and patients can be referred through primary care referral or self-referral. Direct advice and specific services, such as Citizens Advice, may be offered, as well as referral or signposting onwards. Model 6: Non-primary-care-based referral worker Patients are referred to an external referral center by primary care practice staff, offering one-to-one facilitation, for example, and outreach service or set in the community.

The resources were grouped into the areas of providing relevant health information, well-being (time spent doing meaningf ul and enjoyable thin gs), practical support (help with every day, independent living), and servic es related to diet and exercise (Blickem, et al., 2013). Another example of a social prescribing system was piloted in Rotherham, United Kingdom, from 2012 to 2014, with the aim of increas ing the capacity of gene ral practitioners to meet the non-clinical needs of patients with lo ng-term conditions. The pilot employed a team of voluntary and community sector advisors who re ceived referrals from general practitioners, completed an assessment of referred individual s to identify their needs, and then linked individuals with appropriate social services. Referrals were made to a variety of social service providers, and the services addressing isola tion or loneliness included befriending services, group activity programs, home visits, and group ther apy sessions. An analysis of the pilot found that among the patients who received social pr escribing services, inpatient admissions were reduced as much as 21 percent and accident and emergency attendance were reduced by as much as 20 percent (Dayson and Bashir , 2014). However, the sample si ze and length of the pilot were both small, so these results were not statistically significant. Support Groups and Group Membership In general, peer support groups, such as t hose for individuals with a common illness or condition in common, have proved to be of valu e. For social isolati on and loneliness, group interventions may be aimed directly at those who are socially isolat ed or lonely. One approach is to provide guidance for improving social skills (Masi et al., 2011). For example, a \"friendship enrichment program\" in the Netherlands (which in cluded training in skills re levant to friendship) which was aimed at women aged 55 and older resu lted in 63 percent of th e participants reporting having made new friends through social and edu cation activities (compared to 33 percent among women who did not participate in the program , but were interested in improving their friendships) (Martina and Stevens, 2007). However, the executi on of social skills may be complicated by issues of performance anxiety (Knowles et al., 2015). Support groups may also be directed at people who share common underlyi ng causes of social isolation and loneliness, such as bereavement or widowhood (Chow et al., 2018; Stewart et al., 2001). On the other hand, the reduction of social is olation or loneliness may result from an individual's participation in group activities aimed at other purposes, such as education, volunteerism, or health prom otion activities. For example, a study of SilverSneakers,6 a fitness program for older adults, found that \"membership directly increased physic al activity and self- rated health, directly decreased social isolation, and indirectly decreased loneliness\" (Brady et al., 2020, p. 301). A study of the \"hid den elderly\" in Hong Kong (def ined as \"older adults who are socially isolated and refuse social particip ation\") found that particip ation in a tai chi qigong program resulted in improvement in loneliness (as measured by the De Jong Gieveld loneliness scale).7 Key elements of the program included the trai ning of community elders to act as \"health ambassadors\" of the project; these individuals lived near the hidden elderly and helped to create a sense of neighborhood and create peer-to-peer rela tionships. A clinical trial, Leveraging Exercise to Age in Place (LEAP),8 is now under way to evaluate th e impact of a participation in 6 For more information on SilverSneakers\u00ae, see www. silversneakers.com (accessed November 14, 2019). 7 See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC5 221552/ (accessed Nove mber 14, 2019). 8 See https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT 03624049 (accessed November 14, 2019).

The LEAP study plans to evaluate changes in the Duke Social Support Index at 26 weeks af ter enrollment. However, a recent AHRQ rapid review (discussed earlier in this chapter) states Physical activity interventions to reduce soci al isolation showed the most promise at improving the health of older adults; howev er, effects were inconsistent and short- term. (Veazie et al., 2019, p. ii) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness The ways in which humans think and percei ve involve both conscious and unconscious mechanisms. As a result, loneliness can genera te a vicious cycle in which lonely people withdraw further because they perceive social in teractions as negative or unfriendly. Hawkley et al. (2007) found that lonely indivi duals perceive greater negativity in social intera ctions than do non-lonely individuals and that lonely individuals perform more poorly on tests of executive functioning than non-lonely individuals (Cac ioppo and Hawkley, 2009). Loneliness is also associated with hypervig ilance for social threat9 (Cacioppo et al., 2015b). Ta ken together, biased perceptions and hypervigilance towa rd negativity may cause lonely individuals to unconsciously withdraw from social connections, even though th ey may consciously desire to connect with others. This reaction creates prob lems in particular when lonely individuals attempt to connect with others but perceive the interactions negatively and beco me discouraged, leading to a vicious cycle of loneliness and withdrawal. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is used to help patients deal with a variety of issues ranging from more serious mental health disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder to day-to-day stresso rs and anxieties (Mayo Clinic, 2019). The goal of CBT is to teach individuals to identify their own faulty perceptions and irrational beliefs in order to appr oach and respond to challenging or stressful situations in a more clearheaded and effective way (McWhirter, 1990). By challenging automatic and negative thought patterns, CBT may be useful in helping lonely individuals refr ame the way they think about their relationships, their a ssumptions about others' views, or their expectations of success at overcoming loneliness (Mann et al., 2017). CBT has been found effective in addressing social anxiety disorder, insomnia, and unipolar depres sion (Butler et al., Koszycki et al., 2007). Few CBT-based interventions for loneliness or isolation have been tested in randomized controlled trials, and those that have been tested through randomi zed controlled trials have found mixed results. Mann and colleagues (2017) identified 10 published RCTs on cognitive approaches to improving loneliness or related concepts (e.g., social s upport, social network, social isolation) in people with mental health problems. Of the interventions considered, most therapies showed no effect on lo neliness; however, two online CBT interventions for individuals suffering from depression were found to be successful at decreasing depressed mood and loneliness at 12-month follow-up (Saulsberry et al., 2013). While there is limited evidence of the 9 Hypervigilance to social threats is \"an assumption in line with the evolutionary model of loneliness that indicates feeling socially isolated (or on the social perimeter) leads to increased attention and surveillance of the social world and an unwitting focus on self-preservation\" (Cacioppo et al., 2016, p. 138).

All rights reserved.9-14 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS effectiveness of CBT in mitigating social isolat ion and loneliness, many consider CBT to be a promising path forward (Mann et al., 2017). Interpersonal Psychotherapy CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy are bot h recognized as being \"empirically-based psychotherapeutic interventions for mood disorders,\" and \"bot h are diagnosis-targeted, time- limited, present-focused treatments that encourag e the patient to regain control of mood and functioning\" (Markowitz and Weissman, 2004, p. 136). Interpersonal psychotherapy was originally developed as a treatment for depres sion (Cuijpers et al., 2011; De Mello et al., 2005). Interpersonal psychotherapy differs from CBT in that its focus is on maladaptive thinking specifically related to interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal psychotherapy for depression focuses on two principles: viewing depression as a medical illness (not the fault of the patient) and making the connection between mood and tr iggering life events, su ch as bereavement (Markowitz and Weissman, 2004). Wh ile interpersonal therapy has not been extensively studied as an intervention specifically for social isolati on or loneliness, its focu s on maladaptive thinking and interpersonal relatio nships could be an approach to explore. Mindfulness Mindfulness, a way of being in which an i ndividual maintains openness, patience, and acceptance while focusing on life situations in a non-judgmental way, has also been suggested as a way to mitigate the negative effects of isolati on and loneliness (Gilmartin et al., 2017). Lindsay and colleagues (2019) conducted a randomized c ontrolled trial in which smartphone-based training was used to train participants in mindful ness techniques of awareness and acceptance for 2 weeks. The study found that individuals w ho received mindfulness training reported a 22 percent reduction in daily loneliness compared w ith the control group; th us, mindfulness training may be a promising way to mitigate the subjective risk factors associated with loneliness. Pharmaceutical Interventions Currently, nearly all interven tions that have been propos ed to treat isolation and loneliness are behavioral or psychol ogical in nature. However, the interventions that focus solely on increasing the time spent socializing or in creasing the number of social contacts may be greatly hindered by lonely individuals' negati vely biased perceptions and tendency toward interacting defensively with others. To boost th e possible success of be havioral interventions, adjunctive treatments or therapie s that target the biological un derpinnings of biased cognition have been suggested as a potential tool. Adjunctive therapy is a fo rm of treatment used in tandem with a primary treatment with the goal of assi sting the primary therapy (NCI, 2011). In theory, pharmaceuticals could be used to minimize some of the negative behavioral effects of social isolation and loneliness (e.g., anxi ety, fear), allowing individuals to maximize the satisfaction gained from their social interactions and buildi ng relationships with othe rs, which in turn may increase the success of behavioral therapies (e.g., CBT). However, consideration is needed for whether decreasing symptoms of loneliness, for example, might mitigate motivation to increase human connection, and thereby l ead to increased isolation. Research in animal models suggests that be havioral or psychological interventions for isolation and loneliness may benefit from adj unctive biological treatments that target the underlying neurobiology.

In animal models, isolation of the animals has been associated with a decrease in the concentration in the brain of pregnenolone (Serra et al., 2000), a hormone that has been asso ciated with memory enhancement (Vall\u00e9e et al., 2001). In humans pregnenolone has been shown to improve depressive symptoms in individuals with bipolar disorder (Brown et al., 2014), though evidence of its effects on memory is contradictory (Vall\u00e9e et al., 2001). The use of pregnenolone for loneliness is currently in a phase II clinical trial (NIH, 201 6). Oxytocin is associated with soci al affiliation, and its use in animal models suggests it could mitigate the harmful effe cts of social isolati on (Carter et al., 2008; Grippo et al., 2009, 2012; Young et al., 2014). Th e use of oxytocin in humans has been suggested to promote positive social behaviors, but the evidence for its use is mixed, and more research is needed about whic h individuals might benefit the most (Bartz et al., 2011; Cacioppo et al., 2015b). Interventions That Target Social Determinants of Health Broadly Social determinants of health are often inte rconnected, and therefore social isolation and loneliness may be addressed through efforts to addr ess the social determinants of health more holistically. For example, many Medicaid programs are moving to ward screening for social determinants of health and connecting individu als to needed supports (Manatt Health, 2019). An example of a program targeting the social dete rminants of health broadly is AirNYC. This community-based organization (CBO) uses comm unity health workers to link patients to services in order to address social determinants related to diabetes pr evention and management, asthma, hypertension, aging in place, behavioral health, maternal health, and substance use disorder at the indivi dual and household levels. 10 (See Chapter 7 for more on the role of the health care system in addressing the social determ inants of health. See later in this chapter for more on financing interventions for social is olation and loneliness through existing programs directed at the social determinants of health.) Centene, one of the nation's largest Medicaid managed care organizations, serves more than 14.5 million managed care members across 32 states. The organization has committed itself to providing \"access to high-quality health care, i nnovative programs and a wide range of health solutions that help families and individuals ge t well, stay well, and be well\" (Centene, 2019). Centene is in the process of developing new stra tegies to address the social determinants of health broadly, which could include social isolation and loneline ss, through efforts to address factors known to be at the core of the health and well-being of individuals. Centene envisions these long-term efforts as a way to create su stainable funding for progr ams that will address issues such as linguistic and cultural differences between the social sector (e.g., community benefit organizations) and the heal th sector (e.g., hospitals and payers organizations). Centene envisions a scalable prog ram with broad impact that is guid ed by a standard set of protocols, procedures, and analytics that can be individualized to different markets. There has not yet been a formal evaluation of this program. 10 For more information, see https://www.a ir-nyc.org (accessed August 3, 2019).

CareMore Health is an integrated health plan and care delivery system for Medicare and Medicaid patients. In 2017 it cr eated the Togetherness Program which is composed of three interrelated approaches for helping people f ound to be isolated: Phone Pal, a phone-based interaction; a home-based visiting program; and leveraging existing care cen ters as social hubs with a community health worker embedded in the space. Individuals can opt into the Togetherness Program during their initial HealthyStart visit or can be referred to the program by physicians in the CareMore system.11 Early results suggest that the Togetherness Program has decreased emergency room use among enrolled patients by 3.3 percent co mpared to baseline; additionally, hospital admissions per thousand members are 20.8 percent lower among program participants than in the c ontrol group (BusinessWire, 2018) . CareMore appointed a chief togetherness officer who manages the program a nd fosters internal and external partnerships related to the topic (Jain and Samitt, 2018). UnitedHealthcare, a large heal th insurance company, launched the Navigate4Me program in fall 2017 for individuals enroll ed in its Medicare Advantag e plans who live with complex health issues such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, or multiple chronic conditions (UnitedHealth Group, 2018). The program offers health navigators who support and guide individuals through the compli cated health care system, providing both clinical and administrative assistance (such as answering health questions a nd resolving billing issues) in addition to addressing the social determinants of health (e.g., by connec ting individuals with reliable transportation or housi ng assistance). UnitedHealth Group reports early positive results, with a 14 percent reduction in hos pitalizations and a 9 percent re duction in ER visits for people with congestive heart failure (UnitedHealth Group, 2018). In 2018, eligibility for the program was expanded and specifically made available to individuals at risk for social isolation. Kaiser Permanente, an integrated managed care consortium, launched Thrive Local in 2019. This program created a new social health network in Oregon and southwest Washington State with the aim of creating connections between h ealth care providers and social services agencies. To best address the social needs of its members, Thrive Local will be built locally in partnership with nonprofit and gove rnment agencies, with the goa l of including other health systems and health centers (Kaiser Permanente, 2019). Thrive Local will be integrated into Kaiser's electronic health reco rd as a way of tracking social needs and referrals to social providers (Johnson, 2019). Other health insurance companies are beginning to identify social isolation and loneliness as problems that need to be addressed in thei r broader health campaigns. Humana's Bold Goal 12 is a population health strategy th at specifically addresses the so cial determinants of health, including loneliness and social isolation, in orde r to improve health status. As part of this, Humana created a Loneliness Toolkit (Humana, 2018) for consumers which addresses such issues as health care needs, staying engaged, and supporting love d ones who may be isolated or lonely. Humana also developed a one-page guide (Humana, 2019) for physicians which focuses on defining social isolation and loneliness, highlighting their ma jor health impacts, presenting 11 Presentation by Dr. Sachin Jain to the committee on April 25, 2019. 12 For more information, see https://popula tionhealth.humana.com (acce ssed August 5, 2019).

Other health insurance companies ar e leveraging existing health promotion programs to combat isolation and loneliness. In May 2018, Cigna released the results from a survey assessing the impact of loneliness in the United States; the president and chief executive officer, David Cordani, said of the data: \"[W]e're se eing a lack of human connection, which ultimately leads to a lack of vitality\" (C igna, 2018). Cigna is using existi ng programs, such as its Health Advisor Program, Health Information Line, and Employee Assistance Program, in order to address loneliness in the co mpany's employee and patient populations (Cigna, 2018). Interventions That Target Specific Risk Factors Another approach to addressing social isolati on and loneliness in the health care system is to identify specific underlying risk factors (p articularly health-related risk factors) and to address those issues as appropriate within the health care system. Interventions that fail to target the underlying causes of isolation and loneli ness are likely to be less successful. For example, as mentioned in Chapter 4, untreat ed hearing loss is associated with social isolation and loneliness (Chen, 1994; Mick et al., 2014, 2018; Pr onk et al., 2013; Sung et al., 2016; Weinstein and Ventry, 1982). Several studie s suggest that treati ng hearing loss with hearing aids or cochlear implants may mitigate th e effects of hearing loss on loneliness (Contrera et al., 2017; Weinstein et al., 2016). Other interventions that target specific risk factors focus upon enhancing cognition (Winningham and Pike, 2007); enhancing physical mobility or exercise (Brady et al., 2020; Ollonqvist et al., 2012; Tse et al., 2014; Wallace et al., 2014; Zijlstra et al., 2009); and dealing with bereavement or widowhood (Chow et al., 2018; Stewart et al., 2001). (For more on the role of the health care system in id entifying and addressing the underlying causes of social isolation and loneliness, see Chapter 7.) COALITIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS The 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care identified assistance, alignment, and advocacy as key activities to faci litate the integration of health care and social care (NASEM, 2019). Assistance activities \"reduce social risk by providing assistance in connecti ng patients with relevant soci al care resources\" (p. 44). Alignment activities are \"undert aken by health care systems to understand existing social care assets in the community, organize them in such a way as to encourage synergy among the various activities, and invest in and deploy them to prevent em erging social needs and improve health outcomes\" (p. 46). Advocacy activities involve health care organizations partnering with social care organizations \"to promote policies th at facilitate the crea tion and redeployment of assets or resources in order to improve health outcomes and pr event emergence of unmet social needs\" (p. 47). Furthermore, the National Acad emies committee that produced the report noted that in such activities, \"health care organizations leverage thei r political, social, and economic capital within a community or local environment to encourage and enable health care and social care organizations to partner a nd pool resources, such as servi ces and information, to achieve greater net benefit\" (p. 47). Cross-sector coal itions and partnerships are two strategies for increasing assistance, alignment, and advocacy.

Several coalitions and partnerships have been formed specifically in response to the growing public recognition of the health impacts of social isolation and loneline ss. The sections below highlight a few examples. Oregon Healthy Aging Summit The Oregon Healthy Aging Summit was a collab orative effort \"to develop a roadmap and accelerate action to promote the healt hy aging of older adults in Oregon\"13 by bringing together policy makers, providers, patients, and researchers to address issues relate d to social isolation. The summit sought to represent many diverse groups who may have specialized needs such as people of different races or se xual orientation or individuals living in less populous or rural locales. The summit was structured around the AHR Q rapid evidence review (described earlier in this chapter), with the revi ew acting as a framework for summ it presentations and discussions. Several different programs targe ting social isolation were disc ussed, including those related to physical activities, social support, arts and recrea tion, and access to health services. Some of the major priorities outlined by summit participants were: The development of an information system to connect health systems and community resources. The co-creation of measures and implemen tation strategies a nd the evaluation of programs using the same definitions and measures. The development and maintenance of a pe rson-centered approach that promotes equity. Post-summit activities included setting up a shared email (healthaging@ohsu.edu), establishing and expanding connections, collecti ng and distributing information on resources, and planning subsequent meetings with health sy stem leaders to discuss sharing data and social services locator services. Los Angeles Social Isolation and Loneliness Impact Coalition The Los Angeles Social Isolation and Lonelin ess Impact Coalition was created through a collaborative arrangement between the Motion Picture Television Fund (MPTF) and the AARP Foundation with the goal of addressing the health and financial impacts of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Th e coalition seeks to build upon and promote existing community- wide efforts focused on addressi ng social isolation and loneline ss and creating partnerships and sustainable social interventions that can be expanded nationa lly. MPTF initiated a volunteer- operated call center called A Daily Call Sheet that facilitates communication with very isolated or low-income individuals, many of whom have ch ronic illnesses.

All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Los Angeles and the director a nd the founding chair of the Los Angeles Social Isolation and Loneliness Impact Coalition explained that to date [roughly] 10,000 social calls have been made through this program to active in dustry members, retirees, and re latives of industry members. While the coalition is not specifically focused on the role of the health care system, coalition member and collaborative efforts have been broad and include annual summits on social isolation and loneli ness with participation from for-profit and not-for-profit businesses, academic s, and faith-based organizations; the creation of a call program tool kit to he lp establish new social outreach programs and to train volunteers; the initiation of ongoing data collect ion and analysis protocols; the implementation of new friendly call programs; the training of local police on social isol ation issues and resources for homeless individuals; connecting people in need w ith key resources; and providing access to economical gradua te education to older adults. According to Feldman, a survey of coaliti on members in 2018 revealed that the top reasons for joining the coalition included developing partnerships (87 percent), sharing of best practices (80 percent), a nd learning about the latest research (70 percent). In describing the work of the coalition, Feldman explained, \"Together we will find ways to effectively collaborate and create meaningful change.\" AARP Connect 2 Affect As noted in Chapter 8, the AARP Foundation has partnered with the Gerontological Society of America, Give an Hour, n4a, and UnitedHealthcare to share information about successful interventions and the latest academic research on social is olation (AARP Foundation, 2019). The Connect 2 Affect website includes an op tion for individuals to share resources related to new research or best practices. Like the Campaign to End Loneliness' Learning Network (see Chapter 8), this repository largely represents an effort to share resources and does not primarily conduct evidence-based assessments of interventions on their own. TECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS Information technology (IT) can provide a platfo rm for the delivery of targeted individual or group interventions. A variety of technologies have been test ed as ways to reduce social isolation and loneliness in olde r adults (Chipps et al., 2017; K hosravi et al., 2016). Table 9-1 provides an overview of potential IT solutions with different functiona lities, the types of technologies used, and specific examples of their use to address social is olation and loneliness. (This chapter will focus on the use of technology for interventions. See chapters 6 and 7 for a discussion on the use of technology for assessment.) With the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), social robots and conversational agents are often viewed as effective tools for social enga gement in gerontology. Virt ual reality is another platform that is expected to help older adults with social engagement. More traditional and widely available tools, such as social media groups and video-conferencing, are frequently Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

With any of these technological approaches, challenges re lated to user friendliness remain. TABLE 9-6 Types of Information Technology Tools to Address Older Adults' Social Isolation and Loneliness Function Technology Example(s) Assessment (mining data to identify or predict patterns of social isolation and loneliness) Passive home-based monitoring sensors Motion sensors and door/window sensors capture time spent inside versus outside the home, the number of visitors, the amount of time spent in the presence of others Tracking of usage patterns of online and phone tools Tracking time spent interacting on social media platforms, time spent on the phone, number of phone calls and video calls initiated and received Wearable sensors Activity and sleep tracking facilitated by a wrist-worn watch provides data for one's life-space (as a series of concentric areas radiating from the room where one sleeps and extending to the residential setting, neighborhood, community and beyond) Intervention Social media \"virtual communities\" Engagement in peer-support groups (for example, Facebook \"secret groups\" to exchange information and seek emotional support) Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) systems including hardware (a VR headset) and software (with virtual reality content specifically designed for older adults with the goal of providing reminiscence therapy elements with familiar experiences or engagement with new stimulations) Social robots/conversational agents Use of conversational agents with artificial intelligence functions to engage users in dialogue either for general companionship or for meeting specific goals (reminders, health or safety assessment) Video-mediated \"friendly visits\" Use of video-conferencing software such as Skype or FaceTime or commercially available software for volunteers or other staff to conduct regular \"friendly visits\" Internet Use The potential of the Internet to connect olde r adults has been examined since the early days of online communities. While new tools are being introduced to increase social engagement, the inability of older adults to use them may exacerbate their isolation. Older adults who are not familiar with new media platforms seem more likely to become isolated from groups or cohorts that use emerging technologies for communication (Melenhorst et al., 2001). White et al. (2002) facilitated Internet access for 100 older adult volunteers from four congregate housing sites and two nursing facilities over a 5-month pe riod. The volunteers were randomly assigned to receive Internet training or to a waitlist control group. Results showed a trend toward lower Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-21 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS loneliness and depression among those who receiv ed training, but this was not statistically significant. Cotten and colleagues (2013) examined the usage of information technologies among older adults in assisted and independent livi ng communities in Alabama and found that Internet use was associated with lower le vels of loneliness. Similar fi ndings were reported by Russell et al. (2008) in a study surveying olde r Australian Internet users: In ternet use fac ilitated access to bonding capital (maintaining close ties) and also bridging capita l (connections across social networks). Also in Australia, in a later online survey study of older adults, greater use of the Internet as a communication tool was associated w ith a lower level of social loneliness; however, greater use of the Internet to find new people wa s associated with a higher level of emotional loneliness (Sum et al., 2008). In 2010 Hogeboom and colleagues used the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to examine associations between In ternet use and social networks among 2,284 adults over 50 years of age. Frequency of contact with friends, freq uency of contact with family, and attendance at organizational meetings (not in cluding religious services) were found to have a significant positive association with Internet use. These su rvey findings suggested that Internet use can strengthen social networks for older adults. Internet use has also been found to be benefi cial in the context of social isolation and loneliness for homebound older adults. The CH IPs (Computers for Homebound and Isolated Persons) program sought to create an online community for individuals who were homebound and to connect seniors with others in sim ilar circumstances (Bradley and Poppen, 2003). A 1- year follow up showed that the participants' leve l of satisfaction in the amount of contact with others increased significantly. Tsai and Tsai (2011) used videoconferencing so ftware to connect nur sing home residents with remote family members during a 3-month intervention deployed in 16 nursing homes in Taiwan. The program had a long-term effect in alleviating depressive symptoms and loneliness for nursing home residents, and it also improve d long-term emotional so cial support and short- term appraisal support. Czaja and colleagues (2018) noted the importan ce for older adults of having \"meaningful access\" (p. 476) to the Internet and computer-m ediated strategies for social support. They reported that access to the Personal Reminder and Information and Social Management (PRISM) computer system yielded lower levels of social isolation and less percei ved loneliness in older adults after 6 months. Although the differences between the PRISM gr oup and the control group weres not maintained after 12 months, the PRIS M group still showed improvements in social isolation and loneliness compared to baseline . The investigators noted that technological interventions such as PRISM would not supplan t human interaction, but might supplement other strategies. Social Media Use The Pew Research Center (2018) estimates that older adults are th e fastest-growing group of individuals to adopt and use social media site s. Social media use can be differentiated into active and passive use. Active use refers to \"activities that f acilitate direct exchanges with others,\" whereas passive use pertains to the \"monitoring of ot her people's lives without engaging in direct exchanges with othe rs\" (Verduyn et al., 2017, p. 281). Howe ver, different segments of the older adult populatio n may be using social media in different ways or have different levels of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-22 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS comfort with its use. For example, older adu lts seem to use Facebook less actively than younger adults (Hayes et al., 2015). A 2012 Pew Report identified three factors that contribute to social media use among older adults: receiving social support, reconnecting with peers in their age groups, and bridging generational gaps (Zickuhr and Madden, 2012). J ung et al. (2017) conducted in-depth interviews to identify why older adults us e or avoid Facebook. Six main mo tivators were identified: the desire to keep in touch, sharing photos, soci al surveillance, responding to family member requests, convenience in communi cation, and curiosity. The main reasons given for avoiding Facebook included privacy considerations, tec hnology limitations, the triviality of the communication, time commitment, and frustr ation with the plat form features. Ang and Chen (2018) found that online social participation has the pot ential to alleviate the negative effects of pain on me ntal well-being, indicating that onl ine social participation could supplement attempts to facilitate social engagement in later life, in particular for those whose social activities may be affected by the pain they experience. Grieve and colleagues (2013) concluded that offline social connectedne ss and Facebook connectedness were separate constructs. Furthermore, by studying 274 older ad ult Facebook users, they found that using Facebook could provide the opportunities for deve loping and maintaining social connectedness in the online environment and showed that lower depression and a nxiety and greater life satisfaction were associated with Facebook connect edness. A simple association between social network site usage and loneliness may not, however, be automatically assumed among community-dwelling older adults. Aarts et al. (20 15) surveyed 626 adults aged 60 years or older in the Netherlands to investigate the relationshi p between social sites usage and loneliness and found that, in general, social network sites usage appeared unrelate d to loneliness. Social Robots and Conversational Agents A social robot is defined as an artificial agent (o ften embodied with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic features) that interacts with human s by following the social norms and behaviors attached to its role (Broekens et al., 2009; Ta ipale et al., 2015). Soci al robots have been developed and tested for their pot ential to meet the mental hea lth needs of older adults through interactions involving informati on exchange (Broadbent et al., 2014). Pu and colleagues (2019) in their meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of social robots for older adults reported th at social robot interactions ha ve the potential to \"improve engagement, interaction, and st ress indicators, as well as re duce loneliness a nd the use of medications among older adults\" (p. e37). One of the most common and frequently examined social robots is PARO, a robotic ba by harp seal, which has been tested in various settings with older adults without and with cognitive limitations (J\u00f8ranson et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2013). Other examples include a robotic dog AIBO (Ban ks et al., 2008), a humanoid communication robot called NAO (Soler et al., 2015), a humanoid robot designed to communicate and behave like a 3-year-old boy (Tanaka et al., 2012), and health care robots IrobiQ and Cafero (Broa dbent et al., 2014). Broader in concept than social robots, conversational agents are \"systems that mimic human conversation using text or spok en language\" (Laranjo et al., 2018, p. 1248). Conversational technologies involve the use of intuitive, natural language on the part of both the user and the system. This is in contrast to syst ems that require input that is formulated to be interpreted by a computer system (e.g., computer te rminals) or technologies that require selection and interactions through the manipulation of grap hical elements (e.g., point and click via mouse). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-23 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Conversational technologies are envi sioned to be more intuitive to use, easier to learn, and more resistant to communication breakdowns than non- conversational technologies (Cassell et al., 1999). Voice-based personal assistants such as the Amazon Alexa and Google Home are commercial examples of technologies that attemp t to make use of conve rsational interaction. Agents and agent-based systems refer to technologies that are capable of autonomous action. These systems can act without the direct involvement of humans, can initiate action in response to a certain set of cond itions in their environment, and can interact with other agents and humans (Jennings and Wooldr idge, 1998). A classic example of an agent is an automated online travel assistant that supports users in locating, selecting, and booking travel plans (e.g., Schiaffino and Amandi, 2009). Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) leverage the use of parts of the body, such as hands, the face, or a tonal shift via vocal cords, to regulate co nversation and contribute content (Cassell et al., 1999). For example, an ECA migh t express confusion thro ugh facial features in order to prompt a user to repeat or rephras e a sentence or clap to show enthusiasm or appreciation of a point. ECAs range in appearance from carto onlike to highly realistic and possess the ability to engage in verbal and non-verbal conve rsation in a human-like manner (Cassell, 2001). The three key components of a t ypical ECA are (1) an interface through which information is collected from users, (2) a visu al representation or interface through which the agent communicates with users, and (3) an algorit hm or software which allows it to reason like a human (Cassell, 2001; Provoost et al., 2017). Embodied conversational agents have been inve stigated primarily in the areas of gaming and health care. In health care, ECAs have been used in patient educa tion (e.g., nurse agents to explain medical documents to patients), clin ician training (e.g., tr aining mental health professionals), and the delivery of behavioral inte rventions (e.g., interventi ons targeting behavior change), including serious game s and physical activity (Bickm ore et al., 2009, 2010; Carpenter et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2016; Kanaoka and Mutlu, 2015; Lisetti et al., 2013). Some work has examined the use of conversational agents specif ically for older adults. Bickmore et al. (2013) demonstrated that ECAs were effective in sign ificantly increasing physic al activity levels in older adults when compared to a group of pedo meter users. Vardoulakis et al. (2012) conducted a study with an agent (using th e so-called \"Wizard of Oz\" methodology where the older adult interacts with a computer contro lled by another human) and found that older adults obtained a sense of companionship and support from the agen t and were interested in discussing a wide range of topics. Yaghoubzadeh et al. (2013) used participatory design to create and demonstrate the feasibility of a virtual agent to assist with daily activities of older adults. Their study showed that older adults were able to engage and inte ract successfully with th e agent (Yaghoubzadeh et al., 2013). In addition, ECAs have also been shown to be beneficial for health management. For example, Looije et al. (2010) s howed that a virtual assistant wa s rated more highly than real persons, particularly for conveying empathy. The abil ity to express empathy is a social behavior which can significantly aid in persuasive efforts to facilitate healthy be haviors (Looije et al., 2010). Some ECAs have been developed for i ndividuals with conditions that increase in prevelance with aging, such as dementia (Sakai et al., 2012). The conversational agents in these studies have taken on various appearances, from human-like (Bickmore et al., 2013) to animal characters (Looije et al., 2010).

All rights reserved.9-24 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL CONSID ERATIONS FOR INTERVENTION When interventions for social isolation a nd loneliness are designed, various ethical and practical consideration arise, in cluding (but not limited to) how le vels of social isolation and loneliness are assessed (see Chapter 6), who im plements the interventi on, which settings are appropriate for an intervention, and what the intervention entails or how it functions. While many interventions considered in this chap ter are relatively low- tech, technology-based interventions have been gaining in popularity. Various ethical c onsiderations related to using technology with older adults have been studied, particularly ar ound robotic care (Sharkey and Sharkey, 2012; Sorell and Draper, 2014), smar t home technologies (Chung et al., 2016), and telehealth (Demiris et al., 2006, 2009). While newl y introduced technologies can have a positive impact on health of older adults, potential harms also need to be considered, particularly in the areas of privacy, informed consent, and aut onomy (Chung et al., 2016; Demiris et al., 2009). A recent review of the literature found that 67 pe rcent of the current intelligent assistive technologies (IATs) in dementia care (e.g., handheld devices, mobility aids, smart home sensors, robots) were designed without considering their ethical imp lications (Ienca et al., 2018). Moreover, among those IATs developed with atten tion to ethics at the design level, there was great variation in the kinds of ethical consider ations that had been addressed. For example, privacy considerations had been addressed in only 5 percent of the examined technologies. In evaluating the potential of any intervention to prevent or mitigate social isolation and loneliness, either as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions, questions of accessibility, acceptability, cost, and the feasibility need to be addressed. This section explores potential ethical and pr actical concerns related to both technological and non-technological interventions. Accessibility Accessibility refers to ensuring that services and technologies are usable by people with disabilities, either by design or by the addition of adaptive soft ware or hardware. Given that visual, motor, and hearing changes are co mmon with aging, making technology accessible to older adults may include such things making digita l displays accessible to people with vision loss (e.g., providing options to increase font size) a nd accounting for motor changes such as tremors (Hanson, 2001; Kaeberlein and Martin, 2015; Saxon et al., 2015). However, ECAs and social robots as well as other new technologies (e.g., voi ce based personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa) are adopting voice as an interaction mech anism. The use of one's voice may be a more accessible interface for people who have low vision, but, on the other hand, it may present issues for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Ad justing the volume of a udio output of technology is a way that people often compensate for age- related hearing loss (Pacala and Yueh, 2012), but the conversational aspect of these new technologies means that new dynamics need to be investigated in regards to acces sibility (e.g., turn-taking in co nversation when one party has hearing loss). Cognitive accessibility also needs to be considered in regards to voice-based interactions with ECAs or robot s because of the normal cognitive changes that occur with aging as well as the increased incidence of dementia. Research on technology for aging has expande d to encompass factors affecting other types of accessibility, including structural, financial, and personal barrie rs (Chung et al., 2016; Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-25 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Demiris et al., 2006, 2009). Although technology adoption by older ad ults is increasing (Pew Research Center, 2017), a large proportion of ol der adults remain w ithout access to technology, such as the Internet and hardware (e.g., tablet s), that are needed for use of these ECAs. In addition, disparities due to differences in soci oeconomic status affect older adults' technology use and access to technology (Smith et al., 2015). Financial accessibility will likely be an issue because the ECA services that are emerging for older adults\u2014particularly those that involve a \"human in the loop\"\u2014often involve recurring monthly payments. Another potential factor affecti ng accessibility is literacy. Preliminary studies show that many ECAs can be used by individuals with lowe r literacy levels (Bickmore et al., 2009, 2010). These studies show that ECAs are not bound by time constraints lik e providers are, and they are able to convey information clearly and multiple times, making them easy to comprehend by patients (Bickmore et al., 2009, 2010). Privacy and Data Protection With the rise of consumer-facing technologies, discussions of privacy and confidentiality are evolving. Existing norms and legislation relate d to health information are being reconsidered and extended to include new devices oriented towards patients. Specific issues related to ECAs or social robots include the protection, storag e, and transmission of audio and video data (Demiris et al., 2006). ECAs that interface with h ealth care providers need to meet the standards set by the Health Insurance Portabi lity and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 14 Consumers usually use passwords to protect information and accounts. Passwords that require the memorization of a string of characters may not be th e ideal solution for many people, particularly for older adults with cognitive impairment, or in cases when mu ltiple people, including caregivers, may interface with the technology. In this scenar io, privacy issues intersect w ith accessibility concerns. Given that ECAs in the home use audio and sometimes video data, they pose privacy risks not only to people using them, but to others who enter the sp ace where they are depl oyed. Another potential privacy risk relates to the transm ission of data by social robots and ECAs to family members or health care providers concerning the health conditi ons and activities of older adults, who may not want that information shared. Autonomy Autonomy represents the freedom of an indivi dual to make decisions regarding their own life in accordance with their ow n goals, values, and preference s. Autonomy is an essential guiding principle for interventions and key ethical issue the care of older adults. However, respecting the autonomy of older adults may present challenges when the older person does not have full decision-making capacity, or when ot her family members are involved in the older adult's care.15 A 2019 study by AARP found that \"76 percent of Americans age 50 aand older say they prefer to remain in their current resi dence and 77 perent would like to live in their community as long as possible.\"16 Many new technologies, includi ng ECAs, are designed to 14 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Public Law 191. 104th Congress.

Regard less, concerns may arise for the use of these types of technologies, leading to lost autonomy and personal liber ty (Bickmore, 2005; Garner et al., 2016). However, the loss of independence an d autonomy may not be the most important ethical factor to consider when it comes to pa rticular populations, such as frail older adults (Zwijsen et al., 2011). Though the majority of pub lished literature has not yet addressed the ethical implications of social robots or ECAs, th ere are some articles that have begun to outline some of the potential consider ations (Bickmore, 2005; Bickmo re et al., 2005). For example, Bickmore et al. (2005) discussed issues concerni ng an agent deceiving users into thinking it is a person, agents reducing expressiv ity, and the autonomy of users. Garner and colleagues (2016) conducted group discussions with various stak eholders to understand the concerns and reservations related to using a virtual carer syst em for older adults. Informed Consent For all types of interventions, informed cons ent is perhaps the ethical issue that has received the most attention in research. Howe ver, technological appr oaches confer unique challenges for the informed consent process. Some approaches stress the importance of ongoing consent and the ability to rescind consent (Nei ll, 2003). These approaches, however, assume that an individual is continuously able to assess risk and what is in his or her own best interests. For technological interventions, researcher s are beginning to argue that conventional ways of obtaining informed consent are not suffici ent for research (Vitak et al., 2017). Some of these concerns arise because of the persiste nce and vastness of data created, stored, and transmitted by new technologies, which can lead to po ssible future uses that were unspecified at the time of consent (Vitak et al., 2017). Data co llected by ECAs might be seen as valuable for researchers who study aging, and th ere is a need to understand how informed consent can best be obtained for older adults with th ese new technologies. Furthermore, in the case of ECAs, social relationships may be built over time. Users may de velop trust in virtual ag ents that may affect their ability to assess risks. Trust\u2014and mispl aced trust\u2014are informed consent-related issues found in many settings involving research or in terventions (de Melo-Mart\u00edn and Ho, 2008), but they become particularly complicated when tr ust is developed between participants and the system that is deployed. Trust de veloping between an individual a nd a device could mean that an older adult reveals more personal information than would otherwise be th e case because of the perceived lower interpersonal risk of sharing and a failure to realize that in some cases this information may become accessible to thir d parties or other stakeholder groups. Additional informed consent concerns that are specific to social robo ts or ECAs include the high level of digital literacy needed to understand the mechanis ms of the technology. Moreover, users may need to understand artifical intelligence, networks, and data transmision in order to fully apprehend the risks associated w ith ECAs. Data literacy in this case becomes a great challenge since users need to understand how their data are colle cted, who can access them, and what the potential risks may be. Informed c onsent with ECAs, as with other technologies, is further complicated when individuals are expe riencing cognitive impairment and dementia\u2014 conditions that increase in prevalen ce as people age. Ideally, an i ndividual's capacity to consent is determined on a case-by-case basis with attenti on paid to the magnitude of the potential harm of the research or interventi on and to the participant's unders tanding of the risks (Appelbaum, 2007); however, both of these factors are difficu lt to assess with the new technologies.

All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-27 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Finally, consideration may be needed rega rding informed consent for the use of information technology beyond research, such as a new technology introduced for patient care in the home (e.g., video cameras). Exacerbating Rather Than Reducing Isolation For older adults, particular atte ntion will need to be paid to the impact of interventions that substitute for human contac t. For example, attachment to companion animals has been shown to be associated with changes in psychol ogical health (Raina et al., 1999). A key concern for technological interventions is that the same tools intended to address isolation and loneliness could lead to further isolation by ultimately substituting for human c ontact (Chung et al., 2016; Sharkey and Sharkey, 2012; Sparrow and Sparrow, 2006). This issue may be a particular concern with social robots and ECAs, given that these technologies rely on soci al interactions and building relationships. Pilot studies with ECAs ha ve demonstrated that older adults can engage and interact with ECAs and thus may potential ly develop relationships with these devices (Bickmore et al., 2005; Tsiourti et al., 2014). Methods that ha ve been suggested to reduce isolation and dependence incl ude periodically checking on a person's dependence and having time limits for the usage of the system (Garner et al., 2016). This approach becomes difficult to implement, however, when the effectiveness of the ECA may rely on a continuous connection and relationship built over time. As informati on technology tools become formally integrated into traditional health services in order to re duce cost and human resources, it will be important to assess whether virtual or AI-based inte ractions meant to replace human observers or interaction partners lead to a lo wer quality of engagement and an increased sense of loneliness, at least for some older adults. Another challenge is attachment. ECAs and other technologies developed for older adults may have high costs, sometimes with services attached that require continuous payment, and the participants may have to stop using devices because of such constraints as the research study peri od, financial resources, and travel. Additionally, as mentioned in Chapter 7, ther e may be stigma associated with being labelled as socially isolated or lonely. Such stigma might ri sk causing the individuals to be blamed for being isolated or feeling lonely inst ead of viewing these problems as being due to a variety of factors at the level of the individual, community and society. As a result, individuals suffering from social isolation or loneliness may not want to identify as such for the purposes of receiving an intervention, thereby exacer bating their isolatio n or loneliness. Perceptions of Safety and Functionality Although interventions such as new technologi es are often developed to support safety for older adults, unintended consequences may aris e. For example, a power cord attached to a technology could pose a falling ri sk. ECAs, however, may be more likely to be on mobile platforms and therefore pose less of a hazard. Perc eptions of functionality also might lead to potential safety issues (Yusif et al., 2016). Given the social elem ent of the devices, people might expect devices to be able to fill social safety roles, such as alerting others in case of emergencies\u2014even when this is beyond the technical capabilities of the device or not implemented for fear of adverse events and li tigation. Additionally, indi viduals might come to depend on functionalities such as medication re minders, and if a device malfunctioned or a company shut down, it could leave older adults without the suppor t they had come to rely on (Hensel et al., 2006).

All rights reserved.9-28 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Infantilization of Older Adults The introduction of social r obots or ECAs for older adul ts in some cases introduces concerns for the infantilization of these individua ls\u2014i.e., creating a behavi oral pattern in which the older adult is treated in a ch ild-like manner. This may be especially true when there is a perception that \"toys\" or \"robotic pets\" are ways to engage and ente rtain isolated or lonely older adults (Birks et al., 2016; Sala ri and Rich, 2001). Infantilizati on needs to be acknowledged and addressed by system designers both in the design and selection of features for the hardware and software systems and in the integration of ex isting knowledge bases for AI solutions. Because knowledge bases are informed by existing data and assumptions, ageism and other biases may be reflected in the way a system is design ed to interact with an older adult. Disparities in Access to Interventions Older adults may have disparit ies in their ability to access a variety of interventions. For example, an individual who lives in a rural area may not have any local programs or an individual who has a functional limitation in mo bility may be unable to access programs that exist even in their own communities. Limitations in access may be particularly acute when it comes to technological interventions. The concep t of a digital divide has been of growing concern as the use of technology by health care consumers has increased. Questions of equity and \"digital inclusion\" (Powell and Deetjen, 201 9, p. 1) have evolved from issues of simple access to infrastructure and equipment to include access to the knowledge and skills needed to use technology and now to a consid eration of who benefits the most and in what ways (Ball et al., 2017; Powell and Deetjen, 2019). The following sections focus on disparities in access to technological interventions. Differences between Rural and Urban Environments Early concerns regarding access to technology we re primarily related to the availability of broadband Internet access for pe ople in rural areas and low-in come populations in urban areas (van Deursen and van Dijk, 2019). Although broadband is more widely availabl e than in the past and the use of smart phones is now ubiquitous, the question still merits attention, in part because of variations across geographic area s, costs, ease of use, and accep tability to older adults. While access to web-based and technology-enabled conn ections has increased and such connections have been described as \"a basic utility for so cial inclusion\" (van De ursen and van Dijk, 2019, p. 355), geographic disparities still exist, and issues have surfaced related to knowledge, skills, and costs over time. As of 2018, 39 perc ent of people living in rural areas in the United States did not have access to broadband in their homes, compar ed with 4 percent of people in urban areas (Stover, 2018). People living in rural areas often have a limite d choice of broadband providers and may experience lower broadband speeds than in urban areas. Wired internet connectivity is more costly in rural areas because of to th e lower population density and the need for longer wiring; additionally, wireless t echnology, particularly on mobile phones, can be costly, and download speeds can vary acro ss carriers (Stover, 2018). Access to broadband alone does not address a ccess to the necessary hardware, software, peripherals, licenses, and subs cription fees (van Deursen an d van Dijk, 2019). The resource limitations experienced by some high-risk populations can worsen inequalities in access to technologically mediated supports to addr ess social isolation and loneliness.

All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-29 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Rural residents are increasingly using mobile technologies, such as smart phones, rather than broadband, as a means of accessing the In ternet (Pew Research Center, 2019b; Stover, 2018). According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2 019, 71 percent of rural residents owned smart phones, compared with 83 percent of urban residents (Pew Research Center, 2019b). Similarly, 53 percent of older adults owned smart phones compared with 96 percent of young adults aged 18-29 a nd 79 percent of adults aged 50 64. These findings suggest that older adults living in ru ral areas do not have the same ubiquitous access to mobile technologies as do those who are younger and living in urban areas. Age Age has been specifically identified as a factor in the digital divide (Wu et al., 2015). In a study of adults in the Netherlands , where the Internet saturation is 98 percent, the investigators found that age was negatively related to access to multiple devices and peripherals (e.g., printers, scanners, additional screens, hard drives, docking stations) and also negatively related to total cost of maintenance expenses (v an Deursen and van Dijk, 2019). This suggests that even in a technologically-advanced society, older adults have fewer devices a nd peripherals, thereby limiting the types and extent of social conne ctions that are possi ble using technology. Pearl (2014) reported on the use of three technologies by members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California: Internet, mobile technologies, and vide o platforms. He found that 51.2 percent of members over the age of 70 had enrolle d in the Kaiser Permanent website, compared with 71.6 percent of members' ages 30 70 (Pearl, 2014). This suggests that older adults might be less likely to use technologi cally mediated strategies than young and middle-aged adults. Although a majority of adults over age 65 are using the Internet ( 73 percent in 2019), the rate is far lower than in younger age groups (88 percent of adults aged 50 64 and 97 percent of those aged 3049 years) (Hong and Cho, 2017; Statista, 2020). In an analysis of survey data originally collected at three points in time by the Health Information Network Survey of the National Cancer Institute, Hong and Cho (2017) found that older adults were increasingly accessing the Internet. Older adults' use of Internet resource s was primarily for obtaining health information and communicating with their physicians. The study found that education and income were related to Internet use, while rural-versus-urb an residence was not. The authors concluded that although the \"digital divide\" was narrowing, it rema ined substantial for those who were older, less well educated, and with lower incomes. This suggests that the social determinants of health create barriers to older adults' access to technologies and that reducing these barriers could be helpful in efforts to reduce social isolation a nd loneliness. Adults aged 75 and older were less likely than adults aged 65 74 to use the Internet. Hong and C ho stated that \"improved access to the Internet may enable older adults' access to he alth information, but it may not necessarily lead to the adoption of various aspect s of HRIU (health-related Internet use), such as connecting with people online\" (2017, pp. 860 861). Another perspective on the digital divide c oncerns how and when electronic technologies are used and how different age groups perceive them. Focus gr oups conducted by Ball et al. (2017) indicated that older adults were offe nded by the use of electronic technologies when family members or others were physically in thei r presence, but appreciated their use when apart. Thus, electronic technology use could worsen feelings of social isolation from those in direct contact with older adults but serve as a tool to enhance so cial connection when at a distance. Older adults' use of certain technologies may depend strongly on their comfort and familiarity with the devices. As a result, traini ng older adults in the use of the technology may Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-30 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS encourage more seniors to use various devices. For example, Older Adults Technology Services (OATS)17 trains older adults in community settings in computer skills, including the use of email, the management of medical informa tion, and the building of community networks. Underserved Populations and the So cial Determinants of Health In a literature review of the impact of sociodemographic factors on the use of eHealth, Reiners et al. (2019) concluded that older adults and individu als with lower incomes were generally less likely to use eHealth. It also appe ared that people with less education were less likely to use eHealth. Literacy skil ls are key to some uses of eHea lth. This review suggested that limited access to the appropriate equipment and a l ack of the skills needed to use the equipment contributed to older adults' lowe r levels of use of eHealth. Thes e authors recommended tailoring eHealth strategies to the need s of individuals, providing educ ation and support for the use of eHealth, and involving caregivers wh en possible. When older adults live alone, they may be less likely to use electronic strategies because of a lack of support. In a system atic review of studies of eHealth literacy among underserved U.S. populat ions, Chesser et al. ( 2015) noted that few of the studies they reviewed were conducted with rural populations. Mitchell and colleagues (2019) evaluated da ta from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study and found that older adults from racial and ethnic minorities, including Hispanics and African Americans, used hea lth-related technol ogy less frequently than whites. Although differences were not found across racial and ethnic groups in younger ages, by age 62 differences began to emerge. The authors speculated that lan guage may contribute to the differences seen in older Hispanic adults, and they noted no differences were found in the use of specific technologies, such as \"E-mails, text messaging and mobile applications for health\" (p. 11), suggesting that targeting the type of technology for its acceptability to the population may be an appropriate strategy. Older Adults with Disabilities In a review of the literatur e, V\u00e1zquez et al. (2018) found that the few studies that addressed the use of eHealth by older adults with intellectual disabilities indicated that eHealth was used by this population primarily as s upport for independent living, telehealth, and communication. The authors recommended using unive rsal design in eHealth to increase the ease of use and also considering the use of strategi es such as games and virtual reality. Gell and colleagues (2015) found that older a dults with disabilities that le d to functional limitations were significantly less likely to use the Internet than those without such limitations. This was particularly true for those individuals who needed help with activities of daily living or mobility outside the home and those with vision or memory impairments. Older adults with other issues, including pain and breathing pr oblems, were more likely to use technology. The investigators noted this may have been because the ease of getting help using technology outweighed the difficulties of trying to do so in other non-techno logical ways for these specific impairments. Infrastructure Issues Pearl (2014) found that reimbursement issues detracted from physicians' willingness to use technology for virtual visi ts. Fee-for-service reimbursement systems do not always cover 17 For more information, see www.oats.org (accessed October 16, 2019).

While newer approaches to care coordi nation and patient self- management may support using technology to re duce social isolation and loneliness, key infrastructure issues related to reimbursements a nd regulations may need to be resolved to allow for full adoption. FINANCING OF INTERVENTIONS Most of the interventions reviewed earlier in this chapter draw heavily on volunteers and are patched together funding from various sma ll grants and donations or are technological innovations that may base their marketing models on the sharing of data by users. While many of these programs had some positive impacts on partic ipants, a volunteer-based model is difficult to grow or maintain on a large scale. Instead, mo re formal funding mechanisms are needed. The choice of funding source will depend in part on the type of intervention, the cost, and the population being served. However, because there is little scientific evidence to date on the cost and benefits of various interventions addressing so cial isolation and loneli ness in general, and for interventions in health care settings in partic ular, the committee presents a discussion of funding options in a more general sens e, providing a general assessmen t of possible paths forward. As noted in Chapter 3, social isolation and loneliness have negative effects on health, but at the same time health limitations (e.g., audito ry or mobility problems) result in significantly higher risks of social isolation and loneliness. Given these strong ties, a natural avenue for the implementation and funding of interventions is through the health care and health insurance systems. Furthermore, the 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care describes the negative correlation between spending on social care and total health care costs that exists across countries and across states (NASEM, 2019). This correlation suggests that, in addition to improving the lives of individual s at risk for social isolation and loneliness, investment in this area may prove cost-effective. Given the committee's charge to focus its attention on older Americans and the groups most at risk of social isolation and loneliness, this s ection begins with the potential role of the public Medicare and Medicaid program. Medicare is the primary health insurance provider for those aged 65 or older as well as for those eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance, while those older or disabled individuals with few resources have access to Medicaid. Given their target populations, these programs are well positione d to lead the way in identifying individuals at risk and in providing mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of social isolation and loneliness. Medicare is a federally run program and, as su ch, changes in this program directed towards social isolation and loneliness can have an im pact on a large number of individuals. In 2018 there were approximately 60 million individuals en rolled in Medicare (CMS, 2019a). In contrast, Medicaid programs are run at th e state level with funding from both states and the federal government. The state-level administration allows for individual states to ta ilor coverage to their populations and also allows for th e piloting of different programs acr oss states to provide data on numerous interventions at the sa me time. The total population covere d by Medicaid is far larger than that covered by Medicare (approximately 75 million in 2018) (CMS, 2019a), but children make up the largest subset of beneficiaries, so the adult population covered by Medicaid is similar to that covered by Medicare. The committee suggests three avenues along which the health care system\u2014and particularly Medicare and Medi caid\u2014may address these issues. The first of these avenues is Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-32 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS through the use of traditional me dical interventions targeting sp ecific underlying health-related causes of social isolation or loneliness. The second is by financi ng interventions that target social isolation and loneliness, either directly or indi rectly. Finally, financing may be considered for public health efforts to increase awareness of the health and medical impact s of social isolation and loneliness, both for reducing the stigma associ ated with social isol ation and loneliness and for helping to identify those at risk. The followi ng sections provide exampl es of approaches to funding interventions generally. However, the co mmittee recognizes that relatively little is currently invested (particularly by Medicare and Medicaid) into these types of interventions, that many of the program cited have not been eval uated for their impact specifically on social isolation and loneliness, and significant incentives will likely needed in order for these approaches to gain traction. Financing Interventions for Und erlying Health-Related Causes The first mechanism of financing to consider involves using traditional health care interventions that target the underl ying cause of social isolation or loneliness. For example, when considering causes of social isol ation and loneliness, physical barr iers such as hearing or vision impairments or limitations on mobility loom large. Limitations like these make social connections more difficult and have been demonstr ated to increase the li kelihood of loneliness or isolation (see Chapter 4). Medicare currently covers some mobility devices when they are medically needed, but it does not cover hearing aids or low vision devi ces, although these items could potentially be included in an expanded defi nition of \"durable medical equipment.\" In some states, Medicaid does cover heari ng aids for those who qualify for benefits, but many states do not offer this coverage. Better c overage of hearing aids and othe r medically needed devices (e.g., wheelchairs, low-vision technologies ) could potentially do much to help reduce the prevalence of social isolation and loneliness. 18 Financing Interventions Targeting Social Isolation and Loneliness Social isolation and loneline ss might also be targeted by taking advantage of existing programs to assess or address the social determinants of health in general. The recent increase in recognition of the importance of th ese factors in affec ting health outcomes has led to several states beginning to use their Medicaid program s to address such issues as food insecurity, homelessness, and domestic violence. Like social isolation and loneline ss, these factors are strongly related to he alth outcomes, and improving the so cial situations can lead to improvements in health. Although th ey are outside the typical scope of Medicaid programs and not required by the federal government, these ty pes of outreach activities can be financed through Medicaid waivers that allow for pilot proj ects or through amendments to state Medicaid programs. While Medicaid programs have begun to address the social determinants of health among children and disabled beneficiaries, the co mmittee has focused primarily on pilot projects that might inform outreach activities targeting ol der adults at risk of or experiencing social isolation and loneliness. A key component of these pilot project s is evaluation. As such, the research needed to learn about th e effectiveness and best practices of these pilots, while still in its infancy, will at least begin to provide some answers in the coming years. However, a recent 18 H.R. 2050, introduced in 2017, called for a demonstration project for the inclusion of low vision devices.

Medicaid waiver programs (particularly the newest Section 1115 waivers) have been authorized by the Centers for Medicare & Medica id Services (CMS) to allow Medicaid programs to adapt their services \"to best meet their state's unique needs\" such as by expanding coverage to specific groups, providing incentives for healthy behaviors, or improving behavioral health services (NCSL, 2019). As noted by Seema Verma, the CMS administrator, We know that behaviors and other determinants of health\u2014like where we work, live, learn, and grow\u2014are all factors in our overall health and wellbeing. As we seek to create a health care system that truly rewards value, we must consider the impact that factors beyond medical care ha ve in driving up health costs. . . . As part of this demonstration, North Carolina will implement a groundbreaking program in select regions to pilot evid ence-based interventions addressing issues like housing instability, transportation ins ecurity, food security, and interpersonal violence and toxic st ress. (Verma, 2018) Interventions of this type typically operat e through accountable care organizations and managed care organizations and provide a number of services not normally associated with health insurance organizations. North Carolina has recently launched a pilot enhanced case management system to provide various social su pport services to Medi caid beneficiaries. The program includes services to help with housing, food security, and domestic violence. Examples include replacing carpet or an air conditioner fo r an individual with asthma and improving access to healthful food (NCDHHS, 2018). The One Ca re demonstration project operating through Medicare and Medicaid programs from the Co mmonwealth Care Alliance in Massachusetts provides a care partner to assist a patient with the social determinants of health as well as with traditional medical services. Loneliness is specifica lly listed as a targeted social determinant of health but the project is limited to adults younger than 65 (Commonwealth Care Alliance, 2018). New York also has a broader program addre ssing the social determinants of health (NYSDOH, 2017, 2019). The New York program in cludes components that address economic security as well as housing and food security. Nota ble in the New York plan is that \"social and community context\" is called out as a key dom ain. Outreach in these areas can be provided through existing programs such as the Department for the Aging, Department of Health, State Office of Aging, senior centers, virtual senior centers, friendl y visitor programs, care giver support, and social adult day services. Similar pi lot programs are operational in other states, and Medicaid managed-care plans are similarly e xploring ways to improve health outcomes by addressing the social determinants of health. Medicaid waiver programs can be used as models for interventions specifically addressing social isolation a nd loneliness among low-income older adults and people with disabilities. An important step in reaching out with intervention s along these lines is identifying those most at risk for social isolation and loneliness. Medicaid 's existing coverage of home health care services provide a ready avenue to iden tify at least some of those at risk for social isolation and loneliness, as do ot her outreach programs such as Meals on Wheels or other state- and local-run programs. 19 19 Note that the Administration on Aging (AoA) operates in large part by providing funding to states and local communities to support programs addressing the well-being of older adults. A large portion of this funding goes to Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-34 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS For older and disabled indivi duals who are not eligible for state Medicaid programs, Medicare affords similar opportunities to address social isolation and loneliness. While Medicare itself is a federal, rather than state-run program, sugges ting that interv entions would need to be implemented more broadly, CMS recently finali zed its policy to allow Medicare Advantage plans expand benefits to cover interventions addressing the social determinants of health (CMS, 2019b), and this idea is already gaining traction with numerous private insurers (e.g., Anthem Inc., UnitedHealthcare, Kaiser Permanente) launching programs through their Medicare Advantage plans (Graham, 2019). While many of these programs focus on affordable housing, transportation, and food insecurity, the same models can be used to more aggressively target, social isolation and loneliness. The idea behi nd these pilot projects is that by being more proactive in identifying and interv ening for social isolation and lone liness or in reducing the risk, these interventions will act both to reduce total health care costs and in crease well-being. Should these projects prove successful, one would imagin e that private insurers serving the non-elderly and non-disabled population (i.e., those not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) would begin to consider similar interventions as cost savings mechanisms. Outside the United States, the National H ealth Service in the United Kingdom has already created a system of social prescribi ng to encourage doctors to \"prescribe\" social activities and engagement. A ccording to a recent evaluati on, the most common sorts of interventions were \"information and advice, co mmunity activity, physical activities, befriending and enabling\" (Dayson and Bashir, 2014, p. i). Th e evaluation found substa ntial reduction in inpatient admissions, emergency department vis its, and outpatient visits. It also found a substantial cost savings on the or der of a 50 percent re turn on investment (see more on social prescribing earlier in this chap ter). Similarly, the Australian government provides funding for a program in which volunteers visit low-income older adults (Sutherland Shire Council, 2018). As described in Chapter 3, social isolati on, particularly for an often less-mobile population, can have adverse outcome s on health. Increasing social activities and combating the isolation faced by many people with functional limitations and other disabilities is a key element in encouraging good overall health. The Health Pl an of San Mateo found that addressing social isolation is a key to successfully transitioning individuals out of institutional care, particularly as many are leaving a very struct ured environment (HPSM, 2020). Th at organization is examining new types of peer supports and other related se rvices to address isol ation. The health plan contracts with an organiza tion called A Wider Circle, 20 which facilitates an activity-based social group led by peers to support individuals with day-to-day living tasks. A Wider Circle also emphasizes physical activity and collects some data on health outcomes. The health plan acknowledged that extensive in ternal review are often requi red when these services are authorized, but because feedback received from members has been very positive, it will continue to provide these activities (Soper, 2017). Financing Public Health Campaigns Finally, financing needs to be considered for efforts at the society-wide level such as public health campaigns to increase awareness, remove stigma, and, more generally, enlist the public's help in reducing social isolation and loneliness. For example, the National Institutes of Meals on Wheels programs, which count on money from the AoA for approximately one-third of its budget (Meals on Wheels America, 2017). 20 For more information, see www.awiderci rcle.org (accessed Oc tober 15, 2019).

All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-35 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Health have promoted public health campai gns about smoking, physical activity, and heart disease (NIH, 2019) (see more on public health campaigns in Chapter 8). Publicity campaigns like these could encourage individuals to check in on neighbors or older family members. They could also reduce stigma and thus encourage lonely older adults to reach out for help themselves. By highlighting social isolation and loneliness, public health cam paigns could help individuals approaching retirement and old age better plan for meaningful engagement and connections in the future. (For more on disseminati on and implementation, see Chapter 10.) REFRAMING INTERVENTION USING A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH Because of the variety of ways that social isolation and loneliness a ffect health and well- being, there is no single treatment that can preven t or cure every instance of social isolation or loneliness. Instead, addressing thes e issues will necessarily involve a variety of different actors and an assortment of interventions focused on di fferent demographics, risk factors, and health impacts. One way to address the problems of isolation and loneliness may be through using a public health framework while designing and imple menting different interventions. As defined by the American Public Health A ssociation, \"public health promotes and protects the health of people and the communities where they live, lear n, work, and play,\" which includes promoting wellness by encouraging healthy be haviors and assuring \"the condi tions in which people can be healthy.\" Furthermore, public he alth includes \"spreading the word about ways to stay healthy and giving science-based solutions to problem s\" (APHA, 2019). A public health framework entails designing interventions to address one of three strategies: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. The aim of primary prevention is to intervene before any he alth effects occur, such as by changing health behaviors or changing the built e nvironment so that exposures to hazards are decreased (IWH, 2015). Strategies that focus on primary preventi on typically include clinical preventive services (e.g., immunization or post- exposure prophylaxis for individuals exposed to a communicable disease), media campaigns rais ing public awareness about the link between certain behaviors and health outcomes (e .g., smoking and lung cancer, wearing seatbelts automobile crash safety), and education aimed at personal health behavior s (e.g., oral and dental hygiene education) (WHO, 2019b). For social isolation and lone liness, primary prevention may include public health awareness campaigns a nd identifying individuals at high risk. Other approaches, while outside the scope of this committee's work, might include neighborhood and city planning for housing design and community spaces that would facilitate bringing people together (e.g., common spaces for gathering, sidewalks), facilitate interactions (e.g., opportunities for volunteering, inte rgenerational housing) , and prevent isol ation (e.g., more effective public transportation). 21 Secondary prevention aims to reduce the impact of a di sease or illness that has already occurred by, for example, using screening or as sessment to identify the earliest stages of the condition. Some examples of secondary preventions strategies are regimens of daily low-dose aspirin for individuals who have suffered from heart attack or stro ke; regular mammogram 21 Fried, L. 2018.

In the case of social connection, secondary prevention strategies are those that a ttempt to target or influence existing social isolation or loneliness that is felt acutely (in other words, a tempor ary state of loneliness or social isolation, perhaps due to a sentin el life event). This also in cludes the assessment for social isolation and loneliness, as discussed in Chapter 7. Tertiary prevention involves managing a disease post-dia gnosis in order to slow or soften the impact of the disease or to stop its progression (CDC, 2017). Examples of tertiary prevention include cardiac or stroke rehabi litation programs, chronic di sease management programs for diabetes or depression, and support groups for people with cancer. In the case of social isolation and loneliness, tertiary prevention strategies at tempt to address chronically experienced social isolation or loneliness (in other words, \"trait\" loneliness). Examples include the use of CBT (see earlier in this chapter). One important consideration in the devel opment of interventions for isolation and loneliness is who (i.e., which actor) is responsible for carry ing out these actions. Different actors will be responsible for and involved in different t ypes of interventions. Figure 9-1 suggests levels of responsibility for interventions in loneliness. (Note, these le vels of responsibility correspond to the contextual factors of the committee's fr amework in Chapter 1.) The figure shows that primary prevention strategies su ch as public education campaigns and relevant research funding are the responsibility of govern ment health authorities and nonpr ofit organizations. Key partners here include organizations such as the U.S. Public Health Service, the Administration for Community Living, and area agencies on aging. Secondary prevention strategies are the responsibility of community actors such as general health care practitioners and local service groups. Those responsible for tertiary prevention st rategies include affected individuals and their close associates or care team, including but not limited to family and friends (Mann et al., 2017). However, all of these actors will likely need to wo rk together in concert to address the health and medical impacts of social isolation and loneli ness using this public health approach. For example, the Trust for America's Health \"is prior itizing the role of public health to improve the health and well-being of our na tion's growing older adult popul ation\" by sharing \"models of public health collaborations with the aging se ctor\" (Trust for Ameri ca's Health, 2020). In another example, age-friendly health systems (a n initiative of The John A. Hartford Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in partnership with the American Hospital Association and the Catholic Hea lth Association of the United Stat es) seek, in part, to \"know and align care with each older adult's specific he alth outcome goals and ca re preferences\" (IHI, 2020). Collaborations and partnerships such as these around public he alth and aging could consider their role in addr essing social isolation and l oneliness among older adults.

All rights reserved.9-38 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Interventions A variety of interventions have been propos ed to address isolation and loneliness. However, there is currently not enough evidence to identify the most effective interventions. The evidence base for interventions is limited by sample size and the length of follow-up. Few (if any) randomized controlled trials have been conducted on these interventions, and many interventions lack a theoretical basis. Features of successful interventions may include an educational approach to the intervention, the involvement of the indivi duals being targeted in the design of the intervention, and a strong th eoretical basis for the approach of the intervention. Many intervention studies do not use a valida ted tool (as described in Chapter 6). Rather, these interventions are assessed using qualitative interviews, surveys, and internally designed measurement tools. Both direct and indirect interventions hold promise for ameliorating the negative health impacts of isolation and loneliness. It is important that interventions target the underlying issue causing isol ation or loneliness, if the underlying cause is known (e.g., hearing loss or mobility limitations). The preservation of an individual's autonomy is an essential ethi cal principle that needs to be respected for all interventions. As new evidence develops, a centralized sh aring of resources and best practices would benefit all stakeholders. Technology A significant proportion of older adults ar e using technologies. With education and support, technology provides an important set of opportunities fo r the toolkit of strategies that can help prevent or mitigate social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Technologically mediated interventions might be helpful adjuncts to other interventions intended to prevent or mitigat e social isolation and loneliness in older adults. Studies of the use of Internet and, more specifically, social media by older adults introduce mixed findings; several studies show that online tools may increase connection and decrease isolation, while othe rs have shown no links between Internet use and perceived isolation. The number of studies examining social robot s for social isolation and loneliness has increased significantly in recent years, but there is insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. Conversational agents are de signed to promote engagement and address loneliness, especially for older adults with mild c ognitive impairment; the majority of the Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-39 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS evaluations of conversational agents to date have focuse d on short-term feasibility and acceptability. The digital divide, especially the rural-urba n digital divide, is a major moderator of the effectiveness of many interventions. Ex amples of the differences observed in the digital divide include familiarity; access to equipment, software, and fees; acceptability; ease of use with physical or em otional health problems or disabilities; and literacy. Special population groups (e .g., different age groups, people with different levels of literacy, people with different levels of in come, people with varying functional status, and various racial ethnic, and cultural groups ) need to be considered when designing technological solutions to social isolation and lone liness for older adults. Clinician familiarity with technological st rategies to improve health, including the prevention or treatment of social isolati on and loneliness, is influenced by time, reimbursement strategies, and regulatory issues. As with other areas of health care, ethical and legal considerations especially must be explored when the technology is used in interventions for isol ation and loneliness. Financing of Interventions Current interventions are larg ely supported by volunteers, wi th much of the financial support coming from grants and donations. This is an unsustainable financing model. The availability of adequate resources to support and sustain interventions is key to their long-term success. Many efforts to develop newer approaches to the funding of inte rventions (largely for interventions directed at the social dete rminants of health in general) have not been evaluated for their impact on social isolation and loneliness specifically. The committee notes the following findings from the report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care (NASEM, 2019): o Within existing definitions of health care, state Medicaid programs and their contracted managed care plans and accountab le providers are innovating with . . . activities to pay for social care in health care settings using state plan amendment authority and the waiv er process (p. 7). o There remains great variation among states in the level of social care activity; the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Se rvices (CMS) provides only limited guidance about permissible social car e activities and benefits (p. 7) o Medicare's new supplemental benefits gui dance to Medicare Advantage plans . . . has created new opportunities to integrat e social care into the health care of Medicare beneficiaries (p. 7). o Patients enrolled in both Medicaid and Medi care have the highest social needs, but the division of their health care fina ncing between state and federal agencies creates barriers to addressing those needs in a way that integrates social care (p. 9). o Social service agencies and health care organizations have historically not worked together, and they are f unded by different systems (p. 9). Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-40 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS NEXT STEPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The committee identified two key areas that ne ed to be addressed re lated to interventions overall: strengthening community-based networ ks and resources and improving the overall evidence base. Strengthening Ties to Community-Based Networks and Resources Chapters 2 through 4 of this report show that social isolation and loneliness have wide- ranging health and medical impacts and are associated with a vast array of risk factors. Like other social determinants of h ealth, social isolation and lone liness are community-wide problems and require coordinated solutions between the he alth care system and community-based social service providers. National, state, and local coalitions of public and private health care leaders, including minority-based commun ity organizations, need to work collectively to develop strategies to address social isol ation and loneliness in older adu lts. A report of the Campaign to End Loneliness recommended that service providers make connections with others in order to address the full range of needed supports and serv ices, stating \"Providers need to assess what contribution they make to the overall framew ork of loneliness interventions and build the necessary partnerships to deliv er more effectively with othe r providers\" (Jopling, 2015, p. 59). As noted earlier, cross-sector coalitions and partnerships ar e two strategies for increasing assistance, alignment, and advocacy activities in order to integrat e social care into health care. The committee concludes that such partnerships are similarly needed in order for the health care system to help address social isolation and l oneliness in older adults. Therefore, the committee identifies the following goal and recommendations: GOAL: Strengthen ties between the health care system and community-based networks and resources that address social isolation and loneliness in older adults. RECOMMENDATION 9-1: Health care prov iders, organizations, and systems should partner with social service provi ders, including those serving vulnerable communities, in order to create effective te am-based care (which includes services such as transportation and housing suppo rt) and to promote the use of tailored community-based services to address social isolation and lonelin ess in older adults. In particular, the committee notes that many h ealth care organizations (e.g., hospitals) are required under federal law to submit community be nefit reports. Efforts by such entities to partner with social service provi ders could be used as an exam ple of their community benefit efforts. As an example of tailored commun ity-based services, the 2019 National Academies report Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care cites examples of assistance and alignment as including the provisi on of transportation vouchers that can be used for ride-sharing services or public transit and the investme nt in community ride-sharing programs (NASEM, 2019). In the case of social isola tion and loneliness, such servi ces would allow individuals to travel to health care appointments and also to overcome individual tran sportation-related barriers to participation in local community events. A variety of stakeholders, both within and out side the formal health care system, are testing new approaches to prev enting, identifying, and interven ing for social isolation or Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-41 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS loneliness for older adults. The committee conc luded that as new evidence develops, a centralized sharing of resources and best practi ces would benefit all st akeholders. The committee noted that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has funded resource centers aimed primarily at health and social care professionals on a variety of topics that ar e of wide interest for the care of older adults (HHS , 2019d). Existing centers include the National Falls Prevention Resource Center, the National Clearinghouse for Long-Term Care Information, the National Resource Center on Nutrition and Aging, and th e National Resource Center on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Aging. These re source centers not only serve as centralized resources for information, but also may provide training and technical assistance (Meyer and Johnston, 2014). Therefore, the committee makes the following recommendation: RECOMMENDATION 9-2: Given the public heal th impact of social isolation and loneliness, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services should establish and fund a national resource cente r to centralize evidence, res ources, training, and best practices on social isolation and loneliness, including those for older adults and for diverse and at-risk populations. Improving the Evidence Base on Interventions The committee found that the over all quality of the evidence for specific interventions for social isolation and loneliness in older adults, particularly for inte rventions related to health care providers, is mixed. Current res earch uses a variety of definitions, measures, outcomes, and length of follow-up. Furthermore the populati on of older people aged 50 and older are heterogeneous in their personal characteristics, th eir specific needs, and the underlying causes of their social isolation and lone liness (if present). While there is some evidence for promising approaches, the committee concluded that rese archers are only beginning to understand which specific approaches work best for which people and which risk factors. In particular, the committee emphasizes that as social isolation an d loneliness are distinct concepts, different intervention approaches may be n eeded to address each of them. As discussed in Chapter 7, the health care syst em has a key role to play in helping to improve the evidence base on effective interventions . To that end, a report from the Campaign to End Loneliness cautions: As long as there is a shortage of evidence of the impact of loneline ss initiatives, there will always be an excuse not to fund this vital work. External evaluati ons are costly, but all organisations can build into their programmes the opportunity to gather data about their impact. By using recognized and accredited tool s, even if only with a sample of service users, we can start to create a reservoir of comparable data, improving the evidence base and building a clearer picture of which ini tiatives work best and why. (Jopling, 2015, p. 59) Furthermore, the report notes: There is a huge shortage of evidence of the impact of loneliness initiatives on minority communities, such as LGBT and BME [black, minority, and ethnic] older people, and older people who live in care homes. This is not necessarily becau se initiatives do not serve these communities, but because providers have not yet gathered the data that proves that they do, and we do not know enough to be able to work out which approaches work Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.9-42 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS best. Providers need to make sure that the needs of these minority communities are built into service planning, and that efforts are made to evaluate the impact on these groups in particular. (Jopling, 2015, p. 59) When it comes to specific technological in terventions, many gaps in our understanding remain, particularly related to potential uninte nded harms and ethical concerns. Also, little is known about how current trends, such as the use of social media, will aff ect social isolation and loneliness in future gene rations of older adults. In accordance with the committee's previously identified goal of developing a more robust evidence base on effective prevention, assessm ent, and intervention strategies for social isolation and loneliness in olde r adults, the committee identifie d three major aspects of the overall evidence base for effective clinical interv entions that need to be addressed in order to determine best practices and approaches. First is to improve the breadth and overall quality of the evidence for interventions in clinical se ttings. The committee notes that along with recommendations for research in Chapters 2 a nd 3, the development of a more robust evidence base is key to identifying effective interventions that might be scaled ra ther than investing in random interventions. Second is to increase the overall funding for such studies. Third is to target research to major gaps in the current evid ence base. Within this co ntext, and as noted in Chapter 7, the committee emphasizes that the pres ervation of an individual's own decisions regarding his or her life (e.g., li ving arrangements, community part icipation) is essential as a guiding principle for all interventions. (See Chapter 10 for mo re on engaging with the recipients of interventions.) RECOMMENDATION 9-3: Funders should prioritize research that builds a scientific foundation for clin ical and public health inte rventions that reduce the health and medical impacts of social is olation and loneliness based on standard theoretical frameworks. Researchers and health care providers and systems that study interventions for social isolation or loneliness should consider the following key elements in the design and evaluation of any intervention in order to enhance the ability to compare across studies: A theoretical framework that drives particular approaches Appropriate choice of measure Specific target population Scalability Sustainability Ways to encourage data sharing For the above recommendation, beca use of the variability in res earch designs to date, it is especially important for resear chers to describe the theoreti cal frameworks driving their approaches in order to build a more coherent body of knowledge. RECOMMENDATION 9-4: Major funders of health research, including the government (e.g., the National Institutes of Health, the Cent er for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Cen tered Outcomes Research Institute), foundations, and large health plans should fund research on effective interventions Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTERVENTIONS 9-43 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS in clinical settings to identify, prevent, a nd mitigate the effects of social isolation and loneliness in older adults. RECOMMENDATION 9-5: Those who fund, develop, and operate programs to assess, prevent, and intervene in social isolation and loneliness should prioritize research on the following major gaps in the evidence base: Tailored interventions based on a pub lic health framework of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. In particular, researchers should examine improved measures to identify individuals who may be at high risk for social isolation or loneliness and pr imary interventions in order to target such individuals. Trends among current younger adults as they age (e.g., use of technology, economic trends) to gain knowledge that informs future approaches to addressing social isolation and loneliness. Flexibility in funding to allow for the pilot testing and evaluation of innovative funding mechanisms for interventions Approaches for assessments of and interventions among understudied groups of older adults (e.g., low income, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) and those who face unique barriers to health. RECOMMENDATION 9-6: System designers as well as those who are developing and deploying technology in interventi ons should ensure that technological innovations related to social isolation and loneliness are properly assessed and tested so as to understand their full range of bene fits and potential adverse consequences in order to prevent harm, and they sh ould work to understand and take into account contextual issues, such as broadband access and having sufficient knowledge and support for using the technology.

All rights reserved.PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 10-1 10 Dissemination and Implementation The gap between discovery of public health know ledge and application in practice settings and policy development is due in part to ineffective dissemination. Brownson et al., 2018a The dissemination and implementation of scient ific evidence into regular and effective use is complex due to the multiplicity and capacity of health care systems and providers and the diversity of the target audiences . However, such efforts are imper ative in order to improve the quality of care, patient outcomes, and populat ion health. Several reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, a nd Medicine describe opportunities for the implementation of evidence to improve populatio n health and health care delivery (IOM, 2009, 2011a,b, 2012, 2013, 2015). The gap between the existence of evidence-based practices and the application of such practices has been linked to poor health outcomes (Conway et al., 2012; Shever et al., 2011; Sving et al., 2012). Two main challenges exist for the dissemination and implementation of information related to the social isolation and loneliness of older adults. First, better dissemination is needed regarding the evid ence of the health impacts of social isolation and loneliness. Second, the best practices of implem entation science will need to be used in order to ensure that health care systems and providers are able to more quick ly adopt evidence-based practices. This will be particularly important as the evidence base on the effectiveness of specific interventions for social isol ation and loneliness improves. DEFINITION OF TERMS Multiple and inconsistent terms are used in the field of dissemination and implementation science (Rabin and Brownson, 2018). For purposes of this report, evidence-based practice is defined as the conscientious and judicious use of current best evidence in conjunction with clinical expertise, patient values, and circumstan ces to guide health care decisions (Straus et al., 2010; Titler, 2014). Ideally, when enough reliable re search evidence is available, practice is guided by findings from research in conjunction with clinical e xpertise and patient values. In some cases, however, a sufficient research base may not be available, and health care decision making relies on other evidence sources, such as sc ientific principles, case reports, and outcomes of quality improvement projects. Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.10-2 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Dissemination research in health is the scientific st udy of the targeted distribution of evidence-based information and intervention mate rials to specific public health or clinical practice audiences with the intent of spreadi ng and sustaining knowledge use and evidence-based interventions (HHS, 2018). The mechanisms and approaches to packaging and conveying the evidence necessary to improve public health an d community and clinical care services are dependent upon the type of audien ce (users), how the messages ar e framed, and the local context in which users reside, work, and live. For example, successful dissemination of health information may occur differently, depending on whether the audience consists of consumers, caregivers, practitioners, policy makers, employers , administrators, or other multiple stakeholder groups. Translation science , more recently known as implementation science , focuses on testing interventions to promote the inte gration of evidence-based practices in order to improve patient outcomes and population health and also to explic ate what implementation strategies work for whom, in what settings, and why (Eccles and Mittman, 2006; HHS, 2018; Titler, 2010, 2014). Implementation research seeks to understand the practice behaviors of h ealth care professionals, health care organizations, consumers, and policy ma kers in their respective contexts or settings (HHS, 2018). Evidence-based practice and implementa tion science, though related, are not interchangeable terms. Evidence-b ased practice is the actual app lication of evidence in practice (the \"doing of\" evidence-based practice), wher eas implementation scie nce is the study of implementation interventions, factors, and contex tual variables that a ffect knowledge uptake and use in practices and communities. The translation research model (Titler and Everett, 2001; Titler et al., 2009, 2016) (see Figure 10-1) is based on Rogers's (2003) diffusi on of innovations framework in which the rate and extent of the adoption of evidence-based heal th care practices are influenced by the nature of the innovation (e.g., clinical topic for the evidence-based practice) and the manner in which the innovation is communicated to the users of the evid ence-based practices w ithin a social system. Successful implementation requires strategies to addr ess each of these areas (Titler, 2010; Titler et al., 2016). An important principle to remember when planning for implementation is that the attributes of the evidence-based practice topic as perceived by users and stakeholders (e.g., ease of use, valued part of practice) are neither stable features nor sure determinants of their adoption. Rather, the interaction among the characteristics of the eviden ce-based practice topic, the intended users, and the context where practices will be implemented all determine the rate and extent of adoption (Dogherty et al., 2012; Greenha lgh et al., 2005).

OVERVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES To narrow the gaps between the known evidence and what is applied in routine health care, implementation scientists have prioritized the development, refinement, and testing of implementation strategies. Implementation strategies are methods or actions (i.e., interventions) to promote and facilitate the adoption, implem entation, sustainment, and scale-up of evidence- based programs, practices, or models of care. In terventions can be disc rete, involving one action or process (e.g., clinical reminders), or they ca n consist of two or more discrete strategies (Kirchner et al., 2018). The challenges facing implementation include the inconsistent terminology used in naming and defining implementation strategies, the lack of an agr eed-upon taxonomy, and the variations in how the implementa tion strategies are operationaliz ed (e.g., who is targeted, who delivers it, temporality). The following sections describe implementation strategies that address each of the four components of th e model illustrated in Figure 10-1. ADDRESSING THE CHARACTERI STICS OF THE TOPIC The complexity of a topic influences im plementation. For example, evidence-based practices to decrease the social isolation and loneliness of older a dults will likely include several actionable recommendations applicable acro ss health care settings and the community (Andermann, 2016; Malani et al., 2019; Veazie et al., 2019). Several implementation strategies can be used to address the characte ristics of the topi c. For example, quick reference guides give targeted concise information in a manner to assist those implementing recommendations in performing specific tasks (Titler, 2018). A variety of quick referen ce guide formats are available, such as laminated checklists and decision-ma king algorithms. Quick reference guides concisely and accurately convey essential actions and inform ation from the practice recommendations and are accessible at the point of care delive ry (Anderson and Titler, 2019; Arditi et al., 2017; Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.10-4 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Pantoja et al., 2019). The design and content of quick reference guides will affect their use in practice and the subsequent implementation of ev idence-based practices (Flodgren et al., 2016; Versloot et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2016). As discussed in Chapter 9, Humana developed a one- page (two-sided) guide for physicians which focu ses on defining social isolation and loneliness, highlighting the major health impacts of social isolation and loneline ss, presenting the UCLA three-question Loneliness Scale, and advising phys icians on potential re ferrals and resources (e.g., area agencies on aging, ridesharing services, food resour ces) (Humana, 2019). The empirical support for electronic clini cal decision support interventions is mixed (IOM, 2011a). Reminders embedded in electronic h ealth records have small to modest effects on clinician behavior and appear to be more e ffective when included as part of multi-faceted implementation strategies than when used alone (Anderson and Titler, 2019). Conveying key messages about recommended practi ces at the point of care delivery is another way to foster the implementation of recommendations and is useful for reducing complexity. Distilling the recommendations to a few key points on visual displays can be very effective when the displays are designed appropriately. Examples include posters and infographics. Selecting the key message tools to promote implementation requires consideration of the knowledge of the end users, the context in which the tools will be used, and their design and usability (Flodgren et al., 2016; Grimshaw et al., 2012). ADDRESSING USERS OF THE EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION When designing implementation strategies that address the users of the evidence-based practices, it is essential to first delineate the targ eted audiences or key stak eholders for the use of the information as well as the nature of the c ontext in which they work or interact with the specified patient population. For example, interven tions to decease social isolation may include social workers, psychologists, public policy make rs, community health workers, and clinicians such as primary care physician s, physician assistants, nurse pr actitioners, mental health care providers, and physical therapists (among others ). The interventions may target the general population to increase awareness about the i ssue (i.e., social isol ation, lonelin ess) and considerations for addressing it. Members of a group such as individuals w ithin a health care system (e.g., nurses, physicians, community health workers) influe nce how quickly and widely evidence-based practices are adopted (Rogers, 2003). Implementa tion strategies that have demonstrated effectiveness in improving evidence-based pract ices of the users include performance gap assessment, audit and feedback, trying the eviden ce-based practice, engagi ng with the recipients of the evidence-based practices to address their values and pr eferences (e.g., shared decision making), and ongoing meetings to address barri ers and acknowledge success (F\u00f8nhus et al., 2018; 2012; Stacey et al., 2017; Titler and Anderson, 2019). These stra tegies are discussed in the following sections. Performance Gap Assessment Performance gap assessment is the provision of baseline or current practice indicators at the beginning of a practice change. It is used to engage clinicians in discussions about the current practice and about the formulation of strategies to promote alig nment of their practices with Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 10-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS evidence-based practices. As discussed in Ch apter 7, many health care delivery systems are exploring practice-based strategies to identify and address the so cial determinants of health (including social isolation and loneliness); yet, clinicians may see such approaches as burdensome. As evidence-based practices fo r social isolation and loneliness emerge, performance gap assessment could provide the opportunity for clinicians to engage in the alignment of their practices for the implem entation of these evidence-based practices. Audit and Feedback Audit and feedback is the ongoing auditing of performance indicators, aggregating data into reports, and discussing the findings with prac titioners on a regular ba sis during the practice change (Hysong, 2009; Hysong et al., 2012; Ivers et al., 2012). This strategy he lps clinicians see how their efforts to improve care and pa tient outcomes are pr ogressing throughout the implementation process (Ivers et al., 2014). Trying the Evidence-Based Practice The users of evidence-based practices usually try the method for a period of time before fully adopting (Greenhalgh et al., 2005; Rogers , 2003). When an evidence-based practice is given a trial as part of an implementation, user s have an opportunity to use the evidence-based practice, provide feedback to the implementati on team, and modify the practice as necessary. This feedback loop will be key to Recommenda tion 7-1, the performance of assessments to identify social isolation or l oneliness in older adults. As the committee noted, more needs to be learned about who should receive assessments, who should conduct the assessments, the ideal frequency of assessment, and appropriate referr als. Feedback garnered by the initiation of assessment in clinical settings will provide valuable data on how to best intervene. Engaging with the Recipients of the Evidence-Based Practices An important component of implementing evid ence-based practices is engaging with the recipients of the practices to a ddress their values and preferences. Putting the patient, family, and community at the center of health care decisions is a core component of implementing evidence- based practices. It is essential to address patient values, characteristics, and contextual factors that are important to them. This is similar to the finding in Chapter 9 that a common factor of many successful interventions for so cial isolation and l oneliness is the active engagement of the older adult in the design of the intervention itself to ensure that the voice of the individual is at the center of interventions. Furthermore, shared decision making is a process by which patients and health care workers partner to make informed health decision s that benefit the patients and are aligned with consumers' knowledge and values (Msowoya a nd Gephart, 2019). One approach to promoting shared decision making is the use of patient deci sion aides. Patient decision aides (also known as shared decision-making aides) ar e evidence-based documents or tools that support patients by making decisions explicit, providing information about options and associated benefits and harms, and helping to clarify congruence betwee n decisions and personal values (Msowoya and Gephart, 2019; Stacey et al., 2017). These types of processes will be important, again, to ensure the autonomy of individuals who are identified as socially isolated or lo nely.

All rights reserved.10-6 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS interventions, and personal preferences for lifestyle (e.g., living a rrangements, community participation) need to be respec ted and honored in interventions. When engaging patients, families, groups, and communities in health care decision making, it is important to be attuned to health literacy, health numer acy, and primary language. Health literacy, or th e ability to understand wr itten information about health, and health numeracy, the ability to understand quantitative da ta or information presented as numbers or graphs, are important for health care decision making. Thus it is n ecessary to ensure that patient materials and tools are in the patient's prim ary language and convey the appropriate meaning following translation (Msowoya and Gephart, 2019). Meetings with Key Stakeholders Another implementation strategy is to have re gular meetings with key stakeholders and those implementing the evidence-based practices in order to track the process of implementation, provide guidance, address questions that arise, solve ongoing challenges, and share implementation strategies that are working (Titler et al., 2009, 2016). COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES Information and shared understanding move through communication channels, such as mass media, and interpersonal or interactive co mmunication routes, such as the Internet and social media. Which of various communication st rategies one uses for implementation depends upon the stage of implementation (see Figure 10-2 ), the audience target ed for communication, the nature of the information to be communicate d, and the desired outcomes. For example, if the desired outcome is to in crease awareness about the impact of social isolation on the health of community-dwelling older adults, implementers may consider using mass media delivered through the Internet by professiona l organizations and consumer groups. (See Chapter 8 for more on public health campaigns.) When selecting co mmunication strategies, it is important to be clear about the types of audiences to be reached and the information sources they use.

The primary channels of mass media are tele vision, radio, print materials, internet sources, and digital technology (Bala et al., 2 017; Carson-Chahhoud et al., 2017). The characte ristics of a mass media communication that influence the amount of attention that th e communication attracts include the seriousness of the issue being disc ussed, the human interest (as with a personal story), timeliness, and conflict and controversy (Brownson et al., 2018a). The use of mass media to align clinician professional practices with the evidence most likely increases awareness and persuasion early during implement ation (Grimshaw et al., 2012). The definition of social media is broad and constantly changing, but social media can be thought of as a form of elect ronic communication us ing a variety of platforms through which users create online communities to share informa tion, ideas, messages, and other content such as videos. Social media makes it possible for info rmation and knowledge to be rapidly shared (Kirton, 2019; Roland, 2018; Ventola, 2014). The types of social media can be grouped by function (Djuricich, 2014; Kirton, 2019; Ventola, 2014), Professional networking\u2014LinkedIn Flickr, Instagram Content production\u2014blogs such Tumb lr and Blogger and microblogs such as Twitter Knowledge or information aggregation\u2014Wikipedia Although dissemination of evidence-based prac tice information through social media is significantly and positively associated with more downloads and citations of the evidence, it is unclear if the use of such dissemination pathwa ys has a positive effect on practice behaviors (Brownson et al., 2018a; Puljak, 2016). Studies have demonstrated that the use of social media increases users' knowledge about evidence-based practices and, based on self-reports, the application of evidence in their practice (Dyson et al., 2017; Frisch et al., 2014; Maloney et al., 2015; Tunnecliff et al., 2017). Bernhardt et al . (2011) describe how social media can be leveraged to enhance the dissemination and implem entation of research evidence. More research using rigorous designs is needed to fully exp licate the impact of social media on improving the knowledge, skills, and application of evidence in health care. When using social and mass media, the c onsiderations about messaging include knowing the audience, defining the customer, specifying the message and framing it, and selecting the communication channels (Brownson et al., 2018a; Steensma et al., 2018). A challenge for the dissemination of information related to eviden ce-based practices is defining the customer. \"Failure to properly identify cu stomers is the undoing of many valuable innovations\" (Steensma et al., 2018, p. 193). Defining the customer help s frame the message and identify the proper communication channels and social media platforms for reaching them. This is particularly relevant for social isolation a nd loneliness in that there are lik ely a variety of underlying causes which likely require very key messa ges and intervention approaches.

All rights reserved.DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 10-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Education As discussed in Chapter 8, educating the user s of evidence-based practices is necessary but not sufficient in order to chan ge practice, and didactic educa tion alone does little to change practice behavior (Forsetlund et al ., 2009; Gigu\u00e8re et al., 2012). Ther e is moderate evidence that educational meetings that include both didactic and interactive learning are more effective in aligning professional practice behavi ors with the evidence-based prac tices than didactic meetings alone or interactive learning al one (Forsetlund et al., 2009). Dependi ng on the complexity of the evidence-based practices to be implemented, a variety of educational approaches can be considered, including train-the-trainer programs, high-fidelity simula tion, and ongoing point-of- care coaching (Brownson et al., 2018a; Titler and Anderson, 2019). Many web sources have packaged selected resources into implementation t oolkits that include printed materials, training videos, and slide presentations. A toolkit could be developed for communities and health systems to facilitate the implementation of evidence-bas ed practices to addre ss social isolation and loneliness. For example, as discussed in Ch apter 9, Humana created a Loneliness Toolkit (Humana, 2018) directed at consumers. The tool kit includes information on health-related issues (e.g., stress, substance abuse, vision and hearing impairment), staying engaged (e.g., transportation alternatives, housing options, use of social media), supporting loved ones (e.g., personal coping skills, caregiver support groups), and general community resources (e.g., area agencies on aging, rideshari ng services, support groups). Opinion Leadership and Change Champions Studies and systematic reviews have demonstr ated that opinion leaders are effective in changing the behaviors of health care practitioners (Anderson and Titler, 2014; Cranley et al, 2019; Dagenais et al., 2011; 2013; et al., 2016; Yousefi Nooraie et al., 2017), especially in combination w ith educational outreach or performance feedback. Opinion leaders are from the local peer group, viewed as a respected source of influence, considered by associates as technically competent, and trusted to judge the fit between the evidence-based practices and the local situation (Dobbins et al., 2009; Flodgren et al., 2011; Grimshaw et al., 2012). Opinion leader ship is multifaceted and complex, with role functions varying by the circumstances, but fe w successful projects that have implemented evidence-based practices have managed wit hout opinion leaders (Gre enhalgh et al., 2005; McCormack et al., 2013). Opinion leaders am ong groups of older adults may encourage participation in interventions, most lik ely for community-based interventions. Change champions are also helpful for impl ementing innovations (Dogherty et al., 2012; Rogers, 2003). They are practitione rs within the local setting (e.g., clinic, patient care unit, public health agency) who are expert clinicians, are passionate about the evidence-based practice topic, are committed to improving the quality of care, and have a positive working relationship with other health professionals (Rogers, 2003). They circulate information, encourage peers to adopt the evidence-based practi ces, arrange demonstrations, and orient peers to the evidence- based practices (Titler et al., 2016). The scope of influence that change champions have is usually within a specific unit or team within an agency, whereas the influence of an opinion leader spans multiple units or teams across an agency. For example, if an evidence-based practice tool to assess social isolation is being implemented across multiple primary care practices in a health system, to implement the practice one nurse and one physician opinion leader could work across the practice sites in collaboration with cha nge champions that are Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

This will be key to the implementation of Recommendation 7-1 (assessing for social isolation and loneli ness) wherein the committee concluded that an important aspect of selecting a tool for use in cl inical settings is sta ndardization, meaning that within a specific health care syst em or organization all clinicians would use the same tool or set of tools rather than reso rting to different tools. Educational Outreach Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of educational outreach, also known as academic detailing, in improving the pr actice behaviors of clinicians (Avorn, 2010; IOM, 2011a; O'Brien et al., 2007; Titl er et al., 2009, 2016; Wilson et al., 2016). Educational outreach involves interactive face-t o-face education and dialogue with pr actitioners in their setting by an individual (usually a clinician) with expertise in a particular t opic (e.g., the prevention of social isolation). Academic detailers are able to expl ain the research foundations of the evidence-based practices and respond convincingly to specific questions, concerns, or challenges that a practitioner might raise. Clinic ians' perceptions of educationa l outreach as an implementation strategy are quite posit ive and perceived as helpful in overcoming implementation barriers (Wilson et al., 2016). ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL CONTEXT The social context for evidence-based practice implementation refers to the characteristics of the physical setting of im plementation and the dynamic practice factors in which implementation processes occur (May et al., 2016; Shuman et al., 2018a; Squires et al., 2015). Context factors that aff ect implementation include Organizational capacity for evidence-based practice (Brownson et al., 2018b; 2009; Ya al., 2017), (Aarons et 2014; Birken et al., 2016; Hauck et al., 2012; Jun et al., 2016; Richter et al., 2016; Riley et al., 2018; Shum an et al., 2018a; Wong and Giallonardo, 2013), Practice climates for use of evidence-based practices (Ehrhart et al., 2014; Jacobs et al., 2014; et al., 2018a; Yamada et al., 2017), and Evidence-based practices competencies of mid-level managers and supervisors (Gifford et al., 2007; Melnyk et al ., 2014; Shuman et al., 2019). The organizational capacity needed includes st rong leadership, a clea r strategic vision, good managerial relationships, visionary staff in key positions, a climate conducive to experimentation and risk taking, and effective systems for data capture and transforming data into information (Brownson et al., 2018b; Riley et al., 2018; Titler and Anderson, 2019). Elements of system readiness for assimilating ev idence-based practices into care delivery include a tension for change, a fit of th e evidence-based practices with th e system, clear implications of adopting or not adopting the evidence-based pr actices, support and advocacy for the evidence- based practice topic (e.g., reducing the social is olation of community-dwelling older adults), the time and resources necessary for implementation, and the capacity to evaluate the impact of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 10-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS evidence-based practices on processes and out comes of health care during and following implementation (Brownson et al., 2018b; Titler and Anderson, 2019). When promoting the use of evidence-based pract ices, it is crucial to consider the context in which the potential users of the evidence wi ll work because the sett ings for implementation are dynamic, and each setting carries its own set of contextual f actors, such as the practice climate and leadership behaviors that influen ce the implementation and sustainability of the evidence-based practices (Riley et al., 2018; Titler and Anderson, 2019). Implementation strategies that target the soci al context generally address infrastructure elements of the system (Riley et al., 2018). These strategies, descri bed in the following sections, include Performing an environmental scan, Understanding the governance of the organization, Engaging with key leadership stakeholders, Addressing the standards of practic e and documentation systems, and Promoting linkages among health systems and communities. Environmental Scan An environmental scan is a process that asse sses internal strengths and challenges for a specific topic\u2014in this case, the implementati on of evidence-based practices. Environmental scans include the structure and function of th e organization\u2014how things are done within a system or community. One purpose of an environmental scan is to understand the mission, vision, and values on an organization and to articulate how the proposed evidence-based practices will contribute to meeting these or ganizational attributes . Those who lead the implementation of evidence-based practices to ad dress social isolation and loneliness will need to articulate how these recommendations will cont ribute to comprehensive care for the older adults served by the particular health system . (See more on comprehensive care in Chapter 7.) Organizational Governance and Engaging with Key Leadership Stakeholders Understanding the governance structure is necessary so that work can be integrated into existing structures. Selected members of the im plementation team will need to meet with key leadership stakeholders representing each of the di sciplines that will be users of the evidence- based practices. Given the wide variety of health care workers who will be required to fully address social isolation and loneliness (see Chapter 8), it will be important for such meetings to include representatives across the health care workforce. Addressing Standards of Practi ce and Documentation Systems Written standards of practice (e.g., policies, procedures, clinical pathways) and documentation systems need to support the use of the evidence-based practices (Titler, 2010). Clinical information systems may need to be revised in order to support practice changes; documentation systems that fail to readily suppo rt the new practice thwart change (IOM, 2011b). For example, having an electronic health record or medical record that is capable of capturing data on social isolation and loneliness will be key to the implementation of Recommendation 7-3, the inclusion of social isol ation in the electr onic health record or medical record.

All rights reserved.10-12 SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LO NELINESS IN OLDER ADULTS PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Promoting Linkages Among Health Systems and Communities Several models of care delivery and role specialization have emerged to provide continuity and linkages across levels and sites of care delivery and with communities. These models include case management, care coor dination, patient navi gation programs, and transitional models of care (Hirschman et al ., 2015; IOM, 2011b; Lamb and Newhouse, 2018; NASEM, 2016c; Naylor et al., 2013). People working within th ese models of care are key stakeholders to engage in implementing evidence -based practices and to provide linkages with the community. A care coordinator or patient navigator may be among the first to know if community-dwelling older adults are suffering from social isolation and can help navigate referrals and follow-up for community services to address the issue (see Chapter 8). These professionals are also well positioned to comm unicate the importance of this issue broadly among the health care workforce. To realize th e full impact of implementing evidence-based practices within health care settings, it is es sential to have partners hips and linkages with communities and those outside the health sector (e.g., social services, law enforcement, urban planning and housing programs) (Brownson et al ., 2018b; McMillen and Adams, 2018). To that end, Recommendation 9-1 calls for the integration of health care and social care in order to provide effective team-based care and promote th e use of tailored community-based services to address social isolation and loneliness. SUSTAINABILITY As noted in Chapter 9, the sustainability of an intervention is a ke y element in the design and evaluation of that in tervention. Sustainability refers to the degree to which the implemented evidence-based practices continue after impl ementation. Given the considerable effort and resources required to implement such practices, it is crucial to determine which improvements are sustained or decay following implementatio n. However, few studies have addressed the determinants of sustaining evidence-based pr actices following adoption (Stirman and Dearing, 2019). Experts agree however, th at planning for sustainability during development and delivery of implementation interventions contributes to su stainability and continued improvements (Ploeg et al., 2018b; Stirman and Dearing, 2019; Tricco et al., 2016). The following principles are helpful to consider when planning implementation (Chambers et al., 2013; Col\u00f3n-Emeric et al., 2016; Johnson et al., al., 2009; Tricco et al., 2016). 1. Use implementation strategies that a ddress the needs and context of the organization. 2. Address alignment with organiza tion's value, mission, and vision. 3. Integrate evidence-based programs or pract ices into existing staffing models and workflow. 4. Engage with key stakeholders early and often (stakeholder participation). 5. Include programs for training new staff and conducting annual competencies of all staff. 6. Plan for work force turnover. 7. With use of non-professional he alth workers such as lay health workers, plan for mechanisms to support their ability to deliver the evidence-based practices.

Plan for and adapt to the dynamic contexts in which the evidence-based programs or interventions are implemented. 9. Set boundaries for potential adaptations , including impact on outcomes. 10. Include outcomes meaningful to the key stakeholders in evaluations, and share the findings. 11. Incorporate selected metrics into quality and performance improvement programs for ongoing monitoring. CONCLUSION Promoting and sustaining use of evidence- based practices and programs is a dynamic process that is influenced by the context or se tting, the population served, and the attributes of what is being implemented. The science of implementation is growing with multiple challenges and opportunities in advancing this field of inquiry. As the evidence base for effective interventions in health care settings for social isolation and loneliness in older adults is improved (as discussed in previous chapters), consider ation of best practices for dissemination and implementation of this information is needed both in the planning of the intervention to be tested as well as in consideration of any implementation plan.
