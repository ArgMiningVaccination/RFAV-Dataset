Please remember, all employees must sign a photo release before their photos may be used for publication. And don't forget to abide by your department's dress code policies.

Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Schedules now available on the HHC Connect [intranet](https://intranet.hartfordhealthcare.org/human-resources/health-and-wellness/tuberculosis-testing) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) requires all hospital employees who perform direct patient care to receive an annual tuberculosis screening. All employees are required to come to Occupational Health Services (OHS) for their screening. OHS staff does not travel to departments to perform screenings. Starting in January 2017, employees must come in for their annual or semi-annual screening by department/service area. This helps OHS staff screen employees more evenly throughout the year and avoid a bottleneck of employees who need to be screened at the end of the fiscal year. Employees have a 30-day grace period to complete testing. If TB screenings are not completed by the grace period, badge access will be terminated. For more information and to view the TB testing schedules at Hartford Hospital, visit [HHC Connect](https://intranet.hartfordhealthcare.org/human-resources/health-and-wellness/tuberculosis-testing).

Employees who are required to do a yearly N95 Respirator Fit test will see their due date in HealthStream as their anniversary date of starting at the hospital. When you have completed all three steps, the assignment will automatically reset to the same month next year. Complete your HealthStream module prior to getting the Fit Test portion. If there are any changes to your cardiac or pulmonary health, or if you are a new employee, you must be medically cleared by Occupational Health prior to being Fit Tested. Also, Federal Law prohibits testing of anyone with facial hair that interferes with the mask seal. Please ensure you meet all of these requirements before getting Fit Tested.
