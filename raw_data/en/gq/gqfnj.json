Women have not always experienced equality in the areas of politics, the law, the economy, and even within families and communities. Through countless campaigns and activism, girls and women are now able to fully participate and lead in many areas of society. In 2013, we celebrate a historical moment in Canadian politics\u2014 we have six female Premiers! More women of all ages are attending university and college, and more are working in different areas such as business, government, the not-for-profit sector, education, and law. Women and girls also continue to work and gain momentum in the fields of science, technology, trades, engineering, and math. But we need you to keep the momentum going! So be free to discover who you are, and explore the many different things that you like and enjoy doing. According to Statistics Canada, over 67,435 girls ages 14 and younger were living in Nova Scotia in 2011. Each one of you are special. Y ou can discover yourself by exploring different activities such as participating in school, sports, art, music and nature. Guide for Girls is here to support you in reaching your potential as you continue on your life's journey.YWCA Canada has many resources for girls including: A Girl's Guide to Knowing Her Rights - a publication that speaks about the rights of girls at home, at school, and at work (ywcacanada.ca/data/documents/00000083.pdf).If you want more information, check out their website www.ywcacanada.ca 5 6 As girls, we have value and we can celebrate who we are.

It is what makes each of us special and unique. Diversity includes characteristics that are seen, such as our race, ethnicity, colour, language, and sex. But it also includes characteristics that are not so obvious, such as our gender, sexual orientation, age, ability or disability, religion, political belief, cultural heritage, family background, social class, education, and geographic origin. It takes time and curiosity to get to know ourselves and others well. It also takes time and effort to respect and appreciate our differences and similarities.

Being healthy is not just about \"not being sick.\" It's much more than that.

Being active can also improve concentration and learning to help you at school. You don't have to give up the computer, your video games, or smartphones to be active. Limiting the use of technology a few hours a day can help you find more time to be active. Chances are, your friends who are having fun in recreation, sports, and outdoors are not spending all of their time playing online. To be active, you don't have to lose out on time with friends either. Look for a friend in your neighborhood or school who would like to do an activity with you. Activities are more fun when shared with friends. Our bodies are meant to move. Every teenager needs at least 60 minutes of physical activity during the day . It's about moving a lot daily and not necessarily about training as an athlete. 22 Our bodies are meant to move. BEING ACTIVE BEING HEALTHY There are so many to choose from\u2014walk or cycle to school, dance in the bedroom to your favourite music, try sports during school lunch period, swim at a supervised beach, skate on a pond with your family, or follow a yoga video online. Check with the school, municipal recreation department or youth groups in your area for programs or facilities like a gym, pool, track or trail. It can sometimes feel uncomfortable doing activities around certain people. You may feel unsure about your body and clothing. You may worry others will disapprove of the activity you like. Being a girl does not have to limit what activities you choose or how you participate. You don't need to look a certain way to join in. The more you move, the more confident you will become with the way your body looks, moves and feels. When you find an activity you enjoy, it is just one part of who you are; it doesn't define everything that you are. You may believe you don't have enough physical skills or the ability to learn new skills. Work on small goals, one after another, and soon you will have more experience to help you be confident and do well. There are people who can help\u2014teachers and program volunteers in schools, program leaders in community organizations or perhaps a family member. The key is to find an activity that you find most fun that allows you to move around everyday. What physical activities do you enjoy doing?Try different physical activities until you find the ones you consider most fun . 23 STUFFSTUFF girl STUFF 24Our bodies change as we grow older. For most girls, this includes developing breasts and getting your period. Safe and trusted family members and health professionals can guide you as you navigate through these kinds of \"girl stuff\" such as purchasing the right size bra, using female care products, and getting advise from medical professionals about decisions you need to make such as your sexual health. It may feel a little awkward, but don't worry. You are not alone! There are safe and trusted adults who can help you go through these transitions.You're not alone!When we get sick 24 OSTEOPOROSIS ANEMIAOSTEOPOROSIS Osteoporosis causes bones to break easily, especially when you get older. The most important time for girls to build strong bones is between the ages of 16 and 20, as almost half of the adult skeleton is formed during the teen years. So take action now to prevent osteoporosis later. Get lots of exercise, such as walking and dancing and running. Include calcium in your diet, from foods such as milk, cheese, and leafy green vegetables. ANEMIA Anemia can make you feel tired and cranky, because your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction. To have lots of energy and prevent anemia, eat lots of foods that contain iron and B vitamins, such as green vegetables and seafood.Getting sick is normal. One way that people get sick is through germs which are microscopic and hard to see. They can creep into your system without you noticing. Often times, germs spread through the air through sneezes and coughs, and through bodily fluids. One of the best ways to protect your body is to keep your immune system strong by eating well, drinking enough water, staying physically active and getting enough sleep. These healthy habits allow your body to fight germs. Another way you can prevent getting sick is keeping good personal hygiene \u2014 like showering or bathing regularly, brushing your teeth, and washing your hands often. When we get sick Here is something to consider: 25 Match up the doctor to their expertise: Family Doctor heart Dentist eyes Cardiologist children Dermatologist mental health Optometrist hearing Pediatrician teeth Audiologist general illnesses Psychiatrist skin Getting help when we're sickThere are ways to prevent diseases, and medical professionals are there to help determine ways for people to get better such as prescribing medicine to address illnesses. When you are sick, it is important that you tell a safe and trusted adult such as a family member or a health professional, so that they can bring you to a doctor who can help. When was the last time you were sick? Who was the first person you told? Did you go to the health 26 Diversity is the beauty that makes each of us amazing and special just the way we are. You're amazing! When you stand in front of a mirror, what do you see? Do you see how unique and amazing you are? As you grow older, your physical body will undergo many changes including changes to your height and weight. Don't worry! This is normal, and everyone goes through it. Everyone! Although girls experience similar changes, everyone is unique. Girls and women come in all shapes, sizes, and appearances. 27 Write down some things you love about your body ... 12 53 4body image Body image involves attitude and feelings: how we think about and feel about our bodies. Some people are satisfied with the way they look, while some may think they are too \"something\"\u2014 too thin, too fat, too tall, too short. But remember, just like everyone else, we have good days and bad days ... and our mood can affect how we see ourselves. Know also that what we focus our minds on affects how we view and value ourselves. One way we become unhappy about ourselves is the COMPARISON GAME. Any time you're tempted to compare yourself to others, STOP and consider who you are. No two people are ever the same. We are all unique! Think about your strength , your uniqueness , your talent , your beauty \u2014 both inside and out! Celebrate who you are, and others around you. Think about positiv e things. Build and protect your self-esteem, because healthy minds support healthy emotions and build healthy bodies. 28 body image \"Be a first-rate version of yourself, rather than a second-rate version of someone else\" Judy Garlandbody image One final note ... We all love photos and share them with safe and trusted friends and family online or through text messages. But with all of these social media tools and our smartphone gadgets, let's keep things smart and real. First, know the environment, and be smart about what images and videos are posted online, because whatever is shared electronically may and can be seen and shared by many people, including people you don't know. Second, we need to remember that what we watch on TV and see on the internet, the models in the magazines and on advertising, can create unnecessary pressures to look and dress a certain way. That is why it is very important that we remember what's real, and not get lost in all these images defining what's supposed to be beautiful or creating the pressure or need to be \"sexy.\" Your body is still changing, and you have the power to decide how you want to express yourself with the way you look. Media also has tools to make people look \"good,\" like computer software, expert camera angles and lighting, and professional stylists and make-up artists. Often times, what we see is an illusion. These media images were enhanced to make them look better than real life. We can resist, stay real, and be ourselves. Remember, there is much value in our diversity. Surround yourself with people who love you and accept you just the way you are. And accept and love others just the way they are. digital 29 handling STRESS what stresses you out? wrIte down wha t stresses you the most? Stress comes with change, and some of that is good. Other times, it can become a bit too much. Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed when too much stress happens all at once\u2014from school, exams, parents or guardians, friends, work, money, try outs, and relationships. An important part of growing up is learning how to manage and deal with stress in positive ways. 30 GO FOR A W ALK Exercising helps people manage and relieve stress. When we move around, our body naturally produces and releases chemicals called endorphins that help us feel better about ourselves and the situations we're facing. Endorphins ease away the tension our bodies feel when we're feeling stressed out. Exercising\u2014even something as simple as a walk in fresh air\u2014helps us sleep better, feel rested, and handle stress when it comes up. how do youCOPE? MANAGE YOUR TIME Managing time between school, work, friends, and family can sometimes seem impossible, but prioritizing and setting goals that are realistic and achievable can help you tackle things one step at a time. T ake a break Being too busy can be a big source of stress, so make sure you take some time to RELAX. When stress hits us, sometimes the best thing we can do is to slow things down, and take some time out. Walk away from the problem, take slow and deep breaths, and think about other, more positive things. You'll be surprised how your mind can see more clearly after taking a break. You might want to read a book, play a musical instrument, or write in your journal. ASK FOR HELP When we're feeling overwhelmed, one of the best ways to manage that stress is to reach out to safe and trusted family and friends and ask for help. Sometimes, we may need to talk to professionals like a psychologist or another medical professional. That's OK too. We can discuss our problems and situations with people we trust. They can listen, and sometimes can even offer help to make the situation more manageable for us. In the same way, be a friend to others and listen to them when they need help during stressful times. 31 Sometimes, making healthy decisions is difficult, especially when we are in stressful situations and we feel angry or pressured. Unhealthy actions to cope with stress are often used to shut out and forget about the problems, or to feel in control. Please know that the use of alcohol, drugs, or smoking is not the best way to cope with stress. If you need someone to talk to, you can call the Kids Help Phone 1-800-668-6868 . under control?

Sometimes, it might feel like they don't care. Sometimes, you may enjoy being with them and talking with them, other times \u2014 you might feel like they're treating you like a child.

Write a letter to your parent or guardian. Tell them what you love about them, and what's going on. You can share how you feel, and if you want, ask for help to sort things out. BUT WAIT! After you've written the letter, DON'T GIVE IT TO THEM YET! Keep it for a few days, and read it again. Then decide if you want to share it with them. Do what you believe is best, and what you're comfortable with. \"I talk to my mom a little bit.\" - Nova Scotia teen \"I talk more to my dad because I'm an only child too, but I've always been close to my dad because we have the exact same personality.\" - Nova Scotia teen Some girls are able to talk more with the women or the men in their lives. Whoever it is you communicate with best, finding a way to share what you're thinking and how you're feeling with safe and trusted adults in your life is really important. No one is a mind reader. You can't read their minds, and they can't read yours. One of the best ways to sort out a conflict or misunderstanding is through talking about it, sharing your perspective, and listening to the other person's side. 42 Families go through difficult times like the loss of a loved one or parents divorcing. It's normal for you to feel lost, confused, angry, or frightened. Talk with a safe and trusted adult, like your parent, guardian, or a guidance counselor. Ask questions to help you better understand the situation and to also give you an opportunity to just let it out.Challenging times in the family Parents, siblings, relatives \u2014 they fight from time to time. Conflict is part of life, and so is making up. Talking about what happened, apologizing and stopping behavior that hurts others are important ways to reconcile relationships. Unfortunately though, some families may experience violence during these times. If you feel or know that someone is getting hurt in your family, it's important to tell someone safe and that you can trust like a parent, a guardian, a teacher or a guidance counselor. Remember, your safety and the safety of your loved ones is very important. Ask for help! You can call the Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868.

At times, people can be mean or insensitive. Arguments can happen, and so can misunderstandings. It gets difficult when trust is broken, especially between friends. One of the things you can do is to talk things through with your friends, and see if your friendship can be repaired. It is OK to be angry or upset. These are normal responses to a conflict or disagreement. It is important to learn to communicate and disagree respectfully, but also honestly, without using violence to settle a problem. You'd be surprise to see how a kind word or an apology can mend broken relationships. However, despite your honest efforts, some disagreements can't be sorted out. Even though it might be difficult, the best thing you might be able to do is to let things go and walk away. \"Your most important relationships are with your friends because they're the ones that understand you the most, but you also have a lot of drama with your friends and so that's where it gets tricky\". - Nova Scotia teenProblems with Friends \"My relationship with my friends changed too, so I don't really hang with them anymore, just because of problems\". - Nova Scotia teen 47 It's a known fact, we all need friends!

Intersex is a general term used to describe biological variations in sexual and reproductive development in which a person is born with sexual or reproductive anatomy or chromosomes that do not fit the binary biological sex of female or male. is typically understood within two fixed options \u2014 boy/man or girl/woman. A society or culture makes up the roles and relationships, traits, behaviours, values, power and influence appropriate between the two genders. Gender messages and expectations are constantly around us. Most assume that a person's gender is based on the sex they are assigned at birth. However, there is much more diversity than that! Gender identity is your internal sense of being male, female, both, neither, or somewhere in between. Gender identity refers to the internal experience of a person that cannot be determined by others. A person's gender identity is different from their sexual orientation. How you present or show your gender to the world is known as gender expression. For most people, gender identity or expression is consistent with their assigned sex at birth. For transgender individuals, gender identity or expression differs from their assigned sex. People who are gender variant or gender nonconforming have a gender expression that differs from what is expected for their perceived gender or assigned sex in a given culture. Some people identify as genderqueer. This is a label for individuals whose gender identity is outside the male/female gender identification. Aboriginal people may identify themselves as Two Spirit rather than as bisexual, gay, lesbian, or transgender. Two Spirit implies the embodiment of both masculine and feminine spiritual qualities within the same body. What is the difference between sex and gender ? 64 Sexual orientation is who we are romantically, emotionally, or physically attracted to. Sexual orientation is about who you like, who you crush on, who you form relationships with \u2014 who you love. Sexual behaviour is often confused with sexual orientation. Where sexual orientation is about attraction, sexual behaviour is just about sex. Someone's sexual behaviour does not necessarily tell us about someone's sexual orientation, or vice versa. What is sexual orientation ? 65 Asexual: People who are asexual usually do not experience sexual attraction. They do sometimes have emotional attractions, and form relationships (just not ones that involve sexual behaviour). This means sometimes people who are asexual can also identify as straight or LGBTQ. Bisexual: A bisexual person is emotionally and physically attracted to men and women\u2014it doesn't have to be 50/50, or an equal feeling. Someone could be more attracted to men or more to women, but feels they could have a relationship with either. Pansexual: The word \"pan\" means \"all,\" so pansexual is used to mean a person who is attracted to people of various identities and expressions. If you think of the word bisexual, \"bi\" means \"two,\" implying there are only two genders. Some people disagree with this, and use pansexual as a way of lifting those limitations on gender. It does not mean that bisexuality is seen in a negative light, just that there are other identities that some people find more comfortable. Queer: Queer can be an identity that is a little less limiting than others. Queer means someone is not straight (or heterosexual), but who feels that words like lesbian, gay, or bisexual aren't quite right either. It can also be useful because it doesn't gender someone, or indicate the gender of someone's partner. Many like to identify as queer for these reasons. Note as well that \"queer\" is also used as a slur, and should always be defined before using. Make it known that you are using queer in a positive way. People also like to use queer in a positive way because it can take away the negative power of the word. Straight (Heterosexual): A person who is attracted to the opposite sex/gender. Everyone has a sexual orientation, and some of the most common labels are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and straight (but there are more, like queer or pansexual). Here are some definitions: 66 It is often an exciting feeling when you're thinking about romantic relationships. To some people, it can also be a stressful time. Having feelings that make you wonder what your sexual orientation is may be a confusing experience. Whatever it is you are feeling, know that you are not alone! Consider talking with a safe and trusted adult like a parent or guardian, guidance counselor or youth worker. There are people out there you can talk to, such as the staff and youth leaders at The Youth Project at www.youthproject.ns.ca. For more information, you can also check out the Nova Scotia Gay Straight Alliance Manual (2011) www.youthproject.ns.ca/gsa/ docs/GSAManual.pdf. 67 In a healthy relationship, you feel safe, respected and cared about. You know, like, and respect each other. You accept each other as you are and don't try to change each other. You trust each other. You enjoy your time together and aren't jealous when you spend time with other people. You don't control one another. You're there for one another. You support each other through good times and bad. You feel good when you're together. You're relaxed and comfortable. You can laugh and have fun. You're not worried about saying or doing the wrong thing. You can talk about anything. You can discuss your problems and concerns. You even feel comfortable talking about sex. You listen to each other. You're not afraid to be honest or to say what you really think. You can disagree with each other without getting mad. If you do fight, you don't hurt each other and you respectfully make up and work things out.

There is a lot of yelling in your relationship. Your partner freaks out when you don't agree with what she or he wants or says. Sometimes you're scared of what he or she might do which may include more yelling or even hitting. Remember, relationships start with you!

Mutual respect is key.

Are we friends? Do we have fun together? Do we both have other friends and interests and aren't jealous when we spend time with other people? Are we honest with each other? Do we trust one another? Are we comfortable talking about most things, including being ready for sex or not? Do we listen to each other and respect each other's ideas, values, and points of view? Does this relationship make me feel good about myself? When we disagree, do we sort it out respectfully? Am I sure that he or she will never physically hurt me? Do I feel valued and listened to in this relationship? If you answered \"no\" to any of these questions, your relationship could be unhealthy. You might find it helpful to talk with someone you trust about how you feel. For more information, check out the resources available in Nova Scotia starting on page 114.

You can participate in this process by identifying what subjects you enjoy and are good at, and what kinds of jobs you may want to have in the future. 80 New students and their parents or guardians can visit universities and colleges to get more information about how post-secondary education works.

Starting your own business can be a lot of work, but there are people and organizations who can help you make your business ideas into a reality. Growing up, some of you may have organized your own lemonade stand, or your own yard sale. Those are beginnings of your entrepreneurial spirit. You need to think about a few questions: How much time and effort are you willing to invest into this business idea? Where will the funds come from to start your business? What is your business idea? What is the product or service you will be selling? Is there a need for your product or service? 88 These are just some of the very basic parts of starting your own business. You need to consider other things such as taxes and business registration. For more information, you can check out the following websites: Centre for Entrepreneurship Education and Development's Youth Employability Project (YEP) www.ceed.ca Services for Youth: Starting Your Own Business www.youth.gc.ca/eng/ topics/jobs/business.shtml Centre for Women in Business www.centreforwomeninbusiness.ca Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Network (EDN) www. ednns.ca Black Business Initiative (BBI) www.bbi.ca Immigrant Settlement & Integration Services (ISIS) Business Development Services www.isisns.ca/business How much will it cost to produce?

When looking for a job, you can often apply in person by handing in your resume at a service counter. Some companies and organizations will also ask you to complete an application form \u2014 either on paper or online. Word of mouth is also important. Ask your friends and family if they know of places where you can apply for a job. Your local public libraries provide free public access to the Internet, and you can ask a librarian to show you where you can look for employment. Some companies only accept job applications online, either on their website or by email. If you don't have your own email, ask a safe and trusted adult like a parent, guardian, or teacher how to open an account. You can also check out a few websites online like Gmail.com or Hotmail.com . Here are some websites that list job openings: Job Bank www.jobbank.gc.ca CareerBeacon www.careerbeacon.com/Nova -Scotia Federal Student Work Experience Program www.jobs-emplois.gc.ca/fswep-pfete/index-eng.php Note that there are laws that protect all workers, including young workers. For more information about your rights, and what you can or cannot do at work, contact Nova Scotia's Labour Standards office www.novascotia.ca/lae/ labourstandards. 93 Safety comes first! When looking for a job, remember to read through the job posting. It is best to have a conversation with a safe and trusted adult like a parent, guardian or teacher if you are unsure about any part of the job advertisement. You also have a right to stop the application process if you feel that the job you're applying for is unsafe. Once you are hired somewhere, you also have the right to refuse any task that you feel is unsafe. Safety always comes first! For more information about workplace safety, check out: www.novascotia.ca/lae/healthandsafety . Job Interviews After applying for a job, the company or organization usually calls selected candidates for an interview. Usually interviews occur in person. Sometimes, an interview can happen over the phone. Sometimes, there's one person doing the interview; other times, it can be multiple people. They may ask you questions like \"why do you want the job?\", \"what do you have to offer this organization?\", and \"what are your strengths and weaknesses?\" You also need to know that there are some questions an employer cannot ask you, such as your ethnic background, (dis)ability, religion, gender, and personal beliefs. If you experience something like this, you can call the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission at 1-877-269-7699. Remember, the key to doing well in a job interview is preparation! Everyone needs to do work to get work. Check out this website for more information on how you can prepare for job interviews www.youth.gc.ca/eng/topics/jobs/interview.shtml Other things to consider 94 Volunteering One of the best ways to get experience, develop your skills and talents, and build your resume is to volunteer in your community. Volunteering is essentially working for free. You give your time and efforts to a local community group and help them run a program or event. There are many opportunities to lend a helping hand. The section Getting Involved and Giving Back , starting on page 98 of this guide, gives more information about how you can get involved in your community. Transportation Getting around, to and from school or work, is an important part of the puzzle. Some people will have friends and family to give them a lift from one place to another. Many students either take public transportation like the local bus, or get their own driver's licence. Several Nova Scotian municipalities and regions have public transit systems that make it easy and affordable to get around including Metro Transit in the Halifax Regional Municipality, Kings Transit in the Annapolis Valley and Transit Cape Breton in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Metro Transit also operates ferries across Halifax Harbour. You can also check out Community Transit in your area ( www.communitytransitns.ca ). As for getting your driver's licence for the very first time, you can apply for your Beginner's Licence at age 16 to start learning how to drive. For more information, check out www.gov.ns.ca/snsmr/paal/RMV/ paal378.asp . 95 96 MONEY MA TTERS Did you have a piggy bank when you were younger? Do you get an allowance from your parents? Do you already have a bank account? What do you do when you receive money as a present for your birthday or for Christmas? Are you saving up to purchase something special, like your first phone or your first car? Or maybe you're planning ahead and want to start saving up for a trip after high school, or to help pay for your college education. Get informed and plan your goals. List how much money you make at your job, which is often called \"income,\" and list how much money you spend, called \"expenses.\" Create a budget that works for you. If you would like help, ask a safe and trusted adult. Try to stick to your budget! Don't be discouraged if you don't. Learn from your experiences and adjust your budget or your spending habits.Money is part of life, and here are some tips on how to handle it well: One day, you will need to learn about borrowing money, such as how to use credit cards, and how to manage loans, such as student loans. Consider picking up your piggy bank again - and save! Put some money away to help you on a rainy day, or help you buy those big purchases in the future. 96 97P a ying for College or University If you decide to attend university, college or a training program after high school, find out the cost of the program you are considering by looking at their website. Look for information on tuition fees, housing, books, and supplies and on financial assistance, such as scholarship, grants, and bursaries. Your school can help you locate this kind of information. Then, you can plan ahead with your budgeting plans. Know as well that you can consider applying for a student loan to help afford school after high school, so you can get the training and education you need to get your dream job. Don't let the need to get a student loan stop you from fulfilling your dreams. Many people have student loans! It's important to be aware that you are likely to pay back your student loan with interest. We encourage you to have a conversation with safe and trusted adults like your parents, guardians, teachers and guidance counselors.
