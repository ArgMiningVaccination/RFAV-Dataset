It's easy to forget things when you're dealing with a squirming child who isn't keen on being examined. It helps to list your questions in order of priority, says Carlos Lerner, MD, a UCLA pediatrician in Westwood. \"Bring up your most pressing concerns at the start of the appointment to ensure you get the answers you need,\" he says. This also is a good time to mention any changes in your family that may affect your child's well-being, such as a parental illness or separation. Document your child's symptoms. Pictures or videos of your child's rash, behavioral changes or other problems often can help your doctor make a diagnosis. Heide Woo, MD, a UCLA pediatrician in West Los Angeles, also recommends keeping a diary of your child's symptoms. \"Note things like changes in temperature, sleep, behavior and appetite,\" Dr. Woo says. Be smart about scheduling. You're more likely to get in and out on time when your appointment takes place at a relatively calm time, such as first thing in the morning or immediately after the lunch break. It's also a good idea to plan around your child's naptime and meals. \"I remind parents to budget enough time for the appointment, so they don't feel rushed or panicked about having to be somewhere else,\" says Dennis Woo, MD, a UCLA pediatrician in Santa Monica. Prep for the visit. If your child gets anxious at the doctor's office, try easing those worries by reading books at home about doctors and playing with toy medical kits. Be honest with your child about vaccinations. Don't tell your child he or she won't be getting a shot if you know that's not true. Some pediatricians like Dr. Heide Woo prefer to give shots to an anxious child at the start of the appointment. \"Kids tend to remember the last thing that happens during an exam,\" she explains. \"I want that memory to be a positive one.\" Talk to your doctor about the best timing for your child. Take advantage of technology. Depending on what's bothering your child, you might be able to avoid an office visit altogether. Most offices offer phone or e-mail consultations which may be covered by insurance. E-mail correspondence is available via my.UCLAhealth.org , UCLA Health's online medical-records tool.Whether you are taking your child to the pediatrician for a well-care visit or for other concerns, this advice from UCLA doctors will help the appointment go smoothly. LAWFive Tips for Getting the Most from Your Child's Visit to the Doctor Carlos Lerner, MD Heide Woo, MD Dennis Woo, MDPEDIATRICS To find a UCLA pediatrician or adolescent specialist visit: uclahealth.org/mattel/ outpatient-locationsUCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) Approach t o Men's Health When it comes to looking after their health, men can learn a few things from women, suggests UCLA urologist Jesse N. Mills, MD. \"Men have been taught to 'play through pain,' which often translates to not seeking the care they need,\" says Dr. Mills, director of The Men's Clinic at UCLA. \"And unlike women, who see an internist or gynecologist every year, many men between the ages of 18 and 50 don't go to see a doctor for routine checkups. That's a lot of years in a man's life in which he is missing out on an opportunity to be checked for potential risk factors and counseled in ways to optimize his health.\" The Men's Clinic at UCLA aims to change that narrative. The clinic is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary health-and-wellness center in Santa Monica; its physicians treat male sexual dysfunction and male infertility issues, as well as collaborating with physicians in other specialties to meet men's holistic health needs. \"While many men's health clinics emphasize testosterone therapy, we incorporate diet and lifestyle modification along with appropriate therapy to improve sexual health \u2014 potentially including testosterone replacement, medical and surgical therapies for erectile dysfunction and treatment for infertility,\" Dr. Mills explains. But more broadly, Dr. Mills hopes to reach men who are motivated to do everything they can to maintain or improve their health. \"We want to bring them into the healthcare system at an earlier age so that they can take the steps that will keep them active and help to prevent the illnesses that commonly afflict men as they age,\" he says. \"We want to help identify potential risks such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, erectile dysfunction, obesity and risky personal behaviors.\"Erectile dysfunction often can be a sign of other health concerns, such as significant cardiovascular problems, Dr. Mills notes, so simply giving a prescription for an oral medication without performing a full risk assessment is doing a disservice to the patient. When it comes to treating erectile dysfunction, patients shouldn't give up if the pills don't work; there are effective options offered by specialists in sexual medicine that can have a major impact on their quality of life. While sexual or urinary difficulties are what initially drive many men to the doctor's office, Dr. Mills sees these visits as opportunities to engage them in their overall health. \"If I'm seeing a man in his 20s or 30s for fertility issues, I'm also thinking down the road about his risk factors for other conditions and how we can intervene to reduce them,\" he says. \"If I'm seeing a 40-year-old man who is finished having kids and wants to schedule a vasectomy, and I see that he is overweight, I will discuss what he could do to improve his life over the next 10 years to make sure he doesn't develop heart disease, diabetes or other complications of obesity. \"In either case,\" Dr. Mills says, \"the man is now enfranchised into the medical system, and if he has issues or just needs a routine screening, he's more likely to return.\"Erectile dysfunction often can be a sign of other health concerns, such as significant cardiovascular problems, so simply giving a prescription for an oral medication without performing a full risk assessment is doing a disservice to the patient. MEN'S HEALTH Vital Signs Spring 2017 Vol. 74 5 Vital Signs Spring 2017 Vol. 74 5UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)A procedure called radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a reliable tool for the treatment of various pain conditions, as well as the destruction of some types of soft-tissue tumors when conventional surgery is not an option. RFA also has emerged as a successful approach to alleviating the intense pain experienced by cancer patients with bone metastases. Image-guided RFA is a minimally invasive treatment that uses radiofrequency energy to heat and kill cancer cells. UCLA is among a small number of major medical centers nationwide offering the procedure, which typically is performed in an outpatient setting with the patient under conscious sedation. The physician places a needle electrode through the skin to direct energy into the tumor to destroy it. \"Image-guided RFA offers significant advantages over persistent use of narcotics for patients receiving palliative care,\" says Pablo Villablanca, MD, director of the Interventional Spine Service and the Radiology Department Pain Service at UCLA. Opioid therapy often fails to fully alleviate metastasis-related spine pain and leaves patients heavily sedated, without the ability to engage with their families and friends or in activities they enjoy. \"Narcotics are not very effective for pain caused by metastatic spinal lesions,\" Dr. Villablanca says. \"Image-guided RFA provides an opportunity to make a difference.\" CANCER Using Heat to Kill Spinal Tumors Can Improve Quality of Life for Patients with Bone Metastasis Vital Signs Spring 2017 Vol. 74 7UCLA Recognized as Baby-Friendly Hospital Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center has been recognized as a Baby-Friendly Designated birth facility. The designation by Baby-Friendly USA is based on criteria that are aligned with the WHO/ UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. It recognizes hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care and support for breastfeeding mothers and their babies.Continued from cover Breastfeeding Success May Depend on Getting a Good StartOBSTETRICS \"It's extremely common to have some kind of problem or challenges during breastfeeding,\" she says. \"But women shouldn't feel they're alone or that they're doing something wrong. The struggle is normal, but there are a lot of resources available to help them.\" Some problems can be avoided by getting off to a good start in the hospital. Ideally, breastfeeding should be initiated promptly following childbirth. \"Women who begin breastfeeding in the hospital have a much higher likelihood of continuing nursing their children into the first year of life,\" says Leena Shankar Nathan, MD, a UCLA OB/GYN in Westlake Village. \"We recommend six months of exclusive breastfeeding.\" At UCLA, mothers who wish to breastfeed follow a protocol to increase the chances of success, says Georgann Abraham, RN, coordinator of the UCLA Health BirthPlace. That means letting nature take its course. Immediately following childbirth, the infant is placed on the mother's chest, skin-to-skin, to facilitate nursing. \"When you put the baby on the abdomen, within an hour the baby will go through several instinctual stages \u2014 they will crawl up, massage the breast, smell it and latch on,\" she explains. \"The babies drive milk production.\" In the hospital, new mothers are encouraged to breastfeed at least eight times in the first 24 hours, Abraham says. \"If you provide that good start, it will prevent many of the common problems.\" Women should take a breastfeeding class prior to giving birth, experts advise. And it's important for women who experience problems to seek help right away, Dr. Nathan says. \"Have a lactation consultant come out to your house.\" \"Simply persevering is the key,\" Dr. Valle adds. \"It can take several weeks to get an optimal latch from the baby and to get adequate milk supply from the mom. Utilize the resources available to you.\" Breastfeeding confers many benefits. For mothers, that includes a decrease in the risk of breast and ovarian cancers and a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, which is a precursor to diabetes. Nursing also facilitates weight loss. For babies, breast milk strengthens the immune system and boosts the health of the gastrointestinal tract. Babies who are breastfed have a reduced risk of childhood allergies, obesity and high cholesterol later in life and a lower risk of respiratory infection and childhood leukemia. \"Breastfeeding is a secret weapon,\" Dr. Nathan says. \"When a baby is sick or fussy, nothing will calm the baby as easily as nursing. Be persistent. The rewards will be great for mother and baby.\"RFA can provide significant, durable pain relief to patients after a single session, reducing or eliminating the need for narcotics and providing patients with dramatic improvements in quality of life, Dr. Villablanca says. Recent technological advances have boosted the precision, safety and efficacy of RFA to the spine, enabling heat delivery to a tightly defined target. Computed tomography-guided precision navigation is critical to protecting the spinal cord and surrounding healthy tissue. Spinal metastasis and removal of tumors may result in a weakened spine and potential fractures, Dr. Villablanca notes. During the RFA procedure, the system also can be used for kyphoplasty, a procedure to stabilize the spine. Kyphoplasty minimizes the risk of compression fracture in a weakened spine. If a fracture and metastasis are present, RFA will treat the tumor and kyphoplasty will stabilize the bone. Studies show RFA for spinal metastases results in clinically significant pain relief for 90 percent of patients. Pain relief often is immediate, or pain subsides within a few days. The procedure takes about one hour. Patients treated for metastases to the spine, like those treated for lesions in the iliac or sacrum bones, are typically released as early as a few hours after the procedure. Adverse events are rare but can include bleeding, infection and damage to arteries or nerves. Unlike many other cancer-pain-management treatments, image-guided RFA for bone metastasis can be repeated, if necessary, although most patients do not experience pain recurrence. While indicated for patients with bone metastasis who have failed conventional therapies, RFA also may be an option for patients who decline radiotherapy. However, RFA does not prevent patients from receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy at a later time. The procedure is contraindicated in patients with metastases that have extended into the spinal canal.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that on any given day, one in 25 hospital patients has at least one infection associated with their care or the hospital environment, and approximately 75,000 patients die each year as a result. At UCLA, continuously evaluated efforts to adopt and implement the best possible prevention practices are led by infectious disease experts Zachary Rubin, MD, and Daniel Uslan, MD. Infection-Free Hospital EnvironmentEfforts Aim to Create an Zachary Rubin, MD, and Daniel Uslan, MDWhat are the aspects unique to a hospital environment that put people at risk for infection? Dr. Rubin: Part of it is the medical technology. Infections can occur when patients are being supported by artificial equipment that bypasses the normal immune system. For instance, a patient may be placed on a ventilator that can bypass our ability to get rid of secretions, allowing some of the bacteria that are living in the mouth and the upper airway to get down to the lower lungs and cause pneumonias. Central venous catheters are large IVs that get placed through the skin into central veins, which opens up the possibility that bacteria from the skin or from the outside can get into the bloodstream. And the same is true with surgery; any time you open up a sterile site, there's the possibility that bacteria from the skin or from outside can get in. What has changed over the years to make infection prevention more challenging for hospitals? Dr. Rubin: Patients in hospitals have been getting sicker, partly because of healthcare's success in keeping people alive who would not have survived even 20 or 30 years ago. Many of these patients who are surviving longer have impaired immune systems and are thus more vulnerable to catching infections. We INTERVIEW Vital Signs Spring 2017 Vol. 74 9have seen a lot of care transitioned out of the hospital, so most patients are in the hospital only for the most aggressive, intensive care, and that means they are much more at risk for hospital-acquired infections than historically was the case. Dr. Uslan: The nation also is facing an increasing issue with what have been labeled \"superbugs,\" which are bacteria that are resistant to some or all of the antibiotics we would typically use to treat those infections. On the positive side, though, we now have a much better understanding of how infections are transmitted, and we use that understanding to guide our prevention strategies. What types of precautions are taken at UCLA? Dr. Uslan: It's multifaceted. There is a behavioral approach that focuses on such things as making sure healthcare workers wash their hands appropriately, as well as implementing isolation precautions for certain patients and requiring healthcare workers to wear special gowns and gloves when in those rooms. Admitted patients now get a daily bath with a special antiseptic soap based on research showing that it is more effective than regular soap and water in preventing infections. We also focus on the environment of care, which encompasses everything from keeping the hospital tidy and using the right cleaning products to ensuring that our food is prepared correctly and served at the right temperatures to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses. After discharge, we clean our patient rooms with a special robot that uses ultraviolet light to help disinfect surfaces in the room. We also take extra measures to routinely clean surfaces, such as bedrails, that are frequently touched and therefore at risk for harboring some of these infections. And the final piece is looking at medical procedures that carry a risk of infection and how we can reduce those risks. For example, central venous catheters carry a substantially increased risk of causing infection, so we devote a great deal of attention to making sure that when those lines are put in, everything we know from research is being followed to reduce that risk. What role do patients play in infection- prevention efforts? What can they do to reduce their risk? Dr. Uslan: Certainly patients should have the expectation that healthcare workers are going to clean their hands upon entering their room. If they have any sort of in-dwelling device, whether it's a catheter in their bladder or one of these central lines, they should know why it's there and ask whether or not it can be taken out, because the best way to prevent infections from those devices is to remove them. And, finally, a big driver of this problem of superbugs in both the hospital and the outpatient setting is overuse of antibiotics. Antibiotics don't do anything for viruses, yet they are too often prescribed for upper-respiratory infections. So patients getting antibiotics should ask whether they are appropriate and how long they are absolutely necessary to treat the infection they have. Even when all appropriate precautions are taken, will there still be some risk? Dr. Rubin: The reality is that some factors are beyond our control because patients in hospitals are sicker, we're doing things that suppress their immune systems, and we're performing more invasive procedures. Nonetheless, we as healthcare providers must set a very high bar for ourselves, which is to try to get to zero infections. We're not there yet, but we're working on it. UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)Like children and the elderly, adolescents and young adults often have unique healthcare needs and issues that are particular to their age. In addition to the usual teen-angst-producing issues of acne and ever-changing bodies, many face emerging questions about sexuality and sexual behavior. \"It is important that we address the special reproductive-health needs of adolescents and young adults and provide them with the full range of appropriate services,\" says Loris Hwang, MD, director of the recently established UCLA Adolescent and Young Adult Reproductive Health Clinic, which offers clinics twice weekly for young women and once a week for young men. Adolescent-health specialists are doctors who have received extra training to help them to understand and meet the unique needs of this age group. These doctors typically train in pediatrics, family medicine or internal medicine, and they complete an additional three-year fellowship in adolescent health. \"There is a clear need for reproductive- health services for the young women and young men in this population,\" says Anna- Barbara Moscicki, MD, chief of adolescent and young-adult medicine. \"Teens who are sexually active can find it challenging to choose a birth control method and then to stay on birth control. Many adolescents also have difficulty in discussing problems such as heavy or prolonged menses, amenorrhea or painful menses. Some of these abnormalities may be linked to eating disorders, which make them even more difficult to treat. Young men often find it equally difficult to discuss birth control and possible sexually transmitted disease.\" In addition to frank discussions about contraception and the availability of newer long-acting options, talking about and screening for sexually transmitted diseases also is essential, Dr. Moscicki says. Adolescent-health specialists also are trained to address the reproductive-health needs of teens or young adults who may have other medical conditions. \"At UCLA, we see some very medically complex kids,\" Dr. Moscicki says. \"It is important to understand such issues as contraception and potential side effects when you are working with adolescents who have a past history of blood clots, lupus or cardiac disease, for example.\" Dr. Hwang notes that adolescents and their parents might elect to come to such a specialized clinic because many adolescent patients are uncomfortable in a pediatric setting with young children and babies, or in a traditional OB/GYN office. \"We offer the full spectrum of contraceptive methods, which includes both placement and removal of intrauterine devices and the arm implant in our clinic,\" Dr. Hwang explains. While Dr. Moscicki encourages adolescents to bring a parent or support person to their visits, she notes that state laws permit confidential medical care of adolescents for sensitive topics. While insurance may cover many services provided to adolescents and young adults, she also points out that a state program, the Family PACT program (Family Planning, Access, Care and Treatment), provides for free and confidential family-planning services to eligible patients. In addition to reproductive health, adolescent-health specialists perform routine physical exams and can address growth and development issues, acute and chronic illnesses, acne, substance abuse and psychosocial issues. They also provide care related to nutrition, obesity and eating disorders, and they will identify appropriate additional specialists for their patients if necessary. Establishing a safe space where adolescents and young adults can freely talk about such issues of concern is essential to delivering the highest quality of care. \"The goal of good adolescent and young-adult care is to create an environment where these young patients feel comfortable,\" Dr. Hwang says.ADOLESCENT MEDICINE UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) Specialized Approach Addresses Reproductive -Health Needs of Adolescents and Young Adults In addition to reproductive health, adolescent-health specialists perform r outine physical exams and can address growth and development issues, acute and chronic illnesses, acne, substance abuse a nd psychosocial issues. Vital Signs Spring 2017 Vol. 74 11This issue is assuming greater significance as the graying of the U.S. population translates to more diagnosed cases of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. While the actual number of people with dementia who are still driving is unknown, studies show the rate of automobile crashes in this group is higher than among other drivers, says Zaldy Tan, MD, medical director of the UCLA Alzheimer's and Dementia Care Program. \"The risk of motor-vehicle crashes in people with dementia is up to eight times greater compared to people who don't have dementia,\" Dr. Tan says. California is among the few states in the nation with a mandatory reporting law aimed at keeping unsafe drivers off the road. The law requires health professionals who make a diagnosis of dementia to report the diagnosis to the Department of Public Health. That agency reports the case to the Department of Motor Vehicles. DMV officials will review the case and may request that the individual come in for a driving test. Family members, neighbors or others also can anonymously report someone who is suspected of being an unsafe driver due to dementia. The law protects public safety by removing drivers with dementia from the roads. But it can also put health professionals in a tough spot, Dr. Tan says. \"The law is helpful if the health professional does the right thing and loved ones do the right thing,\" he says. \"But, because of this law, it may discourage loved ones and patients themselves from letting health professionals know there might be dementia. Health professionals might be hesitant to diagnose dementia because they would have to confront this person about driving.\" Not everyone with dementia needs to stop driving. However, dementia is linked to an erosion of several skills that often impact the ability to drive safely, Dr. Tan says, including short-term memory and decision-making skills. Drivers with dementia may also have a decline in visual-spatial skills. That may mean difficulties judging the distance to the car ahead or centering one's own car in a lane. \"Dementia is a neuro-degenerative disease, so it affects several abilities,\" Dr. Tan says. \"These patients also may have reduced awareness of their own driving safety.\" Dr. Tan recommends that a family go on a ride-along with the person with dementia to assess his or her driving ability. Some organizations will offer driving assessments for people with dementia, and there are other resources to help older people make adjustments to their vehicles to enhance safety. GERIATRICS For Patients with Dementia, It May Be Time to Give Up the Car Keys A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or some other form of dementia typically signals a turning point in an individual's life and t he lives of his or her loved ones. One of t he most significant impacts may be the decision to stop driving. The patient, family m embers and health professionals can all be i nvolved in determining if it's no longer safe for a person with dementia to get b ehind the wheel.UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) Community Health Programs UCLA Health offers community programs and events to help our neighbors lead healthier lives through wellness education.
