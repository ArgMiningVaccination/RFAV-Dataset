I don't know about you but lately it's really hit me. A feeling of being un-grounded and not quite in my body. Maybe you have very real reasons for feeling anxious or maybe your personal life is fine but you feel yourself affected by external events like the fires, the Borderline shooting, or the general political instability surrounding us. One thing that makes anxiety so difficult to control is that it creates a negative feedback loop in your mind/body/consciousness. Anxiety makes you breathe into your chest instead of your belly (fight or flight response) and over time this can actually displace your solar plexus chakra (Manipura). All that chest breathing can cause Manipura to lose its anchor at the belly and migrate upward toward your chest. If you feel un-grounded or not completely in your body this is one possible reason. So, how do you get Manipura back where it belongs anchored to your belly? Glad you asked! Here's a simple crystal self-healing ritual I've been doing for the past couple of weeks and it's really helped. I'd be honored to share it with you. It's based on traditional Ayurvedic principles fused with crystal energy healing. (*See the why it works section below the ritual). What you'll need: 15 - 30 minutes of quiet time Your own intuition and awareness A garnet power bracelet or several garnet tumbles (preferably deep red), a clear crystal point, a grounding stone such as black onyx, smoky quartz or black tourmaline. Optional Tiger's Eye if you're feeling scattered and need focus. Crystal Self-healing Ritual with Garnet Lie down in a comfortable position on your bed or yoga mat. Lie flat with no pillows if you can. Place one had on your belly button and feel your belly (not your chest!) rise with each inhale and lower with each exhale. Place the garnets or garnet bracelet in a circle around your belly button. Optional, place the tiger's eye directly on your belly button (see photos below). Place the crystal point on your abdomen below your belly button with the point toward your feet. Place the grounding stone at your base chakra (Muladhara) or between your legs. Optional: place the tiger's eye on your belly button. Continue breathing into your belly and consciously direct your attention to re-anchor Manipura chakra at your belly. Optional: silence is golden but I also like listening to this mantra [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ANWxfIURZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ANWxfIURZE) Why it Works: If you're familiar with crystals you've probably heard that garnet has revitalizing and protective qualities. It's specific use for anxiety is based on [Vedic Astrology](https://www.anastasia-tarot-vedic-astrology.com/vedic-astrology-about/) and Ayurveda. Feelings of powerlessness or feeling like things are spinning out of control often accompany anxiety. This self-healing ritual is energetically designed to re-balance your sense of power and re-align your Manipura chakra. Deep red garnets associate with the Sun. In the human body, Sun's energy is most anchored at Manipura chakra. Sun relates to Atman, the in-dwelling spark of divine consciousness in your soul. Tiger's eye also channels solar power. It increases focus and helps alleviate the \"scattered\" feeling that can accompany anxiety. Strengthening and balancing Manipura chakra will help you re-connect with your Atman - your inner Sun. Energetically, making sure your Manipura chakra is anchored at your belly - your center - will help you feel more grounded and present in your body. Garnet's (and Sun's) strengthening qualities will help alleviate feelings of powerlessness and replace them with calm acceptance of both your own power and the limits of your power. Namaste!
