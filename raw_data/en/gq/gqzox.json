You may then be sued for malpractice, which could mean disaster for your practice. Fortunately, with our Homeopathy insurance policy, incidents like this don't have to mean the end of your dreams. We've included malpractice cover in our policy as standard, so you can focus your time and energy on helping those in need, while we ensure you and your business are protected.
