The patient and representative (if any), have the right to be informed of the patient's rights in a language and manner the individual understands. The HHA must protect and promote the exercise of these rights. This CONDITION is NOT MET as evidenced by: Based on observation, record review and interview, the agency failed to ensure all patients received the administrator's name in order to receive complaints (G414); failed to ensure all patients received an OASIS [Outcome and Assessment Information Set] privacy notice found on the CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) website to all patients for whom the OASIS data was collected (G416); failed to ensure all patients received the agency's policies for transfer and discharge (G422); failed to ensure it accommodated and respected the patient's (and/or family's) preferences in his or her own home while agency staff was present (G428); failed to ensure all patients participated in, were informed about, and/or consented to any changes in the home care services/treatment provided (G434); the agency failed to ensure all patients received all services as ordered on the plan of care (G436); failed to provide all patients information on their right to be notified prior to the next home health visit, of any changes in the charges for services they received (G440); and failed to ensure it provided all patients with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the Agency on Aging/Aging and Disability Resource Center, Center for Independent Living, and Quality Improvement Organization (G446). This practice had the potential to affect all agency patients.

During an interview on 8/4/2021 at 4:24 PM, the administrator indicated she didn't think the HHA training program had to be 75 hours, new hires enrolled in the HHA training program were in the building for about 3 days, then a nurse took them out to observe care on the first patient contact, and indicated it was hard enough to get them (new hires) to come in for 3 days to train, let alone 75 hours. Also, she indicated the home health aides didn't have to be on the IDOH registry, they just had to be competency tested by a nurse, and indicated again the agency training program didn't have to meet the 75-hour requirement. During this time, the alternate administrator indicated they (agency) spent a lot of time developing their aide training program.
