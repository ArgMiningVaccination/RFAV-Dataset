Allergic patients' quality of life can be primarily improved by injecting increased venom doses to alter their immune response to tolerate venom. This venom-specific immunotherapy is very effective and well tolerated, especially in the administration of vaccines. Creative Biolabs is a world leader in the field of vaccine development. With our extensive experience and advanced platform, we are therefore confident in offering the best vaccine development services for allergic disease. Introduction of Bee Venom Allergy Bee venom is a complex mixture of biochemicals ranging from small peptides and enzymes to biogenic amines, lipids, and amino acids. Some of them have anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects or toxic and detrimental effects, while some of which have both beneficial and unfavorable effects under different conditions. However, the function of each component is still unclear. The group III secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from bee venom constitutes 10%-12% of dry bee venom and is the major allergen in bee venom. Venom components are presented to the T cells by antigen-presenting cells within the skin. These Th2 type T cells then release IL-4 and IL-13 which subsequently direct B cells to class switch to production of IgE. The production of venom-specific IgE and cross-linking FcR1 on the surface of mast cells complete the sensitizing stage in allergic individuals who are most likely to experience severe or even fatal allergic reactions after being stung. Peptide-Based Vaccines Peptide immunotherapy (vaccine) in bee venom allergy is a particularly attractive approach, as up to 40% of patients experience allergic side effects in traditional methods of prevention and treatment. The target allergen is bee venom phospholipase A2 of PLA. Phospholipase A contains three peptides and a glycoprotein T cell epitope (14 to 16 kD in size), containing 134 amino acids. Short synthetic peptide vaccines representing T cell epitopes of PLA for bee venom are capable of modulating immune responses to allergens without the risk of frequent adverse events. Peptides of the appropriate size and solubility, administered at the appropriate doses, have shown encouraging efficacy in most clinical studies. Thus, targeted peptide immunotherapy can improve the safety and likelihood of antigen-specific therapies in allergic diseases. DNA Vaccines Allergens-immunostimulatory DNA vaccines are well tolerated, induce IgG rather than IgE antibodies, and therefore have great potential as a novel, safe, and efficacious type of allergen-specific immunotherapy. The plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the major allergen (PLA2) from honeybee venom could result in a high percentage (65%) of recovery from subsequent anaphylactic shock induced by allergen challenge. They exhibit long-lasting beneficial effects both in prophylaxis and treatment models of honeybee venom allergy.
