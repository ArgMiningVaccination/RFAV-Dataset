I bought six jars for $56 dollars at an art fair. At the time I thought it was not a bad deal as I normally pay $3 for a packet of grocery store spice mix and I was getting a whole jar for less than $10. After trying these spices, I think it's a GREAT deal. They are truly amazing blends. I am a big fan of simple recipes, such as five ingredients or less. These spices have made coming up with my own recipes really fun! Adam Handler Been buying their stuff for decades! For the seasoned chef, they've got unique specialties that make great gifts. For the culinarily-challenged, the right spice, oil, or finishing sauce turns the prosaic into something extraordinary. Ian Furlong Hands down some of the BEST products on the market! My favorite is the Taste of India seasoning! Markus My favorite BHF product is the [Lemon Garlic Finishing Sauce]. I just drizzle a little over a fresh fish fillet before grilling and it tastes like I slaved in the kitchen all day mincing garlic and zesting lemon, but this healthy dinner only takes 10 minutes. Jo-Ann I purchased 3 bottles of sauce and tested one on vegetables for Christmas dinner. I was so happy with the quality, I decided to add one of the bottles to my mother's Christmas present. We all enjoyed the holiday feast! Regina Thank you for awesome customer service! I purchased products for gift baskets and the recipients were so pleased, they asked where they can purchase more. I can assure you I will be a repeat customer! Shawn I can't get enough of the [Zesty Garlic Seasoning]. Its so versatile that I can use it with any protein, vegetable or in any dip, dressing, spread or marinade. It's my new pantry staple! Jason Kroup Selling in my store. People love the products.
