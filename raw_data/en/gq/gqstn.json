Introduction In 1989 the Minnesota Groundwater Protection Act proclaimed its goal to maintain groundwater \"in its natural condition, free from degradation caused by human activities .\" (Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.001). However, w hen groundwater quality monitoring shows that water quality has degraded , the Groundwater Protection Act authorizes the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to adopt rules that set health -protective limits , known as Health Risk Limits (HRLs) , for contaminants found in groundwater that might be used for drinking (Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201). An HRL value is a concentration of a groundwater contaminant, or a mixture of contaminants, that people can consume with little or no risk to health, and which has been adopted under rule. The value is expressed as micrograms of a chemical per liter of water (\u00b5g/L). MDH calculates HRL values for specific durations of exposure. This project proposes to amend Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4717, by revising or adding HRLs for 14 groundwater contaminants. In addition, MDH proposes an HRL for the surface water contaminant triclosan. Historically, MDH has adopted HRLs into rule only for groundwater contaminants. In 2013, the Minnesota Legislature directed MDH to accelerate its HRLs development for water contaminants, including triclosan (Laws 2013, chapter 137, article 2, section 8, subpart a). While Minnesota derives about 75 percent of the drinking water from groundwater, the other 25 percent of the population's drinking water comes from surface water, such as the Mississippi River or lakes. MDH therefore also has an important role in protecting the state's surface waters. Triclosan has been found in sur face water in Minnesota, but it has not yet been detected in groundwater. Specifically, the proposed amendments add new or updated HRL values for 14 contaminants to part 4717.7860 (see Section IV .B.). The proposal will repeal the outdated HRL values in parts 4717.7500, and 4717.7860 (see Section IV .C.) for six of these 14 contaminants. In addition, MDH proposes new values for di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, pentachlorophenol, Contaminant Limits (MCLs) in Minnesota Rules part 4717.7850, subpart (2), items C., E., and H., obsolete (required by Laws 2007, chapter 147, article 17, section 2). The amendments will therefore remove these chemical s from the list when the new values are added to part 4717.7860. These proposed amendments build on MDH's 2009 rule revision and subsequent rulemaking. 2 Details on the 2009 HRL rule revision and subsequent rule adoption are 2 The current rules on the Health Risk Limits ( Minnesota Rules , Chapter 4717, various parts) are available on the Minnesota Department of Health's website at http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/risk/rules/water/hrlrule.html . The rules on Health Risk Limits ( Minnesota Rules , Chapter 4717, various parts) are also available on the Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes' website at: https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/?id=4717 Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 8 presented in Section II. MDH will not be amending any other parts of the HRLs rules in 2014/2015. The Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (Minnesota Statutes, section 14.131) requires MDH to justify the need to amend the existing HRL rules and t he reasonableness of the amendments in a Statement of Need and Reasonableness (SONAR). This document fulfills that requirement. This SONAR is divided into five sections. Section I is this introduction. Section I I identifies MDH's statutory authority to adopt HRL rules and describes past HRL rule revisions. It explains the concept of HRL values and summarizes the methods MDH used to derive the HRL values. Section I II includes the scope of the amendments MDH proposes in 2014/2015. Sect ion IV analyzes each provision in the proposed rules. Section V discusses statutory requirements: the regulatory factors , the performance -based nature of the rules, the additional notice plan, and the impact of the proposed rules , all as required per Minnesota Statutes , section 14.131. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 9 II. Background This background information for MDH's gui dance on groundwater contaminants : describes the statutory authority to review, derive, adopt, and revise HRL values; provides historical information about MDH's past rule revisions ; defines HRL values; and discusses the methods MDH used to derive HRL values. Note: A d etailed description of the methods and the underlying principles is available in MDH's 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2008. See Part IV, page 21 ).3 A. Statutory Authority MDH derives its authority to propose and adopt HRLs for water contaminants from the following statutes: 1. THE GROUNDWATER PROTECTION ACT, 1989 The Groundwater Protection Act of 1989 (the 1989 Act) (Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision (1)(a)) provi des MDH with its statutory authority to adopt HRL values for groundwater contaminants. The 1989 Act states: \"If groundwater quality monitoring results show that there is a degradation of groundwater, the commissioner of health may promulgate health risk limits under subdivision 2 for substances degrading the groundwater.\" The 1989 Act defines an HRL as (Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.005, subdivision (3)): \"a concentration of a substance or chemical adopted by rule of the commissioner of health that is a potential drinking water contaminant because of a systemic or carcinogenic toxicological result from consumption.\" Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision (2)(a) states the authority to adopt HRL values : \"(a) Health risk l imits shall be adopted by rule.\" The methods to derive HRL values are specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision (1)(c) and (d): \"(c) For systemic toxicants that are not carcinogens, the adopted health risk limits shall be derived using United States Environmental Protection 3 MDH's 2008/2009 SONAR is available at: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/risk/rules/water/hrlsonar08.pdf Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 10 Agency risk assessment methods using a reference dose, a drinking water equivalent, and a relative source contribution factor. \"(d) For toxicants that are known or probable carcinogens, the adopted health risk limits shall be derived from a quantitative estimate of the chemical's carcinogenic potency published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and determined by the commissioner to have undergone thorough scientific review.\" MDH has specific authority to review and revise HRL values under Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision (3)(a) and (b): \"(a) The commissioner shall review each adopted health risk limit at least every four years. \"(b) The commissioner may revise health risk limits under subdivision 2.\" 2. C OMMISSIONER OF HEALTH 'S AUTHORITIES , MINNESOTA STATUTES , SECTION 144.12 Historically, MDH has focused on groundwater contaminants when adopting water guidance rules . Under statute, however, MDH has oversight over surface water , too. MDH has specific authority to control, by rule, pollution of streams and other waters and the distribution of water by persons for drinking or domestic use (Minnesota Statutes, section 144.12 subdivision 1(5)). This authority, along with the Laws 2013 described below, provides MDH with the ability to propose HRL rules for triclosan, a contaminant that has been detected in the state's surface waters, but not yet in groundwater. 3. L AWS OF MINNESOTA , 2013 The Legislature granted MDH specific rule making authority for a particular chemical, triclosan, during the 2013 Legislative Session. In Laws 2013, chapter 137, article 2 (Clean Water Fund), section 8, MDH is directed, among other tasks, to accelerate development of health risk limits, including triclosan. MDH developed health -based water guidance for triclosan in 2010, but has not proposed adopting this guidance into rule. For this HRL MDH re -evaluated triclosan to determine if updates were needed. MDH announced the results of the re -evaluation via MDH's subscription email service and on its website in August 2014. To meet the requirements of Laws 2013, MDH will include these updated health -based guidance values for triclosan in the rules proposed for adoption as HRLs. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 11 4. HEALTH STANDARDS STATUTE , 2001 Additional authority is implicit under the 2001 Health Standards Statute (Minnesota Statute s, section 144.0751), which applies to safe drinking water and air quality standards. Per this provision, safe drinking water standards must: \"(1) be based on scientifically acceptable, peer -reviewed information; and (2) include a reasonable margin of safety to adequately protect the health of infants, children, and adults by taking into consideration risks to each of the following health outcomes: reproductive development and function, respiratory function, immunologic suppression or hyper- sensitization, development of the brain and nervous system, endocrine (hormonal) function, cancer, general infant and child development, and any other important health outcomes identified by the commissioner. \" Under the provisions cited above, in cases of water degradation, MDH has the necessary statutory authority to review, develop, and adopt HRL value s for water contaminants based on scientific methods to protect sensitive populations. Thus, MDH has the necessary authority to adopt the proposed rules. B. Past MDH Rule Revision s MDH's Division of Environmental Health has been providing health- based guidance on drinking water contaminants for several decades . The earliest guidance that MDH developed was the Drinking Water Recommended Allowable Limits (RALs). A RAL was defined as a concen tration of a contaminant in water that is protective of human health. RALs were primarily developed for private water supplies, but were also used for public water supplies in the absence of applicable federal standards. The MDH Health Risk Assessment (H RA) Unit derives the water guidance values. MDH HRA does not enforce or regulate the use of health- based guidance, but provides recommended values for risk assessors and risk managers to use in making decisions and evaluating health risks. MDH health -based guidance is only one set of criteria that state groundwater and environmental protection programs use to evaluate contamination. In addition, there are federal requirements for permissible levels of some drinking- water contaminants called t he Maximum Cont aminant Levels (MCLs) . Legally enforceable under the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, they apply only to public water systems . More information about MCLs is available in Section V .A.7, below. The 1989 Act authorized MDH to adopt HRL values for contaminants found in Minnesota groundwater. In 1993, MDH adopt ed methods to calculate HRL values and adopted HRL values for chemicals based on th ose methods. In 1994, MDH adopted additional HRL values based on 1993 methods (henceforth, referred to as 1993-1994 HRL values). The 1993-1994 HRL values were published in Minnesota Rules 4717.7500. Over time, MDH has been calculating updated guidance values for the chemicals in this list using the guidance calculation methods adopted into rule in 2009. When the updated Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 12 values are adopted into rule, the outdated 1993-1994 values in 4717.7500 are deleted and the updated values are added to Minnesota Rule 4717.7860. In 2001, MDH toxicologists and risk assessors evaluated the adequacy of the 1993 methods to c alculate the HRL values. MDH designed the method review to: Provide guidance on new contaminants found in Minnesota groundwater; Update existing HRL values with new toxicological research and exposure data; Incorporate advances in risk -assessment methods; Reflect changes in values and policies regarding children's environmental health; and Respond to the directive in the 2001 Health Standards Statute (Minnesota Statutes, section 144.0751) to protect sensitive subpopulations such as pregnant women and infants. The review spanned seven years during which MDH hosted public meetings and invited stakeholder participation. MDH also convened subject -matter expert reviews of the methods to establish a scientifically accepted calculation for determining these values for risk. This evaluation yielded an updated risk equation, or algorithm, to derive HRL values and corresponding policies . MDH began formal rulemaking in 2008 by proposing an updated methodology to derive HRL values based on the United State s Environmental Protection Agency's ( U.S. EPA) risk -assessment guidelines (see Section I I.D.). In 2009, MDH adopted the new methods and the HRL values for 21 groundwater contaminants that it had derived using the updated methodology. Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4717, parts 4717.7100 through 4717.7800 were repealed (except part 4717.7500) and revised rules as parts 4717.7810 through 4717.7900 were adopted . Additional details on the nature and scope of MDH's 2009 HRL rule revision are documented in the 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2 008). In 2007, the Minnesota Legislature enacted two laws which place HRL values into rule. One law, Minnesota Session Laws 2007, chapter 37, section 1, directed MDH to adopt HRLs for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). MDH did this in August 2007 using the legislation's good cause exemption authority for rulemaking. The second law concerned the Water Levels Standards: Minnesota Laws, chapter 147, article 17, section 2. This law required MDH to set an HRL equal to the U.S. EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) value when the MCL value was more stringent (i.e., lower) than a Minnesota-derived HRL value. In response in 2007, MDH established 11 MCL values as HRLs, and adopted these HRLs into rule in 2009 along with the MCL for nitrate. MDH is now bringing these values up to date and replacing them as MDH derives new HRL values. To date, nine of the MCL values remain in rule. MDH has recently derived updated guidance values for four of them. Three of these, to be included in the 2014/2015 proposed rules amendments. In 2011, MDH added HRL values for 22 contaminants to Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4717, part 7860, and updated part 7500 to reflect all changes . Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 13 In 2013, MDH added HRL values to Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7860 for six chemicals not previously in the HRL rules . In addition, MDH repealed outdated HRL values (adopted in 1993 and 1994) for six chemicals ( from Minnesota Rules part 4717.7500) and replaced them (in part 4717.7860) with new HRL values. In total, MDH adopted new or updated HRL values for 12 chemicals in 2013. In 2015, MDH proposes new HRL values for eight chemicals that have not previously appeared in the H RL Rules. MDH also proposes to repeal outdated HRL values for three more chemicals in Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7500 and replace the repealed values with updated guidance in part 4717.7860. Further, outdated HRL values for three chemicals already in Minnesota Rules part 4717.7860 will be repealed and replaced with new values. In total, MDH proposes new or updated HRL values for 14 chemicals.

Defining Health Risk Limits (HRLs) HRL values are a type of health -protective guidance developed by MDH for water contaminants that pose a potential threat to human health if consumed in drinking water . The 1989 Act (Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.005, subdivision (3)) defines an HRL as: \"...a concentration of a substance or chemical adopted by rule of the commissioner of health that is a potential drinking water contaminant because of a systemic or carcinogenic toxicological result from consumption.\" MDH has defined an HRL more precisely as a concentration of a drinking water contaminant, or a mixture of conta minants , that is likely to pose little or no health risk to humans, including vulnerable subpopulations, and has been adopted into rule . MDH calculates health -based water guidance values , a precursor to HRLs, for specific durations of exposure. An HRL is expressed as micrograms of a chemical per liter of water (\u00b5g/L). Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 14 In 2013, the Minnesota Legislature directed MDH to create an HRL for triclosan, a contaminant that has been detected in Minnesota surface waters. MDH has been calculating health -based water guidance for surface water contaminants for several years under the Drinking Water Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC) program, though MDH has not yet proposed adding them as rules . MDH is now proposing to adopt a triclosan HRL under its authority for protecting surface waters , as described in Section I I A (above). MDH develops health -based water guidance values for substances or chemicals that contaminate surface water or groundw ater, or both, as a result of h uman activities (Minnesota Statutes, sections 103H.201 and 103H.005, subdivision (6)). MDH derives both s urface water and groundwater guidance values using identical methodology. In calculating water guidance values, MDH evaluates contaminant levels as though the water were used for drinking water . This is consistent with the declaration in Minnesota Statutes, section 115.063, subdivision 2, that \" the actual or potential use of the waters of the state for potable wat er supply is the highest priority use of that water and deserves maximum protection by the state... \" Further, t he stated statutory intent is to prevent degradation (Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.001) and to protect the waters of the state (Minnesota Statu tes, section 115.063, subdivision (1)). Risk man agers in partner state agencies, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), request and apply HRL values in risk -abatement and contamination -response programs. In addition, MDH's Site Assessment and Consultation Unit (SAC), Drinking Water Protection, and Well Management programs use HRL values . Except for the requirements for water resources protection (specified in Minnesota Statutes, sectio n 103H.275, subdivision 1(c)(2)), neither Minnesota statute nor current HRL rule (Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4717) specifies how HRL values should be used. In issuing guidance, MDH assumes risk managers consider several principles w hen applying HRL values . MDH-derived HRL values : specify a w ater quality level acceptable for human consumption; should not be interpreted a s acceptable degradation levels; do not address non-ingestion pathways of exposure to contaminants in water (e.g., dermal or inhalation), except in apportioning exposure through the use of a Relative Source Contribution (RSC) factor (for more information on RSC, see MDH, 2008 [Part IV.E.1, page 51 ] and Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820 , subpart 22); do not account for economic or technological factors such as the cost or feasibility of treatment; and do not account for the potential impact on the environment outside the realm of drinking water, or the health of non-human species. MDH cannot anticipate all the situations for which HRL values might provide meaningful guidance. Nor can MDH anticipate all the factors that might determine whether applying an HRL value is appropriate. As mentioned before, HRL values are but Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 15 one of several sets of criteria that state groundwater, drinking water, and environmental protection programs may use to evaluate water contamination. Each program mus t determine whether to apply an HRL or whether site -specific characteristics justify deviation from HRL values . D. MDH -derived Health Risk Limit (HRL) Algorithm As stated previously, MDH derives HRL values using the methods MDH adopted in 2009 (Minnesota Rules , parts 4717.7810 through 4717.7900). Th e calculation used to develop an HRL value is a function of how toxic a chemical is (that is, the minimum quantity that will cause health effects), the duration of exposure, and the amount of water individuals drink (intake rates) during the exposure period. MDH's approach for developing non- cancer HRL values (nHRL) for effects other than cancer is specified in rule ( Minnesota Rules , part 4717.7830, subpart 2). MDH also uses this approach for chemicals that cause cancer only after a known dose level is exceeded (e.g., threshold carcinogens). The algorithms an d explanation of concepts used to derive HRL values are presented in Appendix C of this SONAR . Additional information is available in MDH's 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2008. See Part IV). Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 16 This page is intentionally blank. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 17 III. 2014 /2015 Proposed Rules This section describes the scope of the proposed rules and the basis for contaminants considered in the amendments. A. Scope The 2014/2015 proposed rules build on the 2009 HRL rule revision. The proposed revisions are limited to Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7500, 4717.7850, and 4717.7860 as noted below. MDH is not amending other parts of the HRL rules. Through the proposed rules, MDH intends to: adopt into rule H RL values for 14 groundwater contaminants with guidance developed using the 2009 methodology. The proposed HRL values will be appended to Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7860 (see Section IV.B. for details); and repeal outdated guidance in Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7500 and 4717.7850 for six contaminants adopted in 1993 or 2007 for which a new updated HRL value has been derived (see Section IV.C. for details) . (Note: the repealed values will be replaced with values added in Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7860, as noted above.) B. Selection of Contaminants for Review MDH selected the contaminants for the 2014/2015 amendments based on recommendations from partner agencies such as the M PCA and the MDA , as well as nominations from other stakeholders and the general public. The agencies and nominators expressed a need for guidance on contaminants that might be of emerging concern and those that are commonly detected by the agencies in their monitoring and remediation efforts. At interagency meetings between 2007 and 2014, representatives from MDA, MPCA, and MDH nominated chemicals for review , discussed the ir concerns about specific contaminants, and ranked a list of chemicals according to each agency's need for guidance. A fina l list of priority chemicals was generated from this process. In addition, chemicals nominated through the MDH CEC program (created in 2010) were ranked for priority in guidance development. MDH drew from these two processes to create work plans to assess chemicals for health risk s and issue guidance (see Appendix D) . As MDH reviewed each chemical, it posted the following information on MDH's Chemicals Under Review 4 webpage : the chemical 's name, its Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number, and the date it was posted. Upon completion of each review, MDH posted the guidance values and the chemical -specific summary sheets on the 4 The Chemicals Under Review webpage is available at: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/risk/review/index.html Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 18 Human Health Based Water Guidance5 webpage. MDH also notified subscribe rs to MDH HRL Rules, Guidance and Chemical Review email notification account6 about the updated guidance 's availability . C. Applying MDH -derived Methods MDH derived the proposed HRL values using the methods it adopted in 2009. The 2009 methods reflect current scientific risk -assessment principles; therefore, MDH is not proposing any changes to these methods in the 2014/2015 proposed amendments. Applying the 2009 methods to HRL values from 1993 and 1994 or the 2007 MCL- based HRLs yields new HRL values that might increase or decrease the previous values, based on cancer or chronic exposure endpoints. The se fluctuations are related to several factors, such as : extent and quality of toxicity data for a chemical ; changes in intake rates within the guidance algorithms to account for sensitive subpopulations (e.g., infants and children) ; and age-dependent adjustment factors used within the algorithms. Among the 14 chemicals included in this 2014/2015 proposed rule, six currently have HRL values for cancer or chronic exposure. Of these, three are based on 1993 HRLs and three are 2009 MCL -based HRL s. Some of the new, proposed values will increase, some will decrease and one will stay the same, as shown below: Chemical Abstract Service number Chemical Name Current HRL (\u00b5g/L) Proposed HRL phthalate 100 (1993 HRL) 100 (1993 HRL) 0.5 Lower 84-72-2 Dibutyl phthalate (PCP) 1 (2009 MCL -based HRL) 0.3 Lower 5 The Groundwater Values Table is available at: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/risk/guidance/gw/table.html All health -based guidance values for water are summarized in this table, including those that have not been adop ted into rule. 6 Electronic subscriptions to this account may be requested at https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/MNMDH/subscriber/new?topic_id=MNMDH_39 Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 19 Chemical Abstract Service number Chemical Name Current HRL (\u00b5g/L) Proposed HRL (TCE) 5 (2009 MDL -based HRL) 0.4 Lower For more information about the algorithms used in calculating guidance, please see Appendix C. MDH has two methods to derive HRL values depending on whether or not a dose or exposure can be found that causes no harm in studies of animals or people. Historically, these methods were applied according to the type of health effect that the chemical exposure caused and were termed 'non- cancer' and 'cancer' methods. However, the scientific community now recognizes that chemicals are better assessed according to what is known about finding a dose that causes no harm, regardless of the health effect. Most toxicity studies find that at some low dose or exposure the chemical does no harm or has no effect on the animal tested. The concept of a dose considered to be without harm (with all higher doses causing harm) is called the threshold. Many carcinogens cause cancer only after exposure to high doses but also exhibit a threshold dose for effects other than cancer. That is, this lower threshold dose will not cause c ancer or other health effects. MDH's threshold method, historically called a non-cancer method, has been used by MDH for any chemical that exhibits a threshold, including many carcinogens. Some carcinogens (and some neurotoxicants such as lead) have no ap parent threshold because every dose that has been tested appears to cause some potentially harmful effect. MDH uses a method that presumes even the lowest potential exposure has some small risk of harm. This method is based on carcinogenic potency and is described in the 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2008). MDH's non-threshold method, historically called a cancer method, has only been used by MDH for carcinogens that do not show a threshold. Among the 14 contaminants for which HRL values are proposed during this 2014/2015 rulemaking, there threshold carcinogens carcinogens, the non- cancer HBV values are protective. For the four non-threshold carcinogens, cancer HBVs were calculated based on a 1/100,000 additional lifetime cancer risk. See also Appendix C for more information.

Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 21 IV. Rule-by- Rule Analysis This section explains the Health Risk Limits Table (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7860) and discusses each provision of the rules proposed by MDH. It also lists the chemicals MDH proposes to repeal fro m part 4717.7500. A. EXPLAINING THE HEALTH RISK LIMITS TABLE (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7860) The Health Risk Limits table in Minnesota Rules, part 4717 7860 lists the HRL values derived for chemicals found in Minnesota's groundwater. As noted before, an HRL value represents the health -protective limit of the concentration of a contaminant in groundwater that poses little or no risk to human health, including vulnerable subpopulations, based on current scientific knowledge. HRL values are derived using the methodology specified in Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7830 and 4717.7840 of existing HRL rule s (see Appendix C for detailed explanations and definitions of the technical terms that follow ). For each chemical and its proposed HRL value (s), MDH provides the following information in a table, as shown in Figure 1 below : Figure 1. Example of table showing proposed rule Subp.

Row h eadings: HRL (\u00b5 g/L): The Health Risk Limit value shown in micrograms per liter ; RfD (mg/kg -day) : The duration- specific reference dose ( RfD) is an estimate of a dose level that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse effects and includes uncertainty factors (see glossary under \" uncertainty factor \" for more information); RSC: Re lative source contribution (RSC) is a portion of the reference dose that is allocated to drinking water ; SF (per mg/kg -day): Slope f actor (SF) is a n upper- bound estimate of cancer risk per increment of dose, usually expressed in units of cancer incidence per milligram of chemical per kilogram of body weight per day (per [mg/kg -day] or [mg/kg -day] -1). It reflects increased risks as the dose increases. The steeper the slope, the more potent th e carcinogen . Age-Dependent Adjustment Factors (ADAF) or Lifetime Adjustment Factor (AF lifetime ): A multiplier of the cancer slope factor that adjusts for the increased susceptibility to cancer from early -life exposures to linear carcinogens. Intake Rate (IR) (L/kg -day): The amount of water, on a per body weight basis, ingested on a daily basis (liters per kg body weight per day or L/kg- day) for a given duration. MDH use s a time -weighted average of the 95th percentile intake rate for the relevant duration. Endpoint: Endpoint refers to the organ system s that are most susceptible to harm (or in the case of the endocrine system otherwise involved [see Endocrine (E) in the glossary for more information]) and that should be grouped together for evaluation when m ore than one chemical is present (additivity endpoint) . Column headings : Guidance values are developed for specific time durations or cancer endpoints , as follows: Acute: A period of 24 hours or less. Short -Term: A period of more than 24 hours, up to 30 days. Subchronic: A period of more than 30 days, up to approximately 10 percent of the life span in humans (more than 30 days up to approximately 90 days is typically used mammalian laboratory animal species). Chronic: A period of more than approximately 10 percent of the life span in humans (more than approximately 90 days to 2 years in typically used mammalian laboratory animal species). Cancer: The duration used for cancer is 70 years. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 23 In addition, the following notations are used within the tables: \"-\" means not relevant \"NA\" means not applicable. \"NA\" in the cancer column means that the chemical has not been classified as a linear (non -threshold) carcinogen \"ND\" means not derived due to absence or paucity of toxicity information \"None\" means that the HRL value is based on a general adverse effect (e.g., reduced adult body weight) not attributable to a specific organ system and therefore it is not applicable for inclusion in the additivity calculations for the health risk index. Where noted and so that HRL values for longer durations of exposure are adequately protective of shorter durations of exposure: \"(1)\" indicates the calculated HRL value is greater than the acute value, the HRL is set to equal the acute HRL value; \"(2)\" indicates the calculated HRL value is greater than the short -term HRL value, the HRL is set equal to the short- term HRL value; and \"(3)\" indicates the calculated HRL is greater than the subchronic HRL, the HRL is set to equal the subchronic HRL value. More informa tion about each parameter can be found in Appendix C and in the 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2008). B. PROPOSED RULES: THE HEALTH RISK LIMITS TABLE (Minnesota Rules, p art 4717.7860) 1. Proposed HRL Rules Amendments for New or Updated Guidance The following pages describe HRL Rules amendments proposed for 14 substances with new or updated guidance values: Subp. The proposed acute nHRL is 200 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.25 mg/kg- d and the intake rate is 0.289 L/kg -d. The Relative Source Contribution (RSC) is 0.2. MDH uses the EPA Exposure Decision Tree (EPA 2000c ) to select appropriate RSCs. Given the significant potential non-water sources of exposure from multiple products available for infants and children , an RSC of 0.2 is selected rather than the default value of 0.5 used for Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 24 nonvolatile chemicals . The No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) is 7.4 mg/kg-d, based on the human minimum therapeutic dose for infants at 40 mg/dose for up to 5.4 kg infant. Because the NOAEL was based on human data, no Human Equivalent Dose (HED) was calculated. The tot al uncertainty factor is 30 (10 for intraspecies variability , and 3 for database uncertainty [ additional studies to evaluate gestational and early life exposures and to adequately characterize the dose-response and adversity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme inhibition are warranted] ). The critical effect is hepatotoxicity, or liver damage, in humans. The co- critical effects are liver effects in animals (increased serum liver enzymes, reduced hepatic glutathione, and liver histopathological changes) and acute liver failure in humans . The additivity endpoint (the way scientists evaluate the risk from exposure to multiple chemicals ) is hepatic (liver) system. Short -term duration. The proposed short- term nHRL is 200 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.25 mg/kg -d and the intake rate is 0.289 L/kg-d. The RSC is 0.2. MDH uses the EPA Exposure Decision Tree (EPA 2000c) to select appropriate RSCs. Given the significant potential non- water sources of exposure from multiple products available for infants and children, an RSC of 0.2 is selected rather than the default value of 0.5 used for nonvolatile chemicals. The NOAEL is 7.4 mg/kg -d. The HED is not applicable. The total uncertainty factor is 30 (10 for intraspecies variability , 3 for database uncertainty [additional studies to evaluate gestational and early life exposures and to adequately characterize the dose-response and adversity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme inhibition are warranted ]). Critical effects are hepatoxicity and increased serum liver enzymes (ALT) in humans and animals . Co- critical effects are acute liver failure, hepatotoxicity, increased serum liver enzymes (ALT, AST) in humans and animals, decreased hepatic glutathione (GSH), and liver histopathological changes in animals. The is hepatic (liver) system. Subchronic duration. The subchronic nHRL must be protective of the acute and short-term exposures that occur within the subchronic period and therefore, the proposed subchronic nHRL is set equal to the proposed short- term nHRL of 200 \u00b5g/L. The additivity endpoint is hepa tic (liver) system . Chronic duration. The chronic nHRL must be protective of the acute, short-term, and subchronic exposures that occur within the chronic period and therefore, the proposed chronic nHRL is set equal to the proposed short-term nHRL of 200 \u00b5g/L. The additivity endpoint is hepatic (liver) system. Cancer. Not applicable.

The Relative Source Contribution (RSC) is 0.2. MDH uses the EPA Exposure Decision Tree (EPA, 2000) to select appropriate RSCs. Due to evidence of acrylamid e in breast milk (Sorgel, 2002) and baby food (FDA, 2006), along with evidence that dietary exposures for some people exceed 50 percent of the short- term RfD, an RSC of 0.2 is selected rather than the default value of 0.5 used for nonvolatile chemicals. The point of departure selected was the benchmark dose lower-confidence limit (BMDL 10) of 1.33 mg/kg -d and the Human Equivalent Dose (HED) is 0.31 mg/kg -d. The total uncertainty factor is 30 (3 for interspecies differences [toxicodynamics]8 and 10 for intraspecies variability) . Critical effects are reproductive toxicity in male rodents causing germ cell damage that results in fetal resorptions and implantation loss. Co- critical effects are neurotoxicity such as loss of hind-limb use and altered head tilt, m ale-mediated reproductive toxicity resulting in impaired mating and 8 One of the Uncertainty Factors S ee Glossar y, page 61 and Appendix C, page 75 ) Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 26 decreased number and vitality of fetuses, increased re sorptions/implantation losses , developmental toxicity including neurobehavioral effects in young animals, decreased pup body weight, and increased resorptions/implantation losses. The additivity endpoints are developmental, male reproductive system, and nervous system. Subchronic duration. The subchronic n HRL must be protective of the short-term exposures that occur within the subchronic period and therefore, the proposed subchronic nHRL is set equal to the proposed short- term n HRL of 7 \u00b5g/L. The additivity endpoints are developmental, male reproductive system, and nervous system. Chronic duration. The chronic nHRL must be protective of the short-term exposures that occur within the chronic period and therefore, the proposed chronic nHRL is set equal to the proposed short- term nHR L of 7 \u00b5g/L. The additivity endpoints are developmental, male reproductive system, and nervous system. Cancer. The proposed cancer HRL is 0.2 g/L.

The proposed acute duration nHRL is 100 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.15 mg/kg -d and t he intake rate is 0.289 L/kg -d. The RSC is 0.2. MDH uses the EPA Exposure Decision Tree (EPA , 2000c ) to select appropriate RSCs (MDH , 2008). Typically an RSC of 0.5 is used for nonvolatile contaminants. However, there is evidence that there are significant known or potential sources other than ingestion of water. An RSC of 0.2 was selected rather than the default value of 0.5 for nonvolatile contaminants. The NOAEL is 20 mg/k g-d and the HED is 4.6 mg/kg -d. The total uncertainty factor is 30 ( 3 for interspecies differences [toxicodynamics] and 10 for intraspecies variability). Critical effects are decreased pup body weight and decreased serum thyroid hormone levels in preweanin g pups. There were no co -critical effects. The additivity endpoint is developmental (E). Short -term duration. The proposed short- term nHRL value is 100 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.15 mg/kg -d and t he intake rate is 0.289 L/kg -d. The RSC was set at 0.2 because there is evidence that there are significant known or potential pathways of exposure other than ingestion of water. The N OAEL is 20 mg/kg -d and the HED is 4.6 mg/kg-d. The total uncertainty factor is 30 (3 for interspecies differences [toxicodynamics] and 10 for intraspecies variability ). Critical effects were decreased pup body weight and decreased serum thyroid hormone levels in preweaning pups. There were no co -critical effects. The additivity endpoint is developmental (E). Subchronic duration. The subchronic nHRL value must be protective of the acute and short- term exposures that occur within the subchronic period and therefore, the proposed subchronic nHRL Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 31 value is set equal to the proposed short- term nHRL value of 100 \u00b5g/L . The additivity endpoint is the same as for the short -term duration (developmental [E] ). Chronic duration. The chronic nHRL value must be protecti ve of the acute, short- term, and subchronic exposures that occur within the chronic period and therefore, the proposed chronic nHRL value is set equal to the proposed short- term nHRL value of 100 \u00b5g/L . The additivity endpoint is the same for the short- term duration (developmental [E] ). Cancer. Not applicable. BBP was classified as a Group C carcinogen by EPA IRIS in 1993. In 2002, using the revised EPA cancer classification, the EPA Provisional Peer Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTV) program has classified BBP as \"likely to be carcinogenic\" (EPA, 2002b). PPRTV derived a cancer slope factor, however, MDH has chosen to not use the EPA PPRTV cancer slope factor to generate a cancer HBV. MDH considers BBP to be a nonlinear (threshold) carcinogen based on lack of positive genotoxicity data and evidence of clear morphological continuum acinar cell hyperplasia to carcinoma in male rats (NTP, 1997). Carcinogenicity was equivocal in female rats despite 2 -fold higher dose levels and negative in mice (NTP, 1997). The RfD (0.15 mg/kg -d) is 162-fold lower than the NTP study NOAEL HED and is therefore considered to be protective against cancer.

Typically, an RSC of 0.5 is used for moderately volatile contaminants for the acute and short- term durations. Given the significant potential for non-drinking water sources of dietary exposure to infants and children, an RSC of 0.2 was selected rather than applying the default RSC value of 0.5. The intake rate is 0.289 L/kg -d. The uncertainty adjustment is 30 (3 for interspecies differences [toxicodynamics] and 10 for intra species variability). The critical effect s are decreased fetal b ody weight and body length and increased fetal skeletal malformations. The co -critical effects are decreased fetal body weight, body weight gain , and body length. The additivity endpoint is developmental. Short -term duration. The proposed short- term nHRL value is 1 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.0016 mg/kg -d and the intake rate is 0.289 L/kg -d. The point of departure LOAEL is 0.71 mg/kg -d. The HED is 0.16 mg/kg -d and the RSC is 0.2 (for the same reason as described in the acute duration, above). The total unce rtainty factor is 100 (3 for interspecies differences [toxicodynamics], 10 for intraspecies variability, and 3 for extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL [the neurological effects observed at the LOAEL were subtle and a factor of 3 is expected to be sufficiently protective]). The critical effects are alteration in the development of cliff avoidance behavior and spontaneous locomotor activity in offspring exposed during the developmental period. The co -critical effects are decreased plasma essential ions and decrea sed glomerular filtration rate. The additivity endpoint s are developmental, nervous system, and renal (kidney) system . Subchronic duration. The proposed subchronic nHRL value is 1 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.00044 mg/kg -d, and the intake rate is 0.077 L/kg -d. The point of departure LOAEL is 0.2 mg/kg -d. The HED is 0.044 mg/kg -d and the RSC is 0.2. The total uncertainty factor is 100 (3 for interspecies differences [toxicodynamics], 10 for intraspecies variability , and extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL [t he bone effects observed at the LOAEL were subtle and a factor of 3 is expected to be sufficiently protective]). The critical effects are decreased femoral bone resistance to fracture, increased fragility of the femoral bone, increased markers for bone resorption, and decreased markers for bone formation in rapidly growing young animals . There are no co -critical effects. The additivity endpoints are developmental and skeletal . Chronic duration. The proposed chronic nHRL value is 0.5 \u00b5g/L. The RfD is 0.00011 mg/kg -d, and the intake rate is 0.043 L/kg -d. The point of departure urinary cadmium dose level 10 (UCDL 10) is 0.00033 mg/kg-d, where the UCDL 10 is the 95 percent lower confidence limit on the estimated internal cadmium dose (urinary cadmium expressed as \u00b5 g/g creatinine) corresponding to the probability of 10 percent excess risk of low molecular weight proteinuria. Because a human study was used, an HED was not app licable . The RSC is 0.2. The total uncertainty factor is 3 (3 for intraspecies variability to account fo r sensitive subpopulations). The critical effect is low molecular weight proteinuria.

Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 45 V. REGULATORY ANALYSIS This section discusses the regulator y factors , the performance -based rules, the additional notice plan , and the impact of the proposed rules, as required by Minnesota Statutes, section 14.131. A. REGULATORY FACTORS Minnesota Statutes, section 14.131, sets out eigh t factors for regulatory analysis that agencies must include in the SONAR. This section discusses each of the factors. 1. Classes of persons probably affected by the proposed rules , including classes that will bear the costs and classes that will benefit Because these rules pertain to the quality of drinking water in Minnesota, the proposed amendments could potentially affect all persons in Minnesota. Those affected depend s on how state agencies charged with protecting Minnesota's environment and water resources apply HRL values . Generally, HRL values serve as benchmarks in state water monitoring and contamination response programs intended to protect the health of all Minnesotans. In addition, HRL values and related chemical data are incorporated into other state rules intended to protect Minnesota's water resources (e.g., MPCA's solid waste and surface water rules) benefit ting the entire state. More specifically, the amendments can affect individuals or populations when a public or private water supply becomes contaminated and federal MCLs are unavailable. In these instances, the responding agency estimates the risks from consuming contaminated w ater using HRL values , and advises the regulated party, the responsible governmental unit, the water operator or the public on how to eliminate or reduce risk . Monetary costs for applying the HRLs could affect those found responsible for contam inating or degrading groundwater or surface water, or communities that use public funds to remediate contaminated water . The proposed amendments provide protection to human life stages that are sensitive or highly exposed. Risk managers have the option of applying HRL values to the general population, or adjusting them for smaller groups or \" sub-populations.\" 2. The probable costs of implementation and enforcement and any anticipated effect on state revenues The proposed amendments do not have any direct impact on state revenues. There are no fees associated with the rules . The amendments simply provide health-based levels for certain water contaminants. A gencies that apply HRL values will need to determine costs on a case -by-case basis. 3. A determination of whether there are less costly or less intrusive Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 46 methods for achieving the purpose of the propos ed rule AND 4. A description of any alternative methods for achieving the purpose of the proposed rule that were seriously considered by the agency and the reasons why they were rejected in favor of the proposed rule Minnesota Rules, Chapter 4717, parts 7500, 7850, and 7860 establish HRL values, which are uniform, science-based values that protect the health of people who drink groundwater or surface water . Unlike other rules that regulate citizen or industry activities, this HRL rules revision applies the specific met hodology previously adopted to identified contaminants and calculates and adopts the calculated values themselves. As described in Section II. A. above, Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision 1, prescribes the methods that the Commissioner must use in deriving HRL values. In paragraph (c) the statute requires that the Commissioner establish HRLs for contaminants that are not carcinogens, \"using United States Environmental Protection Agency risk assessment methods using a reference dose, a drinking water equivalent, and a relative source contribution factor.\" Likewise, in paragraph (d) the Commissioner must derive HRL values for contamina nts that are known or probable carcinogens \"from a quantitative estimate of the chemical's carcinogenic potency published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and determined by the commissioner to have undergone thorough scientific review.\" In addition, Minnesota Statutes, section 144.0751, provides further direction. Per this provision, safe drinking water standards must \"be based on scientifically acceptable, peer-reviewed information;\" and \"include a reasonable margin of safety to adequa tely protect the health of infants, children, and adults...\" The section also lists risks to specific health outcomes that the commissioner must consider. Thus the statutes limit MDH's discretion about how it may determine allowab le amounts of water contam inants. In 2009, the Commissioner adopted the methodology for carrying these directives out, which is now contained in Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7820 and 4717.7830. This rulemaking project merely adds new values and repeals old values by applying the met hodology adopted in 2009, which is not under review at present. MDH adopts the specific HRL values through a process designed to inform and engage the public. Because of the specific nature of these rules, the method for achieving the purpose of the proposed rule has already been established by the 2009 rulemaking. There are no less costly or less intrusive methods for adopting these new chemical values. Similarly, the fact that the method was set in the 2009 rulemaking precludes alternative methods for achieving the purpose of the proposed rule. The only choices that the agency considered involved the choice of the specific chemicals. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 47 HRL values , before being adopted into rule, are initially an alternative type of quantitative guidance on water contaminants, often derived at the request of other agencies. This guidance, known as a Health Based Value (HBV ), is derived using the same methodology as an HRL . While all HRL values were initially HBV values, not all HBV values are proposed for adoption into rule as HRLs. The HBV values may be less costly in that the agency has not used resources needed to complete rulemaking. In practice, risk managers may use HBV values in the same way as HRL values. However, because HBV values have not been adopted into rule , State agencies and the regulated community consider them to be transient i n nature when compared to the HRL values . HRLs values are more useful in long -term planning because they are considered more permanent. The promulgation of the guidance into rule standardizes the use of guidance statewide, and provides the authority and uniformity of rule. HBVs for ground water contaminants that MDH has derived through the HRL standard methodology are eligible for rule adoption. MDH rejects the possibility of leaving the proposed chemicals in their outdated or HBV status. 5. The probable costs of complying with the proposed rule Because the HRL rules do not specify how the health-protective numbers are to be applied, the probable cost of complying with the proposed amendments cannot be estimated. HRL values are only one set of criteria used to evaluate whether a contaminant's concentration in groundwa ter is associated with a risk to health. HRL values are not intended to be bright lines between \"acceptable\" and \"unacceptable\" concentrations. MDH derives HRL values using conservative methods so that exposures below an HRL value would be expected to pre sent minimal, if any , risk to human health. Similarly, a contaminant concentration above an HRL value, without consideration of other information, might not necessarily indicate a public health problem. However, because the proposed HRL values for four ch emicals are lower than the or the cost of remediating or preventing water contamination might increase. The proposed HRL values for the eight chemicals without 1993/1994 or 2009 HRL values represent new HRL values. Any costs associated with these are indeterminate. 6. The probable costs or consequences of not adopting the proposed rule The probable costs or consequences of not adopting the proposed amendme nts are immeasurable in terms of effects on water. As stated above, Minnesota's groundwater and some surface waters are primary sources of drinking water for Minnesotans, making the need to protect these waters obvious and imperative. A f ailure to revise the rules would ignore legislative directives and leave an outdated set of standards in place, providing only limited options for protections to segments of the population. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 48 Though the state's goal is to prevent degradation of water, degradation prevention is the ideal and thus cannot always be achieved. Some water resources have already been contaminated by unintentional releases \u2014by activities that occurred before the vulnerability of source waters to contamination was known; by activities that occurred before certain chemicals were identified as toxic; or before regulations prohibiting releases had been implemented. HRL values allow authorities to evaluate drinking water sources to ensure that there is minimal risk to human h ealth from usi ng them for drink ing. A reliable source of water that is safe for human consumption is essential to a state's ability to safeguard a high standard of living for its citizens. 7. Differences between the proposed rule and existing federal regulations, and the need for and reasonableness of each difference U.S. EPA's Office of Water publishes several sets of drinking water -related standards and health advisories such as Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) , MCLs , Drinking Water Equivalent Levels (DWELs) , and lifetime Health Advisories (HAs) . While these are similar to MDH -derived HRL values in some respects, they differ in important ways noted below. Furthermore, for any given chemical, all, several, one, or none of these standards and advisories may have been developed by the U.S. EPA. MDH- derived HRL values differ from existing federal regulations and advisory values in several ways: HRL values are based strictly on human health; The derivation of HRL values explicitly includes a reasonable margin of safety for vulnerable sub-populations such as infants and children, who are considered to potentially be at higher risk than adults; MDH has more exposure time durations than U.S. EPA; MDH derives guidance for chemicals that are of high importance specifical ly to Minnesota ; and In general, MDH can sometimes derive guidance more expediently. While some federal regulations or advisory values might adhere to one or two of the conditions above, none adheres to all conditions. EPA -derived MCLGs are advisory values based solely on considerations of human health. However, by definition, the MCLG for any chemical that causes cancer is zero. Because it might not be possible to restore contaminated groundwater to a pristine condition, MCLGs do not provide meaningful values for practical application to groundwater contaminated by carcinogens. EPA -derived MCLs are federal standards adopted for the regulation of public drinking water in Minnesota. However, MCLs incorporate a considerati on of the costs required to reduce contaminant concentrations to a given level and the technological feasibility of reaching that level. The factors that determine economic and technological feasibility for public drinking water systems might not be releva nt to private drinking water wells or to other sites impacted by contamination. The U.S. EPA has developed MCLs for 91 Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 49 chemicals , with the most recent value developed in 2001. As a result, most MCLs were developed using outdated methods based only on adult intakes and body weight. EPA -derived DWELs and HAs are estimates of acceptable drinking water levels of non - carcinogens or carcinogens based on health effects information. DWELs and HAs serve as non- regulatory technical guidance to assist federal, state, and local officials. DWELs assume that all of an individual's exposure to a contaminant is from drinking water. HRL values and lifetime HAs take into account people's exposure via routes other than drinking water, and allocate to drinking water only a portion of an individual's allowable exposure (i.e., incorporate the RSC). HAs might also be derived for exposure durations of one day, ten days, or a lifetime. One-day and ten-day HAs incorporate intake and body weight parameters appropriate for children but do not incorporate an RSC. MDH also currently has health -based guidance for more chemicals important to Minnesota. While U.S. EPA has MCLs for 91 chemicals, there are currently Minnesota values for 136 chemicals . If all of the proposed HRL values are adopted in this rulemaking , there will be HRL values for a total of 150 chemicals in Minnesota. Furthermore , EPA currently derives guidance values primarily for subchronic and chronic duration while MDH de rives guidance for acute and short -term durations in addition to subchronic and chronic durations. Providing guidance for less than chronic durations helps ensure that risk manag ement decision s are protective for all exposed individuals, including infants and children and not only adults. Importantly, the chemicals for which MDH develops guidance are those that MDH and its partners have deemed to be priorities in Minnesota. At the federal level, guidance is developed based on priorities throughout the nation. At times, because of varying geographic and historical factors , including usage of chemicals , chemical s important nationally may not be as high in priority for Minnesota , and chemicals important to Minnesotans may not be ranked as high nationally. Guidance developed by MDH, however, is often based on requests from Minnesota risk managers who have detected a chemical at location s within the state, or from members of the public who have concerns about specific known or potential contaminants in Minnes ota waters. Further, guidance developed in Minnesota is often available more quickly than guidance developed by U.S. EPA. At times, issuance of new guidance from EPA can be delayed for various reasons. At the time an HRL guidance value is requested by Minnesota state agencies or the public, contaminants in groundwater have often already been detected in the state, with potential for human exposure. This increases the need for timely guidance. 8. An assessment of the cumulative effect of the rule with other federal and state regulations related to th e specific purpose of the rule. The proposed rules represent the only regulatory results, since as stated in item 7 above, there are no other state and federal rules related to the same specific pur pose of setti ng Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 50 allowable water contaminant values for groundwater . MDH is not proposing enforceable standards but adopting guidance for risk managers and our partners to use in their evaluations and mitigation work. For these reasons the cumulat ive effect comes only from the applications of these rules. The proposed amendments to the HRL rules have no direct regulatory impact because the HRA Unit at MDH does not enforce or regulate the use of health-based guidance. MDH provides recommended values for use by risk assessors and risk managers in making decisions and evaluating health risks. Other programs within MDH or other agencies may independently adopt these health-based values and incorporate them within enforceable requirements related to permitting or remediation activities. MDH cannot anticipate all the situations in which HRL values might provide meaningful guidance. Nor can MD H anticipate all the factors that might determine whether the applying an HRL value is appropriate. Each program must determine whether to apply an HRL value or whether site -specific characteristics justify deviation from HRL values. Health -based guidance is only one s et of criteria that state water and environmental protection programs use to evaluate contamination. Other state and federal health or environmentally-based rules, laws or considerations may apply. For example, the federally -implemented MCLs for drinking water are applicable to public water systems. MCL values are legally enforceable under the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations. Further, MCLs are not applicable to private water supplies. Those who consume or work to protect the water from a private well may seek to comply with an HRL or MCL value in interest of protecting health. Overall, the incremental cumulative effect of these rules will vary on a case- by-case basis, depending on the type of contamination present, the level of threat to human health or the environment, and the requirements of the responsible governmental agency. In some situations the rules may have little or no effect, especially when other laws take precedence or when contamination is already below the H RL value. In another case where an HRL value is exceeded , an agency might invoke its requirement that the responsible party bring the contaminant concentration down to a safe level for consumption. The numerous scenarios under which HRL values might be applied by other agencies prohibit a more full analysis of incremental impact that is within the scope of this SONAR. B. PERFORMANCE-BASED RULES The proposed amendments allow risk managers and stakeholders flexibility in determining how best to protect the public from potentially harmful substances in our groundwater. HRL values provide a scientific and policy context within which the risks posed by a particular situation may be analyzed. Following the risk analysis, risk managers and stakeholders, including other regulatory agencies, may examine the options and make decisions on a course of action. After implementation, they may evaluate outcomes. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 51 C. ADDITIONAL NOTICE In addition to following the notice requirements specified by the Minnesota Administrative P rocedures Act ( APA) (Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.001 et seq .) for the publication of official notices in the State Register and related procedures, described below, MDH has already carried out or will carry out the following additional activi ties as its additional notice plan : Before the official beginning of rulemaking , on February 12, 2014, MDH sent a notice via its GovDelivery Water Rules, Guidance and Chemical Review Account to notify subscribers that it was contemplating rulemaking. A link to a Web page with a list of chemicals with eligible guidance , in addition to the guidance values, was included in the message. Comments were encouraged. This email was sent to 2,684 subscribers. One business day before to the Request for Comments publication, on April 11, 2014, MDH made phone calls or sent emails to seven individuals or environmental advocacy or trade organizations who in the past had requested notice about MDH rul emaking activity related to HRL values. MDH also sent emails to two staff of ot her State agencies. The notices provided information about pending publication of the Request for Comments, and links to MDH's Rules Web page with information about each chemical under consideration. Request for Comments: MDH published the \"Request for Comments \" notice in the Minnesota State Register on April 14, 2014. The notice provided an overview of possible amendments to the current HRL rules and invited public comment. The notice is available from the Minnesota State Register website at : http://www.comm.media.state.mn.us/bookstore/stateregister/38_42.pdf#page=8 . The day of the publication, MDH sent out a GovDelivery notice to the 2,750 subscribers of the Water Rules, Guidance and Chemical Review account to provide notice of the Request for Comments publication. A list of the contaminants with guidance under consideration was included in the email, along with links to MDH HRL Rules Web page and to the Request for Comments in the State Register . MDH HRL rule amendment public meeting: MDH hosted a public meeting on Thursday, August 7, 2014, at the Orville Freeman Building in St. Paul, MN. MDH sent notification about the public meeting via its GovDelivery account for Water Rules, Guidance and Chemical Review before the meeting on July 2, 2014, (2,809 subscribers) and maintained materials on its website. At this meeting, MDH staff gave an overview of the chemical selection and review process, and presented information on the proposed amendments and the types of guidance MDH develops for groundwater contaminants. MDH encouraged attendees to ask questions, engage in discussion with staff and submit written comments. Questions centered on 1) how to choose and apply guidance for a duration (Application of rules is outside of the scope of the rules .); 2) Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 52 whether surface water contaminants in addition to triclosan are being considered for rulemaking (MDH is not proposing other surface water guidance f or adoption into rule now.); and 3) rulemaking timing and process (MDH offered more detailed information about rulemaking, including options for commenting on the rules .). MDH offered to meet with stakeholders upon request. MDH made all meeting materials, including answers to the questions asked at the meeting, available on MDH's HRL rule amendments Web pages after the public meeting. 9 Including MDH staff, about 11 perso ns attended the public meeting. As of March 2, 2015, MDH has received no written or oral comments in response to the Request for Comments. More than 60 days have elapsed since its publication. Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules : MDH intends to publish the Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules -Dual Notice in the State Register . MDH will mail the proposed rules and the Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules to the parties listed on MDH's rulemaking list under Minnesota Statutes, section 14.14, subdivision 1a. MDH will also send the Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules - Dual Notice and a copy of the SONAR to the Legislature and the Legislative Reference Library . Further, MDH will send a notice to the subscribers of its GovDelivery Water Rules, Guidance and Chemical Review account. MDH also intends to send information to the offices of stakeholders such as water resource interests groups and the industry or commerce organizations to distribute to their members as at their discretion. Upon request , copies of the proposed rules and the SONAR will be made available at no charge. MDH's Notice Plan did not include notifying the Commissioner of Agriculture or the state Council on Affairs of Chicano/Latino People because the rules do not affect farming operations per Minnesota statutes, section 14.111, or the Chicano/Latino people per Minne sota statutes, section 3.9223, subdivision 4. MDH uses the following methods to communicate with stakeholders and to make information available during the rules process: MDH HRL rule amendment website: MDH created new Web page s for the 2014/2015 HRL rule amendment . 10 MDH periodically updates these Web pages and includes, or will include, information such as: drafts of the proposed amendments to the rules (made available online before MDH's HRL public meeting -see details below), the SONAR, notices requesting public comments, 9 Materials and handouts for MDH's meeting on the amendments to the rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater are available at: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/risk/rules/water/rules2015/publicmeeting/index.html 10 MDH's amendments to the rules on Health Risk Limits for Gro undwater are available at: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/risk/rules/water/overview.html Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 53 public meeting announcements and related handouts, the rule amendment schedule, and brief explanations of the rulemaking process. MDH email subscription ser vice: MDH maintains a free email subscription list for send ing updates on water rules and guidance on the chemicals reviewed. Anyone may subscribe through links on the MDH HRL rules am endment Web pages. MDH routinely sends updates on the HRL rule amendment to the email subscribers. The updates include information such as: information on new or updated guidance values for specific chemicals, the publication of notices requesting comments, announcements regarding the public meeting, and the availability of drafts of the proposed rules and the SONAR . As of April 14, 2014, MDH's Groundwater Rules, Guidance and Chemical Review email subscription account had 2,750 s ubscribers. As of March 2, 2015, the number of subscribers had grown to 2,938 subscribers. D. IMPACT OF PROPOSED RULES 1. Consultation with MMB on Local Government Impact As required by Minnesota Statutes, section 14.131, MDH will consult with the Minnesota Management and Budget (MMB) on the impact the proposed rules might have on local governments . MDH will do so by sending to the MMB Commissioner copies of the documents sent to the Governor's Office for review and approval before MDH publishe s the Notice of Intent to Adopt Rules . The document s that will be sent to MMB include: the Governor's Office Proposed Rule and SONAR Form; the proposed rules; and the SONAR. MDH will plan to send the documents to MMB as soon as these documents have been approved by the MDH Commissioner for distribution. 2. Determination about rules requiring local implementation As required by Minnesota Statutes, section 14.128, subdivision 1, MDH has considered whether the proposed rules will require a local government to adopt or amend any ordinance or other regulation in order to comply with these rules. MDH has determined that they do not because no local government develops or enforces groundwater quality standards through ordinances or regulations . Local units of government have consulted with MDH on the use of HRL values for interpreting the results of well monitoring. 3. Cost of complying for small business or city MDH cannot determine small business or city costs incurred in complying with the proposed amendments because the rules do not have any implementation, regulation or enforcement requirements. The amendments simply provide health -based guidance for water contaminants; the rules do not address application or use. The guidance is one set of criteria for risk managers to evaluate potential health risks from contaminated groundwater. Risk managers have the flexibility in determining if and when to apply the HRL values and how costs should be considered. MDH is unaware of any small business or city that applies the health -based guidance. Therefore, there is no evidence that complying with the rules will exceed $25,000 for an y small business or city. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 54 E. LIST OF WITNESSES MDH intends to publish a \"Notice of Intent to Adopt\u2014Dual Notice \" and may cancel the scheduled hearing unless 25 or more persons request a hearing. If the proposed rules require a public hearing, MDH anticipates having the following personnel testify in support of the need and reasonableness of the rules: Julia Dady, Toxicologist/Risk Unit, H ealth Risk Assessment Unit, MDH Sarah Johnson, Toxicologist/ Risk Assessor, Health Risk Assessment Unit, MDH Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 55 VI. CONCLUSION As stated in Minnesota statute, \"the actual or potential use of the waters of the state for potable water supply is the highest priority use of that water and deserves maximum protection by the state .\" (Minnesota Statutes, section 115.063(2). Roughly 75 percent of Minnesota's drinking water is from groundwater and 25 percent is from surface water, leading to a need to protect both sources of water. The proposed amendments update MDH's human health-based guidance as requested and needed by risk managers to protect water and public health. This work is part of MDH's long -term plan to continue to review, develop , update, and add to the HRL rules on water contaminants . With the proposed amendments, MDH meets its statutory requirements to use methods that are scientific, based on current U.S. EPA risk -assessment guidelines , and provide protections to vulnerable populations ( Minnesota Statutes , section 103H.201 and Minnesota Statutes , section 144.0751). MDH used reasonable and well -established methods adopted in 2009 (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7830 , subpart . 2), and peer - reviewed data and scientific research in developing the HRL values for each chemical. The proposed amendments align with MDH's mission to protect , maintain and improve the health o f all Minnesotans . Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 56 This page is intentionally blank Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 57 APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN RISK ASSSESSMENT Acute duration: A period of 24 hours or less. Additional Lifetime cancer Risk (ALR) : The probability that daily exposure to a carcinogen over a lifetime may induce cancer. The Department of Health uses an additional can cer risk of 1\u00d710-5 (1 in 100,000) to derive cancer HRL values. One common interpretation of this additional cancer risk is that if a population of 100,000 were exposed, over an extended period of time, to a concentration of a carcinogen at the level of the HRL, at most, one case of cancer would be expected to result from this exposure. Because conservative techniques are used to develop these numbers, they are upper bound risks; the true risk may be as low as zero. Additivity Endpoint: See Health risk inde x endpoint(s). Adverse Effect: A biochemical change, functional impairment, or pathologic lesion that affects the performance of the whole organism or reduces an organism's ability to respond to an additional environmental challenge. AF lifetime or lifetime adjustment factor: An adjustment factor used to adjust the adult- based cancer slope factor for lifetime exposure based on chemical -specific data. Age-Dependent Adjustment Factor (ADAF): A default adjustment to the cancer slope factor that recognizes the increased susceptibility to cancer from early -life exposures to linear carcinogens in the absence of chemical -specific data. For the default derivation of cancer HRL values the following ADAFs and corresponding age groups are used: ADAF <2 = 10, for birth until 2 years of age; ADAF 2<16 = 3, for 2 up to 16 years of age; and ADAF 16+ = 1, for 16 years of age and older. Animal Study: A controlled experiment in which a cohort of test animals, usually mice, rats, or dogs, is exposed to a range of dos es of a chemical and assessed for health effects. For the purposes of the MDH HRL rules, only studies of mammalian species were considered; studies relating to fish, amphibians, plants, etc. are not used because of the greater uncertainty involved in extrapolating data for these species to human health effects, as compared to studies involving mammals. Benchmark Dose (BMD) : Dose or concentration that produces a predetermined change in the response rate of an adverse or biologically meaningful effect. The BMD approach uses mathematical models to statistically determine a dose associated with a predefined effect level (e.g., 1 0 percent). Benchmark Dose Level (BMD L): A statistical lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose (BMD). Cancer classification : Most substances are classified under the system put in place in the U.S. EPA Risk Assessment Guidelines of 1986. This syste m uses the categories: Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 58 A - known human carcinogen; B - probable human carcinogen; C - possible human carcinogen; D - not classifiable as to carcinogenicity; and E - evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans. In 2005, U.S. EPA finalized revised guidelines calling for a \"weight of the evidence\" narrative, which is a short summary that explains the potential of a substance to cause cancer in humans and the conditions that characterize its expression. The following general descriptors were suggested: carcinogenic to humans; likely to be carcinogenic to humans; suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential; inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential; and not likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Cancer Slope Factor: See Slope Factor. Carcinogen : Generically, a carcinogen is a chemical agent that causes cancer. For the purposes of these Rules, a carcinogen is a chemical that is: A) classified as a human carcinogen (Group A) or a probable human carcinogen (Group B) according to the U.S. EPA (1986a) classification system. This system has been replaced by a newer classification scheme (EPA 2005), but many chemicals still have classifications under the 1986 system. Possible human carcinogens (Group C) will be considere d carcinogens under these Rules if a cancer slope factor has been published by U.S. EPA and that slope factor is supported by the weight of the evidence. OR, B) Classified pursuant to the Final Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment (EPA 2005b) as \"Carcinogenic to Humans\" or \" Likely to be carcinogenic to humans.\" See also: Linear carcinogen, Non-linear carcinogen. CAS number : The Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Number. This number, assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service, a division of the American Chemical Society, uniquely identifies each chemical. Chronic duration: A period of more than approximately 10% of the life span in humans (more than approximately 90 days to 2 years in typically used mammalian laboratory animal species). Co-critical effect(s) : Generally, effects that are observed at doses up to or similar to the exposure level of the critical study asso ciated with the critical effect(s). Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 59 Conversion Factor (CF): A factor (1,000 g/mg) used to convert milligrams (mg) to micrograms (g). There are 1,000 micrograms per milligram. Critical effect(s) : The health effect or health effects from which a non -cancer toxicity value is derived; usually the first adverse effect that occurs to the most sensitive population as the dose increases. Database Factor : see Uncertainty Factor. Developmental health endpoint : Adverse effects on the developing organism that may result from exposure before conception (either parent), during prenatal development, or post- natally to the time of sexual maturation. Adverse developmental effects may be detected at any point in the lifespan of the organism. The major manifestations of developmental toxicity include: (1) death of the developing organism, (2) structural abnormality, (3) altered growth, and (4) function deficiency. Dose -Response Assessment : The determination of the relat ionship between the magnitude of administered, applied, or internal dose and a specific biological response. Response can be expressed as measured or observed incidence, percent response in groups of subjects (or populations), or the probability of occurre nce of a response in a population. Dosimetric Adjustment Factor (DAF): A multiplicative factor used to adjust observed experimental or epidemiological data to human equivalent concentration for assumed ambient scenario. Duration: Duration refers to the length of the exposure period under consideration. The default durations evaluated for non- cancer health effects are acute, short -term, subchronic, and chronic. See individual definitions for more information. These definitions are from \"A Review of the Reference Dose and Reference Concent ration Processes,\" U.S. EPA , Risk Assessment Forum (December 2002, http://www.epa.gov/raf/publications/pdfs/rfd- final). The default durations evaluated for cancer health effects correspond to the age groups upon which the age dependent adjustment factors (ADAF) are based. These age groups were identified in the \"Supplemental Guidance for Assessing Susceptibility from Early-Life Exposure to Carcinogens,\" U.S. EPA, Risk Assessment Forum (March 2005, http://www.epa.gov/cancerguidelines/guidelines -carcinogen -supplement.htm ). The age groups are: from birth up to 2 years of age; from 2 up to 16 years of age; and 16 years of age and older. The duration of concern may also be determined by chemical- specific information. For example, the non- cancer health effect may be linked to the time point at which the concentration of the chemical in the blood reaches a level associated with an adverse effect. Another example is if the cancer slope factor is based on a lifetime rather than an adult-only exposure protocol. In this case, a lifetime duration rather than the three age groups identified above would be used. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 60 Endocrine (hormone) system : All the organs, glands, or collections of specialized cells that secrete substances (hormones) that exert regulatory effects on distant tissues and organs through interaction with receptors, as well as the tissues or organs on which these substances exert their effects. The hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, parathyroids, adrenal glands, body are all endocrine organs; the intestines and the lung also secrete hormone- like substances. Endocrine (E) : For the purpose of the HRL revision, \"endocrine\" or \"E\" means a change in the circulating hormones or interactions with hormone receptors, regardless of the organ or organ system affected. Because of the many organs and tissues that secrete and/or are affected by hormones, the Department has not considered the endocrine system to be a discrete classification of toxicity. An endpoint is given an \"E\" designation only if a change in circulating hormones or receptor interactions has been measured. Endpoints with or without the (E) designation are deemed equivalent (e.g., thyroid (E) = thyroid) and shall be included in the same Health Risk Index calculation. Exposure Assessment : An identification and evaluation of the human population exposed to a toxic agent that describes its composition and size and the type, magnitude, frequency, route, and duration of exposure. Hazard Assessment : The process of determining whether exposure to an agent can cause an increase in the incidence of a particular adverse health effect (e.g., cancer , birth defect) and whether the adverse health effect is likely to occur in humans. Health -Based Value (HBV) : A health -based value (HBV) is the concentration of a groundwater contaminant that can be consumed daily with little or no risk to health. HBVs are derived using the same algorithm as HRL values but have not yet been as adopted into rule. An HBV is express ed as a concentration in micrograms per liter (g/L). Health risk index: A health risk index is a sum of the quotients calculated by identifying all chemicals that share a common health endpoint and dividing the measured or surrogate concentration of each chemical by its HRL. The multiple -chemical health risk index is compared to the cumulative health risk limit of 1 to determine whether an exceedance has occurred. Health risk index endpoint(s) : The general description of critical and co -critical effect s used to group chemicals for the purpose of evaluating risks from multiple chemicals. For example, the effect \"inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase\" is listed as the health risk index endpoint \"nervous system,\" and all chemicals that can affect the nervous system would be considered together. Health Risk Limit (HRL) : A health risk limit (HRL) is the concentration of a groundwater contaminant, or a mixture of contaminants that can be consumed with little or no risk to health, and which has been adopted into rule. An HRL is expressed as a concentration in micrograms per liter (g/L). Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 61 Health Standards Statute : Minnesota Statutes, section 144.0751. This statute requires that drinking water and air quality standards include a reasonable margin of safety to protect infants, children, and adults, taking into consideration the risk of a number of specified health ef fects, including: \"reproductive development and function, respiratory function, immunologic suppression or hypersensitization, development of the brain and nervous system, endocrine (hormonal) function, cancer, and general infant and child development.\" Human Equivalent Dose (HED): The human dose (for other than the inhalation routes of exposure) of an agent that is believed to induce the same magnitude of toxic effect as the experimental animal species dose. This adjustment may incorporate toxicokinetic information on the particular agent, if available, or use a default procedure, such as assuming that daily oral doses experienced for a lifetime are proportional to body weight raised to the 0.75 power (BW 3/4). Immunotoxicity : Adverse effects resulting fr om suppression or stimulation of the body's immune response to a potentially harmful foreign organism or substance. Changes in immune function resulting from immunotoxic agents may include higher rates or more severe cases of disease, increased cancer rates, and auto- immune disease or allergic reactions. Immune system : A complex system of organs, tissues, cells, and cell products that function to distinguish self from non-self and to defend the body against organisms or substances foreign to the body, including altered cells of the body, and prevent them from harming the body. Intake Rate (IR): Rate of inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact, depending on the route of exposure. For ingestion of water, the intake rate is simply the amount of water, on a per body weight basis, ingested on a daily basis (liters per kg body weight per day, L/kg -day) for a specified duration. For the derivation of non- cancer and cancer HRL values , the time -weighted average of the 95 th percentile intake rate for the relevant duration was used. Interspecies Factor: see Uncertainty Factor. Intraspecies Factor: see Uncertainty Factor. (kg): One kilogram is equivalent to 2.2046226 pounds. Latency Period : The time between exposure to an agent and manifestation or detection of a health effect of interest. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 62 Linear carcinogen: A chemical agent for which the associated cancer risk varies in direct proportion to the extent of exposure, and for which there is no risk- free level of exposure. Linear Dose Response: A patte rn of frequency or severity of biological response that varies directly with the amount of dose of an agent. In other words, more exposure to the substance could produce more of an effect. This linear relationship holds only at low doses in the range of extrapolation. Liter (L): One liter is equivalent to 1.05671 quarts. Liters per kilogram per day (L/kg -day) : A measure of daily water intake, relative to the individual's body weight. LOAEL- to-NOAEL : see Uncertainty Factor. Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) : The lowest exposure level at which a statistically or biologically significant increase in the frequency or severity of adverse effects is observed between the exposed population and its appropriate control group. A LOAEL is expressed as a dose rate in milligrams per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg -day). MCL -based HRL: A Health Risk Limit for groundwater adopted by reference to the U.S. EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) rather than through the standard MDH chemical evalu ation proc ess. Mechanism of Action : The complete sequence of biological events (i.e., including toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic events) from exposure to the chemical to the ultimate cellular and molecular consequences of chemical exposure that is required in order to produce the toxic effect. However, events that are coincident but not required to produce the toxic outcome are not included. Microgram (g): 10 -6 grams or 10-3 1 milligram Micrograms per liter (g/L): A unit of measure of concentration of a dissolved substance in water. Milligram (mg) : 10 -3 grams. 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram. Milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg-day or mg/kg-d): A measure of daily exposure to a contaminant, relative to the individual's body weight. Mode of Action (MOA) : The sequence of key event(s) (i.e., toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics) after chemical exposure upon which the toxic outcomes depend. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 63 Neurotoxicity : Any adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system related to exposure to a chemical. Non-linear carcinogen: A chemical agent for which, particularly at low doses, the associated cancer risk does not rise in direct proportion to the extent of exposure, and for which there may be a threshold level of exposure below which there is no cancer risk. Non-linear Dose Response: A pattern of frequency or severity of biological response that does not vary directly with the amount of dose of an agent. When mode of action information indicates that responses may fall more rapidly than dose below the range of the observed data, non- linear methods for determining risk at low dose may be justified. No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) : An exposure level at which there is no statistically or biologically significant increase in the frequency or severity of adverse effects between the exposed population and its appropriate control group. Physiologically Based Toxicokinetic (PBTK) Model: A model that estimates the dose to a target tissue or organ by taking into account the rate of absorption into the body, distribution among target organs and tissues, metabolism, and excretion. (Also referred to as physiologica lly based pharmacokinetic model.) Point of Departure (POD): The dose-response point that marks the beginning of a low-dose extrapolation. This point can be the lower bound on dose for an estimated incidence or a change in response level from a dose-response model (BMD) or a NOAEL or LOAEL for an observed incidence, or change in level of response. Reference Dose (RfD) : An estimate of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects for a given exposure duration. It is derived from a suitable exposure level at which there are few or no statistically or biologically significant increases in the frequency or severity of an adverse effect between an exposed population and its appropriate control group. The RfD is expressed in units of milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg -day). Relative Source Contribution (RSC) : The portion of the RfD that is \"allocated\" to ingestion of water. Applying this factor acknowledges that non-ingestion exposure pathways (e.g., dermal contact with water, inhalation of vol atilized chemicals in water) as well as exposure to other media, such as air, food, and soil may occur. The Minnesota Groundwater Protection Act , in Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision 1(d), requires that MDH use a relative source contribution in deriving health risk limits for systemic toxicants. MDH relied upon U.S. EPA's Exposure Decision Tree approach contained in Chapter 4 of the Ambient Water Quality Criteria document ( http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/upload/2005_05_06_criteria_humanh ealth_method_complete.pdf ) to determine appropriate RSC values. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 64 HRL values are often applied at contaminated sites where media other than groundwater may also be contaminated. The level of media contamination and the populations potentially exposed will vary from site to site and from chemical to chemical. Using a qualitative ev aluation and the Exposure Decision Tree, MDH determined the following default RSC values: 0.2 for highly volatile contaminants (chemicals with a Henry's Law Constant greater than 1\u00d710 -3 atm-m3/mole) and 0.5 for young infants or 0.2 for older infants, children and adults for chemicals that are not highly volatile. There may be chemical -specific or site -specific exposure information where the Exposure Decision Tree could be used to derive a chemical - or site -specific RSC that is different than the default val ue. Reproductive toxicity : Effects on the ability of males or females to reproduce, including effects on endocrine systems involved in reproduction and effects on parents that may affect pregnancy outcomes. Reproductive toxicity may be expressed as alterations in sexual behavior, decreases in fertility, changes in sexual function that do not affect fertility, or fetal loss during pregnancy. Risk: In the context of human health, the probability of adverse effects resulting from exposure to an environmental agent or mixture of agents. Risk Assessment: The evaluation of scientific information on the hazardous properties of environmental agents (hazard characterization), the dose-response relationship (dose-response assessment), and the extent of human exposure to those agents (exposure assessment). The product of the risk assessment is a statement regarding the probability that populations or individuals so exposed will be harmed and to what degree (risk characterization). Risk Assessment Advice ( RAA ): A type of MDH health -based guidance that evaluates potential health risks to humans from exposures to a chemical. Generally, RAA contains greater uncertainty th an HRL values and HBVs due to limited availability of information. Based on the information available, RAA may be quantitative (e.g., a concentration of a chemical that is likely to pose little or no health risk to humans expressed in g/L) or qualitative (e.g., a written description of how toxic a chemical is in comparison to a similar chemical). Risk Characterization: The integration of information on hazard, exposure, and dose- response to provide an estimate of the likelihood that any of the identified adverse effects will occur in exposed people. Risk Management: A decision -making process that accounts for political, social, economic, and engineering implications together with risk-related information in order to develop, analyze, and compare management options and select the appropriate managerial response to a potential health hazard. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 65 Secondary Observation: Notation indicating that although endpoint- specific testing was not conducted, observations regarding effects on the endpoint were reported in a toxicity study. Short -Term Duration : A period of more than 24 hours, up to 30 days. Slope Factor (SF) : An upper-bound estimate of cancer risk per increment of dose that can be used to estimate risk probabilities for different exposure levels. This estimate is generally used only in the low-dose region of the dose-response relationship; that is, for exposures corresponding to risks less than 1 in 100. A slope factor is usually expressed in units of cancer incidence per milligram of chemical per kilogram of body weight per day (per [mg/kg -day] or [mg/kg- day] -1). Statistical Significance: The probability that a result is not likely to be due to chance alone. By convention, a difference between two groups is usually considered statistically significant if chance could explain it only 5% of the time or less. Study design considerations may influence the a priori choice of a different level of statistical significance. Subchronic Duration: A period of more than 30 days, up to approximately 10% of the life span in humans (more than 30 days up to approximately 90 days in typically used mammalian laboratory animal species). Subchronic -to-Chronic Factor : See Uncertainty Factor . Target Organ: The biological organ(s) most adversely affected by exposure to a chemical or physical agent. Time -Weighted Average (TWA): In quantifying a measurement that varies o ver time, such as water intake, a time- weighted average takes measured intakes, which may occur at unevenly-spaced intervals, and multiplies each measurement by the length of its interval. These individual weighted values are then summed and divided by the total length of all of the individual intervals. The result is an average of all of the measurements, with each measurement carrying more or less weight in proportion to its size. Threshold: The dose or exposure below which no deleterious effect is expected to occur. Toxicity: Deleterious or adverse biological effects elicited by a chemical, physical, or biological agent. Toxicodynamics (TD): The determination and quantification of the sequence of events at the cellular and molecular levels leading to a toxic response to an environmental agent (sometimes referred to as pharmacodynamics and also MOA). Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 66 Toxicokinetics (TK): The determination and quantification of the time course of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals (sometimes referred to as pharmacokinetics). Uncertainty Factor (UF): One of several factors used in deriving a reference dose from experimental data. U Fs are intended to account for: Interspecies UF - the uncertainty in extrapolating from mammalian laboratory animal data to hu mans . This uncertainty factor is composed of two subfactors: one for toxicokinetics and one for toxicodynamics. Intraspecies Variability Factor - the variation in sensitivity among the members of the human population; Subchronic -to-Chronic Factor (Use of a less -than-chronic study for a chronic duration) - the uncertainty in extrapolating from effects observed in a shorter duration study to potential effects from a longer exposure; LOAEL- to-NOAEL (Use of a LOAEL rather than a NOAEL) - the uncertainty associated with using a study in which health effects were found a t all doses tested; and Database Uncertainty - the uncertainty ass ociated with deficiencies in availab le data. Uncertainty factors are normally expressed as full or half powers of ten, such as 10 0 (=1), 100.5 (3), and 101 (=10). All applicable uncertainty factors are multiplied together to yield a composite uncertainty factor for the RfD. Half -power values such as 100.5 are factored as whole numbers when they occur singly but as powers or logs when they occur in tandem (EPA 2002c). Therefore, a composite UF using values of 3 and 10 would be expressed as 30 (3\u00d710 1), wher eas a composite UF using values of 3 and 3 would be expressed as 10 (100.5 \u00d7 100.5 = 101). In keeping with the U.S. EPA RfC/RfD Technical Panel (EPA, 2002c ) recommendation and the rationale supporting it, MDH has not derived an HRL for any chemical if the product of all applicable uncertainty factors exceeds 3,000 (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820 , subpart . 21). Volatile: Volatility is the tendency of a substance to evaporate. Inhalation exposure to volatile chemicals in groundwater may be a health concern. Chemical characteristics that affect volatility include molecular weight, polarity, and water solubility. Typically, a chemical is considered volatile if it has a Henry's law constant greater than 3\u00d710 -7 atm- m3/mol. Chemicals are characterized as being nonvolatile, or being of low, medium, or high volatility as follows: Henry's Law constant < 3 \u00d710-7 atm-m3/mol = Law constant > 3 \u00d710-7 atm-m3/mol volatility Henry's Law \u00d710-5 Henry's Law constant >1 \u00d710-3 atm-m3/mol = high volatility Weight of Evidence (WOE) : An approach requiring a critical evaluation of the entire body of available data for consistency and biological plausibility. Potentially relevant Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 67 studies should be judged for quality and studies of high quality gi ven much more weig ht than those of lower quality.

Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 77 APPENDIX C : CONCEPTS USED IN MDH -DERIVED HRLs Described below are the basic principles that underlie MDH's risk algorithm adopted in 2009 (Minnesota Rules , part 4717.7830 , subpart 2) as stated in Section II.D. MDH used these methods to derive the HRL values that are included in the 2014/2015 proposed amendments. Detailed descriptions of these concepts are also available in MDH's 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2008. See Part IV). HRL rules employ two types of assessments. One assessment is for chemicals for which it is assumed that any dose of that chemical above zero carries some potential increased risk of cancer. These chemicals are identified as \"linear\" or \"non -threshold\" carcinogens. The second type of assessment is for evaluating non -cancer effects . This method can also be applied to address chemicals that have the potential to cause cancer through a \"non-linear\" mechanism. The assessment of a non-carcinogen or a non- linear carcinogen assumes that there is a threshold dose that must be exceeded before adverse health effects (including cancer) will develop. Toxicity Toxicity is one of the factors in determining HRL values . In evaluating the d ose and response, researchers seek to determine the lowest dose at which adverse effects are observed (the \"lowest observed adverse effect level,\" or LOAEL) and the highest dose at which no adverse effects are observed (the \"no observed adverse effect leve l,\" or NOAEL). Alternatively, researchers may statistically model the data to determine the dose expected to result in a response in a small percentage of the dosed animals (e.g., the benchmark dose, or BMD). The dose resulting from the dose- response evalu ation , also referred to as a point-of-departure (POD) dose, serves as the starting point for deriving health -protective concentrations for air, water and soil, collectively referred to as the \"environmental media.\" For effects other than cancer, the dose selected from the dose-response evaluation is divided by variability and uncertainty factors (UFs) to account for what is not known about a chemical's toxicity to a human population. The result, called a reference dose (RfD), is an estimate of a dose level that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse effects. An RfD is expressed in milligrams of chemical per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg -day). Understanding the relationship between the timing and duration of exposure and the subsequent adverse effect is essential in deriving criteria that are protective of sensitive life stages (e.g., development early in life) and short periods of high exposure (e.g., infancy). In A Review of the Reference Dose (RfD) and Reference Concentration (Rf C) Processes, U.S. EPA recommends the derivation of acute, short-term, subchronic, and chronic RfDs (EPA , 2002c ). In where sufficient toxicological information is available, MDH derives RfDs for the various time periods as defined by EPA. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 78 In evaluating the proposed nHRL values, MDH staff compiled and assessed the available toxicity information for the following durations of exposure: Acute: up to 24 hours Short-term: greater than 24 hours and up to 30 days Subchronic: greater than 30 days and up to 10% of a lifetime Chronic: greater than 10% of a lifetime. The current HRL methods not only list the specific effects occurring at the lowest effect dose, but also effects that occur at doses similar to the Lowest-Observed- Adverse Effect Level ( LOAEL), from other available toxicity studies. This provides more information to risk managers and can affect the results of an assessment when multiple chemicals are present (also see Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7880 ). Within each chemical's toxicology summary (see Appendix E), MDH has also indicated which chemicals are associated with endocrine effects and which chemicals have their greatest effects as a result of exposure in utero or during child development. Further, MDH notes whether the information reviewed for each chemical includes assessments of developmental, reproductive, immunological, endocrine, or neurological effects. This information is provided for each chemical in part to meet th e stipulations of the 2001 Health Standards Statute . For cancer HRLs, as stated in MDH 2008/2009 SONAR, \"it is usually assumed that any amount of exposure, no matter how small, potentially carries some risk. Derivations of HRLs based on the endpoint of c ancer for chemicals considered to be linear carcinogens do not, therefore, employ an RfD. Instead, Minnesota's long-standing public health policy is to derive values that limit the excess cancer risk to 1 in 100,000. Cancer potency is expressed as an upper bound estimate of cases of cancer expected from a dose of one milligram of substance per kilogram of body weight per day (i.e., cancer incidence per 1 mg/kg -day). From these estimates, a cancer potency slope, or \"slope factor\" (SF), can be calculated.\" (M DH, 2008). To derive a cancer HRL, MDH is required by the Groundwater Protection Act to use a cancer potency slope published by EPA. To account for the potential for increased cancer potency when exposure occurs early in life, MDH used methodology contained in the EPA Supplemental Guidance for Assessing Susceptibility from Early -Life Exposure to Carcinogens (EPA 2005a). This approach involves applying age- dependent cancer potency adjustment factors to three life stages. The adjustment factors and corresponding life stages are: a 10 -fold adjustment for individuals from birth to 2 years of age; a 3-fold adjustment for individuals from 2 to 16 years of age and no adjustment for individuals 16 years of age and older (MDH, 2008). For additional information about methodology for derivation of cancer HRLs, please see the 2008/2009 SONAR (MDH, 2008). Examples of sources of toxicity information that MDH considers in deriving HRL values include the following: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Reregistration Eligibility Decisions (REDs) from the Office of Pesticide Programs Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 79 The Health Effects Su pport Documents for Contaminant Candidate List Regulatory Determination from the Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) The National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) risk assessments Calif ornia EPA The Public Health Goal technical support documents from the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) Agenc y for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) toxicological profiles ; National Toxicology Program (NTP) study report and toxicity studies; Health Canada 's Priority Substances Assessment Program and Screening Assessment Reports European Commission chemical reviews European Commission Enterprise and Industry Chemicals European Food Safety Authority European Union Pesticide Database The World Health Or ganization's (WHO) Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents ; and Other published scientific literature. Intake Rates An intake rate (IR) is defined as the rate of ingestion of water (Minnesota Rules, part 4717. 7820 , subpart 14). In deriving HRL values , the RfD for non- cancer health effects is converted from milligrams per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg -day) to a water concentration in micrograms per liter of water (\u00b5g/L) by dividing by a water intake rate. IR is expressed as the quantity of water consumed in liters per kilogram of body weight per day (L/ kg-day). MDH staff calculated and used the following default time -weighted -average intake rates for default values are time- weighted averages based on the data reported in U.S. EPA 's Per Capita Report (EPA , 2004c) and a revised assessment for the Child- Specific Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA, 2007b). For linear carcinogens HRLs, as noted in the 2008/2009 SONAR, \"MDH has adopted EPA's approach for integrating age-dependent sensitivity adjustment factors and exposure information. The default intake rates corresponding to the age- dependent adjustment factor (ADAF) age groups used in deriving cancer HRLs are based on the TWA of the 95th percentile intake rate for each age range. The values are 0.137 L/kg -day Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 80 (up to 2 years of age), 0.047 L/kg-day (2 to up to 16 years of age), and 0.039 L/kg- day (16 years of age and older).\" The duration used to characterize lifetime cancer risk is 70 years, per EPA's practices (MDH, 2008). For additional information, please see the 2008/2009 MDH SONAR. The relative source contribution (RSC) was used to allocate a portion of the total daily RfD to exposure from ingestion of water. The balance of the RfD is reserved for other exposures, such as exposures from non-ingestion routes of exposure to water (e.g., inhalation of volatilized chemicals, dermal absorption) as well as exposures via other contaminated media such as food, air, and soil. Minnesota Statutes, section 103H.201, subdivision (1)(c), which establishes methods for deriving HRL values for chemicals other than linear (non-threshold) carcinogens, requires that an RSC be used. The RSC values used are based on the U.S. EPA Ambient Water Quality Criteria document (EPA , 2000c) and the consideration of chemical and physical properties of each chemical (e.g., volatility) as well as other potential sources of exposure. Based on qualitative evaluation and the U.S. EPA's Expos ure Decision Tree (EPA , 2000c), MDH used the following default RSC values: for nonvolatile, low and moderately volatile chemicals, an RSC of 50 percent (0.5) is used for the acute and short-term durations that use the intake rate for young infants ; for subchronic and chronic durations, 20 percent (0.2) is used . In contrast, for all durations for highly volatile chemicals, an RSC of 20 percent ( 0.2) is used because inhalation exposure would be a concern for any duration or age of exposure, including infan cy. The volatility classification for each chemical is determined by the following definition (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820 , subpart 1 1 \u00d7 10-3 Law constant > 1 \u00d7 10-3 atm-m3/mol Uncertainty Factors (UFs) To account for what is not known about a chemical's toxicity to a human population, uncertainty and variability factors are applied to threshold (non-linear) toxicants when deriv ing HRL values for non- cancer non-linear carcinogens. Once the dose level (e.g., NOAEL, LOAEL or BMD) has been selected as the point of departure (POD), it is then divided by uncertainty and/or variability factors to derive the RfD: (RfD) Dose Reference(UFs) Factorsy Variabilit andy Uncertaint(POD) Departure of Point = As risk -assessment methods have evolv ed, risk assessors consider the applying five uncertainty and variability factors. Each of these factors and guidelines for application are explained below: Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 81 Interspecies Extrapolation Factor -This factor accounts for the uncertainty or the difference between animals and humans when laboratory animal data are used as the source of the point of departure (POD). It is composed of two subfactors - toxicokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of the chemical) and toxicodynamics (the body's response to the chemical). Current practice is to use either chemical -specific toxicokinetic data or a data- based adjustment for toxicokinetics rather than an uncertainty factor for toxicokinetics. If there is no chemical -specific information regarding quantitative differences between laboratory animals and humans, a body- weight scaling adjustment based on EPA guidance (EPA 2011b) is used to calculate the Human Equivalent Dose or HED. Less information is typically available concerning the toxicodynamic portion of this factor. If no chemical -specific toxicodynamic information available, a default uncertainty factor of 3 is applied for the toxicodynamics. Chemical -specific information for either or both subparts may lead to a combined factor of greater tha n 10. If human data is the source of the POD then a factor of 1 may be used. Intraspecies Variability Factor - This factor accounts for the variation in sensitivity between individuals in the human populations (including life stages) and for the fact that some subpopulations might be more sensitive to the toxicological effects than the average population. As with the interspecies extrapolation factor, this factor is also composed of two subfactors - toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. If no information on human variability is available then a default value of 10 is used. If adequate information is available for either subfactor then this information is used along with a default factor of 3 for the remaining subfactor. If the POD is based on human data gather ed in the known sensitive subpopulations, a value of less than 10 (including 1) may be chosen. Subchronic- to-Chronic Extrapolation Factor - This factor accounts for the uncertainty in extrapolating from the effects observed in a shorter- duration study to potential effects of longer -duration exposure due to lack of adequate information in the dataset. In determining whether to apply this factor, MDH considers: 1) data indicating other, more sensitive, health effects as the duration of exposure increases, 2) data indicating that the critical effect(s) progress in severity as exposure duration increases, or 3) data indicating that the POD decreases in value as exposure duration increases. A default value of 10 is often applied to shorter-duration PODs to derive chronic values unless data suggest a lack of progression with increasing exposure duration. If data addresses only some of the considerations, a value of less than 10 (e.g., 3) may be used. LOAEL- to-NOAEL Extrapolation Factor - This factor accounts for the uncertainty in using a study in which even the lowest dose tested causes some adverse effect(s), and is in contrast to the preferred case where at least one of the administered doses caused no adverse effects. Since the RfD is considered to be a threshold value that protects against any adverse health effects, the LOAEL -to- Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 82 NOAEL factor is applied when the critical study(s) lacks information or the threshold/NOAEL cannot be determined with confidence (e.g., when LOAEL is used as a POD). The default value is 10, however, if the adverse effect observed is considered to be of minimal severity a default value of 3 may be appropriate. Database Uncertainty Factor - This factor accounts for uncertainty based on existing data or deficiencies in the available dataset, resulting in the potential for additional data to yield a lower reference value (EPA , 2004a) (i.e., additional studies may show the chemical to be more harmful). A high -confidence database would contain a minimum of two chronic bioassays testing sys tem toxicity by the appropriate route of exposure in different species, one 2-generation reproductive toxicity study, and two developmental toxicity studies in different species. A database UF is used when a potentially more sensitive health effect cannot be identified because the database is missing a particular type of study or the existing data suggest the potential for a health effect but the effect has not been adequately assessed. In general, a default factor of 10 is used if more than one particular type of study is missing. A value of 3 has been used if one particular type of study is missing (e.g., no 2-generation reproductive or developmental study). In the absence of chemical -specific information, each of the five factors is typically assigned a value between 1 and 10. Uncertainty factors are normally expressed as full or half powers of ten, such as 10 0 (=1), 100.5 (3), and 101 (=10). All applicable uncertainty factors are multiplied together to yield a composite uncertainty factor for the RfD. Half - power values such as 100.5 are factored as whole numbers when they occur singly but as powers or logs when they occur in tandem (EPA, 2002c). Therefore, a composite UF using values of 3 and 10 would be expressed as 30 (3\u00d710 1), whereas a composite UF using values of 3 and 3 would be expressed as 10 (100.5 \u00d7 100.5 = 101). In keeping with the U.S. EPA RfC/RfD Technical Panel (EPA , 2002c ) recommendation and the rationale supporting it, MDH has not derived an HRL for any chemical if the product of all applicable uncertainty factors exceeds 3,000 (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820 , subpart 21). Chemicals with higher total uncertainty factors are not necessarily more toxic than chemicals with lower total uncertainty factors. The use of a larger total uncertainty factor only means that there is less information available about the toxicity of the chemical. MDH Health Risk Limit Algorithm s As no ted in Section I I.D., MDH uses formulas called \"algorithms,\" to derive HRL values. The formulae and explanation of components are described below: Non Cancer HRL s (nHRL s) The algorithm for nHRLs is: Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 83 durationduration durationIR1,000 RSC RfDnHRL\u00d7 \u00d7= Where: cancer health risk limit (nHRL), for a given duration, expressed in units of micrograms of a chemical per liter of water (\u00b5g/L) (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820, subpart 13). RfD duration = the referenc e dose (RfD) for a given duration, expressed in units of milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg -day). The following default durations are used: (i) acute - a period of 24 hours or less; (ii) short- term - a period of more than 24 hours, up to 30 days; (iii) subchronic - a period of more than 30 days, up to approximately 10% of the life span in humans; or (iv) chronic - a period of more than approximately 10% of the life span in humans (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820, subpart 9 and 21). RSC = the relative source contribution (RSC) factor which represents the percentage of total exposure to a substance or chemical that is allocated to ingestion of water. MDH uses the U.S. EPA Exposure Decision Tree (U.S. EPA, 2000) to select appropriate RSCs, ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. The default RSC is 20 percent (0.2) for highly volatile chemicals. For other chemicals, the default RSC is 50 percent (0.5) for acute and short-term HRL values and 20 percent (0.2) for subchronic or chronic HRL values (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820, subpart 22). In some cases, a chemical - specific RSC is applied. For example a value of 0.8 has been used for pharmaceuticals when, for persons not using the pharmaceutical, no other route of exposure other than drinking water is likely. 1,000 = a factor used to convert milligrams (mg) to micrograms (\u00b5g) (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7830, subpart 2, item D). IR duration = the intake rate (IR) of ingestion of water, or simply the amount of water, on a per body weight basis, ingested on a daily basis (liters per kg body weight per day or L/kg-day). The default IR corresponds to the time-weighted average (TWA) of the 95 th percentile intake rate during the relevant duration: acute and short - term - 0.289 L/kg-day, based on intake for 1 up to 3 months of age; subchronic - 0.077 L/kg -day, based on a TWA up to 8 years of age; and chronic - 0.043 L/kg -day, based on a TWA over a lifetime of approximately 70 years (Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7820, subpart 14). MDH departed from the above default HRL algorithm and parameter values if sufficient chemical -specific information indicated that a different duration or intake rate was more appropriate. In these cases, a time- weighted intake rate was calculated over the duration specified by the chemical -specific information. The RfD, RSC and IR values used in deriving each nHRL for chemicals included in the 2012 proposed rules are presented in Section IV .B. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 84 As indicated in the risk algorithm, the magnitude of the HRL value is a function of the RfD and the IR. In general, for a given chemical, the shorter-duration RfD values will be higher than the longer-duration RfD values because the human body can usually tolerate a higher dose when the duration of the dose is short, even if that same dose would be harmful when it occurs over a longer duration. It is possible, however, that the RfD for a shorter duration is similar to, or in rare cases lower, than the RfD for a longer duration. This could occur for various reasons such as if a short duration was sufficient to elicit the same adverse effect found in longer-duration study; or if the health effect assessed only in the shorter-duration study occurred at a lower dose than the effect assessed in the longer-duration study; or if the life stage or species assessed only in the shorter -duration study was more sensitive to the toxicant than the life stage or species assessed in the longer - duration study. The intake rate also affects the magnitude of the HRL value. As described above, the shorter-duration intake rates are higher than the longer- term intake rates. These higher intake rates combined with the RfD may produce a shorter- duration HRL that is less than the calculated longer -duration HRL. When this occurs, the longer-dur ation HRL is set equal to the lower, shorter-duration HRL. This ensures that the HRL for a longer duration is protective of higher shorter-term intakes that occur within the longer- duration. In instances where the calculated longer -duration HRL value is s et at the shorter -duration HRL value, the health endpoints identified will include the health endpoints specified for the shorter-duration, and may include additional health endpoints. These additional health endpoints are included if they are associated with longer-duration exposure to drinking water concentrations similar in magnitude to the shorter -duration HRL. In accordance with the general rule for calculations involving multiplication or division, HRL values are rounded to the same number of signifi cant figures as the least precise parameter used in their calculation (EPA , 2000c). As a result, the HRL values are rounded to one significant figure. MDH rounded the values as the final step in the calculation (see chemical -specific summary sheets in Appendix E). The example below shows the derivation of the short- term nHRL value for carbon tetrachloride , using the algorithm for nHRLs : nHRL duration x (RSC) (Conversion , L/kg/d) Short- term (1000 \u00b5 g/mg) L/kg- d) = 2.6 rounded to 3 \u00b5 g/L The next example below shows the derivation of the subchronic nHRL (nHRL) for carbon tetrachloride: Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 85 Subchronic NHRL = (0.0098 mg/kg/d) x (0.2) x (1000 \u00b5 (0.077 L/kg- d) = 25 rounded to 30 \u00b5g/L The calculated subchronic nHRL (30 \u00b5g/L) is greater than carbon tetrachloride's short- term HRL value of 3 \u00b5g/L (see the chemical -specific summary sheets in Appendix E for details). Since the subchronic HRL must be protective of the short-term exposures that occur within the subchronic period, the subchronic nHRL is set equal to the short- term nHRL value. Hence, the subchronic nHRL value for carbon tetrachloride is set equal to 3 \u00b5g/L. The health endpoints include the hepatic and immune system. In this case: Subchronic Non- Cancer Health Risk Limit (nHRL subchronic) = nHRL short -term = 3 \u00b5g/L Notes RfDs and uncertainty adjustments are derived by MDH, unless otherwise noted. The RfDs and the endpoints are usually based on animal studies but may be based on human studies. RfDs are based on human equivalent dose (HED) calculated from the point of departure in the selected animal studies. HED is the human dose (for other than the inhalation routes of exposure) of an agent that is believed to induce the same magnitude of toxic effect as the experimental animal species dose (MDH, 2011). A health endpoint designation of \"none\" is used when a general adverse effect (e.g., decreased adult body weight) cannot be attributed to a specific organ system. The duration- specific nHRL value is derived using the following equation as previously stated in Section II.D. and specified in Minnesota Rules, part 4717.7830, subp 2: The terms used in this section are explained in the Glossary (see Appendix A). Cancer HRLs: For the derivation of cancer HRLs for linear carcinogens, MDH applied the age- dependent cancer potency adjustment factors and corresponding intake rates to the default HRL algorithm for cancer: [ ] years < < < <\u00d7 \u00d7 = Where: Minnesota Department of Health Rules on Health Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 86 cHRL = the cancer health risk limit expressed in units of micrograms of chemical per liter of water (g/L). (1\u00d710-5) = the additional cancer risk level. 1,000 = a factor used to convert milligrams (mg) to micrograms (g). SF = the cancer slope factor for adult exposure, expressed in units of the inverse of millig rams per kilogram of body weight per day ([cancer incidence per mg/kg -day] or [mg/kg- day]-1). ADAF = the age -dependent adjustment factor for each age group: 10, for up to 2 years of age (ADAF <2); 3, for 2 up to 16 years of age (ADAF 2<16); and 1, for 16 years of age and older (ADAF 16+). ADAFs are default adjustments to the cancer slope factor that recognize the increased susceptibility to cancer from early life exposures to linear carcinogens. They are incorporated into the denominator of the cancer HRL equation. IR = the intake rate for each age group: 0.137 L/kg-day, for up to 2 years of age (IR <2); 0.047 L/kg-day, for 2 up to 16 years of age (IR 2<16); and 0.039 L/kg -day, for 16 years of age and older (IR 16+). D = the duration for each age group: 2 years, for up to 2 years of age (D <2); 14 years, for 2 up to 16 years of age (D 2<16); and 54, for 16 years of age and older (D 16+). 70 years = the standard lifetime duration used by U.S. EPA in the characterization of lifetime cancer risk. MDH depart s from the above default HRL algorithm if sufficient information is available to derive a chemical -specific lifetime adjustment factor (AF lifetime ). In these cases a time- weighted intake rate over a lifetime is applied, resulting in the following equation: daykgL lifetimemgg 5 = the additional cancer risk level. 1,000 = a factor used to convert milligrams (mg) to micrograms (g). SF = adult -exposure based cancer slope factor. AF lifetime = the lifetime adjustment factor based on chemical -specific data. 0.043 L/kg -day = 95th percentile water intake rate representative of a lifetime period. Additional explanations of the concepts used in deriving the HRL values are available in MDH's 2008 SONAR , Part IV (MDH, 2008).

Not classified as a carcinogen by IARC, U.S. FDA, NTP, U.S. EPA or California OEHHA Volatile: No Summary of Guidance Value History: Health -based guidance values for acetaminophen were published in 2011. Acetaminophen was re- evaluated in 2014 to incorporate more recent toxicity information. The re- evaluation did not result in quantitative changes; therefore, the 2014 HBVs are identical to the 2011 guidance values. The re- evaluation did provide some additional information regarding health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute (see below). Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 Yes5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might b e available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based o n the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 Thyroid hyperplasia was reported in a 2- yr dietary study in mice at human equivalent doses approximately 150 times higher than the chronic RfD of 0.093 mg/kg -day. No effects on thyroid Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 92 hormones were found in a small short- term study in humans at a dose over 170 times higher than the short-term RfD or in mice at a dose 26 times higher than the short-term RfD. One epidemiology study reported a weak association between increased risk of cryptorchidism in offspring of mothers who used acetaminophen during pregnancy. Thyroid was identified as a co- critical endpoint for the chronic duration; however, the chronic HBV was set to the short -term value and, therefore, is considered protective for possible thyroid effects. In vitro studies reported decreased testosterone production in fetal rat and adult human testes exposed to acetaminophen but no effects on fetal testosterone pr oduction by human fetal testes in vitro . In human fetal testes explants, decreased insulin -like factor 3 (INSL3) levels were reported. The biological relevance of in vitro testes studies is unknown and testosterone effects for acetaminophen have not been evaluated in vivo . In humans taking oral contraceptives, acetaminophen may increase circulating ethinylestradiol after ingestion of a single acetaminophen dose (approximately 14 mg/kg -day or approximately 50 times higher than the acute, short -term and subchronic RfDs and 150 times higher than the chronic RfD). Acetaminophen was negative in mouse and rat uterotrophic assays at human equivalent doses greater than 600 times higher than the acute/short- term RfDs. 2 A limited number of animal studies have rep orted that acetaminophen suppressed humoral and cellular immunity at doses that were either toxic to the liver or over 150 times higher than the RfDs. Acetaminophen was associated with suppression of serum neutralizing antibody response, increased nasal symptoms, and a rise in circulating monocytes in human volunteers infected with intranasal rhinovirus type 2 in a small double-blind, placebo-controlled human clinical trial at doses over 200 times higher than the RfDs. Acetaminophen may cause bronchoconstri ction in individuals with aspirin -induced asthma at doses more than 50 times higher than the RfDs. There are conflicting epidemiology data regarding a possible association with prenatal or early life exposure to acetaminophen and childhood asthma. The most common limitation in these epidemiology studies was the lack of control for \"indication for use\" (i.e. infection, fever, or illness may have been important confounders that were not considered and data was not adjusted accordingly) and doses were not adequately characterized. 3Multiple human studies have reported no increase in developmental effects from acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the overall weight-of- evidence suggests that acetaminophen is not a developmental toxicant in humans. There are conflicting human data regarding associations between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and risk of gastroschisis in offspring. No other malformation has been shown to be causally associated with single -ingredient acetaminophen. Recent human studies repor ted possible weak associations between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and increased risk of asthma, increased risk of autistic disorder from acetaminophen use after measles -mumps -rubella vaccination; and increased risk of cryptorchidism (undescended te stes) in offspring. At the present time there is insufficient evidence for a casual association and further studies are needed before these recent findings can be linked to acetaminophen. Experimental animal studies do not suggest increased malformations from therapeutic use of acetaminophen during pregnancy. One laboratory animal study reported decreased body weight gain in offspring and decreased survival of offspring at a human equivalent dose over 500 times higher than the acute RfD. In another study, effects on survival and body weight gain in offspring, persisting to adulthood, and sperm abnormalities occurred at human equivalent doses approximately 200 times higher than the acute and short -term RfDs. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 93 4 No effects on pregnancy or offspring were reported in several laboratory animal studies at human equivalent doses up to over 500 times higher than the acute and short-term RfDs. In a continuous breeding animal study, effects on reduced fertility and reproduction were observed at human equivalent dose 800 times higher than the acute and short- term RfDs. 5Acetaminophen is not considered to be a neurotoxicant based on lack of secondary observations in animal studies. In laboratory animals, clinical neurotoxicity symptoms were reported only at very high doses over 1,700 times higher than the RfDs. No effects were reported at doses 1,000 times higher than the RfDs. An acute subcutaneous injection study in neonatal animals reported altered locomotor activity and failure to acquire spatial learning in adulthood; however, the relevance of injection studies for oral exposure is questionable. A few epidemiology studies reported associations between acetaminophen during pregnancy and higher risk of hyperkinetic disorders, ADHD medication use, and ADHD- like behaviors, decreased motor skill development, communication skills, and externalizing or internalizing behaviors in children. One epidemiology study reported no association between exposures during pregnancy and IQ or attention deficits in children. However, the se epidemiology studies have several limitations, including lack of dose characterization, and cannot be used to establish a causal relationship between acetaminophen use and neurotoxicity in humans.

Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes1 Yes2 Yes3 Yes4 Yes5 Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 108 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researcher s identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 Endocrine effects have been seen only at very high doses. Decreased testosterone and serum prolactin level and alterations in thyroid hormone levels in have been reported in laboratory animals at doses 2,000 times higher than the current short- term reference dose. Alterations in the adrenal gland have also been reported in a chronic drinking water study in rats at doses over 1,000 times higher than the chronic reference dose. 2 Immunotoxicity of acrylamide has been directly tested in two recent short- term s tudies. For acrylamide exposure to compromise immune system function, a very high dose of approximately 1,000 times higher than the current short -term reference dose was needed. At 100 times the current short- term reference dose, subtle changes in lymphocyte populations in the serum were detected. Immunotoxicity has also been indirectly tested during the chronic 2- year cancer studies, and no secondary observations have been noted on immune function in these three high quality long- term studies. 3 Devel opmental effects include increased resorptions/implantation losses, reduced pup body weight, altered behavior activities and decreased learning ability, and changes in the brains of young rodents. Neurotoxicity is among the more sensitive developmental eff ects and has been reported at doses 100-500 times greater than the short -term reference dose. 4 The short -term reference dose is based on reproductive toxicity in males (increased pre- and post- implantation losses, decreased live pups per litter, increased resorptions, decreased sperm count, abnormal sperm and decreased breeding success). Two -fold h igher doses cause reproductive effects in females (body weight gain decreases and loss of hind limb use during gestation). 5 Neurotoxicity, in the form of nerve degeneration and damage, is the critical effect for subchronic and chronic water guidance. Two to three-fold higher doses also caused other types of neurotoxicity in rodents such as altered hind limb use, head tilting, and difficulty learning. Developmental neurotoxicity has also been shown to occur at doses 100-500 times greater than the short- term reference dose (discussed above).

However, alterations in thyroid organ weights have been noted and serve as the basis for the chronic RfD. A database uncertainty factor was incorporated into the acute, short -term and subchronic RfDs to address the need for additional studies regarding thyroid function. 2 The acute and short -term RfDs are based on developmental effects such as post -implantation losses, fetal resorptions, and decreased pup body weights. Delays in ossification of multiple areas of the skeleton have also been described. Decreased pup body weight and body w eight gains were also reported in animals dosed with up to 1500 times the short term RfD. One study reported animals experiencing partial abortions, embryonic resorptions, and no living fetuses at doses more than 5000 times the short term RfD. 3 One male reproductive study in mice found no effects on spermatogenesis. The short- term RfD is based on incidence of postimplantation loss and fetal resorptions in animals dosed with bentazon. At 400 times the short-term RfD, animals had 100% postimplantation loses . There was a higher incidence of embryonic and fetal resorptions in animals treated with 300 times the short- term RfD. 4 Neurotoxicity has not directly been studied for bentazon. Secondary observations in an animal study included sedation, ataxia and tremors at a dose more than 1500 times the subchronic RfD.

In 1998, a chronic nHBV of 300 g/L was derived. In 2012, new nHBVs were developed for acute (300 g/L), short -term (300 g/L) and subchronic (100 g/L) durations and the chronic nHBV was lowered to (100 g /L). In 2014, BPA was re- evaluated. The acute HBV was removed, the short -term value decreased to 100 g/L and the subchronic/chronic nHBVs Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 120 decreased to 20 g/L based upon 1) a re -evaluation of the toxicity data with inclusion of more recent information, and (2) new life- stage toxicokinetic information that resulted in revised dose -adjustment factors (DAFs). Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 Yes5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might b e available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based o n the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1Unconjugated (free) BPA is a well -known endocrine- active substance and has been extensively studied. BPA is metabol ized quickly in the liver to an endocrine -inactive form (i.e., glucuronide conjugate) that is rapidly excreted in human urine. The estrogenic potency of free BPA is more than 1,000- fold lower than estrogens and BPA has a weaker binding affinity to classical hormone receptors than endogenous hormones. Estrogen, testosterone and thyroid hormone levels and hormone receptor results from laboratory animal studies at doses below 5 mg/kg -d have been inconsistent and contradictory. However, study design limitation s, dose-response interpretation issues, inconsistencies in results and conflicting data in the low dose region exists. The RfDs are considered protective for endocrine effects in humans, in part, because humans and non- human primates efficiently metabolize BPA to its endocrine- inactive conjugate which is rapidly excreted in the urine. In a rodent study assessing effects resulting from early life ( in utero and direct dosing for 3 months after birth) changes in estradiol, thyroid hormone, progesterone and pro lactin levels were reported only at doses more than 3,000- fold higher than the RfDs presented above. No effects were reported on FSH or LH at doses 30,000 times higher than the subchronic RfD. Effects on serum levels of sex hormone ratios are considered as co-critical effects for the short-term duration. 2 Immunotoxicity of BPA has not been thoroughly evaluated, but a limited number of studies evaluating either direct or in utero exposure to BPA using non-standard test methods suggest that BPA may interfe re with immune homeostasis (cytokine activity, macrophage activity, tumor necrosis factor secretion, and T- cell activity). Several studies found no effect on adult spleen or thymus weights or histopathology of adult immune organs but one study reported spleen and thymus atrophy at a dose 4,500 times higher than the short- term RfD. BPA is a skin sensitizer in humans exposed dermally but there is no clear evidence that BPA interferes with overall immune system function. In general, doses more than 90 times hi gher than the short-term RfD and more than 2,000 times higher than the subchronic/chronic RfDs are required to elicit a significant immune response. A few studies reported immune -related cellular effects at lower doses, including increased IgG1, IL-4, and various splenocyte T -cell populations at doses more than 6 times higher than the subchronic RfD. Inconsistent results have been reported for IgG2a, interferon- , and splenic cell numbers. These low dose cellular- level effects have not been associated with adverse functional immune outcomes related to enhancement or suppression of response to pathogens and the biological significance is uncertain. Database limitations and uncertainties regarding available immune system data were considered in the derivation of the RfDs. The spleen, an immune system organ, was Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 121 identified as a co -critical developmental additivity endpoint based on transient organ weight effects in weanling animals. 3The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has identified the brain, behavior, and prostate as developmental endpoints of \"some concern\" for fetuses, infants, and children. In other words, NTP considers there are insufficient data from human studies to support possible effects on the brain, behavior and the prostate; however, limited evidence in some animal studies cannot be dismissed. NTP concluded that the significance of the limited data from animal studies to humans is unknown at this time. See footnote #5 below for information about neurodevelopmental effects for brain and behavior. A few reports suggest that BPA exposure during gestation and infancy may increase susceptibility to prostate cancer, mammary cancer, impact mammary gland development, or contribute to metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes) later in life; however, current data are inadequate to determine whether BPA exposure in early life leads to cancer or metabolic disease in adulthood. A statistically significant increase in mammary gland ductal hyperplasia, a potential indicator of mammary gland development, was r eported in rats at a dose over 30,000 times higher than the chronic RfD. The biological significance of this finding will not be known until results from an ongoing chronic study become available. Delayed puberty in male and female animals has been reported, although a recent large-scale study in rats found no effects on pubertal onset, except for delayed testes descent reported at a dose over 1,000 times higher than the short - term RfD. Developmental effects are considered as critical and co -critical effects for the short -term duration RfD and uncertainties related to neurobehavioral effects and metabolic disease are addressed in the derivation of the RfDs using a database uncertainty factor. 4 Female reproductive effects, including decreased numbers of lit ters per breeding pair and changes in hormone ratios, are considered co- critical effects in the derivation of the short -term RfD. Estrous cycle effects were reported at doses 450 times higher than the short -term RfD and over 11,000 times higher than the subchronic/chronic RfDs. Male reproductive effects were reported in adult animals and included multinucleated giant cells in seminiferous tubules, reduced spermatogenesis in pubertal animals and various reproductive organ weight effects (testes, prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis). Reports of BPA effects on sperm parameters and testosterone are inconsistent. Male and female reproductive effects are considered as co -critical effects for the derivation of the short- term RfD. 5 NTP has identified the brain and behavior as endpoints of \"some concern\" for fetuses, infants and children. This means that there are insufficient data from human studies, but limited evidence of potential neurotoxicity in some animal studies cannot be dismissed, although significance to humans is unknown. Experimental evidence in a well-conducted developmental neurotoxicity study in rats does not support brain developmental neuropathological changes in offspring exposed via maternal dietary doses up to 700 times higher than the short -term RfD. Low dose (defined as doses < 5 mg/kg-d) gestational and/or neonatal exposures have been reported to cause various neurodevelopmental effects in offspring in a variety of studies. Some studies suggest possible effects of early life exposure on various sexually dimorphic behaviors, changes in maternal behaviors nursing and nesting behaviors, anxiety, aggression and learning performance resulting from doses below the short- term RfD; however, there has been a lack of consistency, reproducibility and a variety of study design or reporting limitations in existing data. Several brain morphology studies with various methodological flaws and/or using routes of exposure that are not relevant for evaluating the oral route (e.g., injection studies) have reported effects on various biochemical and neurotransmitter gene expression changes in brain tissues. Developmental neurobehavioral endpoints were identified as areas of data uncertainty in the derivation of acute and short- term RfDs/HBVs. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 122 Acute or shor t-term exposure to adult animals has resulted in nervous system effects in some studies including piloerection, decreased locomotor activity, sedation, lethargy, arched back, and vocalization. These effects occurred at high gavage doses that were over 700 times higher than the short -term RfD. One study reported decreased serum cholinesterase in female rats exposed to a dose that was about 900 times higher than the short -term RfD, but this effect has not been evaluated in other studies and the biological significance is unknown.

Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 No5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 Potential estrogen activity of BBP and the major BBP metabolites MBuP and MBeP has been investigated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Only weak estrogen activity at high concentrations/doses of BBP was reported. Some epidemiology studies have identified associations between phthalate exposure and changes in reproductive development in newborn boys. However, these effects were not consistently observed and studies were generally accompanied by multiple confounding factors such that it is not possible to draw conclusions. Multiple studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated antiandrogen -like activity of BBP and its major metabolites. Indicators of antiandrogenic activity include reduced anogenital distance, areolas in neonatal males, reduced testicular weight, and disrupted testicular migration following in utero and lactational exposure. Decreased pup body weight and serum levels of thyroid hormones in developing laboratory animals exposed to BBP in utero and via lactation have been reported at dose levels below those causing male reproductive developmental effects. Decreased body weight and changes in thyroid hormone levels are identified as critical effects and form the basis of the RfD. 2 Several mechanistic toxicological studies and epidemiological studies have been conducted to evaluate immunotoxicity, mainly on other phthalates (e.g., DEHP). The mechanistic studies typically utilized topical or subcutaneous injection as the route of exposure. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association with PVC -related exposure and asthma. Limited studies specifically evaluating immunologic effects have been conducted in laboratory animals. No significant immune suppression or enhancement was observed in rats treated with 0.6, 1.2 or 2.4% BBP for up to 12 months. Limited studies on a related phthalate, DEHP, suggest that immunological effects could occur at a similar order of magnitude dose as those causing male developmental effects. It is anticipated that the RfD for BBP will be protective of male developmental effects as well as immunological effects. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 141 3 Some epidemiology studies have identified an association between phthalate exposure and male reproductive and neurobehavioral development. However, effects were not consistently observed and further studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn. Studies in laboratory animals have identified the male reproductive system, particularly in during the developmental stage, to be a target for the toxicity of BBP. Decreased pup body weight and serum levels of thyroid hormones in developing laboratory animals exposed to BBP in utero and via lactation have been reported at dose levels below those causing male reproductive developmental effects. Decreased body weight and changes in thyroid hormone levels are identified as critical effects and form the basis of the RfD. The developmental effects of the to the effects observed after exposure to BBP, suggesting that MBP and MBzP may be responsible for the developmental effects of BBP. 4 BBP and its major metabolites (MBP & MBzP) have been found to adversely affect the reproductive organs in experimental animal studies which may impact fertility. The developmental period is a sensitive life stage to the male reproductive effects of BBP. Main effects reported include a decrease reproductive organ weights, damage to the testis, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicle and to reduced sperm concentrations, and at higher BBP doses reduced fertility, in addition to increases in relative liver and kidney weights. Decreases in pup body weight and changes in serum thyroid hormone levels, the basis of the RfD, occurred at dose level lower than those associated with male reproductive developmental effects. 5 Some epidemiological studies have reported associations between maternal phthalat es and metabolites and neurobehavioral changes in offspring. Two 2-generational studies conducted in laboratory animals have assessed neurological endpoints. Neither study reported evidence of neurological impairment. A related phthalate, DBP, has also bee n evaluated for neurodevelopmental effects and no neurobehavioral impairment was observed.

There are no positive studies of orally ingested cadmium suitable for quantitation. Source of slope factor: N/A Tumor site(s): N/A Volatile: No Summary of Guidance Value History: The 2014 acute HBV for cadmium (5 ug/L) is slightly higher than the 1993 Health Risk Limit (HRL) of 4 ug/L. The reasons it is higher are: 1) use of more recent toxicity information; and 2) rounding to one significant digit. The 2014 chronic HBV for cadmium (0.5 Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 150 ug/L) is eight times lower than the 1993 Health Risk Limit (HRL) of 4 ug/L. The subchronic and short- term noncancer HBVs are 4 times lower. The reasons that the 2014 HBVs for the short -term, subchronic, and chronic durations are lower than the 1993 H RL are: 1) use of more recent toxicity information; 2) use of more recent intake rates that account for higher exposures during early life; and 3) rounding to one significant digit. Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 Yes5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researcher s identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 In female animals treated with cadmium at levels at least 400 times the subchronic RfD, decreases of estradiol, FSH, LH, and progesterone were observed. 2 Immune effects have been observed in some studies, but not in others. In mice exposed to cadmium at doses more than 100 times the short- term RfD immunosuppression has been noted, but the mechanism is unclear. In a second study, mice exposed to cadmium 125 times higher than the short-term RfD showed enhanced T -lymphocyte- independent responses and suppressed T -lymphocyte-dependent responses. Thes e responses may be due to a compensatory mechanism that is part of humoral immunity. Although one study showed that cadmium at doses 250 times higher than the short term RfD increased mortality from an infectious agent, a second study with a dose 2,000 times the short term RfD failed to show altered resistance to an infectious agent. A primate study showed that cadmium stimulated cell -mediated immunity at a dose of more than 2,000 times the short term RfD. 3 Developmental effects form the basis for the acu te, short-term, and subchronic RfDs. While neurological effects in animals exposed in utero forms the basis of the short- term RfD, adverse skeletal effects in rapidly growing animals forms the basis of the acute and subchronic RfDs. Multiple studies reported reduced fetal body weight and size as well as an increase in skeletal malformations in pups exposed in utero to cadmium at levels at least 30 times higher than the acute RfD. Other developmental effects such as fetal resorptions and delayed ossification were noted from 300 to over 5000 times the acute RfD. 4 Epidemiology studies have been conducted examining the effect of cadmium on male and female reproductive toxicity. The results have been inconsistent. Although two studies showed a relationship between male sex hormone levels and cadmium, others did not. The relationship between sperm quality and serum cadmium levels is also not clear. While one study reported a decrease in sperm quality with Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 151 increased blood cadmium level, two others did not. Data on reproductive toxicity in women is limited. Among infertile women, no association between cadmium body burden and the risk of endometriosis was observed. Elevated urine cadmium levels have been associated with an increased time to pregnancy. A number of animal studies have also demonstrated reproductive effects, but at very high dose levels greater than 3,000 times the acute RfD. 5 Neurotoxicity following in utero exposure is the basis of the short -term RfD. In some animal studies, effects have been reported at doses 50 times the chronic RfD. Other studies have reported neurological effects in rats exposed to cadmium at doses thousands of times higher than the short -term RfD. The effects have included impacts on grooming, learning, movement, rearing, behavior, hearing, and vision. References: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) - MRLs.

Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 159 Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 No5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researcher s identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 Some epidemiology studies have identified associations between phthalate exposure and changes in thyroid and reproductive hormones. However, these effects were not consistently observed and studies were generally accompanied by multiple confounding factors such that it is not possible to draw conclusions. In vitro studies evaluating pituitary cell proliferation and thyroid receptor interactions suggest that DBP may impact thyroid function. The relevance of the in vitro effects to in vivo is unclear. Poten tial DBP thyroid effects following in vivo exposure have not been evaluated. Changes in thyroid hormone serum levels were identified as sensitive effects following butyl benzyl phthalate exposure in laboratory animals. The lack of thyroid studies on DBP is part of the rationale for incorporating a database uncertainty factor into the derivation of the RfD. In studies conducted in laboratory animals changes in FSH, LH and PRL have also been reported but effects were not consistent across doses or time points of evaluation. Disruption of fetal testes steroidogenesis was been identified as a sensitive effect and forms the basis for the RfD. 2 Several mechanistic toxicological studies and epidemiological studies have been conducted, mainly on other phthalates (e.g., DEHP). The mechanistic studies typically utilized topical or subcutaneous injection as the route of exposure. Epidemiological studi es have suggested an association with PVC - related exposure and asthma. Laboratory animal studies on DEHP suggest immunological effects at doses of similar magnitude to those causing male reproductive developmental effects. The need for immunological study of DBP is part of the rationale for incorporating a database uncertainty factor into the derivation of the RfD. 3 Some epidemiology studies have identified an association between phthalate exposure and male reproductive and neurobehavioral development. However, effects were not consistently observed and results from these studies are generally accompanied by multiple confounding factors such that it is not possible to draw definite conclusions. Studies in laboratory animals have identified a variety of developmental effects following exposure to DBP. Disruption of fetal testicular development has been identified as a sensitive effect. Increased malformations and decreased offspring viability were observed at higher doses, doses ~10 to 20 -fold higher than those associated with fetal testicular development. The sensitive effects of fetal testicular development and steroidogenesis form the basis of the RfD.

However, effects were not consistently observed and these studies are generally accompanied by multiple confounding factors such that it is not possible to draw conclusions. Studies in laboratory animals have identified a variety of male reproductive effects, including testicular effects and decreased fertility. The fetal male reproductive system is more sensitive than the mature male reproductive system following exposure to DBP. Fetal male reproductive effects form the basis of the RfD. 5 Some epidemiological studies have identified an association between phthalate exposure and changes in neurobehavioral development. However, these studies are generally accompanied by multiple confounding factors such that it is not possible to draw defini tive conclusions. Neurodevelopmental studies have been conducted in laboratory animals. Neurobehavioral impairment was not observed. References: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2001).

Cancer Health Based Value (cHBV) = 7 \u00b5g/L = (Additional Lifetime Cancer Risk) x (Conversion Factor) [(SF x ADAF <2 yr x IR <2yr x (SF x ADAF 2-<16 yr x IR 2-<16yr x 14) + ADAF 16+ yr x IR 16+yr x 54)] / 70 x (1000 ug/mg) [(0.014 x 10 x 0.137 L/kg- d x 2) + (0.014 x 3 x 0.047 L/kg- d x 14) + (0.014 x 1 x 0.039 L/kg- d x 54)] / 70 = 7.3 rounded to 7 \u00b5g/L Cancer classification: Group B2, probable human carcinogen Slope factor: 0.014 (mg/kg- d)-1 (laboratory animal) (NTP, 1982) Source of slope factor: EPA 1993 Tumor site(s): Liver Volatile: No Summary of Guidance Value History: The 2013 noncancer HBVs (20 g/L) for acute, short -term, and subchronic durations are new. There is a 2009 HRL MCL of 6 g/L based on the US EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). There was a pr evious 1993/94 cancer HRL of 20 g/L (based on liver cancer and an oral slope factor of 0.014 from IRIS 1991). The 2013 can cer HBV (7 g/L) is slightly higher than the 2009 MCL -based chronic HBV (6 g/L) due to: 1) utilization of more recent lifetime intake rates which incorporate higher intake rates during early life; 2) application of age -dependent early -life cancer sensitiv ity adjustment factors; and 3) rounding to one significant digit. Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Tested? Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 172 Endocrine Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protectiv e of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 It is well documented in an extensive number of laboratory animal studies that DEHP is anti-androgenic, causing decreases in fetal testosterone at critical wind ows of male reproductive development in utero, leading to postnatal male reproductive organ malformations. The effect of DEHP and/or metabolites on testosterone and thyroid hormone levels in humans have been studied in several epidemiology studies with conflicting results. In animal studies, thyroid hormones have been affected at doses over 3,000 times higher than the RfD. DEHP does not appear to have estrogenic effects in animals or humans. Endocrine effects, based on anti-androgenic responses, are identif ied as co -critical effects. 2In humans, associations between inhalation of phthalate dust, including DEHP, and asthma- like symptoms have been reported in some epidemiology studies; however, there are no reported associations between oral exposure and asthma or allergy in humans. Low doses of phthalates have affected antibodies in animal studies only when given by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, but not by oral ingestion. No developmental immune effects were found in offspring at doses over 2,000 times higher than the RfDs. S pleen and thymus weights were decreased in offspring exposed prenatally to doses over 800 times higher than the RfD. 3As an anti -androgen, DEHP inhibits the normal biological effects of androgens (male sex hormones). This interference results in alteratio ns in normal male sexual development. Interference at different stages of life can alter fetal, neonatal, and adolescent (puberty) development, based on laboratory animal studies. In humans, the effects of DEHP and/or metabolites on neurobehavioral development, male reproductive and pubertal development have been reported in several epidemiology studies with conflicting results. Developmental effects on the male reproductive system are identified as critical effects and provide the basis for the RfDs. 4Repr oductive system effects of DEHP and/or metabolites in humans, including effects on male fertility, have been reported in several epidemiology studies with conflicting results. Male reproductive system effects are identified as critical effects based on lab oratory animal studies and provide the basis for the RfDs. 5Neurobehavioral developmental effects in humans, including effects on psychomotor development, IQ, internalizing and socializing behaviors, have been associated with phthalates in some epidemiology studies. In laboratory animals, DEHP caused some neurotoxicity including reduced grip strength, reduced hind-limb splay, and increased brain weight in offspring exposed prenatally at doses over 8,000 times higher than the RfD. No neurobehavioral effects were reported in a 14 -day neurotoxicity study at doses over 10,000 times higher than the RfDs. Impaired spatial learning and memory in aged animals exposed prenatally were reported at a dose about 10 times higher than the RfD. No neurobehavioral Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 173 effects were reported in chronic studies although increased brain weights in rats and mice were reported at doses over 6,500 times higher than the RfD.

Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 187 Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Tested? No Effects? No No Yes1 Yes2 Yes3 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protectiv e of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1Developmental effects are listed as a co -critical effect for the short -term and subchronic durations. Decreased pup body weight was observed in reproductive and developmental animal studies at doses 100 times higher than the short-term RfD (0.34 mg/kg -d). 2Reproductive effects are listed as a co -critical effect for the short -term duration. A decrease in the number of implantations was observed in a 2-generation reproductive study at a dose 25 times higher than the short-term RfD (0.34 mg/kg-d) and an incre ase in post implantation loss was observed in the same study at a dose 100 times higher than the short-term RfD. Isolated instances of late abortions occurred in a rabbit developmental study at a dose 200 times higher than the short- term RfD. 3Nervous sys tem effects are listed as a co -critical effect for the short -term duration. A range of neurological effects were reported in acute and developmental studies in rats. The effects included lethargy, excessive salivation, increased lacrimation (increased tear production), increase bristling of hair, and decreased motor activity. The effects occurred at doses starting at 130 times higher than the short-term RfD (0.34 mg/kg- d). References: Australian Government - Department of Health and Ageing.

An earlier HRL (3 g/L) promulgated in 1993 was based on cancer. The above noncancer HBVs represent new values. The revised cancer HBV above is approximately 3-fold lower than the 2008 HRL due to: 1) revised cancer slope factor, 2) application of age- dependent adjustment factors to address earl y life sensitivity, and 3) rounding to one significant digit. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 194 Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 Yes5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protectiv e of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1. Endocrine effects are listed as a co -critical for all durations. Reductions of thyroxine (T 4), decreased triiodothyronine/thyroxine (T 3/T4) ratios, decreased response to stimulation with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and increase in thyroid weights were reported in laboratory animals. 2. Immunological effects were reported in short-term and subchronic studies in both mice and rats. In one study, male rats showed lymphocyte effects and suppression of antibody responses when exposed to PCP at levels 16.5 times the short-term RfD. However, another study reported no effects on lymphocytes or leukocytes in male rats exposed to doses over 15,000 times higher than the RfD. One study in mice reported non- statistically significant decreases in lymphocytes at a HED 3,500 higher than the RfD. Immune effects of technical grade PCP (but not for analytical grade), including reduced host- resistance to viral infection, red uced T- cell activity and reduced macrophage activity were reported in adult male mice at approximately 325 times the short- term RfD; however, immune effects at this level were considered to be related to impurities. Analytical grade PCP (>99% purity) cause d reduced thymus weight in female mice at doses over 700 times higher than the RfD. Suppression of antibody responses were observed at dose levels similar to the subchronic point of departure and have been identified as a co- critical effect. 3. Skeletal malformations are listed as critical effects for the acute and short -term durations. Delayed skull ossification was observed in rats. In addition, a range of skeletal malformations such as lumbar spurs, abnormal sternebrae, abnormal vertebrae, and decreased distance from crown to rump were observed starting at doses almost 900-fold higher than the RfD. 4. Male reproductive system effects are identified as co -critical. At a dose 1,700 times higher than the short- term Rfd, the incidence of fetal resorptions w as 100% and at 3,300 times the short- term RfD, the sex ratio was skewed to 100% males. Distended lumina of the uterus, the presence of macrophages in the uterus, and increased uterine weight as well as increased time to vaginal patency were observed in the female rat offspring at doses 4,600 times higher than the short- term RfD. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 195 5. Neurotoxicity testing was performed as part of a chronic study in mice. Although the mice showed dose-related increases in motor activity and startle response, they showed no tr eatment - related effects in pinna, corneal or righting reflexes, visual placement, grip strength or rota-rod testing. These effects were examined beginning at doses 1,900 times higher than the chronic RfD. References: Agency for Tox ic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) - MRLs. (2009).

Typically an RSC of 0.5 is utilized for nonvolatile contaminants for the acute and short -term durations and an RSC of 0.2 is used for subchronic and chronic durations. Given the limited potential for exposure from other sources, an RSC of 0.8 was selected rather than applying the default RSC value. For individuals who take sulfonamide antibiotics by prescription, the additional exposure from drinking water will be negligible.

Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Tested? Yes Yes Yes Yes No Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 201 Endocrine Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researchers identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 In laboratory animals, sulfamethazine (SMZ) increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and decreased thyroid hormone (T4). Thyroid hormones were not affected in non- human primates at administered doses over 17,000 times higher than the subchronic RfD. Thyroid and pituitary hormone effects were identified as critical and co -critical effects. 2Immunotoxicity studies for SMZ in animals or humans are not available; however, the sulfonamide antibiotic drug class is generally known to cause hypersensitivity immune reactions in humans and dogs based on clinical experience. SMZ forms the same types of reactive metabolites that have been related to sulfonamide hypersensitivity. Immunotoxic effects include skin rashes, threatening hypersensi tivity reactions. Sulfonamide hypersensitivity is considered to be related to drug metabolism deficiencies and/or variability among sensitive individuals. Immunotoxicity is addressed through the use of an uncertainty factor of 10 to account for sensitive populations. 3Human infants exposed to sulfonamides in utero or during the first 2 months after birth have increased risk of kernicterus, a bilirubin-induced permanent brain dysfunction. Exposed infants have a greater risk for jaundice and hemolytic anemia. Malformations (i.e., cleft palate, hydroureter and hydronephrosis) occurred in laboratory animals exposed to SMZ in utero at doses over 2,900 times higher than the short- term RfD. Developmental effects were identified as co-critical for the subchronic and chronic durations. 4Reproductive performance and fertility were decreased in rats at HED doses over 4,000 times higher than the RfDs. No reproductive effects were reported in laboratory animals at doses over 1,900 times higher than the RfDs. 5Neurotoxicity has not been directly evaluated for SMZ. For a similar sulfonamide, SMX, no effects on neurological clinical signs were observed in chronic studies with non-human primates and rats at doses 4,000 times or more than the RfD. The thyroid plays and important role in normal neurodevelopment, so the RfDs based on thyroid effects are considered protective. References: Altholtz, L. Y., K. M. La Perle and F. W. Quimby (2006).

A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 Studies explicitly evaluating endocrine effects of TCE have not been conducted. Secondary observations in studies designed to evaluate reproductive parameters provide limited evidence of endocrine effects. A limited number of epidemiological studies have reported effec ts such as decreased levels of testosterone and abnormal menstrual cycles. Decreased testosterone and abnormal menstrual cycles have been evaluated in animals studies, and these effects, like those above reported in humans, occur at levels >1000-fold hi gher than the short-term, subchronic and chronic RfDs. Therefore, it is likely that the Short-term, Subchronic and Chronic HBVs are protective of these effects. 2 Human and animal studies provide strong evidence that TCE plays a role in autoimmune disease and hypersensitivity. There is also some evidence that TCE may play a role in immunosuppressive effects although the evidence for these effects is weaker. Immune- related effects observed in human and animals studies are not limited to diseases but also involve organs and tissues within the immune system. Immune effects provide the basis of the RfDs (0.00017 - 0.00052 mg/kg-d) for the short-term, subchronic, and chronic durations. 3 A number of developmental outcomes have been observed in animal and human studies following inhalation and oral exposure to TCE. Some of the adverse developmental effects that have been observed in these studies included: spontaneous abortion, perinatal death, pre- or post-implantation loss, increased resorptions, low birth weight and decreased postnatal growth, and congenital malformations and fetal cardiac defects in particular. Fetal cardiac malformations (Johnson et al. 2003) were identified as a sensitive effect in the recent EPA IRIS Toxicological Review (2011). The RfDs derived by MDH (0.00017 mg/kg -d- 0.00052 mg/kg- d) that are based on immune effects are 90 -300 times lower than LOAEL reported in the Johnson et al. 2003 and are therefore considered to be protective of fetal cardiac malformations. 4 There is consistent evidence in animal and human studies that exposure to TCE is associated with adverse reproductive effects in males and females. A limited number of epidemiological studies have reported effects such as decreased levels of testosterone and abnormal menstrual cycles at exposure levels >1000 -fold higher than the short-term, subchronic and chronic RfDs. Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 210 Reproductive studies in laboratory animals have evaluated effects on sperm, fertility, reproductive organs, and parturition. These effects, like those above reported in humans also occurred at levels >1000 -fold higher than the short-term, subchronic and chronic RfDs. 5 TCE is associated with a variety of neurological effects in both animal and human studies. Most neurological effects associated with TCE were observed in inhalation studies but some neurological effects have also been observed following oral exposure to the TCE. The strongest evidence of neurological effects in human resulting from exposure to TCE is for changes in trigeminal nerve function or morphology and impairment of vestibular functions (includes symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea). There is more limited evidence that TCE may cause delayed motor function, changes in auditory, visual, and cognitive function or performance. The lowest HED 99 dose levels for neurological effects range from 3.5 mg/kg - d(developmental neurotoxicity in mice) to 7.3 mg/kg -d(trigeminal nerve effects in humans). The RfDs derived (0.00017 - 0.00052 mg/kg- d) are >6700 -fold lower and are therefore protective of neurological effects observed in inhalation and oral animal and human studies.

Summary of toxicity testing for health effects identified in the Health Standards Statute: Endocrine Immunotoxicity Development Reproductive Neurotoxicity Yes4 Yes5 Note: Even if testing for a specific health effect was not conducted for this chemical, information about that effect might be available from studies conducted for other purposes. Most chemicals have been subject to multiple studies in which researcher s identify a dose where no effects were observed, and the lowest dose that caused one or more effects. A toxicity value based on the effect observed at the lowest dose across all available studies is considered protective of all other effects that occur at higher doses. Comments on extent of testing or effects: 1 Dose -related decreases in serum levels of a variety of hormones (thyroxine (T4), estradiol, testosterone) have been reported. Alterations in thyroxine and estradiol levels have been identified as critical/co - critical effects and form the basis for the short-term HBV. Triclosan has also been evaluated for estrogenic activity using the sensitive utertrophic screening assay. When administered alone triclosan Minnesota Department of Health Rules on th e Heal th Risk Limits for Groundwater - July 2015 216 did not exhibit activity. When co -administered with ethinyl estradiol (E2) triclosan potentiated the estrogenic response. Using a range of E2 doses the authors demonstrated that at lower E2 doses high doses of triclosan were needed to cause potentiation. The lowest dose of E2 tested was within the range of doses women on contraceptives or hormone therapy may be exposed to. However potentiation at this E2 dose required triclosan human equivalent doses that were >70 times higher than the short- term, subchronic and chronic RfDs. Decreases in testes weight and testosterone levels have been observed but the dose levels at which these effects have occurred has been inconsistent. Decreases in male reproductive organ weights were reported at dose levels similar in magnitude to the short-term point of departure by Kumar et al (2009). However, these observations are not consistent with other studies and there are concerns regarding the purity of triclosan used in this study. Given these uncertainties MDH has chosen not to include the results from Kumar study in the derivation of the RfD. Under in vitro conditions triclosan has exhibited antagonistic activity in both estrogen and androgen responsive bioassays. 2 Skin sensitizing potential of triclosan has been extensively studied in multiple species, including humans, and resulted in no evidence of skin sensitization. A limited number of epidemiological studies have reported positive associations between exposure to triclosan (as measured by urinary triclosan levels) and increased allergic sensitization to inhalant and food allergens. These associations have not been consistent across studies. Study limitations include cross- sectional design, lack of clinical confirmation and exposure to multiple chemicals. In an animal model of asthma, dermal administration of triclosan did not result in airway reactivity. However, when dermally administered in conjunction with an injected allergen triclosan produced enhanced airwa y hyperreactivity; however this indicator of asthma in laboratory animals is inconsistent with the epidemiology studies that found no association between triclosan and asthma in humans. The association between triclosan and allergic sensitization is diff icult to explain since triclosan itself has been shown to have no sensitizing potential and little if any information is available regarding potential mechanism of triclosan in relation to allergic disease. More experimental studies are needed to determine triclosan's potential role in allergen sensitization. 3 Decreased pup weight with accompanying developmental delays in ossification have been reported at human equivalent dose levels > 100 times higher than the short-term, subchronic or chronic RfDs. 4 A 2 generation study has been conducted in rats. No effects on fertility indices were reported at human equivalent dose levels 500 times higher than the short- term, subchronic or chronic RfDs. The impact of triclosan exposure on puberty has been evaluate d in both males and females. No effects on reproductive development were observed at human equivalent dose levels >500 times higher than the short -term, subchronic or chronic RfDs. 5 A single 14 day neurotoxicity study has been performed. Inhibition of movement, decreased muscular tone, polydypsia and polyuria were observed at human equivalent dose levels nearly 1000 times higher than the short -term, subchronic or chronic RfDs. No change in brain weight, histological alterations or peripheral nerve changes were reported.
