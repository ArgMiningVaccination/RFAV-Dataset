Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution Dashboard can be used to tabulate, visualize, and monitor key vaccine distribution metrics and trends that support a phased coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination plan. As communities begin to distribute vaccines, maintaining situational awareness is essential. Understanding how vaccine distribution and coverage metrics vary among target populations, and from one geography to another, helps decision makers develop strategic vaccine distribution plans. Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution Dashboard is typically implemented by health and human services agencies that want to visualize key vaccine distribution metrics over time and use the metrics to inform public education campaigns, make vaccine distribution decisions, adapt recommendations made to reach target populations, and ensure a successful vaccination program. The Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution Dashboard solution delivers a set of capabilities that help you to tabulate vaccine distribution metrics, monitor key trends and performance targets for defined geographies, and communicate progress to interested stakeholders.
