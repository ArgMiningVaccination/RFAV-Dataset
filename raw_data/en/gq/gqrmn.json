Our prices are generally below retail, and never above. In addition, there is no sales tax for medicines in our dispensary that have been prescribed to you. We stock items in-house so that we can know the ingredients and quality of the medicines we are recommending, and for your convenience. The natural medicines we recommend can be found elsewhere if you prefer. The Herbalist across the street carries a nice selection of herbs, Whole Foods carries many OTC products. The Bastyr Dispensary has a very extensive selection. Dandelion herbs in Ballard and Rainbow Remedies on Capitol Hill are other great options for you as well.
