Chiropractic care is one of the most important aspects of healthcare in order to achieve optimal health. This article is designed to showcase how your [San Diego chiropractor](/) can provide beneficial care for both you and your loved ones. WELCOME TO Health In Balance Chiropractic care is based on the concept of eliminating a misalignment of the spine. A properly aligned spine can help ease many different physical conditions including, but not limited to, muscle strains, pain in the neck or back, and even headaches or migraines. Chiropractors use a strategic and effective approach in repositioning a misaligned spine back to its correct shape in order to achieve lasting results. Most people are under the impression that chiropractic care is only for back pain. This is a common misconception as issues such as carpal tunnel, work injuries, auto injuries and many others can be treated through a chiropractic-based approach. The History of Chiropractic Care Daniel David Palmer developed the methods of the modern day chiropractic field. The first ever chiropractic patient was a janitor who was partially deaf. Palmer completed a simple spinal adjustment and the janitor claimed his hearing was improved due to the treatment. Palmer went on to open the first school for chiropractic within the next two years. Since 1895, chiropractic care has become one of the most effective non-invasive treatment options for patients living with a wide variety of issues. Spinal adjustments have been used to help people of all ages overcome the discomfort in their lives and allow them to get back to doing the activities they enjoy.
