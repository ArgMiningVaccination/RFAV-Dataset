SCENARIO Y ou are asked to see a previously well 5-year-old boy who pre- sented to the accident and emergency department. While playingin a public park he picked up a discarded 1 mL syringe with anattached 27-gauge needle and punctured the skin of his hand. Hismother asks, \"Will he catch AIDS? What should we do now? \" STRUCTURED CLINICAL QUESTION In a child with a community-acquired needlestick injury(CA-NSI) (patient, intervention), what is the risk of blood-bornevirus (BBV) transmission (outcome)? Introduction CA-NSI in children causes signi cant parental anxiety. The risk of HIV and hepatitis virus transmission following NSI in health-care settings is well established. The risk of BBV transmission toa child from a CA-NSI is substantially less than from occupa-tional exposure. Despite this, many clinical guidelines are basedon occupational NSI. SEARCH STRATEGY AND OUTCOME Medline was searched using the Ovid interface (1946 topresent/no limits set) using MeSH subject headings: (*needle-stick infections/ or *environmentalexposure/)). No age limits were imposed for reported cases ofBBV transmission from CA-NSI, on the basis that con rmed transmission at any age would support the theoretical possibilityof transmission in children. Only papers addressingnon-healthcare-related CA-NSI were included. Cross-sectionalstudies with no longitudinal follow-up and those reportingexclusively BBV transmission from injecting drug use wereexcluded. The search date was 11 May 2014. The Medline search retrieved 1100 publications, of which 16 were relevant. Search of Embase via the Ovid interface (1974 - present) using the same search strategy retrieved 918 publica-tions and identi ed 1 additional relevant paper. The 17 relevant publications were hand-searched for further references and 4further relevant publications were found. Search of theCochrane Library database retrieved no relevant reviews. Thenal 21 included studies are summarised in tables 1 and 2. When the original publication provided insuf cient information, authors were contacted for further details. COMMENTARY Of the 21 studies, there were 17 observational studies ( table 1 ) and 4 reports describing a total of 5 cases ( table 2 ). Repeated attempts to contact the authors of one observational study toclarify the ndings were unsuccessful and that paper was excluded from further analysis. 1The remaining observational studies were heterogeneous in study design (nine retrospect- ive,2-10six prospective,11-16one mixed17) and completeness of reported outcomes, including the age of cases. Some studies included CA-NSI alongside other exposures, and wherepossible, the other exposures were excluded from our review.Some did not distinguish between exposures in reporting results(none of these studies documented a BBV transmission). Formost studies, there was a high rate of loss to follow-up.Serological results for hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV were inconsistently reported and available for all three in only a few studies. Between 1987 and 2011, 1565 cases of CA-NSI were reported in the 16 observational studies. HIV postexposureprophylaxis (PEP) was recommended in 198 cases. Wherereported, adherence to prescribed HIV PEP was generally poor.Of the 1565 cases, 1 unvaccinated adult caring for a relativewith chronic HBV infection, in a country with a relatively highHBV infection rate and without routine HBV vaccination, devel-oped evidence of HBV infection in the 8 weeks after sustaininga NSI while disposing of an intravenous needle and after declin-ing postexposure HBV immunoglobulin HCV seroconversion (423 patients) HIVseroconversion (995 patients). There were no cases of virustransmission in children or adolescents. Five cases of BBV transmission attributed to CA-NSI were reported in the four case reports, including two cases of HBV 18 19 and three of HCV .20 21In each case, the possibility of viral trans- mission by an alternative route could not be ruled out. There wereno reports of HIV transmission. Only one of the ve cases was a child and occurred following a CA-NSI from a needle discardedby a neighbour with known HBV and HIV infection. The child 's immunisation status was not reported, and he was not given post-exposure HBV immunoglobulin or vaccination. The remainingfour cases occurred in adults, two of whom were in high-risk occu-pations. For the single adult case of HBV infection, immunisationstatus was not reported and he did not receive appropriate postex-posure HBV immunoglobulin or vaccination. Each of the ve patients developed hepatitis. In the three adults with HCV trans-mission, HCV antibody was detected from 3 months post NSI.One adult with HBV cleared the virus, and one adult with HCVhad successful interferon-based treatment. The 4-year-old boy had unsuccessful treatment and developed chronic hepatitis. Occupational studies provide estimates of the risk associated with NSI. Meta-analyses report mean risk rates of 0.23% for HIV , 220.75% for HCV23and 23 HBV , adequate PEP (vaccine\u00b1immunoglobulin)confers near-total protection. Risk for BBV transmission in thehealthcare setting is highest with deep injection of a large inocu-lum (large volume, high viral load) as is more likely to occur inassociation with a large-gauge hollow-bore needle. 25 26 Extrapolated to the community setting, deep injury with a large-gauge hollow-bore needle, visibly stained or lled with blood, sustained minutes following use (such as might occur in a house-hold with a known infected drug user or in a deliberate assault),would be expected to carry a similar risk. However, most epi-sodes of CA-NSI in children, such as in our scenario, are notassociated with these risk factors. While study ndings of viral persistence give cause for concern, the same studies indicate thatunder usual conditions of needle use in the community (small-gauge, low-void-volume syringes) and subsequent environmentalexposure (time, heat, drying, humidity, chemicals), infectivity ismarkedly and rapidly reduced. 27-35This risk analysis assumes the source needle user is infected, whereas BBV rates among people who inject drugs actually vary markedly worldwide andare lower in developed countries with universal HBV vaccin-ation and needle exchange. 36-38Very low risk of infection Arch Dis Child Month 2014 Vol 0 No 0 1Archimedes ADC Online First, published on August 27, 2014 as 10.1136/archdischild-2014-306929 Copyright Article author (or their employer) 2014.

Overall, data from our systematic review, the healthcare setting and experimental ndings suggest the risk of BBV trans- mission from a CA-NSI in a child immunised against HBV orgiven adequate HBV PEP is so low as to possibly be negligible. Clinical bottom line We did not nd any reports of blood-borne virus (BBV) transmission to a child from an incidental community-acquired needlestick injury (CA-NSI). CA-NSI in children is distinct from NSI in healthcare settingsand is associated with much lower risk of BBV transmission. In a susceptible child, the highest risk for transmission is forhepatitis B virus (HBV). This risk is (vaccine\u00b1HBV immunoglobulin).
