The [aroma](/k/1/dichrostachys-cinerea?s=off) of [thyme](/k/1/thymus-vulgaris?s=off), [linden](/k/1/linden?s=off) and [chamomile](/k/1/matricaria-chamomilla?s=off) evokes sweet memories of childhood in everyone whose grandmother once made [herbal](/k/1/herbs?s=off) tea for breakfast. The [herbs](/k/1/herbs?s=off) are deeply embedded in our traditions and are sometimes given a mystical and almost magical action. As science progresses, the secrets of their [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off) effects are revealed - encoded in a variety of [active substances](/k/1/active-compounds?s=off). In this article, we will look at 10 of the best medicinal [herbs](/k/1/herbs?s=off) we can find in our nature or in the pharmacy. 1. It is a tree and should not be confused with danewort ( [Sambucus](/k/1/sambucus?s=off) ebulus), which is a herbaceous plant. The fruits of the [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) hang down, and the danewort is straightened upwards. The other names of the danewort are dane weed, danesblood, dwarf [elder](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) or [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off), and blood hilder. Both [herbs](/k/1/herbs?s=off) are sometimes called [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off). But enough about the names, let's find out what the properties of these plants are. [Elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) (tree) The fruit of [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) contains the protein agglutinin Ivf (SNAIVf), which is homologous to the RIP type 2 lectin, as well as quercetin. The [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) has the following medicinal properties [ [ref. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259696401_An_Evidence-Based_Systematic_Review_of_Elderberry_and_Elderflower_Sambucus_nigra_by_the_Natural_Standard_Research_Collaboration)]: - Anti-inflammatory effect, - Modulation of immune protection, [Antioxidant](/k/1/antioxidante?s=off)effects thanks to the flavonoids, [Antiviral](/k/1/antiviral?s=off)effect - especially against influenza viruses type A and B, as well as against [herpes simplex](/k/1/herpes-simplex?s=off)-1 virus, - Potentially lowers blood pressure, - Diuretic effect ( [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off)flowers), - Potentially stimulates glucose metabolism and increases insulin secretion from the beta cells of the [pancreas](/k/1/pancreas?s=off), - Potentially lowers cholesterol (fruit syrup), - Potentially lowers the weight. Attention, attention! Poorly ripe fruits, bark, roots and leaves of S. nigra contain cyanogen glycoside sambungrin, which is toxic and its intake can lead to cyanide poisoning. [Elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) can adversely affect people with a variety of [diseases](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms) and conditions, including: arrhythmia, cardiovascular [disease](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms), along with taking [medications](/k/1/treatment?s=off) to lower blood pressure, [diabetes](/k/1/diabetes-mellitus?s=off), during [chemotherapy](https://www.sanat.io/bul/p/liechiebni_rastieniia_koito_obliekchavat_mchitielnitie_stranichni_iefiekti_ot_khimio_i_lchietierapiiata_0e97f0c5_6473_4c0a_bfd5_233383967f22), [diseases](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms) central [nervous disorders](/p/anorieksiia_bulimiia_prieiazhdanie_kdie_sie_korieniat_khranitielnitie_razstroistva_499c17d9_4b0f_4506_8deb_16089dec54bf) and in particular [anorexia](/k/1/anorexia?s=off), [migraines](https://www.sanat.io/bul/p/6_bilki_koito_shchie_pomoghnat_na_stradashchitie_ot_mighriena_5f9f41dd_4a26_479a_b23f_06bf63bc6557) and others. As it becomes clear, [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) is a very potent [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off), and it is good to use it after consulting a doctor, especially in the presence of accompanying [diseases](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms) or specific conditions, including in [pregnancy](/c/1/pregnancy-childbirth-children) and lactation. Danewort (herbaceous [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off)) Unripe fruits of the danewort are also poisonous, and only ripe ones are used for medicinal purposes. Other effects are [ [ref. 2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2156587217701322)]: [Antioxidant](/k/1/antioxidante?s=off), - Anti-inflammatory, faster wound [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off), [Anticancer](/k/1/anticancer?s=off)effect - demonstrated only in cells in laboratory conditions. As a [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) used since ancient times, danewort has a long history of food and medicinal applications and is still widely used. Its high potential for therapeutic applications, due to its many bioactive phytochemicals, heralds a bright future for danewort. Where to look for [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) Both types of [elderberry](/k/1/sambucus-nigra?s=off) are found free-growing by the roads, settlements, in shrubs and forests. It can also be purchased in the form of various preparations, dried fruit and syrups from pharmacies and drugstores. 2. [Common yarrow](/k/1/achillea-ochroleuca?s=off) - [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) has attracted people's attention since ancient times and has become part of a variety of myths and legends - including the one about Achilles, according to which he used [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off) to heal his wounds. Besides [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off), several other species of this genus are used to treat wounds, [hemorrhages](/k/1/hemorrhage?s=off), [headaches](/k/1/headache?s=off), [inflammations](/k/1/inflammation?s=off), pain, spasmodic [diseases](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms), [flatulence](/k/1/flatulence?s=off) of species of the genus [Achillea](/k/1/achillea?s=off) reveal that they contain many components that are highly bioactive. The different effects of these plants may be due to the presence of a wide range of secondary active metabolites such are often reported to be found in [Achillea](/k/1/achillea?s=off) species. Here are the effects of [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off) of medical importance [ [ref. 3](https://www.bioseek.eu/bg/eng/research/pubmed/A_review_on_phytochemistry_and_medicinal_properties_of_the_genus_Achillea_22615655)]: [Treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off)of wounds - for faster [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off), aqueous extract of the flowers. [Antioxidant](/k/1/antioxidante?s=off)properties - tea from the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off). - Estrogenic activity - traditionally [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off)is used as a means of regulating the menstrual cycle, [since it contains luteolin and](/p/maghdanozt_tsielinata_i_drughi_bilki_koito_pomaghat_v_borbata_s_raka_431f42b9_91a1_4cb7_b9d4_e633b827af78) [apigenin](../p/maghdanozt_tsielinata_i_drughi_bilki_koito_pomaghat_v_borbata_s_raka_431f42b9_91a1_4cb7_b9d4_e633b827af78)(luteolin and apigenin). Apigenin exhibits estrogenic activity, since it has the ability to bind to estrogen receptors. - Antispermogenous effect - it has been found that in rats, alcoholic [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off)extract disrupts sperm formation processes. - Anti- [ulcer](/k/1/ulcer?s=off) [activity aqueous extract of the](https://www.bioseek.eu/bg/eng/research/pubmed/In_vitro_susceptibility_of_Helicobacter_pylori_to_botanical_extracts_used_traditionally_for_the_treatment_of_gastrointestinal_disorders_16317658) [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off)protects the disturbed mucous membrane of the [stomach](/k/1/stomach?s=off)and promotes its recovery. - Effects on the immune system - [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off)is rich in substances called sesquiterpenes, which have an immunosuppressive effect (suppress the activity of the immune system). This effect is manifested by the use of essential oil from the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off). [Antibacterial](/k/1/antiseptic?s=off)effects - extract (hexane:ether:methanol = 1:1:1) of [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off)has shown [ [ref. 5](https://www.bioseek.eu/bg/eng/research/pubmed/In_vitro_antimicrobial_activity_of_extracts_of_four_Achillea_species_the_composition_of_Achillea_clavennae_L_Asteraceae_extract_15978758)] broad [antibacterial](/k/1/antiseptic?s=off)activity against (Staphylococcus coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enteritidis) fungi (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). [Antispasmodic](/k/1/antispasmodic?s=off)effects - the use of [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off)infusion to relieve gastrointestinal problems, especially as an [antispasmodic](/k/1/antispasmodic?s=off)and anti-inflammatory agent, is quite common in [folk medicine](/k/1/traditional-medicine?s=off). [Antispasmodic](/k/1/antispasmodic?s=off)effects of the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off)are probably due to flavonoids in the plant. The substances galangin, quercetin and eupatilin, which are common in this genus, have been reported to cause a powerful sagging of the ileum (the last part of the [small intestine](/k/1/small-intestine?s=off)). - Anti-inflammatory properties - the action is probably due to sesquiterpenes and alkamides. - Undesirable effects - [hypersensitivity](/k/1/hypersensitivity?s=off)may occur in some people and there is not enough data to determine whether the intake of the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off)during [pregnancy](/c/1/pregnancy-childbirth-children)and lactation [ [ref. 6](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/final-assessment-report-achillea-millefolium-l-herba_en.pdf)] is safe. However, consultation with a specialist is necessary if we intend to use the [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off)for longer periods of time. Where can you find [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off) The [yarrow](/k/1/achillea-pannonica?s=off) is found at an altitude of up to 2000 m above sea level. It grows in grassy places, meadows, shrubs. In pharmacies it is available in a variety of forms - tincture, dried [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off), essential oil, capsules, ointments, floral water. 3. simply [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off), is a semi-parasitic shrub that develops in the crowns of trees and gives specific white ball fruits. The plant is poisonous, its stalks and leaves also apply as a [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off), but it should not be taken for a long time. Recently, white [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) has been more actively studied, as some of its potentially [beneficial effects](/k/1/healing-properties?s=off) in the fight against [cancer](/c/1/diagnosis-of-cancer) have been found. The plant contains phenols, terpenoids and lectins. Lectins may act as immune and proapoptotic effects (apoptosis is the programmed cell death or process in which the cell kills itself so as not to harm the body). In fact, both [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) extracts and purified [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) lectins have great potential as [anticancer agents](/k/1/anticancer?s=off) and have been shown to inhibit the growth of [tumor](/c/1/diagnosis-of-cancer) cell lines such as B-cell hybridomas, P815, EL-4, Ke37, MOLT-4 and U937 in vitro. The mechanism by which they stop cell growth involves inducing apoptosis. It should be taken into account that the use of [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) alone is not the best therapy against [cancer](/c/1/diagnosis-of-cancer) and the results are influenced by the use of other [treatments](/k/1/treatment?s=off). Given all this, the best way to evaluate the anti- [cancer](/c/1/diagnosis-of-cancer) properties of [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) is to evaluate its use as an adjuvant drug rather than as an alternative to [chemotherapy](/k/1/chemotherapy?s=off). [ [ref. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124078499000543)] In [folk medicine](/k/1/traditional-medicine?s=off), [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) is used in the form of a decoction for: - decrease in high blood pressure, - as a vasodilator agent with an effect on the lower extremities, - as a hemostatic agent, - [epilepsy](/k/1/epilepsy?s=off), [anxiety](/k/1/anxiety?s=off). A curious fact is that the main toxic ingredients of the [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) are [stomach](/k/1/stomach?s=off)-irritating to cobra snake poison. [ [ref. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124165953000050)] Where can you find [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) As we said at the beginning, [mistletoe](/k/1/viscum-album?s=off) is a semi-parasite that grows on the branches of various tree species, up to 2000 meters above sea level. Dried [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) is sold in drug stores and it's not expensive. 4. Lemon Balm ( [Melissa](/k/1/melissa?s=off) officinalis) - bees love it It blooms at the end of summer and is a honey plant attracting bees - it is also named after them. It's leaves smell like lemon. For [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off) purposes, the leaves of the lemon balm are used before flowering occurs. Phytochemical studies reveal that the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) contains volatile compounds, triterpenoids, phenolic acids and flavonoids. Raw extracts and pure compounds isolated from M. officinalis exhibit numerous pharmacological effects, of which only the following are shown in [clinical trials](/k/1/clinical-trials?s=off): [anxiolytic](/k/1/anxiolytic?s=off)(anti- [anxiety](/k/1/anxiety?s=off)), - antivirus, [antispasmodic](/k/1/antispasmodic?s=off)activities of this plant, as well as its effects on mood, cognition and memory. [ [ref. 9](https://www.bioseek.eu/bg/eng/research/pubmed/Melissa_officinalis_L_A_review_of_its_traditional_uses_phytochemistry_and_pharmacology_27167460)] The [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) has a potential positive effect in insomnia [as well as in the role of an ](/p/kak_da_sie_spravim_s_biezsniieto_4a5e9367_3f8a_4aa7_bcf3_ecedac42f10c) [antioxidant](/k/1/antioxidante?s=off). [ [ref. 10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871149/)] It is important to note that its intake with sedative and [antipsychotic drugs](/k/1/antipsychotics?s=off) is absolutely prohibited. Prolonged intake of lemon balm (30 days) can lead to a number of adverse effects. Where can you find the lemon balm The lemon balm grows in shrubs and small forests, courtyards, in grassy and rocky places - up to 1200 m above sea level. 5. [Stinging nettle](/k/1/urtica-dioica?s=off) ( [Urtica dioica](/k/1/urtica-dioica?s=off)) - also called [common nettle](/k/1/urtica-dioica?s=off) or stinger. Leaves and stalks are collected from June to September, and the roots - in the autumn, in which case it is necessary to act responsibly and not destroy the entire bed, in order to have [nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) in this place and the following year. The plant is well known by everyone because of the [dermatitis](/k/1/dermatitis?s=off) it causes when touched, due to biochemical mediators such as histamine and acetylcholine. [Nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) exhibits such as: [antirheumatic](/k/1/antirheumatics?s=off), anti-infectious, immunomodulatory, [antihyperglycemic](/k/1/antidiabetic?s=off) (lowers blood sugar) action, as well as for the relief of allergies. For a long time [Urtica dioica](/k/1/urtica-dioica?s=off) has been used as a diuretic agent and the [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) of [arthritis](/k/1/arthritis?s=off) and [rheumatism](/k/1/rheumatic-diseases?s=off) in [folk medicine](/k/1/traditional-medicine?s=off). Today [nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) is recognized as an important [medicinal herb](/k/1/phyllanthus-niruri?s=off), and is also consumed as food due to its content of minerals, amino acids, lecithin, carotenoids and vitamins. variety of valuable substances are found in [nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off), such as flavonoids, tanins and sterols. Its as scopoletin, fatty acids, polysaccharides and isolectins. Pharmaceutical studies also found additional medicinal applications [liver](/k/1/liver?s=off)), - For patients with [enlarged prostate](/p/kakvi_sa_prichinitie_za_ugholiemiena_prostata_i_ima_li_liechieniie_s_bilki_e6649524_c6c7_443e_9780_c569c3224f15)and other problems can you find [nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) [Nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) is a widespread plant and it's found near settlements, roads, landfills, manures, along rivers - on nitrogen-rich soils. If we pick the [nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) for food, collect the young tips with the help of a pinch or dense gloves. Besides the leaves, the roots are also used for [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off). [Nettle](/k/1/urtica?s=off) can be purchased at affordable prices - dried or fresh. It is also sold in the form of capsules. 6. [Common hedgenettle](/k/1/betonica-officinalis?s=off) ( [Betonica officinalis](/k/1/betonica-officinalis?s=off)) The wood betony, bishopwort, or bishop's problems](/p/losho_khranosmilanie_dispiepsiia_prichini_simptomi_i_liechieniie_295123d1_141a_4a34_b5b4_38236707b61c), for painful conditions, including [gout](/k/1/gout?s=off), [headache](/k/1/headache?s=off)and [kidney stones](/k/1/kidney-calculi?s=off)( [nephrolithiasis](/k/1/nierenstein?s=off)) and pain and swelling of the bladder ( [inflammation](/k/1/inflammation?s=off)), - it is also used to treat stress and tension, nervousness and [epilepsy](/k/1/epilepsy?s=off), - in combination with other [herbs](/k/1/herbs?s=off), betony is used to treat [nerve pain](/k/1/neuralgia?s=off)( [neuralgia](/k/1/neuralgia?s=off)) and [anxiety](/k/1/anxiety?s=off), - potentially lowers blood pressure and therefore you should stop using it at least 2 weeks before surgery; not recommended for people with [low blood pressure](/k/1/hypotension?s=off). Where can you find betony The [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) grows in meadows, grassy places, in shrubs and small forests. It is allowed to be harvested only for personal needs, that is, up to 1 kg collected by one person per day. Dried [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) is available in pharmacies and drugstores. 7. [Calendula Scotch [marigold](/k/1/tagetes?s=off). Phytochemical studies show the presence of different classes of compounds, the main ones being: triterpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, quinones, volatile oils, carotenoids and amino acids. Studies have reported the following properties of [marigold](/k/1/tagetes?s=off) [ [ref. 13](http://www.rroij.com/open-access/phytochemistry-and-pleiotropic-pharmacological-properties-of-calendula-officinalis--a-review-.php?aid=34273)]: - Anti-inflammatory and against [edema](/k/1/edema?s=off), - For wound [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off)and for a variety of [skin](/k/1/skin?s=off)problems, - In [gingivitis](/k/1/gingivitis?s=off)( [inflammation](/k/1/inflammation?s=off)of the gums), [Antioxidant](/k/1/antioxidante?s=off), - Antitumor observed in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in mice, - Antigenotoxic (genotoxic substances are those that damage DNA), - Chemoprotective and hepatoprotective - found in cells and mice, [Antiviral](/k/1/antiviral?s=off), [Antibacterial](/k/1/antiseptic?s=off)and [antifungal](/k/1/antifungal?s=off)- inhibits the growth in particular of various representatives of the genus Candida and Rhodotorula, as well can you find [marigold](/k/1/tagetes?s=off) It is most often grown in gardens, it loves the bright sun and moist soil and is easily grown from seeds. The [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) is sold in the form of dried flowers, ointments, tincture, oil, capsules. 8. St. John's wort ( [Hypericum perforatum](/k/1/hypericum-perforatum?s=off)) St. John's wort is a widespread [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off). In order not to be mistaken for other representatives of the genus, when picking the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off), you need to pay attention to whether the petals have multiple small holes when lifting them against the light. From this feature comes the name of the species - perforatum, since the leaves are perforated. The chemical composition of St. John's wort has been well studied. [Antidepressants](/k/1/antidepressants?s=off), [antiviral](/k/1/antiviral?s=off) and [antibacterial](/k/1/antiseptic?s=off) (only in very high concentrations and in Gram(-) bacteria) effects of the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) are confirmed by research and explain some of the traditional uses of the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) [ [ref. 14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11370698/)]. It seems that many pharmacological actions are due to hypericin and flavonoids. It is believed that hypericin is also responsible for photosensitive reactions that occur when using St. John's wort and sun exposure - therefore, it is not recommended to take the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) in the summer. With regard to the [antidepressant](/k/1/antidepressants?s=off) effects of St. John's wort, hyperforin, and not hypericin, as originally thought, has emerged as one of the most important components responsible for [antidepressant](/k/1/antidepressants?s=off) activity. St. John's wort is not a harmless [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off). Photosensitivity can lead to [cataracts](/k/1/cataract?s=off), a number of unpleasant [side effects](/k/1/side-effect?s=off) are observed, including influence on the emotional state, gastrointestinal disorders, [numbness](/k/1/hypesthesia?s=off) of the limbs. The [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) is contraindicated in pregnant women due to negative (teratogenic) effects on the fetus! Where can you find St. John's wort St. John's wort is widespread and it grows up to 2000 m above sea level. It blooms from May to August. 9. is also known as [corn poppy](/k/1/papaver-rhoeas?s=off), [corn](/k/1/zea-mays?s=off) [rose](/k/1/g\u00fcl?s=off), field poppy, Flanders poppy, or red poppy. Both types of poppy contain the substances morphine, codeine, tecaine and narcotin. Poppy can cause poisoning in larger doses and it is mandatory to use it only under medical supervision! The [common poppy](/k/1/papaver-rhoeas?s=off) is used in [folk medicine](/k/1/traditional-medicine?s=off) for: - Breathing disorders, - Insomnia, [Cough](/k/1/cough?s=off), - Pain, [Treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off)of dependence on heroin, morphine and other opioid drugs. More scientific evidence is needed to assess the effectiveness of the [common poppy](/k/1/papaver-rhoeas?s=off) in the [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) of these conditions. The [opium poppy](/k/1/papaver?s=off) contains the most opium and therefore overuse can lead to dependence! This type of poppy is used to produce opium, heroin and other drugs. Opium is used to produce morphine and is extracted from the liquid that occurs when immature fruits of the sleeping poppy are injured. Not all subspecies of the [opium poppy](/k/1/papaver?s=off) contain large amounts of narcotics and therefore find applications in culinary - poppy seed. The following substances are isolated from the sleeping poppy and they have important properties for medicine: - relaxant tubocurarine. Where can you find poppy Only poppy seed is sold commercially. 10. Maral root ( [Leuzea carthamoides](/k/1/leuzea-carthamoides?s=off), [Rhaponticum carthamoides](/k/1/rhaponticum-carthamoides?s=off)) It is a rare endemic plant that grows in Siberia, Central Asia, Mongolia and China at an altitude of up to 3000 m, on the border of melting glaciers. As it becomes clear, the [herb](/k/1/herbs?s=off) is not found in our nature, but is sold in the form of various supplements. Several different classes of compounds were found from different parts of R. carthamoides, of which the main groups were [ [ref. 15](https://www.bioseek.eu/bg/eng/research/pubmed/Chemistry_and_pharmacology_of_Rhaponticum_carthamoides_a_review_19457517)]: - steroids, in particular ecdysteroids, - triterpenoid glycosides, - terpenes (essential oil). It has been established that various types of preparations, extracts and individual compounds derived from the Maral root have a wide range of pharmacological effects on the [brain](/k/1/brain?s=off), blood, cardiovascular and [nervous system](/k/1/nervous-system?s=off), as well as on various biochemical processes and physiological functions, including: [proteosynthesis](/p/kakva_ie_razlikata_miezhdu_bieltk_i_protiein_b1b6b96e_e340_46d2_9768_ac9fa8cd6adc), - working capacity, - reproduction and sexual function.
