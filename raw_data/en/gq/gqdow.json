State, m.d., ph.d., had never seriously consid - ered a career in genetic research until 1995, when he spent a few months in a child psychiatry ward during his residency at the University of California, Los Angeles. There he cared for a few children with Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genet - ic disorder caused when all or part of a seven-gene stretch of chromosome 15 is missing. Children with Prader-Willi tend to be intellectually delayed and prone to compulsive behav - iors such as skin-picking and uncontrollable eating. \"These kids just had one region lost, but it led to a variety of psychiatric manifestations,\" State recalls. \"It made me start thinking, quite naively, about studying rare mutations as a way of understanding disorders that are much more common in the population.\" The notion led State, at age 35, to enroll in the graduate program in genetics at Yale, where others were thinking along the same lines. Most famously, faculty member Richard P. Lifton, m.d., ph.d. , now chair and Sterling Professor of Genetics, had discovered a trove of new genes involved in hypertension by screening families with rare, extreme blood pressure disorders. In recent years, State, now the Donald J. Cohen Profes - sor in the Child Study Center, professor of psychiatry and genetics, and co-director of the Yale Program on Neuroge - netics at the School of Medicine, has been employing the lat - est genomic technologies to take the same general approach In 2007, Natalia B. Ivanova, ph.d. , arrived at the School of Medicine with ambitious plans. A rising star in stem cell biology, she had just left a postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton, and her first order of business was to hire a team for her Yale laboratory. Most medical investigators are funded not from a central budget, but through grants from the govern - ment or other institutions. Young scientists are pressed to win sup - port from these backers, who tend to favor established researchers. But Ivanova, assistant professor of genet - ics, had a leg up: she was the medical school's first recruit to benefit from the Yale Scholars initiative, which Honoring an RNA pioneer, backing science's next generation A firm foothold in the genetics of autismOffice supporting student research celebrates 25 yearsprovides young scientists with sup - port that allows them to focus on science during their earliest years as independent researchers rather than scramble for funding.

Stud - ies have found dozens of genetic blips in people with autism, which is characterized by repetitive behaviors and problems in communication and social interactions, but researchers have struggled to sort out which of these gene variants are harmful and which benign.

Alpern, m.d. , characterized Salem as \"absolutely dedicated to patient care. . . . He works with extreme com - passion, and his ex - traordinary caring nature is evident to all of his patients.\" Colleagues who nominated Salem for the prize praised \"his availability, his calm disposition during critical mo - ments, and above all his counsel.\" Salem earned his medical degree at the University of Rhodesia and completed a general surgery residency After three decades in basic science, a biologist circles back to medicine The poet William Carlos Williams exalted the ordinary: \"So much depends,\" he wrote, \"upon/a red wheel/barrow.\" Seen from the vantage point of Pietro De Camilli, m.d., the seemingly unremark - able fact that cell membranes can bend into different shapes is likewise invested with the greatest importance, for life itself\u2014and every thought, emotion, and memory\u2014depends upon it. As a child, De Camilli spent each year's four-month school vacation in his mother's ancestral village by Lake Maggiore, in northern Italy. There he developed the \"passion for understand - ing nature\" that drew him to biology. Because little rigorous advanced train - ing in general biology was available in Italy at that time, De Camilli enrolled in medical school. He had little interest in a career as a physician, but relished the chance to be \"exposed to one organism, from molecules to mind.\" His early research was in endocri - nology, specifically on how hormones are secreted from cells in a process called exocytosis. This manner of secre - tion is ubiquitous in biology, but is par - ticularly crucial in the nervous system. In neurons, the membrane is shaped into spherical sacs called vesicles that carry neurotransmitters to synapses. There they fuse with the synaptic mem - brane and empty their cargo, passing on to other cells the chemical messages that allow the brain to function. De Camilli soon shifted his focus to neurobiology, and in 1978 he joined the Yale laboratory of Paul Greengard, ph.d. , who went on to win the Nobel Prize for his studies of synaptic transmission. As a cell biologist, De Camilli's favored tool was the microscope, and he needed time to adjust to Greengard's biochemistry lab, in which \"they studied the nervous system with a Waring blender,\" isolating proteins from homogeneous solutions of brain tissue using chromatography. But in a \"magic moment\" De Camilli realized that antibodies being developed by his colleagues could be used with light and electron microscopy to localize subcellular proteins. Before long he had characterized synapsin, the first synaptic vesicle protein to be understood in any depth, and after launching his own Yale lab, he continued to build an inventory of such proteins. But De Camilli, now the Eugene Higgins Professor of Cell Biology and professor of neurobiology, gradually became intrigued with the question of how new vesicles form after neuro- transmitters are released. In this process, called endocytosis, intracellular proteins bend the now-flat synaptic membrane back into a proper-sized sphere, which pinches off and migrates into the cell. This newly born vesicle is loaded with a neurotransmitter, and the secretory cycle begins anew. \"These processes are so fundamental that what you learn can be applied to every cell,\" says De Camilli, whose wide-ranging work on every step in this progression has earned him election to the National Academy of Sciences and appointment as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. De Camilli's career seems itself to be unfolding in a cycle. Mouse strains with defective vesicle trafficking that were created in his lab to explore basic biology turned out to have character - istics seen in various human diseases, rekindling De Camilli's interest in concepts he learned in medical school. In 2006 he joined with Stephen M. Strittmatter, m.d., ph.d. , the Vincent Coates Professor of Neurology and professor of neurobiology, to launch the program in Cellular Neuroscience, Neurodegeneration, and Repair, which aims to rapidly translate lab discover - ies into new treatments for neurode - generative diseases and injuries of the brain and spinal cord. \"Basic science helps us understand medicine,\" he says, \"but increasingly,\" as genomics inspires experiments based directly on human biology and disease, \"medicine has become a tool of science.\"In March, the School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Children's Hos - pital ( ynhch ) Michael G.

The vascular and nervous systems appear to be more closely related than previously thought: \"In multicel - lular organisms,\" Simons explains, \"the nervous system evolved first, and the vascular system followed, and it's be - ginning to look like they used the same set of molecules.\" This connection holds tremendous potential for biomedi - cal research, says Simons. \"It turns out that the vascula - ture controls the function of the nervous system, and the nervous system controls the function of the vasculature. There's a huge overlap between neurobiology and vascular In bringing cardiovascular researchers together under one roof, Yale center gathers momentum and funding, stimulates scientific collaboration There is strength in numbers, and in unity, as members of the Yale Cardiovascular Research Center ( ycvrc ) know. Less than a year after moving into new laboratory space expressly designed to foster collaboration and shared resources, the 16-person team, led by ycvrc Director Michael Simons, m.d. , has received a $9.5 million five-year Program Project Grant ( ppg) from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a component of the National Institutes of Health. The grant will support research on the molecular basis of arteriogenesis\u2014the process by which new arterial blood vessels are formed\u2014with the aim of developing a new framework for drug discovery and other therapeutic advances. Since his arrival at Yale from Dartmouth Medical School in 2008, Simons, a leading researcher on the role of arteriogenesis in cardiovascular diseases, has created a unique scientific climate at the ycvrc that has attracted top scientists he describes as \"stars.\" In turn, the expansion and diversifica - tion of ycvrc faculty has opened up new research directions and new avenues of funding. The new ppg is a concrete recogni - tion of the unusually complementary and interrelated research projects happening at the ycvrc, says Simons, the Robert W. Berliner Professor of Medicine, professor of cell biology, and chief of the Section of Cardiovascular Medicine. It reflects an upward spiral in cardiovascular research at Yale\u2014research that may lead to new arterio - genic therapies for illnesses like atherosclerosis, in which buildup of cholesterol and fatty materials causes an artery wall to thicken, and metabolic syndrome, a combination of medical disorders that can jointly lead to cardiovascu - lar disease and diabetes. \"This would not have happened three years ago,\" he says, \"because we would not have had the people.\" Scientific diversity One of the ycvrc team's greatest strengths is its scientific diversity. For instance, Martin A. Schwartz, ph.d. , profes - sor of medicine and cell biology, is an expert in the way \"fluid shear stress,\" the friction of flowing blood against the endothelium (cells that line all blood vessels), regu - lates their behavior. As part of the new ppg , Schwartz's lab will study how increased flow leads to the growth of new arteries. Recruited to Yale in 2011 from the University of Virginia, Schwartz is one of the newest members of the ycvrc and the ppg team. Shear stress, Schwartz explains, is \"the critical stimu - lus\" in the formation of collateral arteries that grow around blocked arteries, a kind of natural bypass. Following the occurrence of an arterial blockage, as happens in a heart attack, for example, \"some people can make these collateral arteries pretty efficiently, and some people don't,\" he says. The making of these collateral arteries is critical to recovery. For more than 10 years, Schwartz has investigated the mech - anisms underlying this phenomenon experimentally, and he has made real progress. \"We're now at the point where we can apply our understanding to the problem of flow-dependent artery remodeling\" in human patients. Anne Eichmann, ph.d. , m.sc. , professor of medicine, was recruited to the Center in 2010 from the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Eichmann studies the factors that determine where the cells in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels grow. \"We know about the factors that tell endothelial cells how to grow, but we're much less familiar with the cues that tell them where to grow,\" she says. Among Eichmann's other areas of interest is neurovas - cular biology\u2014specifically, to understand how the vascular and nervous systems influence each other's growth and Cardiovascular science as social networkadvances Health & Science News biology, and we're trying to build a program that takes advantage of the expertise Yale has in those fields.\" Eichmann has explored the effects of the interac - tions between nerves and arteries on blood pressure; and another recent recruit, Jean-L\u00e9on Thomas, ph.d. , m.sc. , associate professor of neurology, has pursued research on the relationship between vasculature and brain function. In 2011, Thomas, Eichmann, and colleagues reported in the journal Genes & Development that they had identified stem cells in the brain that replace damaged nervous tis - sue, and that a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) receptor 3 acts directly in these stem cells to stimulate the creation of new nerve cells in adults\u2014findings that have implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Another recent addition to the ycvrc is Karen K. Hirs - chi, ph.d. , professor of cardiology, who joined the faculty in the fall of 2011. Hirschi studies signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell differentiation, specialization, and growth during early vascular development. Her lab is also using this basic biological information to direct the fate of human pluripotent stem cells (both embryonic and in - duced), which can become any cell type, specifically toward vascular cells. Hirschi's aim is to understand how to get human stem cells to efficiently become vascular endothe - lial cells, so they can be used to form new blood vessels in regenerative medicine strategies. Other recent recruits include Daniela C. Tirziu, ph.d. , instructor in medicine, who specializes in cell-to-cell communications in the heart; Daniel Greif, m.d. , assistant professor of medicine, who works on pulmonary artery development and function; Hyung Chun, m.d. , assistant professor of medicine, whose interests // Center (page 6)Assisted reproductive technologies (arts), such as in vitro fertilization, are so established that pregnancy at any age may seem both reasonable and achievable\u2014views that more and more women hold, according to a new report from Yale researchers. The reality is that despite medical advances, women who wait until their early forties to have chil - dren face significant risks of infertility or complications during pregnancy. The new study urges concerted public and professional education to address the \"alarming\" misperceptions of arts. \"We're seeing more and more patients upset after failing in having their own biological child after age 43,\" says Pasquale Patrizio, m.d., m.b.e. , professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences and director of the Yale Fertility Center. In an advance online edition of Fer - tility and Sterility , Patrizio's team writes that among women aged 43 and older employing arts, only about 4 percent eventually give birth, a number 10 times lower than that for women under 35. The researchers urge that women be better informed of these odds, and of the options to cryopreserve their oocytes while at their \"fertility peak years\" (under 35) or use donated oocytes, methods that have achieved high success rates in older women but are lesser-known than other arts.No turning back the biological clockThree genes in a constant interplay with one another determine the fate of embryonic been extensively studied in mice, but little is known about how these genes regulate human stem cells. escs are medically important, because they can differentiate into any of the myriad cell types that make up tissues. Each gene in the Nanog /Oct4 / Sox2 trio plays a vital part in directing cells to commit to one cell fate versus another. Yale Stem Cell Center scientist Natalia Ivanova, ph.d. , assistant profes - sor of genetics, and colleagues mapped out the role of each of these genes in human embryonic stem cells (h escs) by selectively inactivating them during hesc maintenance and differentiation. In the April 6 issue of Cell Stem Cell , Iva- nova and her team report that Nanog , Oct4 , and Sox2 do not have the same functions in h escs and mouse cells. There are restrictions on the use of hescs in research, but \"it is difficult to deduce from the mouse how these cells work in humans,\" says Ivanova. \"Human networks organize themselves quite differently.\" istockphoto Human stem cells play by own rules A legacy of achievement For two centuries, Yale School of Medicine has been a center of important advances in science and medicine.

He saved two patients' lives by donat - ing one of his kidneys and a part of his liver,\" said Emre, chief of the Section of Transplantation Surgery and ynhtc director (donated parts of the liver grow back in donors and grow to the proper size in recipients). Emre pointed out that, like Kiernan, many altruistic donors are veterans, firefighters, or policemen. \"These individuals were on front lines in many life-and-death situ - ations and they know how to sacrifice for others,\" he said. In the U.S., only two percent of organ donations from living patients are altruistic donations. With each step he takes from east to west, Kier - nan, founder of the National Living Organ Donors Foundation, hopes to increase the number of organ dona - tions, from both deceased and living donors, nationwide. After leaving New Haven, Kiernan set off for New York City and expects to arrive in Los Angeles during the first week of July.Cross-campus collaborators work toward the elusive goal of effective treatment, eliminating drug resistance and side effects in the bargain For parasites like those that cause malaria to thrive in the human body, they must produce proteins that drive their growth, reproduction, and nutrition. Existing malaria drugs work by blocking parts of this protein machinery, but the pathogens frequently become resistant to these drugs by evolving ways to block the drugs from binding to or passing through their external membranes. Now, Yale researchers have discovered a different ap - proach that works against malaria parasites and other patho - gens by destroying the genetic material that encodes some of these pathogens' most vital proteins. Over the past few years, Sidney Altman, ph.d. , Sterling Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, has developed a technique to destroy specific pieces of a cell's messenger rna (mrna ) with pmo ) shown that pmo conjugates can kill bacteria, includ - ing E. coli and staph bacteria, by stopping the production of proteins the pathogens require to survive. When the pmo binds its targeted m rna sequence, this structure is recognized by an enzyme in human red blood cells that destroys the m rna , preventing it from being tran - scribed into proteins in the pathogen. \"We think that this technique has general importance and has lots of applications,\" says Altman, who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for helping to establish that rna can act as an enzyme as well as a carrier of genetic information. For the new work, Altman collaborated with malaria expert Choukri Ben Mamoun, ph.d. , associate professor of internal medicine and microbial Ma - moun's postdoctoral , to effective against Plasmodium falciparum , the parasitic species that causes the most severe cases of malaria. As a proof of concept that pmo conjugates could enter P. falciparum cells and cause its m rna to degrade, the team of scientists developed a pmo that binds the m rna coding for an enzyme known as gyrase, the same type of sequence that Altman had targeted in other pathogens. \"There are genes that we know are essential to the parasite but we can't knock them out using classical genetics,\" says Ben Mamoun. \"But using this oligomer, we can block the genes and study what happens.\" As reported in the April 2 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , when the Stopping malaria dead in its tracks where a ceremony for \"Walk of 2012\" took place under the Donate Life flag near the hospital's entrance.

Taylor, m.d. , professor and chief of the Divi - sion of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Repro - ductive Sciences, found that when pregnant mice were exposed to cell phone radiation during pregnancy, their offspring were more hyperactive and forgetful than usual. Taylor and colleagues attached cell phones on active calls\u2014and therefore producing radiation\u2014to the cages of 33 pregnant mice and left them there for the full 17 days of gestation. After the birth of the offspring, the scientists tested the memory, hyperactivity, and anxiety of the newborn mice.

The team also found that certain neurons in the prefrontal cortex of the brains of offspring exposed to radiation had decreased activity, which may explain their behaviors.

Another crucial factor is the \"unique environment\" of the ycvrc, Simons says, a collegial place where \"everybody has a say. People help each other, and we have several fantastic interaction forums.\" These include a weekly faculty gathering held in a purpose-built lunchroom in the center's suite at 300 George Street (see photo). \"If you're there, you could be asked to talk off the cuff about what you do,\" Simons explains. \"All our joint funding has come out of this faculty lunch.\" Cardiovascular medicine is a scientific success story, as research has led to effective medications to manage cholesterol as well as angioplasty and stents, which allow doctors to widen narrow or blocked blood vessels. \"But there has never been a medication that changes the nature of disease,\" Simons says. \"All the currently available treat - ments\u2014and they're very good\u2014do not address the underlying biology of dis - ease, and they basically palliate. The question is: how can you understand what's going on?\" Collaboration ycvrc members collaborate very closely with other groups at the medi - cal school. One notable relationship is that between the ycvrc and the Vas - cular Biology and Therapeutics ( vbt) Program. Formed in 2000, vbt was the medical school's first interdepart - mental research program explicitly focused on translating laboratory discoveries into practical treatments for disease. Now led by William C. Sessa, ph.d. , the Alfred Gilman Pro - fessor of Pharmacology, vbt 's diverse and collaborative design served as a model for the ycvrc , and functions as its \"sister\" program. vbt members meet with ycvrc scientists in regular joint lab meetings. A leading researcher on blood vessel function and vascular disease, Sessa is one of the new ppg 's seven investiga - tors. associate engineering; Laura E. Niklason, m.d. , ph.d. , professor of anesthesiology and of biomedical engineering, a pioneer in tissue engi - neering; and Albert J.

All seven scientists are members of vbt .// Center (from page 3) occur because of dysregulated blood vessel formation\u2014or [as with diseases like \"wet\" macular degeneration], when there's an overgrowth of blood vessels in the eye that inhibits vision.\" In May, the ycvrc and vbt will convene an international neurovascu - lar symposium in New Haven jointly with University College London (ucl) scientists, many of whom \"work on [neurovascular interactions and] eye disease,\" Hirschi says. \"We hope to form collaborations so that we can do studies for eye disease [similar to our studies on the neuro - vasculature of the brain].\" In the area of psychiatry, too, there is much overlap. Thomas, for instance, studies the effects of vegf signaling on behavior, and is working jointly with colleagues in the Department of Psychiatry to gauge the links between vegf and behavioral outcomes like depression and anxiety. \"The symposium enables every - one to share his or her work, get a feel cells. The aim of the new technology \u2014which the scientists hope will be tested in human patients within four years\u2014is to alleviate circulatory prob - lems arising from obstructive blood clots and narrowed blood vessels in patients with coronary stents. The four-year $4.5 million grant is the first ec grant to fund the work of American scientists, Simons says, and could not have been possible without the existence of the Yale ucl Collaborative, which was created in 2010. \"This grant is unique in that it brings together several biotech companies and academic institutions that have complementary expertise,\" Sinusas says. Thanks to advances in genome sequencing technologies, and in particular to state-of-the-art genetic screening capabilities now offered by the Yale Center for Genome Analysis, ycvrc scientists are increasingly able to rely on genetic analyses of indi - vidual patients in conducting basic robert lisak (Above) In the lunch - room at the Yale Cardiovascular Research Center ( ycvrc ), faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students can mingle informally.

The suite's physi - cal design reflects its collaborative culture. research\u2014with the hope that this research can then be brought \"back to the bedside\" as therapy for disease. Cardiovascular genetics efforts at the ycvrc , led by Arya Mani, m.d. , associ - ate professor of medicine and of genet - ics, working together with colleagues from ucl and Yale's Department of Genetics, have already resulted in \"significant new insights in our under - standing of early atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome,\" Simons says. Scientists have traditionally believed that cardiovascular illnesses are caused by numerous small chang - es in many genes. But \"it appears now that there are a number of genes in which a single mutation will give you a significant phenotype,\" Simons says\u2014which increases the odds that scientists can identify the gene vari - ants that cause a particular disease, understand that disease's biology, and find new therapies.\"We see vbt and the ycvrc as a single program, because people in - teract so effectively\u2014at seminars and retreats, and at joint lab meetings,\" Sessa says. \"There are common research interests, and everyone is secure enough with their own work to champion collaborative interac - tions. Michael Simons' recruitment gave us a in cardiology to synergize with.\" Other budding ycvrc collabo - rations involve the Departments of Neurology, Ophthalmology, and Psychiatry. Each month, ycvrc scientists convene with colleagues from the Department of Neurology at a neurovascular meeting to explore the implications of vascular research in the brain. For instance, Jaime Grutzendler, m.d. , associate profes - sor of neurology and neurobiology, studies the brain's microvasculature \u2014its smallest blood vessels\u2014and is interested in \"vascular dementia,\" or the ways neurovascular defects contribute to cognitive decline in the elderly. The expertise of ycvrc scientists like Eichmann, Hirschi, and Thomas, who all work in areas related to neuroscience, is something Grutzendler is now able to tap into. Ophthalmology is closely linked to neurovascular research, says Hirschi, because \"the retina is a neural tissue. Several of us in the ycvrc are inter - ested in ophthalmological disorders that for what everyone else is doing, and identify mutual interests on which we can build joint research programs and training opportunities,\" Hirschi says. Scientists from Yale and ucl are also collaborating on a project recently funded by a European Community (ec) grant, administered by the Eu - ropean Union. Sinusas, Tarek Fahmy, ph.d. , - cal engineering, Simons, and Niklason are working jointly with colleagues at ucl, with U.K.-based Ark Therapeu - tics, and also with teams of scientists in Germany and Finland, to design and test a new technology designed to improve healing around implanted vascular stents. The technology involves using magnetized biodegrad - able stents, which will attract stem cells that have been loaded with iron particles; and, additionally, stents in which viral vectors have been embed - ded, to promote the adhesion of stem terry dagradiMedicine @Yale May 2012 7the ssc includes blood samples and extensive medical information from 2,700 families in which one child has been diagnosed with autism. The families are recruited from 13 clinics across the country, each using the same precise measures to confirm autism diagnoses. Researchers collect blood samples from not only the children with autism, but from parents and unaffected siblings. The term \"simplex\" in the ssc 's name refers to the fact that the collection includes only families with a single child with autism and at least one unaffected child, making it easier to draw precise genetic comparisons between affected and unaffected family members. In a much-publicized study pub - lished April 4 in Nature , State's team screened about 10 percent of ssc par- ticipants. But rather than sequencing the entire genome of each participant, which is for now prohibitively expen - sive, the researchers focused on the \"exome,\" those portions of the genome that code for proteins. By applying this technique to the ssc' s unique population, the research fingered three genes that almost certainly contribute to autism, and about a dozen others that are strong contenders. Two ac - companying papers in Nature turned up yet more candidates. As the cost of genome sequenc - ing continues to plummet, State and others will screen more and more ssc children. Based on previous work and the findings published in Nature , he estimates that the total number of autism-linked genes will hit 500 or more\u2014a greater cause for optimism than it might seem. \"Even though there are many, many regions in the genome involved, I believe they will converge on a small number of // Autism (from page 1) pathways,\" State says. And, he adds, those specific networks will make the best targets for new treatments. The ssc was launched in 2008 to help solve a puzzle. \"We knew that children with autism don't usually get married and don't have children, and yet the rate of autism isn't decreasing,\" says Gerald D. Fischbach, m.d. , scien - tific director of the Simons Founda - tion's Autism Research Initiative. \"So where is it coming from?\" One leading hypothesis was that some portion of autism cases are caused by spontaneous\u2014so-called de novo \u2014genetic variations, rather than those inherited from parents. A 2007 Science paper reported that 10 percent of individuals with autism carry de novo copy number variations (cnv s), stretches of dna that are either deleted or duplicated, compared with just 1 percent of controls. Last year, State's team and an independent group screened the ssc samples for de novo cnv s and confirmed that these variations crop up more often in chil - dren with autism than in controls. But cnv s are large, sometimes encompassing thousands of base pairs of dna and dozens of genes, making it difficult to draw conclusions about which individual genes are implicated in a disease. The new studies, in con - trast, read families' genomes letter-by-letter, so researchers can zoom in on variants affecting just one letter. After screening 928 ssc partici - pants, State and colleagues found 125 single-letter de novo mutations in the children with autism, compared with 87 such mutations in unaffected siblings. That's a statistically signifi - cant difference, but also highlights a basic problem: Since healthy people carry so many mutations that don't seem to do any harm, how do we know which ones in the autism group are important? \"Sorting out the stuff that's damaging from the stuff that's not is extremely difficult,\" State says. \"One of the major preoccupations of the paper was finding an unbiased way of doing that.\" The researchers reasoned that a gene was more likely to be meaning - ful if it carried new mutations in more than one unrelated child with autism. They also placed special focus on mutations that are highly damaging to protein production. Once those criteria were plugged into the proper statistical analyses, from over 238 fam - ilies studied the researchers ended up with just one gene, called scn 2a, that is strongly associated with autism. Another group of researchers, led by Evan Eichler, ph.d. , of the Uni - versity of Washington, did a similar search in a separate group of 677 ssc participants. When State's group applied their statistical approach to the combined data from both stud - ies, three genes made the cut: scn 2a, KATNAL 2 and CHD 8. \"Each one of these genes is a whopper,\" Fischbach says. \"Because of the design of these experiments, using both parents and unaffected siblings, this is about as sure as one can be about a genetic cause.\" These gene candidates have intriguing biological roles in brain cells. scn 2a, for exam - ple, makes a protein that helps control the transmission of electrical impulses across nerve cell membranes; a hand - ful of people with epilepsy or intel - lectual disability have been reported to carry glitches in the gene. State, Eichler, and Michael Wigler, ph.d. , of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are working on sequencing five years she had discovered \"initiator regions,\" sites in messenger rna (mrna ) strands that mark where the cell's protein-making machinery begins translating m rna into proteins. In a classic paper pub- lished five years later, Steitz showed that rna -protein complexes in the cell nucleus called sn rnp s are critical to \"splicing,\" by which non-coding sequences are excised from pre- mrna to form m rna . In the decades since, rna biology has exploded, and Steitz continues to explore rna 's diverse and powerful roles in the cell.\"Dean Alpern envisioned an envi - ronment where new faculty members are free to work on their best ideas,\" says McCluskey, whose new gift brings the total number of Yale Scholar funds to eight. \"I am happy to name this new fund in honor of Joan Steitz, a scientist who exemplifies the power of original thinking.\" To sustain the funds, gifts like McCluskey's two $2.5 million donations establishing Yale Scholar Funds are matched by a commitment from Yale University\u2014evidence of the program's importance to recruit - ing and jump-starting research. // Scholar (from page 1) a fifth year of medical school for research, expanded Student Research Day\u2014an annual event at which students present their work in posters and oral presenta - tions to peers and faculty\u2014and \"created ideal faculty-student pairs,\" Forrest says. Those student-faculty matches allowed students like Obinwanne Ugwonali, m.d. '99, to find the link between yams and twin births through research in Nigeria, and Khoonyen Tay, m.d. '06, to explore the options for treating a middle ear infection in children. At its founding, the Office of Student Research had limited fund - ing, and could only support student research during the first summer of medical school. Today, the office funds students during periods of research throughout medical school, typically during the summer between the first and second years, but often extending to a fifth year. Each year more than 200 students receive fund - ing from Forrest's office, mostly via an nih Training Grant that has been con - tinuously renewed for 25 years. Also providing funding are Yale's Clinical and Translational Science Award from the nih, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Sarnoff Cardiovascular Research Foundation, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and donations to Yale from individuals. A recent re - application for the nih training grant earned a perfect score, which Forrest // Student research (from page 1) says is a testament to the faculty-student pairs and the volume and quality of publications and national presentations arising from Yale medi - cal students' research. The budget for the Office of Student Research now exceeds $2.5 million per year. Under Forrest's leadership, Student Research Day has been transformed into an eagerly anticipated annual event. \"In the 60s and 70s,\" he says, \"there was a modest student research afternoon where the prize-winning thesis was presented.\" Today, the event (held this year on May 8) includes a poster session with about 90 post - ers, oral presentations by authors of the highest-rated theses, and the Farr Lecture, which has featured scientific leaders, including Nobel laureates. Hardean Achneck, m.d. '05, now assistant professor of surgery at Duke University School of Medicine, credits his fifth year at Yale with teaching him to think like a researcher.\"The general principles that have helped me in my research career basically started with research at Yale,\" says Achneck, who still considers his faculty advisor, John Elefteriades, m.d., professor and chief of cardiothoracic surgery, a mentor. \"It's often a lifelong friendship that's formed between the mentor and the student with publications, presen - tations, and all the like that follow,\" Forrest says. \"It is that faculty-student pair that deserves the emphasis and the celebration.\" the rest of the participants in the ssc, and based on the mutation rate reported in the Nature papers, they estimate they will find at least 25 genes solidly linked to autism in the ssc alone. What's still unclear, however, is how much of the broader popula - tion of children with autism may also carry glitches in these genes\u2014or how many of these genes will also figure into other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There's also the more mysterious issue of environmental and develop - mental contributions to developmen - tal disorders. And all three Nature papers shed light on a factor that's been much talked-about: paternal age. The data show that as the age of the father increases, so does the number of spontaneous mutations carried by his child, which makes sense since sperm tend to acquire more genetic muta - tions as a man ages. \"It's a very strong correlation\u2014there's no question,\" State says. Still, a father's age probably plays a minor role in overall autism risk. The average age of men when they fathered children with autism was only 1.1 years higher than when they fathered unaffected siblings. And when paternal age was left out of the analysis, children with autism were still found to carry more mutations than unaffected siblings. But State sees a broader lesson to be learned from this finding. \"It shows that as you get more insight at the molecular level, you can begin to un - derstand what mechanisms might be behind some of these environmental influences,\" he says. \"As you move for - ward in clarifying the genetics, you're also going to clarify the environmental factors, and vice versa.\"\"A Yale Scholar Award allows a new scientist to gain traction on a research idea even if it is not a con - ventional one,\" Alpern says. \"A Yale Scholar has the latitude to take novel approaches, to adopt new techniques or to work at the intersection of disciplines where it is harder to find grants. By year five the researcher should be well positioned to attract his or her own funding.\" Today, Ivanova continues her work at the Yale Stem Cell Center (see \"Advances,\" page 3), and her position as a McCluskey Scholar has passed to Andrew Goodman, ph.d. , assistant professor of microbial pathogenesis, who studies microbial communities in the human gut. \"I am deeply grateful to Mr. McCluskey for his generous sup - port,\" Alpern says. \"Natalia Ivanova and Andrew Goodman are at the start of a long line of distinguished McCluskey Scholars, and by Sep - tember we will announce our first Steitz Scholar.
