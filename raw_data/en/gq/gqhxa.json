The U.S. Department of Labor defines naturopathic physicians as doctors who \"diagnose, treat, and help prevent diseases using a system of practice that is based on the natural healing capacity of individuals. May use physiological, psychological or mechanical methods. May also use natural medicines, prescription or legend drugs, foods, herbs, or other natural remedies.\" Most naturopathic physicians provide natural medicine primary care through office-based, private practice. Many receive additional training in disci - plines or modalities such as acupuncture and East Asian medicine. Naturopathic diagnosis and therapeutics are sup- ported by scientific research drawn from peer-reviewed journals from many disciplines, including naturo - pathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complementary medicine, clinical nutrition, phyto-therapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. Information technology and new concepts in clinical outcomes assessment are par-ticularly well-suited to evaluating the effectiveness of naturopathic treatment protocols and are being used in research, both at naturopathic medical schools and in the offices of practicing physicians. Clinical research into natural therapies has become an increasingly important focus for naturopathic physicians.SCHOOL OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINEsChool of naturoP athIC medICIne64 prograM outcoMeS A naturopathic medicine graduate of Bastyr University's School of Naturopathic Medicine will: Demonstrate an appropriate level of knowledge in both in basic, biomedical and clinical sciences. Demonstrate the ability to apply clinical skills in the care of patients to the standards of a primary care naturopathic physician as defined by the profession. Demonstrate the ability to apply the philoso- phy and principles of naturopathic medicine in the care of patients. Demonstrate a commitment to the highest levels of ethics and professionalism by behaving with honesty and integrity in all interactions with patients, their families, other health care professionals, and others they interact with in the course of their professional career. Demonstrate an ability to apply evidence informed practice efficiently and effectively in patient-care settings. priNcipleS of Naturopathic MediciNe The underpinnings of naturopathic medical practice are embodied in six principles: 1. First Do No Harm - primum non nocere 2. The Healing Power of Nature - vis medicatrix naturae 3. Discover and T reat the Cause, Not Just the Effect - tolle causam 4. T reat the Whole Person - tolle totum 5. The Physician is a Teacher - docere 6. Prevention is the best \"cure\" - praevenire Scope of practice Naturopathic medicine is defined by principles, rather than by methods or modalities. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are diverse. The current scope of practice for a naturopathic physician varies by jurisdiction. However, the accredited naturopath-ic programs all train primary care physicians who diagnose, treat and manage patients with acute and chronic medical conditions and diagnoses. This may include, but is not limited to: nutritional science, natural hygiene, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine, homeopathy, counseling, spiri-tuality, minor office procedures and methods of laboratory and clinical diagnosis. The scope of practice is defined by state or provincial statute. The curriculum at Bastyr University matches the require-ments listed by the Washington State Department of Health. Students have the responsibility to become informed on licensure and scope of practice in the legal jurisdiction in which they choose to practice. legal StatuS of Naturopathic MediciNe Naturopathic physicians are licensed or registered as health care providers in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Legal provisions allow the prac-tice of naturopathic medicine in several other states. Efforts to gain licensure elsewhere are currently un-derway. Forty-two states and territories in the United States have professional associations for naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic medicine is regulated in the following Canadian provinces: Alberta, British Co-lumbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Saskatchewan. The Naturopathic Doctors Act of 2008 grants title protec - tion for naturopathic doctors in Nova Scotia. There are 11 provincial and territorial professional associations. Naturopathic MediciNe liceNSure requireMeNt S All states and provinces with licensure laws require completion of a residential program of at least four years and 4,100 hours of study from a college or university recognized by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). A copy of the CNME Hand-book of Accreditation is available in the Bastyr Library and online at www.cnme.org. To qualify for a license, the applicant must satisfactorily pass the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX), which include basic sciences, diagnostic and therapeutic subjects, and clinical sciences. Applicants must satisfy all licensing requirements for the state or province to which they have applied. The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program is accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). profeSSioNal orgaNizatioNS The American Association of Naturopathic Phy- sicians, based in Washington, D.C., represents the interests of the profession of naturopathic medicine in the U.S. The Canadian Association of Naturo-pathic Doctors is the professional association in Canada.

The information below refers only to the naturopathic medicine program. Naturopathic MediciNe prerequiSiteS In selecting applicants for admission, the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program seeks those qualities of motivation, intellect and character essential to becoming a physician. Applicants are considered on the basis of academic performance, maturity and demonstrated humanitarian qualities. Work and/or volunteer experience in health care, coupled with an awareness of the field of natural medicine, is strongly recommended. The following coursework is the minimum required preparation for the study of naturopathic medicine. Applicants may apply with coursework still in progress, but prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Please note: If in doubt about a specific prerequisite, contact an admissions advisor before taking the course. The admissions office may require a course descrip- tion to verify content. Descriptions may be emailed, faxed or sent by regular mail. Overall Preparation Completion of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college/university is required. No specific major is advised. In addition to a strong preparation in the sciences, a broad background in the humanities and liberal arts is encouraged. Prerequisite coursework is used to determine a student's preparation for the na-turopathic program. No credit is given for prerequisite coursework earning a C- or lower. Students submitting prerequisite coursework with grades of P (passing) may be required to submit additional information to demonstrate their competency in that subject. Prerequisite Coursework College-level Algebra .............................................. 1 course Chemistry (science-major level) ................. at least 4 courses Must include a minimum of either two sequential courses in organic chemistry or one course in organic chemistry and one course in biochemistry. The chemistry sequence should include an introduction to biological molecules. (The stan-dard prerequisite for science-major level organic chemistry is one year of general chemistry.) Appropriate lab work required. General Biology (science-major level) ..... 2 semesters or 3 quarters Must cover concepts in cellular biology and genetics. Appro- priate lab work required. Individual courses in the biological sciences may count if the above competencies are met, i.e., anatomy, physiology, microbiology and botany. Physics ................................................ 1 college-level course Course must be algebra-based; calculus-based is also ac-cepted. Lab is not required. Psychology .............................................................. 1 course Introduction to Psychology is recommended. Strongly Recommended Courses Though not required for admission, the faculty recommends that students complete biochemistry, anatomy and physiology, and botany coursework in addition to the prerequisite requirements. These courses will substantially enhance students' ability to master the naturopathic course material. Other Suggested CoursesBiomedical ethics, philosophy of science, public speaking and English composition. Age of Course Required chemistry and biology courses not taken within seven years of matriculation into the program are subject to review by the admissions committee. Additional coursework may be required. Credit by ExaminationApplicants may submit AP , IB and CLEP scores for prerequisite consideration for math, psychology and physics. Students who have had prior AP or IB coursework in chemistry and biology may submit AP or IB scores for biology or chemistry exams. Students must submit either the original score received directly from the testing center, or a copy of their high school or college transcripts showing the score results. Since so few high school or col-lege transcripts show score results, it may be most expedient to automatically request test scores be sent from the testing center. Decisions regarding credit are assessed on a case-by-case basis. The admissions committee reviews test scores within the context of an applicant's academic history. All equivalency deci-sions made by the admissions committee are final. required aBilitieS /SkillS for Naturopathic MediciNe prograM adMiSSioN Bastyr University is committed to providing equal opportunities for differently-abled people. The fol-lowing policy has been adapted from the American Association of Medical Colleges guidelines to ensure sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne66 that prospective students have the physical and mental capacities to perform the required duties of a naturopathic physician: A candidate for the naturopathic medicine degree must be able to demonstrate appropriate observa-tional and communication skills, motor function, intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. Techno-logical compensation can be made for some disabili-ties in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Observation: The candidate must be able to ob- serve demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candi-date must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication: A candidate must be able to speak, hear and observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication in-cludes not only speech, but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effec-tively and efficiently in English in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient mo - tor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should have the manual dexterity to be able to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as blood draw, urinalysis, read electrocardiograms (ECGs) and X-rays, and be able to reposition a patient. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways and the suturing of simple wounds. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quan- titative Abilities: These abilities include measure - ment, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of physi-cians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In ad-dition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to dis-play flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and educational processes. adMiSSioNS criteria The admissions committee of the naturopathic medicine program determines the processes and pro - cedures that guide the selection of candidates for the naturopathic program. The committee reviews under-graduate and graduate (if applicable) academic records and performance in the required prerequisite courses. The personal statement, references, resumes and in-person interviews are also evaluated for evidence of the abilities and skills required of naturopathic physicians. The interview also explores the candidate's awareness of the practice of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program is academically challenging. While no minimum GPA is specified, the mean GPA for entering students in the last five years has exceeded 3.3 for both overall GPA and prerequisite course GPA. iNtervie WS Qualified applicants who submit complete ap- plications and meet the prerequisites may be invited to interview. Applicants are expected to interview at sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne67 the campus to which they apply, either in Kenmore or San Diego. A limited number of exceptions are made to accommodate special circumstances. traNSfer StudeNt S Bastyr University accepts transfer students from natu- ropathic, medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools, and other accredited professional programs, on a space-available basis. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency or from an institution accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). T ransfer students are considered for admis-sion in accordance with the following general guidelines: Applicants must meet the same entrance re- quirements as candidates for the first-year class. Applicants who wish to transfer credits from prior coursework must demonstrate satisfactory completion of courses that are equivalent in con-tent and quality to courses given at the University. Satisfactory completion equals a grade of achieved competency, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. Applicants must provide an official transcript from the college or program from which the transfer is being requested; it should demonstrate that they are leaving in good academic standing. They should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Transfer applicants must submit a $150 transfer evaluation fee. advaNced StaNdiNg StatuS BaSed oN prior Medical educatioN Applicants who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced stand-ing status. Those applicants who graduated from accredited chiropractic, medical or osteopathic col-leges may be eligible for advanced standing in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. All advanced standing students must complete at least two-thirds of the program and do all of their clinical work at Bastyr University. They are eligible for a maximum of 103 credits toward advanced standing. In those instances where the maximum number of advanced standing transfer credits is granted, it will take a minimum of three years (11 quarters) to complete the program. Placement de-pends upon the amount of coursework completed in the original program, similarity of the course content and credits, age of the courses and perfor-mance in these courses. A student must provide documentation that shows the competencies of the Bastyr University course have been met. Course waivers and/or credit transfers are considered only for those courses in which applicants demonstrate a grade of achieved competence, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. An exam to determine competency may also be required. Advanced standing applicants must complete all of the course and credit requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. Final waiver and/or transfer credit decisions rest with the dean of the school in which the curriculum is taught. Advanced standing is determined on a case- by-case basis and depends on the type of degree program completed, the courses taken and the number of years in practice. Applicants who are eligible for advanced standing must submit a $150 advanced standing evaluation fee. Applicants must submit a catalog of course descriptions for the years they attended their pro-fessional program and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Additionally, advanced standing stu-dents should submit a copy of their medical license and a copy of their medical board exam scores/certificates (if applicable). If an advanced standing student is found to be deficient in some area(s) of study, s/he may be required to complete additional courses at Bastyr University. For more information on advanced standing status admission policies and procedures, contact the admissions office. iNtegrated curriculuM deSigN The naturopathic medicine program at Bastyr University is taught in a systems-based approach designed to provide integration across scientific disciplines and between biomedical and clinical sci-ences. It fosters the development of critical clinical reasoning through an active learning environment. Naturopathic medical students are expected to be able to preview learning materials and gain a basic understanding before coming to class to apply the information (the \"flipped classroom\"). The inte-grated curriculum also takes advantage of hybrid learning in which online educational technologies provide the student with flexible learning time and varied methods of instruction to support different types of learners. Students entering this program should be com- fortable with computer technologies and programs. It is strongly advised to have a personal computing device with Internet access and the common word processing and associated programs in order to fully participate in hybrid learning. sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne68 BaSic ScieNceS curriculuM WithiN Naturopathic MediciNe Basic and biomedical science modules within the naturopathic medicine program provide integration across science disciplines and with clinical course-work. First year basic science modules provide a foundation of core principles in anatomy, histology, embryology, biochemistry and physiology that are integrated in the context of body systems. Second year modules use the systems approach to integrate the principles of pathology, immunology and infec-tious diseases. Throughout the curriculum, science concepts are applied to clinical situations through integrated case discussions. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr Uni-versity's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become to-tally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers science courses that satisfy prerequisite requirements, including courses in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. couNSeliNg aNd health pSychology curriculuM WithiN Naturopathic MediciNe The counseling and health psychology curriculum serves naturopathic medical students in understand-ing and effecting change in the emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions of human functioning. The naturopathic medicine program includes six core counseling and health psychology courses. These courses are designed to build the following competencies: Study of the nature and process of healing Development of therapeutic counselor character- istics and communication skills Development of comfort in the role of counseling physician and a sense of counseling style and skill Ability to select and implement holistic counseling interventions and strategies Ability to assess and stimulate psychological well- ness Ability to understand and utilize the body/mind/ spirit interaction in the healing process Ability to assess psychological functioning and make clinical judgments regarding the appro-priateness of treating individuals in naturopathic practice Ability to make appropriate psychological referrals Naturopathic principles and cross-cultural per- spectives are woven throughout all counseling and health psychology courses in the naturopathic medicine program. For additional counseling and health psychol- ogy courses available as electives to matriculated students, please see the course listings in this catalog or the current quarterly schedule of classes. Note: The scope of practice for NDs in California does not allow for therapeutic counseling that is within the scope of licensed counselors. However, the skills and techniques needed for motivating life style change and supporting mind/body wellness are within the California ND scope. DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE PROGRAM BotaNical MediciNe (For Department of Botanical Medicine Mission and Vision, see page 74.) Botanical medicine is a core modality for naturo- pathic physicians to use in optimizing the health and well-being of their patients. Medicinal plants have been used as food and medicine by all peoples on all continents. The importance of plants to humans has been recorded in cave paintings 60,000 years old. A contemporary renaissance in herbal medicine weds traditional use and wisdom with modern analytical methodologies for optimal medical applications for today. Empirical knowledge of plant therapeutics is based on Western and holistic thought, rather than reductionist paradigms, and is linked with contem - porary scientific knowledge. The core curriculum in botanical medicine for naturopathic medical students covers fundamental plant identification and nomenclature, pharmacog-nosy, therapeutic actions, extraction principles, dosage considerations, contraindications, toxicology, herb-drug interactions, clinical applications and treatment regimens. Clinical therapeutics draws from traditional uses, naturopathic formulae and use, and from in-ternational scientific and clinical research, as well as sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne69 advances in phytotherapy. Herbal medicine making is incorporated into the third year systems modules, which focus on treatment. Completion of the required curriculum, along with the required clinical experi-ence, prepares the student for effective and safe clinical utilization of preventive and therapeutic botanicals. A variety of botanical medicine elective and special topic courses are offered to students in the naturo-pathic medicine program and other programs, along with independent study options. The Bastyr University Gardens are managed by the botanical medicine department, with support from the University and donations. They are maintained primar-ily by the garden supervisor, assistant supervisors and work-study students. The botanical medicine depart-ment continues to build an herbarium, although the vast University of Washington herbarium is used as one of Bastyr's teaching venues. The department supports a botanical medicine lab to expand class experience and provide a space for students to continue exploring their work and passion for herbs. hoMeopathic MediciNe Homeopathic medicine is a broad therapeutic modality that is integral to naturopathic medicine. Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. This principle states that a substance that is capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure an ill patient presenting a similar pattern of disease symptoms. Homeopathic medicines stimulate a person's inherent defense mechanism. The entire range of mental, emotional and physi-cal symptoms is considered with each patient. A single medicine is then chosen that addresses the complex pattern of the patient, while emphasizing the uniqueness of the individual. The homeopathic curriculum at Bastyr Univer- sity includes the basic principles and philosophy of homeopathy, materia medica of commonly used homeopathic medicines, use of the homeo-pathic repertory, taking a homeopathic case and homeopathic case analysis. Practical therapeutics for common medical conditions are incorporated into the systems modules in the third year, focused on treatment. phySical MediciNe Physical medicine is an integral part of naturo- pathic medicine. It includes various modalities, such as hydrotherapy, osseous and soft-tissue manipula-tion, sports medicine and therapeutic exercise. The course of study and clinical training in physical medicine enable students to develop a solid foun-dation for entry into the practice of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum offers sufficient hours in manipulation to satisfy the state of Washington's licensing requirement as a naturopathic physician. The physical medicine curriculum begins by teaching students the art of touch and palpation, introduction to basic Swedish massage techniques and soft-tissue manipulation, and then progresses to osseous manipulation. SuMMer MaSSage iNteNSive Bastyr University, Bellevue Massage School Cen- ter for Healing Arts and International Professional School of Bodywork in San Diego offer students a summer massage training program that allows them to apply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the state requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. Students interested in further information may meet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office or with their department's program supervi-sor to discuss program availability and the course prerequisites. Naturopathic MediciNe cliNic eNtraNce prerequiSiteS Naturopathic medicine students must complete and achieve competency in all required classes prior to entering clinical training. Questions about didac-tic prerequisites for clinical ND training should be addressed to the registrar's office on campus. Students must also have completed TB screening, received a hepatitis B vaccination or signed a waiver, have a current CPR card, and submit to a national criminal background check. The criminal background check will be conducted prior to enrolling in clinical shifts. For more information, see \"Felony Conviction Dis-closure and Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. cliNic requireMeNt S Students in the four-year program will begin clinical training in their first year. Clinical training begins with observation, in which the student fol-lows supervisors through their rotations. The next year clinical training builds to active observation, with clinical skills demonstrated by the student and evaluated by the supervisor. The training supports the students to gradually and continually develop sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne70 and expand their clinical skills and competence throughout their roles as early, intermediate and experienced student clinicians. Students are required to successfully complete a minimum of 1,208 hours of clinical training. graduatioN requireMeNt S The curriculum of the naturopathic medicine program requires completion of 302 credits for graduation. This includes 242 core course credits, eight (8) elective credits and 52 clinical credits. Stu-dents must achieve competency (grade of AC) in all 302 credits required in the curriculum. Students must complete all required clinical competencies in order to graduate. Students must complete at least two-thirds of their credits in residence at Bastyr University. electiveS Students in the naturopathic medicine program are required to complete eight (8) elective credits (included in the 302 credit totals) during their course of study. Up to five (5) of these credits may be satis-fied by independent study. It is recommended that elective credits be spread out over the length of the student's program. Courses designated as elective and special topics may fulfill this eight-credit requirement, as well as additional clinic shifts during the student's clinical training. A maximum of five (5) elective cred-its from any one discipline may be used to satisfy the naturopathic medicine program elective requirement. The rule of a five-credit maximum does not apply to elective credits being taken to satisfy waived credits. Elective credits covering waived course credits may be from any discipline. A student may take elective credits from any program/department. Naturopathic MediciNe prograM trackS Students who are accepted into the program and decide not to complete the program in four years must choose one of the following approved options: Extended Track-Option Extended Dual-Degree OptionAt the time of enrollment, naturopathic medi - cine students are registered for the four-year track. Students in their pre-clinical training who wish to change to an extended track must complete the ND change of status form (available in the registrar's of-fice) and then meet with their registrar advisor, room 249. Changes may affect financial aid packages as well as the sequencing of courses. This five-year track extends the first two years of pre-clinical training into three years. As long as a student remains on an approved program track, there should be no course scheduling conflicts. Students must remain on track in order to graduate on time. Students may not register off track or ahead of track without approval from the Associate Academic Dean. dual degree optioNS There are a number of dual degree options that al- low students in the naturopathic medicine program to earn a second degree. Students in good standing wishing to pursue a dual degree are strongly encour-aged to complete the biomedical sciences while on a four-year track. A second program will extend the time you will be at Bastyr and will most likely extend the time you spend in your original program by a year or more. Most of the dual degree programs en-able graduating with the ND and a master's degree in a total of five (5) years, if the student stays on track. The midwifery dual track is a minimum of six (6) years. Currently there are dual degree options with the following programs: Acupuncture, Acupuncture and East Asian Medicine, Ayurvedic Sciences, Counseling and Health Psychology and Midwifery. For additional information regarding the dual degrees, please contact the admissions department. The following curriculum tables list the tenta- tive schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact hours for the course over the entire quarter (Tot.). doctor of Naturopathic MediciNe prograM 2014-2015 FOUR-YEAR TRACk YEAR I Qtr.Cat.

BotaNical MediciNe departMeNt viSioN We facilitate learning about plants and plant-centered medicine, guiding students to apply this knowledge to-ward growing, harvesting, manufacturing and clinical practice. The inclusive range of knowledge runs from tra-ditional wisdom to contemporary scientific information, emphasizing critical and creative thought and discovery. The Bachelor of Science with a Major in Herbal Sciences is designed to provide a thorough, scientifi-cally rigorous and inspiring exploration of herbalism and its applications. The curriculum of the herbal sciences major does not include the diagnosis and treatment of disease, but rather introduces the stu-dent to concepts of disease prevention and health maintenance using medicinal herbs. The curriculum addresses economic, historical and sociopolitical perspectives regarding herbal sciences. Addition - ally, issues related to herbal product manufacturing and quality assurance/quality control introduce the analytical aspects of herbs and herbal products. This program offers a substantial breadth of perspectives and approaches in the herbal sciences. The program is based upon scientific inquiry in the herbal sciences. Students take courses in Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Bio-chemistry and Botany during the first year of this program. Beginning in the first year, and heavily concentrated in the second year, are courses exploring various aspects of the herbal sciences. Introduction to Herbal Sciences, Herbal Preparations, and Herbal Medicine History and T raditions lay a foundation in the junior year. In Research Methods for Herbal Sciences, students learn to interpret scientific litera-ture on medicinal herbs. In Ethnobotany, the door opens to the connection between people and plants in indigenous cultures, old and new. The senior year includes Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy and Medici-nal Actions of a core of Materia Medica, deepening the knowledge base. Northwest Herbs and First Aid for Herbalists lend hands-on experiences. In additional courses, students become familiar with environmental, economic and political issues sur-rounding the herbal sciences. There are electives available that cover a wide array of topics including diverse field courses. Additionally, students are required to complete a 44-hour practicum with herbal manufacturers, herb growers, wildcrafters, practitioners or researchers. Upon completion of this program, each student is uniquely qualified to enter the herbal industry, enter a clinically based program or pursue further educa-tion in a related field. adMiSSioN For general information on the admissions pro- cess, please refer to the Admissions section in this catalog.
