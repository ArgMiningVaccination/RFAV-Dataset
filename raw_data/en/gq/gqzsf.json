This slow-growing plant comes in two colors, white and red depending on how it is grown. And there are two main varieties, Asian and American, that have different active components. The Asian variety has a revitalizing effect, according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginseng-benefits), while the American variety can help with relaxation and calm. You can use fresh ginseng or powdered in soups or [teas](/articles/9-teas-to-suit-your-every-mood). The herb is also available as a supplement or oil. While ginseng has been used in [traditional Chinese medicine](/articles/5-healthy-habits-from-traditional-chinese-medicine), and natural healing, there are medicinal benefits that have been proven by modern science. Here are five health benefits to explore: Contains Powerful Antioxidants [Ginseng](/articles/5-ancient-approaches-to-wellness-that-still-apply-today) contains the plant compounds, ginsenosides and gintonin, that are powerful antioxidants that can help reduce oxidative damage to your cells that contribute to chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. A 2016 [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27616903/) of studies concluded that people who take ginseng supplements have a 16 percent lower risk of developing cancer. The ginsenosides in this healing herb also reduce inflammation, according to [Medical News Today.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262982) That's because the antioxidant can target the pathways in your immune system that could reduce [inflammation](/articles/11-fantastic-foods-that-reduce-inflammation-naturally) due to injuries. Helps to Boost Immunity This healing herb also contains anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal properties according to Healthline. This could help boost your [immune system](/articles/7-herbs-to-strengthen-resilience), which is very important as the flu and cold season is beginning. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4072342/) published in the International Journal of Molecular Medicine that was conducted on mice suggested that there is a possible link between ginseng and the prevention of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, but more research is needed. Helps Improves Focus Ginseng may help you concentrate and could improve brain functions like memory and mood, according to Medical News Today. The healing herb could actually help to improve [cognitive function](/articles/new-research-may-help-age-related-cognitive-function) due to aging or dementia. A 2016 [study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2015.0265?journalCode=acm) published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine of patients with Alzheimer's disease, showed improved frontal brain lobe function after 12 weeks of using red Asian ginseng. Could Lower Blood Sugar Healing ginseng can also be beneficial in controlling blood sugar levels in people with both type 1 and type 2 [diabetes](/articles/12-tasty-food-choices-for-diabetics) suggested Medical News today. That's because American and Asian ginseng were shown to improve pancreatic cell function (and insulin production), according to a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33437155/) that showed a connection between the antioxidants in the herb and lowered oxidative stress. Increases Energy Levels Asian ginseng has also been shown to help ease fatigue and increase energy levels by increasing energy production in the cells, according to Healthline. It is so effective that it could actually improve the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. A [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27822924/) of more than 155 studies also showed that besides reducing fatigue, ginseng could enhance physical performance. "}
