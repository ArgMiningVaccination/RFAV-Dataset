These one-year projects were selected from a pool of twenty-one applications through a rigorous review process, and are the first funded in a [new collaborative research initiative](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fumaine.edu%2Fnews%2Fblog%2F2020%2F06%2F22%2Fumaine-nu-launch-new-collaborative-research-program%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ca.ramos%40northeastern.edu%7C11d376c53b6f4cec903d08d8711ab672%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637383706824182395%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=dEBPwcIJLHBqLQJzoh71PJNG4zqaFgF6BUTB6VrpNfY%3D&reserved=0) established between the two universities. Each team has been awarded $50,000, and will work together to pursue larger external funding programs through federal and private sponsors. David Luzzi, Senior Vice Provost for Research and Vice President of Northeastern's Innovation Campus at Burlington, Massachusetts, emphasized the influential nature of this initiative: \"In today's world of complex, interdisciplinary challenges, partnerships bring together researchers with complimentary expertise that accelerate research progress. This program taps the diverse, deep expertise at our institutions. In addition to funding five impactful projects in the areas of human health and sustainability, the program has resulted in many more new collaborations that will drive progress against important societal challenges for Maine and globally.\" Kody Varahramyan, UMaine Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School, applauded the researchers. \"As manifested by the five selected joint research initiatives, faculty from both institutions should be commended for developing such high-impact projects of significant social and economic benefit to Maine and beyond,\" he said. Northeastern and UMaine began to explore formal partnerships in areas of shared expertise and significance \u2014 artificial intelligence (AI), Earth and climate sciences, health and life sciences, manufacturing and marine science \u2014 after the formation of The Roux Institute at Northeastern University was announced in January 2020. Officials signed a research agreement between the two universities in May, and a request for seed grant proposals followed in June. The Roux Institute seeks to build expertise at the intersection of humans and machines. The focus dovetails into the Artificial Intelligence Initiative and other strengths of the University of Maine, the state's research university. \"It is part of the Roux Institute's mission to help build the Maine tech and life science economy with the power of Northeastern's research and learning enterprise,\" said Michael Pollastri, Senior Vice Provost for Portland and Academic Lead for the Roux Institute. \"The projects we are funding through this program highlight the exciting complementarity between the research ecosystems at the University of Maine and at Northeastern University - and this type of complementarity will quickly drive us forward in our mission.\" Following are the projects and the collaborating researchers: - A Novel Adjuvant for Aquaculture Vaccines Using Engineered Bacteria Targeting the STING Pathway Collaborators are Jiahe Li, assistant professor of bioengineering at Northeastern;
