Ayurveda, the ancient system of medicine that dates back to more than two millennia and has millions of followers and practitioners across the world is believed to have been passed from Gods. Dhanwantri or Divodasa was the name of the sage who was given the knowledge of Ayurveda, who, in turn, passed the same to the other practitioners. This ancient system of medicine is still being practised across the globe and has different regional elements to it, for example, Indian, Greek, Chinese, and lots more. India was the place of origin of Ayurveda, and, currently, has many distinct regional aspects across the various States. Of all the places, the Himalayan belt and Kerala have still retained the original and unabridged essence of Ayurveda intact for generations. [Ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda/ayurveda-packages-in-kerala) include rejuvenation packages, destress programmes, relaxation packages, detoxification, etc. Before we dive deep into the various regional forms of Ayurveda and what makes them so popular, let us move ahead to learn a bit more about the system of medicine. As per Ayurveda, there are three Doshas or body dispositions, namely -Vata, Pitta and Kapha. When all three of them are balanced, the body stays in a healthy condition. Aggravation or alleviation of any one or more of these Doshas leads to diseases. Further, in Ayurveda, all the diseases are linked to the food we consume and our digestive system, and almost all of the diseases originate in the stomach or Jathar. If you eat stale food; highly spicy food; deep-fried and too greasy food and foods that are opposing in nature together, your body Doshas get disturbed or imbalanced leading to various diseases. This is why Ayurvedic treatment packages and therapies in Kerala play a high importance on lifestyle and diet for complete recovery. Further, in Ayurveda, if you eat foods that aggravate or alleviate your body disposition, your health will falter. For example, a person with Kapha disposition should refrain from eating cold foods in general, and especially in the winter season. This will lead to cold, cough, fever, body aches, stomach-ache and runny nose etc. Similarly, a person with Pitta disposition should eat bland and natural or whole foods. Eating spicy, processed or fried foods will lead to acidity, heartburn, digestive disorders and may have adverse effects on kidneys and liver. So, all in all, as per Ayurveda, all diseases start with the food you eat and the kind of lifestyle you have. In fact, the reputed practitioners also believe that your thought process, sleep patterns, entertainment preferences and your behaviour also have a strong influence and impact on your health. Having grasped the basic overview of Ayurveda, let us move ahead and find out some more interesting facts. You should not eat curd at night as it aggravates Kapha. The [Ayurvedic system of medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda) is based on 100% natural remedies and links all diseases and disorders to the lifestyle and eating habits. Hence, the medicines have no side effects and can generally be taken along with any other medicines. Also, Ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala and Ayurvedic medicines are formulated using natural and 100% organic herbs and extracts. Another interesting aspect of the Ayurvedic medicines is that they work on the root cause of the diseases rather than the symptoms. This makes it way better and more effective as compared to the allopathic and other systems of medicine. Many people believe that Ayurveda is of little importance when it comes to surgeries and other complex medical procedures. However, they tend to forget that the very first operations, surgeries and skin grafts were performed by Sushruta - the ancient [Indian Ayurvedic practitioner](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/team). He even used big ants to seal the wounds and cut layers of skin and tissues. The ants used to claw the torn or cut parts together and dissolved over time naturally inside the body. His treatise on Ayurvedic medicine is still an inspiration for the Ayurveda followers across the globe. One major thing that makes Ayurveda this important is that the medicines are prescribed after doing a complete assessment of the human body, its disposition, lifestyle, gender and even age. So, the medicine for cold and cough will vary in dosage and contents from person to person. This brings us to yet another important thing to discuss, the Ayurveda system of medicine and treatment package in Kerala - nature of the foods and herbs. In Ayurveda, every food is considered to have a certain nature. For example ginger produces heat, small cardamom has a cooling effect, mangoes produce heat in the body when eaten without milk and onions and garlic also produce internal heat! These differences in the nature of food substances are the reasons why practitioners prescribe different medicines for different people based on their living conditions and surroundings. Ayurveda - How does the practitioner proceed with the disease diagnosis and treatments? Let us now move-on to find about the regional forms of Ayurveda, such as Kerala Ayurveda; and what makes the Ayurvedic treatments and packages in Kerala so popular across the world. Kerala is a place that has nurtured and practiced many rare art forms, cultures and medicinal therapies since centuries. One can still find many households with generations pursuing the same profession and fields of study. In fact in Kerala, one can still find Kerala Ayurveda practitioners with a family lineage. With such ritualistic practice of Ayurveda, Kerala has become a home to one of the best and the most distinguished Ayurvedic system. This has given a boost to the number of people visiting for Ayurvedic treatment packages and therapies in Kerala. The Ayurveda treatments and packages in Kerala are famous to such an extent that people identify the State with Ayurveda itself. Hence, it is quite normal to find people searching for the best Kerala Ayurveda Centres. Let us find out some other factors that have led to the immense popularity of Ayurveda Packages in Kerala. Shalya (ENT and the body parts above the neck) Rasayana or Jara Chikitsa (Using chemicals or herbal formulations for treatments and therapies) The modern times have seen the rise of a modern Ayurvedic system in which modern equipment and techniques are combined with the basic traditional practices of Ayurveda to make the system of medicine more relevant to the changed times. Some of the most notable mentions are: Now that we have developed a basic idea about Kerala Ayurveda, let us move on to find more about the various popular Ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala and their details. Panchakarma is one of the most famous Ayurvedic treatments in Kerala and across the world. It is a basic detoxification process to bring a balance between the three Doshas and employs the five natural detoxing methods. This intense detoxification not only makes the internal body organs free of all the toxins that have built-up over time, but also gives them a new life. The internal circulation of body fluids is boosted and digestion becomes better as well. There are a large number of benefits of Panchakarma such as removal of constipation, congestion in chest, cough and cold and even haemorrhoids. Let us understand more about the [Panchakarma treatment](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/best-panchakarma-treatment-in-kerala) and find out the five purging techniques. This is an expert-monitored vomiting process in which the patient undergoes induced vomiting. It is an excellent method to eliminate the Kapha Dosha from the body. An increase in its levels makes the body to induce mucus secretion, which leads to congestion in the lungs and forms the ground for diseases such as cough, cold, and bronchitis etc. It also proves highly beneficial in the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis and other skin diseases as well. The vomiting can be induced by drinking lots of warm water with lemon. The patients can also irritate the uvula using their fingers to induce vomiting. The patients themselves start noticing the difference between the consistencies of the water being vomited again and again which changes from acidic in the beginning to completely bland at the end of the Ayurvedic therapy session. Next is the virechanam in which the toxins built-up in the intestines are removed by administering laxatives. These laxatives are therapeutic and are given by the expert Ayurvedic practitioners only. The laxatives clean any old and harmful excreta deposits that tend to accumulate over time in the digestive tract. Virechanam is highly beneficial in the treatment of haemorrhoids and jaundice. This is also one of the best [Ayurvedic therapies for removal of toxins](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda/packages/detoxification-package) deposited in the intestines that come from different sources such as refined flour and processed foods that have become highly prevalent these days. It includes an enema given by the expert practitioners using Kwath or Kashaya Vasti. It is highly beneficial to tackle the disturbances in Vata element or the body disposition finding their origin in air or body gas. Vata has its seat in colon and an enema removes the excess deposits of body gas etc. A herbal concoction is introduced in the rectum which relieves the body of any constipation and deposited toxins. Vasti is also beneficial for the patients of sciatica, kidney stones, joint pain and backaches etc. Many people feel that an enema administered by the Allopathy doctors is similar to the Vasti administered in Ayurveda; but this is not true. In Ayurveda, there are many different types of enema in which different herbal concoctions are inserted into the colon region and to different degrees. All of them work in a different manner and on different body issues apart from simply relieving constipation. However, most of the Allopathic practitioners use the warm soap water for enema and the main purpose is to remove constipation or prepare the patient for a complex surgical procedure. This is the fourth technique in Panchakarma in which an oily herbal concoction is given to the patient. This type of enema is administered to patients suffering from obesity, anaemia and diabetes. This enema is also useful for treating arthritis, paralysis, reproductive disorders, joint disorders, urinary disorders and constipation etc. In inhalation of medicated oils via the nostrils is the last technique. Nasyam eliminates the imbalances of Doshas from the nasal tracts, head, sinus and throat. The patient is also given massages in the upward direction, from shoulders to the neck region. The massaging causes perspiration. This also removes the deposited toxins from skin. Measured dosage of herbal medicines is poured into the nostrils and the patient is told to inhale the same. The administration of nasal therapies is accompanied with massages of feet, palms, shoulders and neck. Nasyam is highly beneficial for the patients of migraine, sinusitis, cold and cough, and chronic bronchitis etc. The complex disorders such as facial paralysis and hemiplegia are also treated using Nasyam. Panchakarma - Diet and Lifestyle Changes: Panchakarma is the natural detoxification technique that is also done before any other special therapy or Ayurvedic treatment in Kerala. It is perfect for people of all ages as the method of administering the various therapies vary from person to person. Stress is the main reason for many body disorders and can also give rise to hormonal imbalances. Stress has become ambient in the modern way of living as people are trying to achieve more in a small amount of time. In this race of beating peers not only locally, but also globally, they have lost track of their health and become reliant on various harmful substances such as excess caffeine, smoking, late night gatherings, social or relieving drinking and even drugs. As per Ayurveda, Stress is caused by disturbances in the Gunas - Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. These Gunas come from different food items and fluids consumed by us. Sattva element is responsible for rational thinking and perfect functional state of the body. When it gets reduced, the body goes into a state of constant stress and is deprived of rational thinking and energy. When we say that stress is the root cause of many body issues, we mean that under stress, a person resorts to many different behaviours and inclinations such as eating lots of greasy food, fast food, comfort eatables and drinking or smoking etc. Further, stress plays a major role in secretion of various hormones that affect the mental and digestive processes. Excess tummy fat, headaches, eye problems, heart disorders and even diabetes also find their causes in a stressful lifestyle. The [De-stress package](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda/packages/packages-03) is also one of the most famous Ayurvedic Treatment Packages in Kerala and is popular amongst the Indian as well as international visitors. Shirodhara is one of the most excellent [methods of de-stressing the body](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda/packages/packages-02) and one of the famous ayurvedic treatments in Kerala. In it, a fluid (generally oil or medicated oil) is poured in a constant fine stream for an hour or so. The stream thickness varies from person to person. The technique relaxes the muscles and acts as a point of pressure for the forehead and Chakra present there. This natural and gentle pressure relieves the stress and induces a state of peace and calm. The technique has pharmacological, psychological and physiological effects on the patient's body. There are different types of Shirodhara depending on the fluids used. Medicated oils, sesame oil, mustard oil, medicated buttermilk and a mixture of different oils are some of the most-used fluids. A mixture of medicated rice water and other fluids is poured over the patient's body in various positions and for different time durations. The entire body is stimulated and relaxed by pouring the fluids in one stream over the areas with maximum nerve endings or major clusters of nerves forming the nervous system. It refers to the [full-body massage](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/ayurveda/kerala-special-ayurveda-treatments) by using a mixture of oils, medicated oils or herbal concoctions. The massage involves working on the pressure points and nerve clusters of the human body. Abhyangam induces a state of calmness and removes the stress knots as well. Pizhichil is also called Thailadhara, and is one of the best Ayurvedic treatments in Kerala. It is a combination of Swedanam and Snehanam which refer to sudation and oil massaging respectively. Pizhichil involves a milk bath, warm oil bath or a bath or prolonged dipping in an herbal formulation of oils and fluids; and gentle massaging. This is an excellent stress reliever and employs more than 3 litres of medicated fluids or oils. Elakizhi refers to Patrapotala Swedanam which employs small cloth blouses or Potalis that are filled with a herbal concoction of special medicinal leaves. Patra means leaves; potala means cloth blouses or pouches; and Swedanam means sudation. So, the practitioner uses medicinal plants and leaves (mostly the ones that eliminate Vata) and fries them in herbal oils or formulations to create an herbal mixture. This mixture is filled into the cloth pouches or Potala, which are then used to massage the patient's body. This warm and gentle massage instantly relieves the stressful body conditions, and induces a state of warmth and peace. Obesity has many causes and an imbalance between the bodily Doshas is one of the leading causes. An increase in the Vata leads to bloating and inflammation which account for a fatty appearance as well. Further, the aggravated elements also lead to fat accumulation or slow (cold) metabolism. This, in turn, makes the situation even worse with the body becoming unable to digest foods properly. The Ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala for weight reduction comprise various techniques such as Oil massages, herbal powder massages, [Yoga](https://www.ayurbethaniya.org/yoga), Aasan and Pranayam etc. The practitioners offer a balanced and modified diet-plan after a careful understanding of the body pulse and Nadi etc. The common Ayurvedic treatment techniques or therapies in Kerala used for weight loss are: Ayurveda recognizes more than 20 types of Diabetes or Madhumeha and all of them are highly dangerous leading to impairment of bodily functions and damaged organs.

There are no interventions from outside and no external means are used for hormonal correction and other such things. As per Ayurveda, Annam Brahmamasmi (Food is God) - this means that what you eat is what you are and what your body becomes. So, the diet plan is also a crucial part of the Ayurvedic treatments in Kerala for all kinds of body issues including infertility. The tubal blockages, low sperm count, sperm quality, reproductive organ deformities and Pelvic adhesions, endometriosis, uterine or cervical malformations and many other things are responsible for the infertility. Many allopathic practitioners also rely on surgical methods or artificial impregnation techniques to deal with infertility issues. However, Ayurveda treatment in Kerala offers the safest and a non-invasive system of internal healing. As per Ayurveda, our food and lifestyle habits are the major causes of infertility as well. Eating cold and stale food, eating cold foods and drinks during periods, excessive indulgence in sex and stimulation of reproductive organs with hands or other artificial means lead to damages to our reproductive system. Involving with lots of sexual partners, consuming random drugs claiming to boost stamina and artificial hormones and supplements etc also have a detrimental effect on the reproductive system. This is why in ancient times women were prohibited from taking cold baths; overexposure to winds and weather elements; eating cold food and washing hands with cold water. All these things have far-reaching effects on the uterus. In fact, many other systems of medicine such as Chinese etc indicate that a cold uterus is unable to conceive easily. A uterus that has been subject to harsh conditions such as too many miscarriages, or abuse during periods also becomes weak. Hence, the best way is to let the body heal internally. Male and female infertility are tackled in different manners and are treated in a holistic way so that the root of the problems is worked upon. The various steps of treatment for infertility comprise of the following: Post pregnancy period or Sheelan is the time when the body of a woman is in an extremely vulnerable state. The immunity is lowered, the upper layers of skin are shedding to give way to new skin, internal body organs are getting back into shape, and the body fluids are changing their consistencies. Hence, women are said to be reborn after giving birth to babies. Apart from the uterus, abdomen, stomach, back, breasts, hair, nervous system and the entire endocrine system experience a large number of changes. The body of a new mother is in need of extreme care and attention. Regular massages, baths with antiseptic and anti-inflammatory agents and a proper nourishing diet plan are extremely necessary for a new mother. Though the allopathic doctors generally don't put much stress on these things, Ayurvedic treatment in Kerala has a lot of therapies and techniques to make the bodies and minds of new mothers healthy, well-nourished and rejuvenated. The modern lifestyle has made it hard to obtain all these things in the cities.
