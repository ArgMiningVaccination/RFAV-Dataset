Examples of populations disproportionately affected due to such factors include: Washington State has also developed a social vulnerability index which includes social determinants factors (e.g., socio -economic, ethnicity/language, housing/transport, etc.) to identify highest vulnerability areas that will be one of several inputs informing vaccine allocation decisions to ensure equitable allocation .Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 EQUITY IS A CROSS -CUTTING FOCUS OF THIS FRAMEWORK People of color People with limited English proficiency People in shared housing, crowded housing, and multi -generational homes People in poverty and low- wage earners People with disabilities People with access barriers to healthcare Note: the following factors DO NOT impact an individual's eligibility: immigration status or health insurance statusK-12 teachers and school staff and child care workers Critical workers in high -risk settings (incl. healthcare) -workers who are in industries essential to the functioning of society and at substantially higher risk of exposure People with comorbid and underlying conditions that put them at moderately higher risk (1 comorbidity or condition) People in homeless shelters or group homes for individuals with disabilities, including serious mental illness, development and intellectual disabilities, and physical disabilities or in recovery not already covered in Phase 1 People with disabilities that prevent them from adopting protective measures People in prisons, jails, detention centers, and similar congregate facilities, and staff who work in such settings All people 65 years of age not covered in Phase 1 Red = Differences from NAM FrameworkWashington State Department of Health | 11Ancillary -19- Vaccination -Program -Interim_Playbook.pdf#page=29 COVID -19 vaccine and ancillary supplies will be procured and distributed by the federal government at no cost to enrolled COVID -19 vaccination providers.

Duration of protection from post COVID- 19 vaccination is currently unknown. EUA will be submitted in a matter of weeks. 20 million doses will be ready to ship by the end of the year; 500million -1 billion doses within the next year. Dimensions of box will be coming out shortly. Once the vaccine is thawed it should stay out (and should not go back into the fridge)Moderna Vaccine -Other key takeawaysWashington State Department of Health | 21To have 2 large scale efficacy trials enrolled and completed independently, with such similar results, is remarkable. The spike part of the RNA transcript is essentially identical; allowing one to feel quite comfortable about the veracity of the efficacy data. The safety data needs to be made public, so one can evaluate it. Available data suggest the vaccines are well tolerated, more side effects with the second dose and somewhat lower severity of systemic side effects in older persons. The similarity of the data means either vaccine can do the job and should simplify that part of the distribution process.Additional takeways for mRNA vaccine productsWashington State Department of Health | 22Vaccines don't save lives; vaccinating people saves lives! USG contracts for mRNA is 100 million doses from each company.

RCW 71.24.585 and 2017 c 297 s 12 are each amended to 5 read as follows: 6 ((The state of Washington declares that there is no fundamental 7 right to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. )) 8 (1)(a) The state of Washington ((further )) declares that ((while 9 medications used in the treatment of opioid use disorder are 10 addictive substances, that they nevertheless have several legal, 11 important, and justified uses and that one of their appropriate and 12 legal uses is, in conjunction with other required therapeutic 13 procedures, in the treatment of persons with opioid use disorder. The 14 state of Washington recognizes as evidence-based for the management 15 of opioid use disorder the medications approved by the federal food 16 and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. 17 Medication-assisted treatment should only be used for participants 18 who are deemed appropriate to need this level of intervention. 19 Providers must inform patients of all treatment options available. 20 The provider and the patient shall consider alternative treatment 21 options, like abstinence, when developing the treatment plan. If 22 medications are prescribed, follow up must be included in the 23 treatment plan in order to work towards the goal of abstinence. )) 24 substance use disorders are medical conditions. Substance use 25 disorders should be treated in a manner similar to other medical 26 conditions by using interventions that are supported by evidence, 27 including medications approved by the federal food and drug 28 administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. It is also 29 recognized that many individuals have multiple substance use 30 disorders, as well as histories of trauma, developmental 31 disabilities, or mental health conditions. As such, all individuals 32 experiencing opioid use disorder should be offered evidence-supported 33 treatments to include federal food and drug administration approved 34 medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders and behavioral 35 counseling and social supports to address them. For behavioral health 36 agencies, an effective plan of treatment for most persons with opioid 37 use disorder integrates access to medications and psychosocial 38 counseling and should be consistent with the American society of 39 p. 33 SSB 5380.SLaddiction medicine patient placement criteria. Providers must inform 1 patients with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder of 2 options to access federal food and drug administration approved 3 medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder or substance use 4 disorder. Because some such medications are controlled substances in 5 chapter 69.50 RCW, the state of Washington maintains the legal 6 obligation and right to regulate the ((clinical )) uses of these 7 medications in the treatment of opioid use disorder. 8 ((Further, )) (b) The authority must work with other state 9 agencies and stakeholders to develop value-based payment strategies 10 to better support the ongoing care of persons with opioid and other 11 substance use disorders. 12 (c) The department of corrections shall develop policies to 13 prioritize services based on available grant funding and funds 14 appropriated specifically for opioid use disorder treatment. 15 (2) The authority must promote the use of medication therapies 16 and other evidence-based strategies to address the opioid epidemic in 17 Washington state.

The state 27 recognizes that a small percentage of persons who participate in 28 opioid treatment programs require treatment for an extended period of 29 time. Opioid treatment programs shall provide a comprehensive 30 transition program to eliminate substance use, including opioid use 31 of program participants )) treatment for persons with opioid use 32 disorder are the cessation of unprescribed opioid use, reduced 33 morbidity, and restoration of the ability to lead a productive and 34 fulfilling life . 35 (4) To achieve the goals in subsection (3) of this section, to 36 promote public health and safety, and to promote the efficient and 37 economic use of funding for the medicaid program under Title XIX of 38 the social security act, the authority may seek, receive, and expend 39 p. 34 SSB 5380.SLalternative sources of funding to support all aspects of the state's 1 response to the opioid crisis. 2 (5) The authority must partner with the department of social and 3 health services, the department of corrections, the department of 4 health, the department of children, youth, and families, and any 5 other agencies or entities the authority deems appropriate to develop 6 a statewide approach to leveraging medicaid funding to treat opioid 7 use disorder and provide emergency overdose treatment.

Staff is requesting guidance from the Commission regarding internship hours for applicants in this category who have applied prior to July 1, 2020. This special consideration was initiated by applicants applying under the Foreign Pharmacist Gradua te process. Background : (Briefly state the pertinent history): This document is attempting to account for several different scenarios for which applicants may fall within the application/licensure process to ensure the commission has a comprehensive overview as it considers its guidance. Relevant Rules: There are no statutes specific to foreign trained pharmacists.

Perhaps - knowing that applicants often wait to file the pharmacist application until after meeting the requirements, if the Pharmacy Commission considers this option it must set clear and specific qualifications to whom this scenario will apply. Recommendation: (What actions are you asking the commission to take? What do you want to happen next? Recommendations: Options 1: Foreign Pharmacist graduated who have applied for a Washington Pharmacist license before July 1, 2020 are granted a waiver and shall meet the internship hours as required under WAC 246-863-040 and policy #45.

The applicant was issued a Washington Pharmacy Intern registration and whose required internship hours are earned and /or certified and has applied for a Washington pharmacist license on or before March 1, 2021. Additional Issue: Policy #45 allowed for foreign pharmacist graduates to sit for the NAPLEX and MPJE before all required internship hours were completed/certified. Does the Commission wish to continue this practice for foreign pharmacist graduates, auth orizing applicants to test after completing 1200 of the required 1500 hours? NABP will not let a pharmacist applicant sit for the NAPLEX until he or she has graduated.

Commission SBAR Communication DOH XXX -XXX Agenda Item/Title: Access to Drugs Stored Outside the Pharmacy by Unlicensed Staff Date SBAR Communication Prepared: November 13, 2020 Reviewer: Link to Action Plan: X Action Informatio n Follow -up Report only Situation: (Briefly describe the current situation. Give a clear, succinct overview of pertinent issues) Licensed hospital pharmacies allow staff members who are not licensed health care pro fessionals to access drugs that are stored outside of the pharmacy. The new pharmacy rules do not permit unlicensed staff to access drugs stored outside of the pharmacy (see WAC 246 -945-455(1)(c) ). Background: (Briefly state the pertinent history): The new pharmacy rules contain a requirement that if a pharmacy stores drugs outside of the pharmacy then access to the drugs must be \"limited to health care professionals licensed under the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040 acting within their scope, and nursing students as provided in WAC 246 -945-450\" (see WAC 246 - 945-455(1)(c) ). This requirement was added to reduc e diversion of drugs that a re not stored within the pharmacy. Based on its statutory definition, t he term \"drugs\" include s over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, non -controlled legend drugs, and controlled substances ( see RCW 18.64.011(14) ). As a result, the new rule (cited above) restricts access to OTCs, non -controlled legend drugs, and controlled substances stored outside the pharmacy to licensed health care professionals and nursing student s. Licensed health care pr ofessionals acting with their scope of practice may access drugs stored outside the pharmacy. RCW 18.130.040 provides the list of disciplining authorities whose professions may acces s drugs stored outside the pharmacy . This does not mean that all licensed health care professionals can access drugs. Instead, the individual must be a licensed health care professional and must be acting within their scope of practice. The only exception to this requirement is for nursing students. There are some hospital pharmacies who permit unlicensed staff to access legend drugs and OTCs stored outside of the pharmacy. This includes access to, among other things, IV fluids e.g., normal saline , lactated ringers, and D5W. These hospital pharmacies would like to continue this practice notwithstanding the new rule. Assessment: (Summarize the facts and give your best assessment. What is going on? Use your best judgment) The pract ice of hospital pharmacies permitting unlicensed staff to access legend drugs and OTCs stored outside of the pharmacy is not permitted by the Commission's rules ( see WAC 246 -945-455(1)(c) ). The current rule language does not permit exceptions for unlice nsed staff members to access drugs stored outside the pharmacy unless they are a nursing student. All individuals (except nursing students) who access drugs stored outside the pharmacy must be appropriately licensed and acting with their scope of practice. In addition, there is no exception for unlicensed staff to access OTCs or \"low -risk\" legend drugs stored outside the pharmacy . To comply with the rule, the hospital could register the se unlicensed staff members as pharmacy assistants . The Commission wou ld need to amend its rule to allow unlicensed staff to access legend drugs and OTCs stored outside of the pharmacy. Recommenda tion: (What actions are you asking the commission to take ? What do you want to happen next? Commission SBAR Communication DOH XXX -XXX The Pharmacy C ommission could consider some or all of the following: 1. Recommending that hospital pharmacies stop permit ting unlicensed staff from access ing legend drugs and OTCs stored outside of the pharmacy until the unl icensed staff obtain a valid credential. For example, the unlicensed staff could obtain a pharmacy assistant credential. 2. The Commission can consider rulemaking to allow flexibility for pharmacies to allow access to drugs stored outside the pharmacy to unli censed staff members by amending WAC 246 -945- 455(1)(c) . 3. The Commission can also consider other solutions not yet identified. "}
