Since then, meetings and conferences of the initiative are taking place. One of the aims of the meetings of the initiative is to form a sphere of activity in which anthroposophical meditation can be practised by people who value working together productively, searching creatively and sharing the research results. All over the world there are people who follow the meditative path of anthroposophy. The Living Connections conference wants to strengthen this work and make it visible so that the crucial essence of anthroposophy's contribution to inner culture and meditation can be expressed worldwide in its various professional fields. On the basis of spiritual friendship, the core of the initiative expresses itself through collegiality, solidarity and openness, bringing together people who are active in the further development and deepening of anthroposophical meditative practice. The Initiative endeavours to make meditative work in contemporary cultural life visible and thus contribute to the tasks of the Goetheanum.
