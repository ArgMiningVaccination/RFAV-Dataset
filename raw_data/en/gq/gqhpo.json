As a result, Marie's persistent heartburn is flaring up again. In the past, over-the\u00ad counter medications, such as Prilosec, Pepcid AC, and Pepto Bismol, have not relieved her symptoms. Frustrated, Marie made. an appointment with her family physician. As she swings her feet from the examination table in the doctor's office, internally rehearsing a list of her symptoms and their longevity for when the doctor shows up, she looks around the examination room, hoping to distract her mind from the painful burning in her esopha\u00ad gus. Prominently featured on the wall are posters of a human digestive tract, sponsored by Nexium. Bored with the graphic representation of her small intestine, she reaches for the remote control to the exam room's tiny television set. In between Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb's pleasantries about the latest thigh cream, she is bombarded with commercials for pre\u00ad scription drugs. As the wait grows increasingly painful, she reaches for this week's People magazine, with a smiling Patrick Swayze on its cover. Be\u00ad tween gossip tidbits and human interest stories, Marie notices glossy pages with columns in tiny typeface, touting the benefits and risks of everything from birth control pills to blood pressure medication. By the time the phy\u00ad sician enters, carrying a Cymbalta clipboard, with a menagerie of drug\u00ad name inscribed ink pens in her lab coat pocket, Marie cannot help but won\u00ad der who is really prescribing her medication -her physician or the pharma\u00ad ceutical companies? \u00b7 While Marie's fictional situation has been embellished for dramatic effect, concerns about pharmaceutical companies' gifts to physicians and pharmaceutical advertisements are far from fictional and are creating quite a buzz in both the medical and legal professions. As lawmakers and industry watchdogs create new regulations in hopes of increasing pharmaceutical company accountability and decreasing prescription drug costs, there is an increasing need to examine the risks and benefits of such regulations. A. Thelssue Pharmaceutical companies strive to create and maintain relationships with physicians through advertising and gift-giving, in hopes of influencing them to prescribe their drugs more frequently than their competitors.1 Ac\u00ad cording to a survey published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007, 94% of physicians reported having arelationship with pharmaceutical 1. Eric G. Campbell et \u00b7 al., A National Survey of Physician-Industry Relationships, 356 NEW ENG. J. MED. 1742, 1743 (2007). 2010] UNDER THE INFLUENCE 91 companies.2 Of those physicians, 83% claimed that those relationships in\u00ad volved free meals, while 78% of those physicians received free drug sam\u00ad ples. 3 Other types of gifts include trinkets, honors for . speaking engagements, reimbursement of travel expenses, and free admission to en\u00ad tertainment events or medical conferences.4 Recently, several states have proposed {)f adopted total or partial bat1S on gifts made by pharmaceutical companies to physicians.5 Most of these statutes include disclosure requirements for advertising expenditures made by pharmaceutical companies.6 Although the definition varies state-by\u00ad state, advertising expenditures typically include gifts given\u00b7 over a certain dollar threshold made to physicians.7 Legislation has also been introduced in the United States \u00b7Congress which would require pharmaceutical compa\u00ad nies to report all ''payment[s} or transfer[s] of value\" made to physicians.8 Medical schools across the country have also adopted this trend, restricting gifts made by pharmaceutical companies to their students.9 In addition, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers ofAmer\u00ad ica (PhRMA) recently released voluntary guidelines prohibiting pharma\u00ad ceutical . companies from offering physicians trinkets such as pens, notepads, and. calendars emblazoned with a drug name.10 Under these guidelines, small gifts lacking any educational purpose and\u00b7 that-are valued under $100 are prohibited.11 . . Both physicians and patients can be affected by drug advertisements\u00b7 paid for by pharmaceutical companies.12 Pharmaceutical companies spend nearly twice as much on advertising and marketing as on pharmaceutical 2. /d. at 1742. 3. /d 4. /d. at 1743. 5.

For example, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, Yale Universi\u00ad ty, and the University of Maryland medical schools all prohibit phannaceutical company gift-giving on their campuses. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was consider\u00ad ing a ban as recently as March 2009. The University of Minnesota is considering a \"con\u00ad flict-of-interest policy\" that would have effects similar to that of a gift ban.

This is important because although the target audience for these ads consists of consumer-patients, physicians will inevitably be exposed to them as well, which will likely influence their prescribing ha\u00ad bits. In Indiana, a state which serves as home to many pharmaceutical companies, 18 there has been some progress in this area of the law. After being the first pharmaceutical company in the nation to endorse the Physi\u00ad cian Payments Sunshine Act (PPSA), 19 Eli Lilly and Company ~lans to launch an online registry of its payments to physicians in 2009. 0 Lilly would create a database accessible to the public via the Internet, which, by 2011, would include all payments made to physicians, and payments made for speaking engagements, bringing it into anticipatory compliance with the PPSA, should it be passed by Congress?1 Despite Lilly's voluntary antic\u00ad ipatory compliance with the PPSA, it is not currently held to any state re\u00ad quirements: The Indiana state legislature, unlike some other states, has yet 13.

Roadmap This Note discusses external factors influencing physicians' prescrib\u00ad ing habits, including gifts from pharmaceutical companies and drug adver\u00ad tisements, and the current and pending state and federal regulations designed to curb such practices. In order to foster an understanding of the current legislation, Section II provides a historical background of several state statutes and federal legislation regulating physician gifts, including motivation and criticisms of each. Section III offers historical background of drug advertising regulations nationwide, with a special focus on such regulations in Indiana. Section IV discusses whether current and pending bans on physician gifts help or hurt consumer-patients and contains an analysis of gifts from pharmaceutical companies and drug advertising in light of the current economic crisis and the state of America's health care system. Finally, Section V concludes the discussion with the suggestion that achieving a balance between accurate dissemination of information about new drugs and therapies and limits on undue influence from pharma\u00ad ceutical companies may be the best way to resolve the issue. II. BACKGROUND: STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATION LIMITING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES AND GIFTS TO PHYSICIANS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES In order to facilitate a better understanding of the necessity of state and federal legislation regulating physician gifts, a discussion of the current and pending state and federal legislation is imperative. The state statutes can be placed into three broad categories: 1) total bans on physician gifts; 2) partial bans on physician gifts; and 3) required recordkeeping of all ad\u00ad vertising costs, including physician gifts, with disclosure to the state gov\u00ad ernment. A. Massachusetts: A Total Ban Massachusetts is the only state thus far to prohibit all gifts made by pharmaceutical companies to physicians.22 The ban, introduced by Senate President Therese Murray in March 2008, is the first of its kind in the Unit\u00ad ed States.Z3 It allows for fines of up to $5,000 for a single infraction?4 22.

The Massachusetts statute allows a pharmaceutical company to educate physicians on its new drug innovations, but draws the line at social means and compensation for atten\u00ad dance at various CME events. Critics of the ban cite concerns about disrupting the free flow of drug information between drug companies, physicians, and patients. They assert that pharmaceutical company representatives are experts regarding the drugs they sell. 31 Although there are concerns that physician gifts raise pre\u00ad scription\u00b7 drug costs, at least one critic of the Massachusetts statute, Julie Corcoran, deputy vice president of PhRMA, says there is no evidence to support such a\u00b7contention.32 Other critics of the Massachusetts statute have expressed concern that the ban will suppress drug innovation and investment in the state.33 Eli Lil- 25.

Thomas Sullivan, president of a medical communi\u00ad cations company, argued that the ban would have ''devastating effects on the research institutions that make Boston the largest healthcare economy in the country. \"36 Sullivan estimates that the ban \"could disqualify as many as 20% of our faculty, as the ban covers all honorarium and travel ... we would have no way to pay speakers from Massachusetts to travel to events, and no way to pay them for their time. \"37 However, the ban has not been in effect long enough to determine the legitimacy of these concerns. B. Minnesota: Partial Ban with Recordkeeping Requirements and Several Notable Exceptions Minnesota legislators passed a partial ban on physician gifts in 2008.38 In Minnesota, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from giving any gifts to any physician with a \"combined retail value\" exceeding $50, subject to a few exceptions?9 The exceptions include: drug samples; compensation to sponsor medical conferences, as long as the compensation is not paid to the physician and the conference is for educational purposes only; consult\u00ad ing fees for research projects; publications; employee salaries; and \"reason\u00ad able honoraria and payment of the reasonable expenses of a practitioner who serves on the faculty at a professional or educational conference or meeting.'.4\u00b0 However, public availability to such information is limited. Public accessibility is provided, but practically speaking, it is very difficult to ob\u00ad tain any of the disclosure reports.41 The disclosure fonns are unavailable electronically or online .. 42 The only way for an individual to obtain the fonns is to \"travel to the state office in Minnesota in order to photocopy 34. !d. 35.

Dr. Carl Heltne, chief medical officer for SMDC Health System of Duluth, Minnesota, a nonprofit health care system of over twenty clinics and hospitals, supports the ban because he feels it stifles misconceptions about the medical industry: \"No matter how you look at it, we [are] all in\u00ad fluenced by these marketing activities ... [b ]ut patients come to us and they trust us to make decisions solely on their behalf. To uphold that trust, we can[not] have even a perception that companies influence us.'M Minneso\u00ad ta 's ban on pharmaceutical companies' gifts of free food for physicians was the first of its kind.45 Interestingly, after the ban went into effect, pharma\u00ad ceutical companies began inviting nurses and secretaries to informational dinners, despite the fact that nurses and secretaries lack prescription au\u00ad thority.46 However, the real targets of the pharmaceutical company's mar\u00ad keting blitz are the speakers at the dinners, physicians who require training about the company's drug prior to eaeh speaking engagement.~7 The doc\u00ad tors are often paid handsomely for these presentations, some fetching up to $100,000 per year.48 However, most claim to be immune from the influ\u00ad ence of compensation they earn from the presentations.49 After watchdog groups first raised awareness about the Minnesota law in 2007, pharmaceutical companies began spending less on Minnesota doc\u00ad tors. 5\u00b0 From 2007 to 2008, pharmaceutical company payments to doctors dropped by over $3.5 million.51 This drop could be attributed to the in\u00ad creasing transparency of pharmaceutical company ~ayments to physicians, but it could also be a result of a suffering economy. 2 While the reason for the decline is unclear, others suggest that increasing concern over the con\u00ad flict of interest between pharmaceutical companies and doctors is a plausi\u00ad ble explanation. 53 43. /d.

In 2008, a statute that would partially limit gifts to physicians was in\u00ad troduced in the New York Assembly. The New York Assembly Bill cited compelling evidence that the vast majority of physi\u00ad cians accept some type of gift or payment from phar\u00ad maceutical and medical device manufacturers, and often such gifts and payments, even when of little value, influence physicians to prescribe treatments that are more expensive and no more effective or safe, and are sometimes less effective and more dangerous, than other available treatments. 54 The New York Assembly also found that \"[l]egislation is necessary to pro\u00ad hibit presenters at continuing professional education programs from provid\u00ad ing false or misleading information to prescribers and to require all potential conflicts of interest be disclosed to attendees of such programs. ,,ss The proposed legislation would prohibit all gifts aggregating to more than $50 annually to physicians and medical students, with exceptions: drug samples; payment for clinical trials; manufacturer's discounts for drugs or medical devices; and \"anything of economic value given by a person with a financial relationship with a manufacturer who is related by blood, marriage or adoption within three degrees of consanguinity to the recipient prescrib\u00ad er.\"56 The proposed New York legislation differs from the Minnesota sta\u00ad tute because it applies to both physician gifts and to gifts made to medical students.57 The permissible exceptions also differ: For example, the Min\u00ad nesota statute provides exceptions for publications and employee salaries, while the proposed New York statute does not. 58 These small differences in state-by-state legislation may provide a better framework for possible fed\u00ad eral legislation banning physician gifts, since they permit lawmakers, phar\u00ad maceutical companies, and physicians to see what works and what does not. A federal model would likely take these findings into consideration. The proposed New York lefslation also requires yearly disclosure of any benefits given or received. 5 The disclosure is mandatory when the physician or medical student \"offered, gave, or received a benefit,\" the pharmaceutical company gave the physician a discount, or there was \"a fi- 54. /d. 55. /d. 56.

Vermont, West Virginia, District of Columbia, and Maine: Big Brother is Watching The least restrictive state statutes require disclosure of physician gifts. In 2008, Vermont legislators passed an initiative . requiring disclosure of marketing expenditures, including physician gifts.63 The Vermont statute requires pharmaceutical companies to record gifts made to physicians if the value of the particular gift exceeds $25, subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for failure to disclose.64 Along with gifts under $25, drug samples, scholarships to medical students, and drug rebates are also exempt. 65 After reports are made to the attorney general, the disclosures are then reported to state lawmakers and the governor.66 Another important exemption from such reports is any statement which would disclose a pharmaceutical com\u00ad pany's trade secrets.67 As a result, \"61 percent of payments to physicians that had been disclosed under the Vermont law were designated 'trade se\u00ad crets' by the reporting manufacturer, and were therefore kept confidential from the public.\"68 West Virginia also requires disclosure of marketing expenditures as\u00ad sociated with prescription drugs, excluding drug samples, reimbursement for costs associated with clinical trials, and scholarships for medical stu\u00ad dents. 69 As the least restrictive state statute for pharmaceutical companies, West Virginia's statute does not apply to medical device manufacturers.70 The disclosure information is not available to the public: \"Any 'national aggregate expense [information]' disclosed to state officials is considered 60. ld. \"Financial relationship\" is defined by the proposed statute as \"an ownership interest, investment interest, or compensation arrangement.\" 61.

The Maine statute re\u00ad quires \"manufacturers or labelers\" of prescription drugs to report their ad\u00ad vertising expenses annually.76 Advertising expenses include direct expenditures for television, radio, and print ads, gifts to physicians over $25 in value, and travel expenses. It also includes drug samples, if those sam\u00ad ples will not be given to patients for free.77 Exclusions include expenses of $25 or less; \"reasonable compensation and reimbursement for expenses in connection with a bona fide clinical trial of a new vaccine, therapy or treat\u00ad ment,\" and educational scholarships.78 The statute's stated purpose is to \"enabl[ e] [Maine]\u00b7\u00b7 to determine the scope of prescription drug marketing costs and their effect on the cost, utilization and delivery of health care ser\u00ad vices and further[ ] \u00b7 the role of this State as guardian of the public inter- est.\"79. .

The United States Congress has addressed the issue of pharmaceutical company gifts to physicians with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act of 2007 (PPSA), so named because it is intended to shed light on the relation\u00ad ship between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians. 86 The PPSA was introduced in the Senate in September 2007; a similar bill was introduced in the House in March 2008.87 The sponsors of the PPSA intended that it would yield \"'transparency' to such payments and ... 'foster accountability by empowering consumers and other watchdogs.\"'88 The PPSA primarily addresses means of disclosure, rather than outright limits or bans on physi\u00ad cian gifts.89 PPSA requires quarterly reports by \"manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, or medical supplies under Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP [State Children's Health Insurance Program].\"90 The reports required by the PPSA must include physician's name, ad\u00ad dress, and facility with which the physician is associated, as well as the amount, date, and description of the payment.91 The description can fall into one of eight categories, including: compensation; food, entertainment, or gifts; trips or 82. !d. at 160-66. 83. !d. at 160 (quoting ME.

BACKGROUND: AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STANDARDS FOR PHYSICIAN GIFTS, FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION STANDARDS FOR ADVERTISING, AND INDIANA STATE MEDICAL GUIDELINES FOR BOTH A. American Medical Association Standards In the early 1990s, the American Medical Association (AMA) devel\u00ad oped its own standards to address the issue of physician gifts.95 The AMA Opinion states that gifts should only be accepted when they benefit a patient and are not too lavish.96 Certain gifts may be appropriate if they serve an informational purpose, including meals or textbooks.97 In addition, \"[i]ndividual gifts of minimal value are permissible as lon~ as the gifts are related to the physician's work (e.g., pens and notepads).\" 8 According to the AMA Opinion, subsidies from the industry should not be accepted di\u00ad rectly or indirectly to pay for the costs of travel, lodging, or other personal expenses of physicians attending conferences or meetings, nor should sub- 92.

In addition, when companies underwrite medical conferences or lectures other than their own, responsibility for and control over the se\u00ad lection of content, faculty, educational methods, and materials should belong to the organizers of the con- ferences or lectures. 101 \u00b7 B. Food and Drug Administration Limitations: An Historical Perspective The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has also imposed advertising limitations on pharmaceutical companies. First regulated by the FDA, then the Federal Trade Commission, now FDA again, spending on direct-to\u00ad consumer (DTC} advertising rose from just $12 million in 1989 to over $2.3 billion in 2001. 02 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA) contains one provision for pharmaceutical advertisements, which \"requires simply that the advertisement include the drug's generic name and formula, and a brief summary describing the effectiveness of the drug and its risks.\"103 This \"brief summary\" must include drug side effects and warnings. 104 \"Second, the \"fair balance doctrine\" provides that the entire advertisement must present a balanced account of all clinically relevant in\u00ad formation; the risks must be presented grominently and legibly so that the benefits are not unfairly emphasized.\" 1 5 Balancing information must be prominently mentioned in the ad so that patient-consumers can properly weigh the pros and cons of taking the drug.106 The advertising cannot be false or misleading and should be consistent with the drug's label.107 In addition, the FDA has created three \"categories of prescription drug advertisements ... : 1) reminder advertisements, 2) help-seeking or disease\u00ad oriented advertisements, and 3) product-claim or indication advertise\u00ad ments.\"108 Reminder advertisements show the drug name but do not pro\u00ad vide information about the drug itself, such as pens, Post-Its, desk 99. /d 100.

Indiana State Medical Association Compliance and Guidance In Indiana, although gifts from the industry are not addressed by Indi\u00ad ana law, the Indiana State Medical Association defers to the AMA ethical standards in this area.116 IV: ANALYSIS: Do LIMITS AND BANS ON PHYSICIAN GIFTS AND ADVERTISING HELP OR HURT PATIENTS? The arguments on both sides of this compelling issue are comparably persuasive. On one hand, those opposing physician gift limits and bans consider industry guidelines sufficient to curb any inappropriate conduct by both pharmaceutical companies and physicians. In addition, some physi\u00ad cians are offended by the implication perpetuated by gift limits and bans that they are not prescribing drugs according to their patients' needs and 109. Id 110. /d.

In contrast, proponents of limits and bans on physician gifts cite ethi\u00ad cal concerns and higher prescription drug costs as their primary criticisms of such gifts. This anti-pharm hysteria is widespread: Websites such as pharmedout.org and nofreelunch.org condemn the use of pharmaceutical company freebies to influence physicians' prescribing habits. A recent sur\u00ad vey of patient-consumers revealed that many were opposed to pharmaceuti\u00ad cal company gifts to physicians. 117 Over 80% of respondents said that pharmaceutical companies should be prohibited from gifting physicians with free dinners and travel.118 In addition, over half of those surveyed thought that drug sam~les from pharmaceutical companies to physicians should be prohibited.11 Perhaps even more telling is that nearly 70% of respondents would support legislation requiring gift disclosure.120 The major concerns about the practice of pharmaceutical companies' gifts to physicians were enumerated by Dr. Ogan Gurel: Unsustainable high cost (hence the massive layoffs that Pfizer announced in 2007)[;] [ c ]oncerns that marketing costs add to the cost of drugs passed on to patients[;] [e]thical concerns about inappropriate pressures being made on physicians with respect to gifts and other benefits being distributed by drug rep\u00ad resentatives[;] [t]he banning of pharmaceutical drug representatives from some medical campuses includ\u00ad ing Stanford, Henry Ford and Rush University medi\u00ad cal centers.121 Further exploration of each issue is necessary to foster an understand\u00ad ing of the pros and cons of physician gift bans by state and federal legisla\u00ad tures.

In a study conducted in 2000 and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Ashley Wazana found that freebies and 117.

Even the most well-intentioned doctor could fall pre~ to his or her subconscience after being subjected to freebies and drug ads.1 7 Despite what some physicians say, studies and social science show that pharmaceutical companies' gifts to physicians have a profound impact on physicians' prescribing habits.128 Dr. David Blumenthal suggests that \"humans are vulnerable to a powerful, unconscious 'self-serving bias'; that is, they have trouble seeing themselves as biased when the bias serves their needs or advances their own perceived interests.\"129 This means that even the smallest gifts from pharmaceutical companies may influence physi\u00ad cians' prescribing habits, since they may feel an obligation to reciprocate, either consciously or subconsciously.130 Blumenthal is skeptical that states' disclosure laws and gift limits will affect the relationship between pharma\u00ad ceutical companies and physicians in the long run because such relation\u00ad ships are important to both parties: pharmaceutical companies need to sell their product, while physicians need to stay educated on cutting-edge drugs and therapies.131 He predicts recurring cycles of scandal and reform for the future.132 122.

Shahram Ahari, former drug representative for Eli Lilly, made a splash when he disclosed the dark side of pharmaceutical companies to sponsors ,of the PPSA and ABC News.133 Ahari alleged that drug repre\u00ad sentatives were hired on the basis of looks and charisma, and in his expe\u00ad rience, the vast majority lacked any sort of science background.134 Ahari alleged that drug representatives are encouraged to use questionable sales tactics, \"including how to exceed spending limits for important clients, be\u00ad ing generous with free samples to leverage sales, using friendships and per\u00ad sonal gifts to foster a 'quid pro quo' relationship, and how to exploit sexual tension. \"135 There is also widespread concern in the medical community that bans and limits on physicians' interactions with drug representatives hurt patients because they limit the drug comp;my's ability to convey information about new drugs and the latest innovations in medical research. Logic dictates that a prescribing physician cannot recommend a therapy or drug if he or she does not know it exists. Scott Lassman, PhRMA counsel, expressed such a concern: \"[T]he new policies [are] a 'disservice to patients and phy\u00ad sicians' because they keep doctors from interacting with sales representa\u00ad tives. 'The company sales representatives, in our point of view, have a lot of useful information on drug products and how to use them, and how not to use them. \"'136 This view is undoubtedly shared by many in the medical community. While some drug representatives, such as Ahari, claim that they are instructed to participate in questionable sales tactics, a spokesman for Eli Lilly countered Ahari's claims: 'We think his examples are exaggerated. We have policies in place that allow us to engage in interac\u00ad tions with health care professionals at an appropriate level and they are intended to provide infonnation about our products so that they will be able to make appropriate medical decisions for their patients.' 137 . 133.

A key concern is the accuracy of the information provided by pharma\"' ceutical representatives. One study, conducted by researchers at the .Uni-\u00b7 versity of California at San Diego School of Medicine, found that 12 of 106 statements made by ~harmaceutical representatives, and later tested for ac\u00ad curacy, were false.1 This means that 11% of the statements contradicted information available to the representatives.142 Most frightening is. the fact that the physicians to\u00b7 whom the information was given were not\u00b7aware of the inaccuracy of the statements.143 Unsurprisingly, marketing material used by pharmaceutical companies often has a bias toward \u00b7the company distributing it.144 In addition to providing skewed information, marketing material sometimes does not comport with FDA regulations \"against. pro\u00ad moting unapproved uses of drugs.\"145 The fact that some pharmaceutical representatives fail to accurately inform physicians about their product, coupled with questionable marketing materials suggests that pharmaceutical companies are not the best resource from which physicians should receive information about new drugs and therapies.

Most state legislatures have cited the growing costs of prescription drugs as a primary concern when enacting legislation banning gifts to phy\u00ad sicians.146 While Massachusetts' approach is very specific and may come with some administrative costs, other states' disclosure laws may not get to the root of the problem. There is little evidence that requiring pharmaceuti\u00ad cal companies to be accountable for their advertising expenditures reduces spending on physician gifts and other marketing avenues. Marketing can have a drastic effect on how a drug is perceived. '\"The explosion in drug costs is directly proportional to marketing,\"' says Alan Cassels7 a pharmaceutical 1p.3rketing researcher from the University of Vic\u00ad toria.14 Cassel further stated, \"'[p]harmacists have told me they can tell when a certain company's dru\u00a7 rep has been in town because of a spike in that company's prescriptions.'\" 48 AstraZeneca, makers of Prilosec and Nexium, has exhibited \"bio\u00ad chemical chutzpah\" in its marketing of the drugs.149 The patent on Prilosec, the world's best-selling drug, ran out in 2001, prompting AstraZeneca to use a mirror image of the drug's isomers to create Nexium; the only differ\u00ad ence between the two drugs is that ''Nexium is 3 percent better at relieving symptoms.\" 150 [NT A: The previous citation was nearly a direct quote from the source; to simplify, I made is a direct quote]. Despite the lack of\"signif\u00ad icant clinical advance,\" Nexium was approved by the FDA that same year.151 Immediately after approval was granted, AstraZeneca launched an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at \"getting doctors and patients to switch from Prilosec to ... Nexium.\" 152 As a result of this marketing blitz, Prilosec is still available over-the-counter, and costs consumers about $30.153 Its nearly identical counterpart, Nexium, costs about $200.154 This demonstrates the remarkable effect that marketing techniques have on pre\u00ad scribers and patients. Economic concerns of rising marketing and advertising expenditures of pharmaceutical companies cannot be overlooked. According to Jason Dana and George Loewenstein, \"[g]ifts from the pharmaceutical industry contribute to the rapidly increasing cost of medical care, and more specifi\u00ad cally, to the increase in expenditures on prescription drugs.\"155 This is sup- 146.

However, [f]rom 1989 to 2000, the US Food and Drug Adminis\u00ad tration judged 76% of all approved new drugs to be no more than moderate innovations over existing treatments, with many being a modification to an old\u00ad er product with the same ingredient. In 2000, the av\u00ad erage price of these standard-rated new drugs was nearly twice the average price of existing drugs pre\u00ad scribed for the same indications. 157 Therefore, even though the overall effectiveness of most prescription drugs has not changed, the price of these drugs has increased far past the rate of inflation, resulting in no more bang for your buck. Back in Massachusetts, medical conventions are being cancelled due to the new gift ban, causing some to wonder if the law is hurting the econ\u00ad omy. The cancellation of a convention results in lost convention revenues for the city, as well as lost accommodation costs and entertainment ex- d. 158 pen 1tures. Administrative costs induced by recordkeeping mandates may out\u00ad weigh any perceived benefit of disclosure. The added costs and effort asso\u00ad ciated with such a recordkeeping requirement has spawned the introduction of companies seeking to capitalize on the gap in the market for physician gift registries. One company offers gift registry databases for physicians and pharmaceutical companies to maintain their compliance with record\u00ad keeping requirements. This, of course, is not a complimentary service. D. Does Banning Free Drug Samples Hurt Patients? The availability of drug samples from pharmaceutical companies is al\u00ad so a concern.

But that's what samples are. And what they really are not is a safety net for the needy.\"'176 This is con\u00ad trary to the opinion of Ken Johnson, vice-president ofPhRMA, who claims that drug samples help patients and \"often lead to improved quality of life for millions of Americans, regardless of their income.\"177 Yet another doc\u00ad tor asserts that the drug samples do not go to needy patients, but usually go home with physicians and their employees instead.178 It appears that drug samples do help some patients, but not those who need them most.

[Vol. 7:89 This inundation of gifts has prompted some physicians to call for the profession-wide refusal of pharmaceutical company gifts.182 Dr. Howard Brody183 frames the ethical argument in the following way: 1. As a matter of professional integrity, I claim that I ought to behave in accord with certain principles. 2. Empirical evidence shows that I am highly likely to behave in ways contrary to my professional principles when I keep company with [pharmaceutical repre\u00ad sentatives]. 3. My professional responsibilities do not require me to keep company with [pharmaceutical representatives]. 4. If, therefore, I choose to continue to keep company with [pharmaceutical representa\u00ad tives], I cannot claim that I truly wish to adhere to h \u00a3'. 1 . . 1 184 t ose pro.tessiOna pnnc1p es. Brody goes on to explain that empirical evidence demonstrates not on\u00ad ly that physicians are influenced by pharmaceutical representatives, but that they do not realize they are being influenced.185 He also says that spending time with pharmaceutical representatives is often a waste of time, and that most physicians do not allow themselves time to later check the representa\u00ad tive's statements for accuracy and bias.186 The only way for the physician\u00ad pharmaceutical representative relationship to be an effective educational tool would be \"[for physicians to] spend time with reps in a manner that preserves professional integrity[, which] would require both refusing to ac\u00ad cept their gifts and srending a great deal of valuable time double-checking their information.\"18 Brody thinks that physicians could spend their time . 1 188 morew1se y.

First Amendment Issues Yet another issue that concerns opponents of .physician gift bans is whether it impedes on the exercise of free speech.19 In 1976, the United States Supreme Court struck down a Virginia statute that prohibited Virgin\u00ad ia pharmacies from advertising their drug prices. The court reasoned that the advertisements had value as commercial speech.198 Advertisements from pharmaceutical companies are generally regarded as commercial speech, rather than personal speech, which is regarded as a higher form of speech, and thus more protected.199 In order to pass Constitutional muster, a restriction on commercial speech must have a substantial governmental interest that is directly advanced by the restriction.200 In addition, the re- 189.

Some argue that limitations on marketing ha\u00ad bits of pharmaceutical comganies \"can improve prescribing decisions and protect the public's health.' 02 It appears, however, that new state legisla\u00ad tion preventing pharmaceutical companies from using prescribing habit in\u00ad formation will pass constitutional muster, at least according to the First Circuit.203 The statute there, however, limited pharmaceutical companies' access to information mined for the purpose of tailoring marketing efforts to specific physicians?04 It remains to be seen whether restrictions on phar\u00ad maceutical company gifts to physicians will be supported by the courts. H. What is the Best Solution? Limits and bans on such gifts are just one way to combat the effect of pharmaceutical industry influence on physicians. While an outright ban, such as the one implemented in Massachusetts, seems harsh, there is little evidence that lesser limitations, such as those implemented in West Virgin\u00ad ia, have had any great effect on this problem. Indiana's biggest pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly, has already tak\u00ad en proactive steps to anticipatorily comply with the PPSA. The PPSA, however, only requires reporting and disclosure of gifts; it does not limit such gifts to physicians. An outright ban, such as the Massachusetts ban, would likely be more effective at curbing the influence that uninformed (though perfectly coiffed) drug representatives\u00b7 have on physicians who should know better. The PPSA and the Massachusetts ban are on opposite ends of the spectrum, with Minnesota's limits in between. While a happy medium seems favorable, it is evident that drastic measures will need to be taken in order to reverse the troubling trend that is unfolding in the health care in\u00ad dustry because of pharmaceutical companies' gifts to physicians. There appears to be a fine line between educating physicians about new pharma\u00ad ceutical therapies and influencing them to write a prescription that they normally would not, if not for external factors. As far as institutional policies which restrict contact between pharma\u00ad ceutical representatives and physicians go, one study has suggested that physicians who had been trained on the policy after it had taken effect were much more skeptical of statements made by pharmaceutical representa- 201.

Id 2010] UNDER niE INFLUENCE 115 tives?05 A restrictive policy, however, did not affect whether a physician would meet with the pharmaceutical representative.206 This study seems to indicate that restrictive policies in medical institutions do affect the way physicians think about their interactions with drug companies;207 a state\u00ad imposed policy regarding gifts and disclosure may have a similar effect. The FDA advertising limits, however, are unnecessarily stringent. Since television viewers are so inundated with parades of atrocious side effects so frequently, risks of warnings and side effects can often fall on deaf ears. Some side effects may be minimal, but because of their promi\u00ad nent placement in drug commercials, it also could cause some viewers to be too terrified to try a drug that could help them more than hurt them. The FDA advertising limits create an advertising environment for prescription drug advertisers which forces pharmaceutical companies to produce the same bland commercials with the same frightening side effects. This likely does not aid in promoting a product as efficiently as could be done if the FDA's requirements were not so limiting. If pharmaceutical companies could realistically portray their products, rather than show people walking hand-in-hand across a field of flowers whilst discussing their genital herpes, it may create more of a desire in consumer-patients to become educated about the product. The advertisement restrictions are unfair in the sense that they prohibit the pharmaceutical companies from flaunting the positive aspects of their products and instead force them to recite a laundry list of horrendous side effects. V. CONCLUSION Studies have shown that gifts from pharmaceutical companies, phar\u00ad maceutical. advertisements, and information tendered from pharmaceutical representatives may have an effect on physicians' prescribing habits. Eco\u00ad nomic and ethical concerns are at the heart of the issue of pharmaceutical company influence. States have attempted to curb this influence through legislation designed to limit or ban gifts to physicians and mandate disclo\u00ad sures for certain types of gifts. For most state legislation, it is too early to tell whether such legislation will have any effect on physicians' prescribing habits and limiting pharmaceutical company influence. There has been very little litigation relating to the state statutes. The PPSA, if passed, will provide consistency in disclosure and recordk:eeping, while allowing states to maintain stricter standards if they wish. Some physicians are concerned that they will be unable to obtain information about new drugs and thera- 205. George D.

Id. 116 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW [Vol. 7:89 pies once state and federal legislation goes into effect. There is evidence, however, that information disseminated by pharmaceutical companies can be biased and even inaccurate. The key to global peace on this issue appears to be a balancing of the free-flowing dissemination of information between pharmaceutical compa\u00ad nies and physicians regarding new drug information and therapies with the influence of gift-giving on physicians' prescribing habits. Disclosure plays a key role in achieving this balance, as is evident in the implementation of recordkeeping and disclosure statutes in states across the nation. The best way to prevent pharmaceutical company influence on physi\u00ad cians remains to be seen. Once the state plans have been in effect for aw\u00ad hile, it will be easier to see what is most effective at curbing this undue influence. For now, it is important for doctors to realize that, no matter how esteemed and educated, they are not immune to pharmaceutical company influence. Awareness of the problem will lead to a better solution. Only then will fictional Marie, and the rest of the American public, be able to rest easy, confident that their doctors are making well-informed, independent decisions solely for the health of their patients.
