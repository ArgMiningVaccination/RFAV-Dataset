Theocean covers more than 70% of the Earth 's surface and has high phylogenetic diversity, as it is home to 34 of the 36 known animal phyla that currently inhabit the planet. Because of its immense breadth and high degree of biodiversity, the ocean is arguably the ecosystem with the greatest potential for biodiscovery, and it istherefore a very promising source of innovation (Evans-Illidge et al. 2013 ). Marine biotechnology \u2014broadly de ned as the application of science and technology to marine organisms for the production of knowledge, goods, and services \u2014can harness the enormous possibilities of marine biological resources, acting as a bridgebetween biological knowledge and applications to improve the quality of human life(Querellou 2010 ) (Fig. 17.1). However, despite the great potential of marine eco- systems to provide solutions to address global challenges, such as food scarcity, sustainable energy, and environmental and human health, the ocean remains largelyunexplored (Trincone et al. 2015 ). In fact, we know more about the moon 's surface than we know about the depths of our oceans. But this can change. We are at a Fig. 17.1 Marine biotechnology work flow. Marine (blue) biotechnology relies on unique bioactive products derived from marine invertebrate biochemical innovations. These products and the animals that produce them are investigated using a biotechnological toolbox that applies basic and applied research methods such as biodiversity assessments and aquaculture production todevelop a wide range of biotechnological applications360 A. Verdes and M. Holfordconfluence in time where advances in the last 40 years have spearheaded techno- logical breakthroughs above and below the seas. These innovations enabled newapproaches for collecting marine organisms, using methods like remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and gliders, and for leveraging the twentieth-century revolution in molecular biology to decipher the genetic and chemical composition ofmarine organisms in a relatively fast and cost-effective manner. The marine biotechnology enterprise (blue biotechnology) has grown exponen- tially in the last few decades, and with less than 5% of the vast oceanic environmentexplored, it has already delivered an array of innovations such as new medicines,chemicals, nanomaterials, nutritional supplements, bioenergy resources, and strate-gies for the sustainable use and management of the world oceans (e.g., Hannon et al. 2010 ; Livett et al. 2004 ; Schmidtko et al. 2010 ). Starting in the 1980s, there has been a signi cant increase in the number of marine compounds discovered each year, with annual numbers peaking at 400 -500 novel compounds (Greco and Cinquegrani 2016 ). The biomedical industry has particularly bene ted from the discovery of novel marine chemicals, with nine therapies derived from marine organisms cur-rently approved for treating disease and al. 2010 ) (Table 17.1). The applications of these com- pounds are as diverse as the organisms from which they were discovered. For example, Prialt \u00aeis a pain therapy developed from the venom of the marine snail Conus magus , while Adcertis \u00aeis sea hare Dolabella auricularia that treats Hodgkin lymphoma (Hart 2015 ; Miljanich 2004 ). Halaven \u00aeis a breast cancer therapy derived from the sponge Halichondria okadai , while Retrovir \u00ae, also derived from a marine sponge, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS (Chiba and Tagami 2011 ; Rachlis 1990 ). As these successful cases illustrate, the great diversity of chemical com- pounds found in the ocean is a highly valuable but yet untapped resource for the discovery of novel bioactive agents with unique structures and diverse biologicalactivities that can greatly improve human life (Evans-Illidge et al. 2013 ). Marine habitats range from tropical coral reefs to ocean trenches and include ecosystems with the most extreme conditions of pressure, temperature, and light. Asa consequence, marine organisms have evolved a plethora of remarkable adaptationsthat serve a variety of vital functions to survive in different habitats. For example,toxic secretions such as those produced by venomous marine organisms are in some cases used as a defensive mechanism against predators and in others as a weapon to subdue prey (Casewell et al. 2013 ; Verdes et al. 2018 ). Like venom, several other adaptations developed by marine organisms, such as bioluminescence and ink,represent biochemical innovations where the animals have attained novel and uniquebioactive molecules that often show considerably greater potency than their terres-trial counterparts (Schroeder 2015 ; Trincone et al. 2015 ). Marine organisms have perfected these biochemical adaptations through millions of years of evolution,providing an immense reservoir of bioactive compounds with enormous potential for both basic and applied research (Schroeder 2015 ; Trincone et al. 2015 ) (Fig. 17.1 ). In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the exceptional17 Beach to Bench to Bedside: Marine Invertebrate Biochemical ... 361Table 17.1 Therapeutics derived from marine organisms.

Verdes and M. Holfordbiochemical innovations found in marine organisms, speci cally marine inverte- brates, and the biotechnological and biomedical applications derived from them toadvance and improve human life. 17.2 Biochemical Innovations of Marine Invertebrates To survive in the varied ocean ecosystems they occupy, marine invertebrates haveevolved an array of biochemical innovations that allow them to adapt and thrive inoften extreme environments. These biochemical innovations, which range fromsecretions of mucus and toxins to light-producing molecules, play fundamentalroles in marine ecological interactions, acting as pheromones, feeding deterrents,mediators of spatial competition, site recognition cues, antifouling agents, UVsunscreens, and facilitating reproduction (Harper et al. 2001 ). In a journey from the shallow intertidal to the abyssal depths, marine invertebrates display effortless biochemical innovations that humans have labored to reproduce in laboratories. Inthe following paragraphs, we describe a few examples of biochemical wondersproduced by marine invertebrates, including toxins, ink secretions, adhesive gels,and light-producing compounds that have been translated to advance the bluebiotechnology enterprise. 17.2.1 Marine Invertebrate Toxins Many marine organisms defend themselves from predators by using toxic sub- stances, including harmful secondary metabolites, poisonous molecules, and ven- omous secretions. These types of chemical defenses are particularly common amongsessile and soft-bodied invertebrates such as sponges, corals, and ascidians that oftendominate subtidal habitats with intense rates of predation (Lindquist 2002 ). For instance, venoms, which are generally de ned as toxic secretions produced by one animal and delivered to another animal through the in fliction of a wound, have evolved independently many times throughout the Metazoa (Casewell et al. 2013 ; Fry et al. 2009 ). Animal venoms are composed of a mixture of bioactive toxins and represent one of the most complex biochemical natural secretions known to date (Norton and Olivera 2006 ; Vonk et al. 2013 ). Venomous marine invertebrates are found in many phyla, from cnidarians such as sea anemones and jelly sh, which are the oldest venomous sea creatures recorded (Macek 1992 ; Ponce et al. 2016 ), to echinoderms such as star sh and sea urchins (Lee et al. 2015 ; Nakagawa et al. 1991 ); mollusks, such as cone snails and octopuses (Gorson et al. 2015 ; Olivera 2007 ); annelids, including reworms and bloodworms (Verdes et al. 2018 ; von Reumont et al. 2014a ,b); and arrow worms (Thuesen et al. 1988 ) (Fig. 17.2a-c).17 Beach to Bedside: Marine Invertebrate Biochemical ... 363A particularly proli c group in terms of venom is the predatory marine neogastropods of the Conoidea superfamily (Fig. 17.2a-b). The Conoidea represents one of the most diverse groups of venomous marine organisms with numerous lineages characterized by a venom apparatus used for predation (Gonzalesand Saloma 2014 ; Gorson et al. 2015 ; Gorson and Holford 2016 ; Holford et al. 2009 ; Puillandre et al. 2014 ). The genus Conus is the most comprehensively studied and includes species that produce complex venoms with hundreds of unique peptidetoxins, referred to as conotoxins (Kaas et al. 2012 ; Puillandre et al. 2012 ). While cone snail venom has been studied for more than 40 years, less than 2% of theirvenom peptides have been characterized to identify their functional molecular Fig. 17.2 Biochemical innovations of marine e)Tomopteris helgolandica under natural (left) and induced bioluminescence (right); Verdes and M. Holfordtargets. Similarly, beyond cone snails, the venoms of terebrids and turrids are largely unknown. Recent efforts have begun to characterize the venom peptides of terebridsand turrids relying largely on advances in next-generation sequencing and other analytic techniques such as proteomics (Gonzales and Saloma 2014 ; Gorson et al. 2015 ). In fact, small, harder to collect, and often neglected venomous marine invertebrates are now being investigated in record numbers, thanks to what issometimes referred to as the \"rise of the omics \"(Gorson and Holford 2016 ; von Reumont et al. 2014a ,b). Given that venomous conoidean snails can conservatively produce between 50 and 200 peptides in their toxic arsenal and there are more than10,000 species of conoideans, there is an amazing repertoire of venom peptides to bediscovered. Whether in cnidarians, echinoderms, or mollusks, the venom peptides produced by these organisms are extremely potent, fast acting, and very speci c, targeting hematic and neurotic pathways (Fry et al. 2009 ; Verdes et al. 2018 ). 17.2.2 Marine Mollusk an ink secretion that functions as a chemical antipredator defense (Fig. 17.2g -h). Sea hares, in particular, have risen to scienti c acclaim for their use in neuroscience to determine the mechanisms of learning andmemory. These herbivorous animals, when threatened, release toxins sequestered from their diet of red algae (Kicklighter et al. 2007 ; Paul and Pennings 1991 ). Both sea hares and cephalopods secrete their chemically laden ink from two distinctglands. In the case of the sea hare, the products of the ink gland and the opalinegland are released into the mantle cavity and then pumped through the siphon towardthe predator (Love-Chezem et al. 2013 ; Prince 2007 ). Opaline is a viscous substance that contains a high concentration of free amino acids and sticks to the chemosensoryappendages of the predator, inactivating them and thus in fluencing its capacity to detect prey (Kicklighter et al. 2007 ; Love-Chezem et al. 2013 ). In addition to acting through sensory inactivation, ink secretion of sea hares can also act as an unpalatable repellent and as a decoy that misdirects and confuses the predator (Nolen et al. 1995 ; Nusnbaum and Derby 2010 ). Cephalopod ink functions as antipredatory visual stimuli, acting either as a smoke screen or as a distracting decoy and possibly alsodisrupting the predator 's chemical sensors (Caldwell 2005 ). It is composed of a black ink containing melanin produced by the ink gland and a viscous mucousproduced by the funnel organ (Derby 2014 ). Ink secretions of both sea hares and cephalopods represent a successful biochemical innovation that has enabled the organisms to survive and thrive.17 Beach to Bench to Bedside: Marine Invertebrate Biochemical viscoelastic adhesive gels such as mucus secretions that consist of a network of polysaccharides and proteins entangled toform a gel with more than 95% of water content (Stabili et al. 2015 ). These mucous secretions are essential for the survival of many marine invertebrates as they are usedfor a variety of functions including protection against pathogens and parasites, tocoat vulnerable organs, reduce drag forces, prevent sedimentation, enhance adhe-sion, limit water loss, and aid in locomotion and feeding (Smith 2002 ; Stabili et al. 2015 ; Weigand et al. 2017 ). Sessile marine invertebrates, in particular, which are permanently attached to the seafloor with limited mobility, are more vulnerable to predation and use mucus secretions as an antipredator mechanism. In addition to mechanical protection, themucus of many of these species contains toxic compounds that make the animalpoisonous or distasteful (Iori et al. 2014 ). In many cases, the mucus also serves as an immune response system, producing a considerable amount of defensive compoundssuch as bioactive antimicrobials, toxins, and cytolytic molecules (Derby 2007 ; Iori et al. 2014 ; Stabili et al. 2015 ). Numerous lter-feeding sessile organisms, such the marine annelid (Fig. 17.2i ), use mucus to trap and lter food, to deter prey, and to gather sand particles to build protective tubes (Weigand et al. 2017 ). Other marine invertebrates, most notably mollusks, use mucus as an adhesive to attach to thesubstratum during locomotion. Some of these mollusks such as limpets and musselsare well-known for the extraordinary adhesive power of their mucus secretions(Smith 2002 ; Stewart et al. 2011 ). 17.2.4 Light-Producing Compounds Bioluminescence, the ability to produce light by living organisms, is another outstanding biochemical innovation that has independently evolved in many line-ages across the tree of life (Haddock et al. 2010 ). Bioluminescent light is the product of a chemical reaction involving the oxidation of a light-emitting molecule ). In some cases, the luciferin is strongly bound to the luciferase and oxygen, forming a stable complex referred to as a photoprotein (Deheyn and Latz 2009 ; Shimomura 1985 ). Biolumi- nescent forms are found in many taxonomic groups, ranging from bacteria tovertebrates, but the great majority of luminous organisms are marine taxa(Shimomura 2012 ; Widder 2010 ). In fact, a recent study based on observations of more than 350,000 individuals in the water column reported that 76% of them werebioluminescent (Martini and Haddock 2017 ). A great number of luminous invertebrates, including cnidarians, ctenophores, annelids,mollusks, Verdes and M. marine invertebrates is remarkable, with species occu- pying a great range of habitats, from coastal waters to the deep sea, in benthic andpelagic waters, from polar to tropical regions. This outstanding diversity is matched by the wide array of bioluminescent colors \u2014including yellow light emitters (Fig. 17.2e ), which are extremely rare in marine environments \u2014as well as varying light patterns and chemistries (Verdes and Gruber 2017 ). Likewise, bioluminescence is associated with a variety of different functions, including defense, predation, andintraspeci c communication (Bassot and Nicolas 1995 ; Gouveneaux and Mallefet 2013 ; Haddock et al. 2010 ; Oba et al. 2016 ). Although all bioluminescent organisms convert the chemical energy of an oxi- dation reaction into light, their independent evolutionary origins have resulted in a great diversity of chemistries and biological systems (Conti et al. 1996 ). The luciferases characterized so far from different organisms have extremely diversestructures, substrate speci cities, and mechanisms and do not generally share sequence similarities (Viviani 2002 ). Luciferins are also quite diverse; however, in many cases the same compound has been independently co-opted in unrelatedorganisms. For instance, coelenterazine is the light emitter in at least nine phylaincluding jelly sh, crustaceans, mollusks, and vertebrates, even though their lucif- erases are unrelated in sequence and structure (Gimenez et al. 2016 ; Haddock et al. 2010 ). 17.3 Biotechnological and Biomedical Applications Recent scienti c breakthroughs and technological advances such as next-generation sequencing, proteomics, and bioinformatics are accelerating our capacity to bioactive compounds for biotechnological and biomedical applications thathave signi cant potential to improve human life and advance scienti c knowledge. In the following sections, we describe some of the novel applications that have been developed from bioactive compounds isolated from marine invertebrate biochemicaladaptations. 17.3.1 Pharmacological Applications of Venom Peptides Many compounds derived from marine invertebrate biochemical innovations, inparticular venom toxins, have become major sources of drug leads driving research efforts in the pharmaceutical industry and greatly advancing drug discovery and development efforts. The only drug derived from venomous marine snails, Prialt \u00ae, is based on a venom peptide from the species Conus magus , and it is used to treat chronic pain in HIV and cancer patients (Miljanich 2004 ). Prialt \u00ae(ziconotide; MVIIA) is a breakthrough drug as it not only realized the potential of venomousmarine snails for drug discovery, but it also provided a new paradigm for treating17 Beach to Bench to Bedside: Marine Invertebrate Biochemical ... 367pain because it targets N-type calcium channels instead of opioid receptors (Fusetani et al. 2000 ; McGivern 2007 ). Until the discovery and development of Prialt \u00ae, most pharmaceutical companies looking for analgesic remedies investigated compounds that target opioid receptors, such as morphine. Prialt \u00aerevolutionized chronic pain treatment as it demonstrated that a peptide that modulates ion channels can be just aseffective, or even more, than the gold standard morphine, with the additional bene t of not causing the undesirable side effect of drug addiction. However, Prialt \u00aedoes not cross the blood-brain barrier, and it is currently administered via intrathecalinjection, which represents a major drawback limiting its widespread application(Staats et al. 2004 ). Recent efforts to overcome the invasive delivery method of Prialt\u00aeinvolve a Trojan horse strategy in which the peptide is encapsulated in a viral nanocontainer and shuttled across the blood-brain barrier (Anand et al. 2015 ; Kelly et al. 2015 ). The Trojan horse strategy mimics how venom is stored and delivered by venomous snails in nature. Conoidean snails produce venom in a special glandreferred to as the venom gland, where toxins are stored in capsule-like structuressimilar to a nanocontainer and later delivered to a hollow radular harpoon forinjection into the prey (Holford et al. 2009 ; Terlau and Olivera 2004 ). The potential applications of conoidean venom peptides go well beyond pain management andinclude treatment of other disorders such as epilepsy and cancer, to name a few (Petras et al. 2015 ; Vetter and Lewis 2012 ). Most drug therapies being developed from marine snail venom peptides target ion channels and receptors (King 2011 ; Lewis and Garcia 2003 ; Olivera 1997 ; Ortiz et al. 2015 ; Vetter et al. 2011 ). Conoidean venom peptides are short disul de-rich peptides with a characteristic structure consisting of a signal peptide, followed by a propeptide region and aterminal cysteine-rich mature peptide, and therefore they share some features ofother peptide therapeutics, namely, poor pharmacokinetics and not being orallyactive (Uhlig et al. 2014 ). As a consequence, there are key areas pertaining to drug delivery that must be addressed to truly advance the potential of marine snail venom peptides for drug development. 17.3.2 Applications of Light-Producing Molecules in Biophotonics Light-emitting compounds have also been widely used for biotechnological appli- cations. The discovery of the green fluorescent protein from the bioluminescent jellyshAequorea victoria revolutionized the biological eld leading to a variety of novel imaging tools and reporters (Chal ee ta l . 1994 ; Tsien 1998 ). In a similar way, the constituents of bioluminescent systems, luciferin and luciferases, have been widely used in biotechnology for three primary applications: as probes for cellular biology, as tools to map and identify genes, and to track the progression of disease inlaboratory animals (Widder and Falls 2014 ).368 A. Verdes and M. HolfordBioluminescent molecules have been widely used in cell biology because many enzymes and metabolites can be measured by coupling them to bioluminescencecofactors such as ATP or H 2O2(Widder and Falls 2014 ). For instance, the refly luciferin-luciferase system can use the ATP produced by a reaction catalyzed by a kinase to produce light in proportion to the kinase (Lundin et al. 1976 ). This assay is the most sensitive detection method available, and because all living cells containATP, it has been used in a wide range of applications, from determining the impactof antibiotics on bacterial growth to the search for life on Mars (Widder and Falls2014 ). In addition, many calcium-activated photoproteins isolated from marine invertebrates such as cnidarians and ctenophores have played a major role inunderstanding the function of calcium, a ubiquitous intracellular messenger in cell regulation (Bonora et al. 2013 ; Ottolini et al. 2013 ). Bioluminescent proteins have also been used to replace fluorescent markers in genetic engineering experiments, to determine if a gene of interest inserted into aparticular cell is actually being expressed. For this purpose, a luciferase gene isincorporated into the DNA region adjacent to the gene of interest, and both genes areexpressed together when luciferin and any necessary cofactors are added (Contagand Bachmann 2002 ; Mezzanotte et al. 2017 ). The luciferases most commonly used for monitoring gene expression are those isolated from the North American refly Photinus pyralis and from two marine 2014 ). Bioluminescent imaging reporters have also revolutionized the study of disease progression, for example, enabling the tracking of an infection in a single animal.Transforming pathogenic bacteria with luciferase and monitoring its biolumines-cence made it possible to track the course of an infection in a single host; observe cellmigration, proliferation, and apoptosis; and evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics(Contag et al. 1995 ; Kim et al. 2015 ). Bioluminescence imaging has also greatly contributed to advances in cancer research, allowing to visualize tumor cells in living animals and making possible to evaluate the ef cacy of chemotherapies and immune cell therapies in vivo (Madero-Visbal et al. 2012 ; Sweeney et al. 1999 ). 17.3.3 Biomaterials Derived from Marine Invertebrates In recent decades, marine-derived biomaterials have gathered increased attention from the medical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries for a variety ofapplications ranging from food additives to biodegradable plastics andbio-adhesives. Cephalopod ink, for example, has been widely used by humans for many practical and commercial purposes, especially in medicine, cuisine, and art (Derby2014 ). Several cosmetic products such as mascara or eyeshadow have been devel- oped using squid ink, with the goal of developing products that are effective but alsosustainable, safe, and respectful with the environment (Neifar et al. 2013 ). The food industry has also used cephalopod ink in various ways, including food flavoring,17 Beach to Bench to Bedside: Marine Invertebrate Biochemical ... 369food coloring, and even curing preserving cuttle sh meat, due to its antimicro- bial properties (Derby 2014 ; Xu et al. 2009 ). Adhesive gels and their constituents, such as mussel adhesive proteins, are also being investigated as attractive biomaterials for various applications including electronic skin and wound dressings or to develop biomimetic analogues thatfunction as antifouling coatings (Kord Forooshani and Lee 2017 ; Li and Zeng 2016 ). For example, the adhesion mechanism of mussels has inspired a free- standing, adhesive, tough, and biocompatible hydrogel that might be more conve-nient for surgical applications than currently used adhesives (Han et al. 2017 ). 17.4 Future Prospects As outlined in this chapter, there are numerous biochemical adaptions that marine organisms have developed which could lead to important scienti c advances, such as nonaddictive pain therapies as an alternative to opioids or novel surgical hydrogels.However, to realize the immense potential of marine invertebrate bioactive mole-cules for both basic research and biotechnological applications, much more must bedone to support the study and discovery of the numerous secrets hidden in ouroceans. The Earth 's oceans are a scienti c phenomenon, full of amazing creatures that have evolved to master their domain and in doing so have provided a roadmap for discovery and innovation. While there are many ways to investigate the oceans, the path that puts the conservation of the environment and the organisms rst should be the preferred one. As extinction rates increase, we are losing more than we cancharacterize with existing technologies. It would be a catastrophic human failure totreat our oceans as factories and not as a source of inspiration. To effectively developapplications based on successful marine products provided by nature, we need toinvest in basic research to identify the most promising compounds and the bestenvironmentally safe methods for extracting them. When discussing the biotechnol- ogy enterprise, the tendency is to highlight the human applications but not the relevance of the basic research that led to them. However consider, for example,the great scienti c advances being achieved and conceived with CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Mei et al. 2016 ). Had it not been for the thoughtful and thorough investigations of the adaptive immune system of Streptococcus thermophilus , the powerful genome editing tool CRISPR-Cas9, as we know it, might not havehappened (Lander 2016 ; Mojica and Rodriguez-Valera 2016 ). In the attempt to translate ocean products to goods and services to advance society, we must practice the concept of identifying the \"usefulness of useless knowledge \"(Flexner 1955 ). It is imperative that we bring to the table the inherent value of basic fundamental researchin evolution and biodiversity, to allow the blue biotechnology enterprise to act as atrue bridge between basic knowledge and applications to improve the quality ofhuman life.370 A.
