I was first recommend to Dr. Molloy a few years ago, and then last year re-injured my back. Dr. Molloy was able to diagnose my problem even before the MRI. Began treating immediately, which after months of pain I finally was able to return to normal activities. I continue to visit for regular adjustments. The Doctor and his office staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Being able to see him on my schedule is great. Highly recommended.... DOC FIXED MY HEART ATTACK!!!! Seriously, after a morning at Condell ER for chest pain, nothing was found. Chest pain continued. Went to Doc, explained the pain. He adjusted a rib in my sternum I had sprained cleaning/moving my 230 pound Dad. Pain immediately GONE!! I have known Doc is a miracle worker for more than 30 years, but this took the cake!! I LOVE you all !!!... A huge shout out to Molloy Chiropractic! i was having trouble walking all day, and was in tremendous pain. By the time I got to the office I was losing feeling in my foot. I'm now able to stand upright and feel my toastir!
