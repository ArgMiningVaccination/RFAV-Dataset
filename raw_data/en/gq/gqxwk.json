However, it is also associated with several unwanted effects which may sometimes prove fatal in the long run. Such effects are more evident in cells exposed to strong oxidants containing reactive oxygen species (ROS). The adverse outcomes of oxidative metabolism are referred to as oxidative stress, which is a staple theme in contemporary medical research. Oxidative stress leads to plasma membrane disruption through lipid peroxidation and has several other deleterious effects. A large body of literature suggests the involvement of ROS in cancer, ageing, and several other health hazards of the modern world. Plant-based cures for these conditions are desperately sought after as supposedly safer alternatives to mainstream medicines. Phytochemicals, which constitute a diverse group of plant-based substances with varying roles in oxidative reactions of the body, are implicated in the treatment of cancer, aging, and all other ROS-induced anomalies. This review presents a summary of important phytochemicals extracted from medicinal plants which are a part of Indian ethnomedicine and Ayurveda and describes their possible therapeutic significance.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-13", "cleaned_text": "Oxidative Stress and Cancer [https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10101606](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10101606) physiological roles are assigned to cellular oncogenes in a normal cell and most of them are involved in cell cycle regulation through their effects on molecular mechanisms of chromatin condensation, DNA damage, replication, transcription, and translation. Cellular oncogenes are homologous to viral oncogenes, which explains the viral origin of some well-known cancers. A different class of genes involved in cancer progression are tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and retinoblastoma protein (Rb) that avert the development of cancer by inciting apoptosis in cancerous cells [ [2](#B2-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Any defect in tumor suppressor genes pushes the cancerous cell to escape apoptosis and continue proliferation leading to tumorigenesis [ [3](#B3-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [4](#B4-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Since all these pathways are correlated with the incidence of cancer, it is obvious that oxidative stress has a huge bearing on cancer epidemiology. In fact, oxidative stress has been shown in causing cancer by inducing DNA damage and mutagenesis. As a result, antioxidant substances are seen as potential candidates in treating various types of cancer, and this has been a promising research area to explore further in cancer therapeutics. In some cases, the theoretical basis of anticarcinogenic effect of certain antioxidants is well known. In this connection, molecules involved in the oxidative metabolism of the cell (such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase - SOD, and peroxidase) appear to be the likely targets for managing cancer [ [4](#B4-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [5](#B5-antioxidants-10-01606)]. This has led to an intensified quest for alternative cures that are free of such side effects. Alternative medicine provides a ray of hope for a safe cancer cure exempt from undesirable side effects. Phytochemicals obtained from traditional herbs are known to have a wide chemical diversity, and several classes of such phytochemicals may have anticancer properties. In particular, chemicals such as terpenes, carotenoids, alkaloids, organosulfur compounds, and steroids are abundantly present in plants. Some of these have shown clinical efficacy in treating cancer [ [6](#B6-antioxidants-10-01606), [7](#B7-antioxidants-10-01606)]. We discuss these aspects in a detailed manner in the below mentioned sections. 2. Relation between Oxidative Stress and Cancer [8](#B8-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Oxidative stress has numerous pro-tumorigenic effects such as genome instability, enhancing DNA mutation rate, or promoting DNA damage as well as cell proliferation. On the other hand, oxidative stress also exerts anti-tumorigenic activities and studies have shown that it is correlated with apoptosis and senescence - the two key mechanisms that neutralize cancer development [ [9](#B9-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Cancer cells exhibit enhanced ROS production that may increase cell proliferation. Undeniably, cancer initiation and its progression are correlated to oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage, increased DNA mutations or genome instability as well as cell proliferation [ [10](#B10-antioxidants-10-01606)]. In order to guard the organism against such detrimental pro-oxidants (endobiotic or xenobiotic), a systematically designed complex non-enzymatic antioxidants (which act by interrupting free radical chain reactions) such as glutathione (GSH), vitamins C, D and E come into play [ [11](#B11-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Under regular physiological situations, these protective antioxidant molecules are present in quantities adequate to tackle the physiological rate of free-radical production. It is also well known that any further load of free radicals can disturb the antioxidant balance (anti-free radical) and pro-oxidant (free radical) balance. This imbalance leads to oxidative stress, when it goes beyond the capability of the oxidation-reduction system of the body, gene mutation may result leading to many chronic diseases including cancer [ [12](#B12-antioxidants-10-01606)]. 3. Indian Ethnomedicinal Plants as a Potential Source of Anticancer Phytochemicals [13](#B13-antioxidants-10-01606)]. The Indian herbal medicines or the conventional medicaments have been derived from the prosperous customs of prehistoric civilizations and scientific inheritance. Herbal therapeutics, thus comprise a key stake of all the legitimate Indian organizations of medicine such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) [ [14](#B14-antioxidants-10-01606)]. These herbal remedies are used by more than 70% of the inhabitants for their primary health-related troubles [ [15](#B15-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It is believed that these plant-based herbal remedies are non-toxic against normal cells and are therefore well tolerated (or accepted) by the human body. This attribute is a great motivation to spark the interest of drug designers who are in the pursuit of cheap and safer alternatives to modern synthetic medicines. A brief list of some ayurvedic medicinal plants having potent anticancer activity and their main phytochemicals is provided in [Table 1](#antioxidants-10-01606-t001). A state-wise geographical distribution of some prominent Indian ethnomedicinal plants has been provided in [Figure 1](#antioxidants-10-01606-f001). [Table 2](#antioxidants-10-01606-t002)listed out several important Indian ethnomedicinal/Ayurvedic remedies and their uses in medical science. Although, validation of a combined therapeutic approach based on Ayurvedic prescriptions and modern medicine with better efficiency and safety is likely to be a big leap in overcoming some of the hurdles in the way of treating difficult disorders such as cancer [ [16](#B16-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [17](#B17-antioxidants-10-01606)]. These phytochemicals or their modified derivatives have displayed significant anti-tumor potential. [18](#B18-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Moreover, the anti-cancer potential of a variety of plants is still being actively investigated and even some have displayed very encouraging results. |Ayurvedic| as brain tonic that help to improve memory and brain functions by preventing cell damage due to its endometriosis, piles, diarrhoea, bloody stools and different types of discharges from vaginal tract [64](#B64-antioxidants-10-01606)] [65](#B65-antioxidants-10-01606)] 4. Antioxidant Phytochemicals in the Management of Cancer [66](#B66-antioxidants-10-01606)]. A plethora of studies has reported that phytochemicals from ethnomedicinal plants can yield numerous bioactive compounds with promising anti-cancer potential. Besides, in addition to their renowned antioxidant properties, several phytochemicals target epigenetic processes participating in cancer progression by modulating oxidative stress [ [67](#B67-antioxidants-10-01606), [68](#B68-antioxidants-10-01606)]. In treating cancer, an efficient strategy is to induce senescence and cytostasis by using cytotoxic agents. Several anticancer polyphenols arrest cellular growth via the induction of ROS-dependent premature senescence (RDPS), and are contemplated as promising antitumor therapeutic options [ [69](#B69-antioxidants-10-01606)]. In the light of this mechanism, pro-oxidant therapy which involves drugs that trigger oxidation-induced cell death has been emerging as an effective strategy for treating cancer [ [70](#B70-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [71](#B71-antioxidants-10-01606)]. In the recent past, numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms that impart anticarcinogenic properties to phytochemicals, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids [ [72](#B72-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Curcumin, which yellow polyphenolic phytochemical produced by Curcuma longa (Turmeric) plants and is widely used in Indian ethnomedicine, is in fact a strong antioxidant agent. It is an exceptionally potent, lipid-soluble compound owing its healing properties to its pro-oxidant/antioxidant effects since the generation of ROS by curcuminoids and curcumin correlates with their apoptotic activity on cancer cells [ [73](#B73-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Antioxidant or pro-oxidant capacity of any prospective candidate drug against cancer thus appears heavily dependent on the concentrations of active phytochemicals in it. A number of studies using different cell models have highlighted the pro-oxidative properties of polyphenols, which are also known as antioxidants, the structure of published articles indexed in PubMed online database pertaining to the most studied antioxidant phytochemicals associated with oxidative stress and cancer. [75](#B75-antioxidants-10-01606), [76](#B76-antioxidants-10-01606)]. In an in vivo research study performed on rats by Sharmila et al., the antioxidant activity of quercetin was matched with that of a carcinogen and testosterone by histological evaluation and measuring oxidative stress markers, such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), H2O2 and reduced GSH. They observed that carcinogen and testosterone-treated rats had higher levels of LPO and H2O2 and lower levels of GSH compared with rats with quercetin treatment. They also reported that quercetin improved the levels of antioxidant enzymes and apoptotic proteins in animals having prostate cancer. Additionally, the authors observed that quercetin synchronized the expression of androgen receptors (AR), insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1), protein kinase B (AKT), cell proliferation factors, and anti-apoptotic proteins which are usually elevated in cancer [ [77](#B77-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Quercetin also trims down the overproduction of ROS, inhibits the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- gene, corrects the damage inflicted by trauma and averts myocardial cell injury caused due to Ca2+ overload [ [78](#B78-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Thus, quercetin can efficiently prevent injuries caused by oxidative stress [ [79](#B79-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [80](#B80-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [81](#B81-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Lately, it is reported that the antioxidant potential of hydroxyl stilbenes (trans- and cis-resveratrol and their hydroxylated analogs) is associated with the regulation of eicosanoid synthesis, and the basic stilbene structure of two benzene rings bonded by a central ethylene is chiefly accountable for its properties on Caco-2 cell growth, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle independently of redox state and modulation of eicosanoid synthesis [ [82](#B82-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [83](#B83-antioxidants-10-01606)]. and its auto-oxidant products may stimulate apoptosis in HL-60 cells. It is involved in modulating Bcl-2, thereby influencing apoptosis, which may explain the observed antioxidant properties of lycopene. It also restrains carcinogenesis by saving indispensable biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, LDL, and DNA [ [84](#B84-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Besides, lycopene also possesses the quenching capability against singlet oxygen that can be accredited to its conjugated double bonds [ [85](#B85-antioxidants-10-01606)]. 5. Classification of Dietary Antioxidant Phytochemicals in the Management of Oxidative Stress and Cancer 5.1. Phenolic Compounds [86](#B86-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [Table 3](#antioxidants-10-01606-t003)lists the anticancer activity antioxidant phenolic phytochemicals, whereas [Figure 3](#antioxidants-10-01606-f003)shows phenolic phytochemicals. [87](#B87-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [88](#B88-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It demonstrated potential inhibitory activity in different cancer types, such as for the initiation, promotion, and progression stages. [89](#B89-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Curcumin perturbs the balance in the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to enhanced suppression of the Bcl-xL protein [ [90](#B90-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [91](#B91-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It contains a variety of active phenolic compounds, e.g., [ [6](#B6-antioxidants-10-01606)]-gingerol, [ [8](#B8-antioxidants-10-01606)]-gingerol, [ [10](#B10-antioxidants-10-01606)]-gingerol, and [ [6](#B6-antioxidants-10-01606)]-shogaol. Among these, [ [6](#B6-antioxidants-10-01606)]-gingerol is one of the most significant pungent components of ginger and was found to have varied pharmacological actions, such as antioxidant, antiemetic, cardiotonic, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet properties [ [92](#B92-antioxidants-10-01606)]. de Lima et al. (2018) found that ginger extract and [ [6](#B6-antioxidants-10-01606)]-gingerol exerted their action through imperative mediators and pathways [94](#B94-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It is also evident by numerous in vitro and in vivo reports that -tocopherol, -tocopherol, and vitamin E metabolite 13'-carboxychromanol have potent anti-cancer activities via modulating key signaling and several mediators that regulate tumor progression and cell death for example PI3K, NF-B, diverse alkaloids known, nearly 17,000 have shown varied pharmacological properties comprising anticancer activities [ [104](#B104-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Among the many pharmacological features of alkaloids are their prominent antioxidant properties which make them capable of averting a range of degenerative ailments either through their binding to catalysts involved in diverse oxidation processes happening within an individual's body or through capturing free radicals. [Table 4](#antioxidants-10-01606-t004)lists the anticancer activity of some recently reported potent antioxidant alkaloids, whereas [Figure 4](#antioxidants-10-01606-f004)shows the chemical structures of some lead alkaloids. [105](#B105-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It is an isoquinoline derivative extracted from Coptis chinensis [Family; Berberidaceae], which possesses pharmacological actions. It is equipped with anti-bacterial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties and is also beneficial for the cardiovascular system [ [106](#B106-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [107](#B107-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It has been shown to possess many important biological functions including anti-inflammatory, anti-fertility, and immunomodulatory effects [ [108](#B108-antioxidants-10-01606)]. The unique chemical structure of rohitukine presents a framework for derivatization and chemical synthesis of some novel molecules [ [109](#B109-antioxidants-10-01606)]. P-276-00 and flavopiridol are two rohitukine analogs presently evaluated in the advanced phase II clinical trials for a potential anticancer drug [ [110](#B110-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Flavopiridol demonstrated efficient action against most cancer cell lines and tumorous growth suppression in animals [ [111](#B111-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It is a pan-CDK inhibitor that arrests the cell cycle in G1/S or G2/M phase and has been used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ [112](#B112-antioxidants-10-01606)]. In a recent study, it has been observed that rohitukine induces cytotoxic effects in lung cancer (A549) cells and stimulates the production of ROS following the exposure of 24 hrs. It was also found that rohitukine activated apoptosis in A549 cell line through the upregulation of p53 and caspase 9 and the downregulation opiates as analgesics involves the use of alkaloids such as codeine in mild pain and morphine or other members of the class in later stages of severe pain [ [122](#B122-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It has long been known that morphine and other opiate alkaloids work by binding to -opiate receptors in the central nervous system to suppress pain [ [123](#B123-antioxidants-10-01606)]. 5.3. Organosulfur Compounds [124](#B124-antioxidants-10-01606)]. There are two major groups of natural resources that contain OSCs with unique properties. Onion, garlic, shallot chives, and leeks are famous representatives of the Allium genus that have S-alk(en)yl-l-cysteine sulfoxides [ [125](#B125-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Cauliflower, cabbage, and kale are representatives of the genus Brassica, while rucola belongs to the genus Eruca of cruciferous family that contain S-methyl cysteine-l-sulfoxide [ [126](#B126-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Earlier research studies have revealed the anti-cancer mechanisms of extracts, preparations, and organosulfur products of alliaceous vegetables. These mechanisms presumably include their antimicrobial activity, redox modification, and reduced bioactivation of cancer-causing agents. Hence, Allium vegetables and their active phytochemicals have assumed significance in efficiently regulating the biological processing of carcinogenesis so as to alter or reduce the hazard of cancer. OSCs inhibit the development of cancer cells by several pathways including inhibition of metabolism, inhibition of angiogenesis, and cell cycle arrest. These compounds are classified into water-soluble OSCs such as S-Allyl compounds are declared to have potent antioxidant capacity. Their potential to scavenge ROS plays conceivably a significant role in their anti-senescence activity in vitro. [Table 5](#antioxidants-10-01606-t005)reports the anticancer activity of recently reported potent antioxidant organosulfur phytochemicals and [Figure 5](#antioxidants-10-01606-f005)shows organosulfur phytochemicals. [128](#B128-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Recently, Rosas-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. appraised the effects of alliin and allicin on cell death and senescence, and their senolytic potential in MCF-7 (luminal A) and HCC-70 (triple-negative breast cancer cells). Their results revealed that allicin has anti-proliferative, anti-clonogenic, and senolytic properties. In addition, allicin reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis by triggering the loss of m, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation, downregulation of BCL-XL expression as well as upregulation of NOXA, BAK, and P21. On the other hand, alliin endorsed clonogenicity, induced senescence, and did not demonstrate pro-apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells [ [129](#B129-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Allicin also suppressed proliferation and induced glioma cell apoptosis in vitro by intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic mediated pathways [ [130](#B130-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [131](#B131-antioxidants-10-01606)]. DAS, DADS, and DATS were revealed to play a significant role in inducing histone acetylation thereby resulting in the suppression of the oncogenic protein expression in human glioblastoma cells [ [132](#B132-antioxidants-10-01606)]. It has also been shown that DATS and DAS have the ability to induce apoptosis in the carcinogen-induced two-stage mouse model of skin tumour via targeting of multiple cancer signaling pathways [ [133](#B133-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [134](#B134-antioxidants-10-01606)]. SAC could also exhibit stronger antioxidant properties than fresh garlic, and has powerful anti-cancer activity not only at the early stage but also at the late stages of the ailment. |Bioactive Molecules||Indian Ethnomedicinal silico||Reduced expression of PD-L1 and called apocarotenoids [ [141](#B141-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [142](#B142-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Carotenoids are the primary line protection mechanism that extinguishes oxygen either physically by energy relocation mechanism or chemically through direct reaction with the radicals [ [143](#B143-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Several carotenoids work as powerful antioxidants and anticancer agents. Various epidemiologic and investigational studies have reported that eating of carotenoids is inversely proportional with the incidence of cancer [ [144](#B144-antioxidants-10-01606), [145](#B145-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [146](#B146-antioxidants-10-01606)]. There are several epidemiologic studies suggesting that carotenoids reduced the hazard of different chronic ailments, especially cancers of gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, lung, and breast with dietary consumption of different carotenoids [ [147](#B147-antioxidants-10-01606)]. On the other hand, randomized clinical trials have not shown any reliable decrease in the frequency of cancers or cancer mortality [ [144](#B144-antioxidants-10-01606)]. Worst of all, in a study on asbestos workers and smokers, an elevated risk of lung cancer had been reported, whether they were given high doses of beta-carotene only or in combination with other antioxidants [ [148](#B148-antioxidants-10-01606)]. [149](#B149-antioxidants-10-01606), [150](#B150-antioxidants-10-01606)]. The proposed mechanisms of cancer chemoprevention using carotenoids probably involve modulations in pathways leading to cell development or cell demise. These mechanisms comprise hormone and growth factor signaling, immune modulation, regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle development, cell differentiation, and apoptosis [ [151](#B151-antioxidants-10-01606)]. The anticancer activities of some recently reported potent antioxidant carotenoids are listed in [Table 6](#antioxidants-10-01606-t006), whereas, chemical structures of some leading carotenoids are given in [Figure 6](#antioxidants-10-01606-f006). 6.
