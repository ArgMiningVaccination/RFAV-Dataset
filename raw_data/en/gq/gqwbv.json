Even the description \"Ayurvedic Director\" barely does him justice. After all, Dr Raman has devoted himself heart and soul to Ayurvedic medicine - which he regards as his main purpose in life. No wonder then that he enjoys the highest reputation not just among our guests but also among the staff at Somatheeram. \"Ayurveda was always my passion. And my great aim is to maintain the authentic style of this treatment\", says this renowned medical professional of his work. Over the course of his career he has gained a wide range of experience: from tribal medicine men to universities and even collaboration with the government of Kerala. And Raman's expertise has been further acknowledged through his appointment as Ayurveda Director. \"That's when I knew\", he says today, \"that all the hard work had paid off.\" There's no doubt that Dr Raman is currently one of the most interesting and well-respected figures in Ayurvedic medicine, even outside Somatheeram. And that is why he also commands such respect within the Somatheeram workforce. Dr Raman has been the chief physician at Somatheeram Ayurvedic Health Resort since 1995. Since then, he has enhanced the lives of thousands of people with his knowledge by introducing them to a healthier lifestyle. As a veteran of the Ayurvedic approach, he is practically part of the family. At the reception desk in the Ayurvedic centre, Dr Raman's expression reflects the southern Indian mentality: his devotion to guests is sincere and relaxed, and always with a ready smile. This Ayurvedic specialist was inculcated with this traditional approach to healing from early childhood. Raman's uncle was a respected Ayurvedic doctor and, as a child, Raman would often watch over his shoulder while he worked, picking up an understanding of this traditional Indian medical practice from a very young age. He made a crucial contribution to the development of the current Somatheeram Ayurvedic programme as many of the treatment plans are based on his findings. And if you want to find out more about traditional Ayurveda, its development and possibilities, just speak to him during your next visit to Somatheeram. We are absolutely sure you will be touched by his wisdom. "}
