In late February 2003, an infect-ed physician stayed on the ninth floor of Hotel M in Hong Kong.Within 24 hours he infected at least 16 other guests beforebeing hospitalized. These infected guests triggered multi-countryoutbreaks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) thatpersisted through the spring of 2003 On April 16, 2003 the WHO announced that a novel coronavirus was the definitive cause of SARS. Surveillance and controlmeasures depended upon clinical case ascertainment through-out most of the pandemic. Traditional public health measureswere invoked to contain it. This included heightened vigilance,exit & entry screening for international travelers, isolation ofaffected persons and quarantine of their close contacts. On July 5, 2003, the WHO announced cessation of human-to- human transmission of SARS. All told, 8096 cases of SARSwere reported from 26 countries and 774 persons died (casefatality of 10%). By July 2003, Canada had reported 251 probable cases: five imported and 246 indigenously acquired. While the GreaterToronto Area experienced an extensive outbreak culminating in247 probable cases and 44 deaths, BC reported four probablecases, three imported and one health care worker, and nodeaths. In addition to extensive containment measures, BC responded with focused public health research initiatives including: The first full genetic sequencing of the SARS coronavirus at the BC Cancer Agency's Genome Science Centre CIHR funded investigations based at BCCDC into proteomics, genomics, immunology, animal models, epidemiology andmathematical modeling The Government of BC contributed $2.6 million to establish an expedited SARS vaccine development program managedthrough the Michael Smith Foundation As a result of the above initiatives, three candidate vaccines have been developed through a national collaboration of 35scientists in five provinces.Executive Summary 4Diseases Preventable by Vaccination The rate of reporting of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease remains low at 0.2 per 100,000. Two of ten cases occurred in children under the age of five years. Reporting of acute hepatitis B in British Columbia continued to decrease. Fifty- seven cases were reported in 2003, for a rateof 1.4 per 100,000. Influenza The proportion of visits due to Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) reported by sentinel physicians surpassed and remained sig-nificantly higher than expected for five weeks (November 9-December 13). The proportion dropped significantly belowand remained below expected values for 17 weeks(December 17-April 24). Health authorities reported 176 ILI outbreaks - 107 in schools, 60 in long term care facilities, eight in acute carehospitals, and one in a daycare. The number of outbreaksreported per week peaked in week 49. Influenza A wasresponsible for 57 (93.4%) of the outbreaks for which an eti-ology was identified. As of May 20, 2004, 117 influenza isolates from BC were characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory. Ofthese 111 (94.9%) were A/Fujian/411/02-like, of H3N2 virus and was nota component of the 2003-04 influenza vaccine. The overall Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I)-related mortality rate for October 2003 through June 2004 was 79.2 deaths/100,000 population, which was within the expected rangefor the months of October through June. There was one case each of of measles, mumps and rubella reported in British Columbia during 2003. There were 29 reports of invasive meningococcal infection in BC during 2003 for a rate of 0.7 per 100,000. In September 2003,BC introduced two routine childhood immunization programsagainst serogroup C disease: one at 12 months of age, theother at 11 years of age in a school-based grade 6 program. The rate of reporting of pertussis in 2003 was elevated com- pared to the previous two years, but still below rates witnessedduring the large outbreak of 2000. As in 2000, the highest rateoccurred in the 10-14 year age group - surpassing even that ofinfants. In 2003, British Columbia reported 322 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) , for a rate of 7.7 per 100,000. There have been an increased number of cases reported overthe past three years, reflecting the broadened case definitionfor IPD. In 2003, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program was initiated, targeting high-risk and aboriginal children 2 to 59months of age (April 2003), and infants starting at two months. 5BC C ENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL 2003Sexually Transmitted and Bloodborne Pathogens The HIVrate decreased in 2003 to 10.4 per 100,000. There was an increase in the rate in women aged 20-24. The AIDS rate in BC decreased to 0.6 per 100,000. The chlamydia rate in BC was 192.6 per 100,000. Women aged 20-24 continued to have the highest chlamydia rate at 1,436.5 per 100,000. The gonorrhea rate for BC 16.3 per 100,000 was lower than the Canadian rate of 24.2 per 100,000 and a slight decrement from the 2002 BC rate. The reported rate of newly diagnosed hepatitis C infections in BC reached its lowest value since 1995, with 3,574 cases reported for a rate of 85.5 per 100,000. The rate of infectious syphilis increased from 4.5 to 6.3 per 100,000 and over 250 cases were reported in 2003. The rate continues to be well above the Canadian rate of 2.3 per100,000. The majority of cases are concentrated in the LowerMainland. Diseases Transmitted by Direct Contact and Respiratory Routes The rate of reporting of invasive Group A Streptococcal (GAS) disease increased again in 2003 to 4.0 per 100,000. Most of the change is accounted for by an increase in the rate of report-ing of cellulitis. The rate of necrotizing fasciitis is not significantlyincreased. In 2003 there were 319 cases of reported tuberculosis in British Columbia, for a rate of 7.6 per 100,000, a 5% increase compared to 2002. Antimicrobial Resistant Organisms The Medical Microbiologists of British Columbia (BCCAMM) haveestablished a network for gathering meaningful informationaround antibiotic resistant organisms in British Columbia. During the 24 month period of this project, the approximateproportion of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus /total S.aureus has remained fairly constant. For 2003 it is 10.5%. Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci isolation remained uncom- mon with 43 isolates identified in both 2002 and 2003. Executive Summary 6Enteric, Food and Waterborne Diseases The rate of amebiasis has remained almost constant over the past 10 years and was 7.8 per 100,000 during 2003. There were no confirmed cases of botulism in 2003. Reporting of campylobacteriosis has continued to decline to its lowest level since 1992. In 2003, there were 1696 reports for arate of 40.6 cases per 100,000. Annual reporting of cryptosporidiosis has remained relatively stable over the past 7 years. There was a slight increase to 161case reports in 2003. Two outbreaks associated with publicswimming pools in Fraser Health Authority were documented. Reporting of Cyclospora cayetanensis rose to 39 cases in 2003, the second highest on record. Most cases of cyclosporiasis arerelated to travel to regions of the world where the disease isendemic. An outbreak of 10 locally acquired cases of cyclosporia-sis occurred in June 2003. An investigation suggested that con-taminated fresh produce was the likely source of the outbreak. Verotoxigenic E. coli infection case reporting fell to its lowest level on record with 123 reports in 2003. An outbreak of 9 con-firmed cases of E. coli O157:H7 infections occurred during theautumn of 2003. An investigation determined that the outbreakwas associated with visits to a petting farm. Lack of hand-wash-ing may have contributed to the outbreak. Despite a small increase to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2003, annual rates of giardiasis in BC have decreased over the last decade. Hepatitis A reporting showed a decrease from the previous year from 80 to 60 cases, or 1.4 cases per 100,000. As in the previ-ous year the highest rate was in males aged 20-25 years at 5.1cases per 100,000, more than three times the overall provincialrate; and three times the rate of females in the same age group. The rate of reporting of Listeriosis during 2003 was 0.3 per hundred thousand population. All eleven reported casesoccurred in people sixty years of age or older. In 2003, the BC rate of salmonellosis infection reached a ten year low at 14.4 cases per 100,000 population. A new risk factor for S. Heidelberg infections was document- ed in BC; consumption of raw or undercooked chickennuggets and strips from the freezer section of the grocerystore was found to be significantly associated with illness. Two outbreaks of Salmonella Typhimurium involving 18 con- firmed cases were identified in 2003. Both outbreaks werelinked to cakes prepared by the same bakery. Cross-con-tamination of raw egg batter with uncooked frosting wasconsidered the likely source of infection. There were 228 cases of shigellosis reported in 2003, up from 174 in the preceding year. An outbreak of Shigella sonnei infections among gay and bisexual men was identified in the summer and autumn of2003. Educational pamphlets and coverage in targetedmedia may have assisted in controlling the outbreak. Typhoid fever case reports rose to the highest level in 10 years - 34 cases in 2003. A case-series study determined that themajority of cases occurred among South-Asian Canadians whohad acquired their infections while traveling to the Punjab regionof India. Eighteen cases of Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis were reported in 2003. The majority were associated with consump-tion of raw oysters during the warmer months. Reporting of yersiniosis fell to the lowest level in 10 years, at 596 cases. 7BC C ENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL 2003Vectorborne and Other Zoonotic Diseases No cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome were reported in 2003. Six cases of Lyme disease were reported in 2003. Twenty-two cases of malaria were reported in BC for a rate of 0.5 per 100,000. This is the lowest rate of reporting in adecade. There is no endemic transmission of malaria in BC. Twenty cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in B.C. in 2003. All cases were acquired while traveling to Alberta,Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Colorado, or the Caribbean. Ninecases presented with neurological infections while eleven hadmanifestations of WNV fever syndrome. West Nile virus enzootictransmission did not occur in BC in 2003, but did reach Alberta. Environmental Fungi Cryptococcus neoformans (variety gattii) emerged on Vancouver Island in 1999. The fungus causes respiratory disease inimmunocompetent humans and animals. About 20% of casesdevelop cryptococcal meningitis. Environmental investigationshave recovered the fungus from soil and air samples as well asfrom the bark of many different tree species on the easternside of Vancouver Island. The rate of reporting of cryptococcal infection due to variety gat- tii increased between 1999 and 2002 as human contact withthe agent and recognition of the diagnosis increased. However,the 2003 was comparable to that of the year before at 0.6 per100,000 or 26 cases. Executive Summary 89BC MapbyHealth Service Delivery Area (HSDA) SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS)SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) 20032003 10An unexplained atypical pneumonia emerged in Guangdong province of China in November 2002. In late February 2003, an infected physician, who had cared for ill patients in Guangdong,stayed on the ninth floor of Hotel M in Hong Kong. Within 24hours he infected at least 16 other guests before being hospi-talized. These infected guests then triggered multi-country out-breaks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that per-sisted through the spring of 2003. In response to these out-breaks, the WHO issued a global alert on March 12, 2003 fol-lowed by a travel advisory on March 15, 2003. On April 16, 2003 the WHO announced that a novel coronavirus was the definitive cause of SARS. Surveillance and controlmeasures depended upon clinical case ascertainment through-out most of the pandemic. Traditional public health measureswere invoked to contain it. This included heightened vigilance,exit & entry screening for international travelers, isolation ofaffected persons and quarantine of their close contacts. On July 5, 2003, the WHO announced cessation of human-to- human transmission of SARS. All tolled, 8096 cases of SARSwere reported from 26 countries and 774 persons died (casefatality of 10%). China (Guangdong, Beijing, Hong Kong andTaiwan); Singapore; Hanoi, Viet Nam; and the Greater TorontoArea, Canada were most affected; all, except Taiwan, hadreceived cases prior to WHO alerts. Fifty-three percent of proba-ble cases of SARS reported to the WHO were female and all agegroups were affected (age range 0-100 years). Health careworkers comprised 22% of reported cases in Hong Kong andGuangdong, China and more than 40% in Canada andSingapore. Not all cities or countries receiving even the earliest SARS importations experienced outbreaks. In Canada, the GreaterToronto Area, Ontario and the city of Vancouver, BritishColumbia received one critically ill patient each from the initialHotel M cluster. By July 2003, Canada had reported 251 proba-ble cases: five imported and 246 indigenously acquired. Whilethe Greater Toronto Area experienced an extensive outbreak cul-minating in 247 probable cases and 44 deaths, BC reportedfour probable cases, three imported and one health care work-er, and no deaths. The four probable cases in BC included twomales and two females with an age range of 44 to 64 yearsadmitted for care at five hospitals across the Lower Mainland.Why some areas experienced sustained outbreaks and othersdid not has yet to be fully explained. Response efforts in BC included focussed public health research initiatives. This included the first full genetic sequenc-ing of the SARS coronavirus at the BC Cancer Agency's GenomeScience Centre. It also included a $500,000.00 grant to the BCCentre for Disease Control from the Canadian Institute forHealth Research (CIHR) [Principal Investigator D. Skowronski] toconduct five major domains of scientific investigation related toSARS vaccine development: (1) laboratory, proteomics andgenomics (to develop vaccine candidates and assays for protec-tion); (2) immunology (to assess correlates of immune defenseand pathogenesis); (3) animal models (to replicate disease andconduct initial evaluation); (4) epidemiology (to identify personsmost likely to benefit and to plan clinical trials); and (5) mathe-matical models (to anticipate impact of universal or targetedstrategies). The BC Ministry of Health contributed an additional$2.6 million to establish an expedited SARS vaccine develop-ment program managed by the Michael Smith Foundation underthe auspices of the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative (SAVI)[Director B. Finlay]. As a result, three candidate vaccines havebeen developed through the national collaboration of 35 scien-tists in five provinces through SAVI and CIHR (inactivated, recom-binant and adenovirus-vector vaccines). 11Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 12Epidemic Curve of Probable Cases of SARS Probable cases of SARS by week of onset Worldwide* (n=5,910), 1 November 2002 - 10 July 2003number of cases date of onset * This graph does not include 2,257 probable cases of SARS (2,521 from Bejing, China), for whom no dates of onset are currently available 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 Curve of Probable Cases of SARS 1.1 1.2DISEASES PREVENTABLE BY VACCINATIONDISEASES PREVENTABLE BY VACCINATION 20032003 13The rate of reporting of invasive Haemophilus influenza type b disease remains low at 0.2 per hundred thousand population. Cases were distributed across age groups and only two of tencases occurred in children under the age of 5 years. One was inan 18 month old child who has received three doses of Hib vaccine in infancy, and one was in a 10 month old child who had received the first two infant doses of Hib vaccine at 2 and 4 months of age. 14Haemophilus influenzae typeb(Hib) ), invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (invasive) Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.00.10.10.20.20.30.30.4 BC Invasive Hib Reports 12 9 9 4 3 4767 1 0 BC Invasive Hib Rate 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 Canadian Hib Rate 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.21994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 2.115Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), invasive Rates by HSDA, 2003 Haemophilus influenzae type b (invasive) Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.01.02.03.04.05.0 Invasive Hib Reports - Female 01 00110 10 2 Invasive Hib Reports - Male 1000 001 101 Invasive Hib Rate - Female 0.0 1.2 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.7 0.0 0.3 0.0 0.5 Invasive Hib Rate - Male 4.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.3 0.0 0.3 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 2.2 2.3Reporting of acute hepatitis B in British Columbia has continued to decrease. Fifty seven cases were reported in 2003, for a rate of 1.4 per 100,000; this is from a high of 6.2 cases per 100,000 in1995 . The decline is likely a consequence of the grade 6 immu-nization program introduced in 1992; universal infant immuniza-tion was introduced in 2001 and programs for high risk haveexpanded in BC. The BC rate has been below the Canadian ratesince 1999. Only one case was reported under 25 years of age this was in the 15-19 age group. The rate of acute hepatitis B in malesexceeded the rate in females in every age group; overall the rate for males was more than 3 times that for females. SouthVancouver Island had the highest rate of acute hepatitis B at 5.6 cases per 100,000. 16Hepatitis B Acute Hepatitis B Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.0 BC Hepatitis B: Acute Reports 230 234 219 220 189 141 109 92 75 57 BC Hepatitis B: Acute Rate 6.2 6.2 5.6 5.6 4.7 3.5 2.7 2.2 1.8 1.4 Canadian Hepatitis B Rate 10.6 10.3 8.0 3.5 3.2 4.2 3.2 4.6 1.9 2.71994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 3.117Acute Hepatitis B Rates by HSDA, 2003 Acute Hepatitis B Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.01.02.03.04.05.0 Hepatitis B: Acute Reports - Female 000000155 1 Hepatitis B: Acute Reports - Male 0000106 1 5 1 5 8 Hepatitis B: Acute Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 1.6 0.8 0.2 Hepatitis B: Acute Rate - Male 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.0 4.4 4.8 2.4 2.3 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 3.2 3.3Proportion of Patient Visits due to Influenza Like Illness (ILI) per Week Compared to Average Proportion of ILI Visits for the Past 14 Seasons Sentinel Physicians, British Columbia, 2003 -2004 0.00.51.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 Week Number Percent ILI 2003/2004 season 1989/90 to 2002/03 seasons (Average +/- (2 Standard Units))4.1Influenza surveillance in BC consists of the collection, analysis and distribution of data on influenza activity. The influenza sur-veillance season begins in the first week of October (week 40)and continues through the end of September (week 39) the fol-lowing year. The objectives of influenza surveillance are: 1. To detect laboratory-confirmed influenza early;2. To detect and monitor influenza type and strain variation during the influenza season; and 3. To determine influenza and ILI morbidity and mortality. Surveillance findings are used to determine population-based susceptibility to emerging and current strains, provide informa-tion to assist in the prevention and control of influenza, andevaluate the performance of influenza control programs. A network of health agencies and professionals provide the information vital to influenza surveillance. Volunteer sentinel physicians record the proportion and demo- graphic characteristics of patient visits due to influenza-like ill-ness (ILI). Sentinel physicians also collect specimens for testingof respiratory pathogens from patients presenting with acute ILIsymptoms.Health regions report ILI outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and hospitals, as well as absenteeism greater than 10%due to ILI in schools and worksites. The virology laboratories at the BCCDC and the Children's and Women's Health Centre report the number of respiratory virolo-gy tests performed weekly and the number positive for respira-tory viruses. Some influenza isolates are forwarded to theNational Microbiology Laboratory for strain characterization. BC Vital Statistics Agency provides monthly reports on pneumo- nia and influenza mortality rates (number of deaths per 100,000population), comparing the current month to the average ratefor the same month in the previous 13 years. In response to concerns about increased morbidity and mortality among children in 2003/2004, enhanced surveillance forinfluenza-related deaths and severe illness in children wasimplemented across Canada - physicians were requested toreport any of these occurrences to public health. BCCDC Epidemiology Services and Laboratory Services partici- pate in national influenza surveillance activities (FluWatch), pro-viding weekly information about ILI activity in the province.Epidemiology Services produces regular surveillance reports thatare circulated and posted on the BCCDC web site. The results presented in this report include weeks 40 (September 28, 2003) through 30 (July 24, 2004). 18InfluenzaForty-four sentinel physicians participated in the BC influenza surveillance program during the 2003-2004 influenza season. For weeks 40 through 45 (September 28-November 8), the weekly proportions of sentinel physician visits due to ILI werewithin or below the expected ranges. The proportion visits due toILI surpassed the expected range in week 46 and remained sig-nificantly higher than expected for five weeks (November 9-December 13). The proportion dropped significantly below theexpected range in week 01, and remained below expected val-ues for 17 weeks (December 17-April 24). Reports of ILI visits peaked in week 49 at 1.87%. Although sig- nificantly higher than expected for week 49 (0.59% to 1.06%),this proportion was within the expected range for week 52 (1.00% to 2.31%), the week in which peak ILI activity typicallyoccurs. Of the 903 ILI cases with known ages, 121 (13.4%) were under the age of 5 years, 259 (28.7%) were aged 5 to 19 years, 467(51.7%) were aged 20 to 64 years, and 56 (6.2%) were aged 65years and over. These proportions are significantly different(p<0.001) than the 10-year historical average proportion in eachage group: 17.8% under 5 years, 20.7% aged 5 to 19 years,45.3% aged 20 to 64 years, and 16.2% aged 65 years andolder. 19Number of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Outbreaks Reported, ILI Rates and Average ILI Rate for past 13 years, per Week British Columbia, 2003-2004 0102030405060708090404244464850522468101214161820222426283032343638 Week ## ILI Outbreak Reported 0.000.200.400.600.801.001.201.401.601.802.00 ILI Rates # ILI Acute Hos pitals #ILI LTCF # ILI schools Avg Rate ILI Rate4.2Health regions reported 176 ILI outbreaks - 107 in schools, 60 in LTCFs, eight in acute care hospitals, and one in a daycare.The number of outbreaks reported per week peaked in week 49with 30 outbreaks - 25 in schools, four in LTCFs, and one in anacute care hospital. The causative organism was identified in 61 (34.7%) of the out- breaks. Influenza A was responsible for 57 (93.4%) of the out-breaks for which an etiology was identified. etiologiesincluded adenovirus (1 school), parainfluenza (1 LTCF), respirato-ry syncitial virus (1 acute care hospital), and Norwalk virus (1LTCF). The BCCDC Virology Laboratory tested 4567 specimens for res- piratory viruses and 947 (20.7%) were positive. Of the positiveresults, 749 (79.1%) were influenza A, 2 (0.2%) were influenza B,55 (5.8%) were respiratory syncitial virus, and 141 (14.9%) wereother respiratory viruses (adenovirus or parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 or4). The Children's and Women's Health Centre Virology Laboratory tested 1858 specimens for respiratory viruses and 598 (32.2%)were positive. Of the positive results, 174 (29.1%) were influen-za A, 1 (0.2%) was influenza B, 302 (50.5%) were respiratorysyncitial virus, and 121 (20.2%) were other respiratory viruses.As of May 20, 2004, 117 influenza isolates from BC were char- acterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory. Of these 111(94.9%) were A/Fujian/411/02-like, five (4.3%) wereA/Panama/2007/99-like, and one (0.9%) was influenza A/NewCaledonia/20/99-like. A/Fujian/411/02-like virus was a newantigenic variant of the H3N2 virus and was not a component ofthe 2003-04 influenza vaccine. A/Panama/2007/99-like viruswas the recommended influenza A component andA/New Caledonia/20/99-like virus was the recommendedinfluenza A (H1N1) component of the 2003-2004 influenza vaccine. 20Virus Isolates and Percent Positive from Respiratory Virus Specimens Submitted to BC Provincial Laboratory, per Week 020406080100120140160404244464850522468101214161820222426283032343638 Week ## of isolates 010203040506070 Percent PositiveBritish Columbia, 2003-2004 Other virus Respiratory Syncitial VirusInfluenza A Influenza B Percent positive4.321Pneumonia-and Influenza-Related Mortality British Columbia, 2003-2004 02468101214 Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep MonthCrude mortality rate per 100,000 population Historic Rate (95% Confidence Interval) Current Rate 4.4 From October 2003 through June 2004 BC Vital Statistics recorded 3259 deaths related to pneumonia and influenza com-bined (P&I) in BC; 66 of these were related to influenza. Theaverage historic number of P&I-related deaths between Octoberand June is 2997. The overall P&I-related mortality rate forOctober 2003 through June 2004 was 79.2 deaths /100,000population, which was within the expected range of historic P&Imortality for the months of October through June(78.4/100,000; 95%CI=76.2-80.6/100,000). P&I-related mortality rates were significantly higher than the his- toric averages in December (12.2/100,000 versus historical9.4/100,000) and significantly lower than the historic averagesin March (8.5/100,000 versus historic 10.2/100,000) and May(6.6/100,000 versus historic 8.0/100,000). P&I-related mortality peaked in December at 12.2/100,000. Historically, this rate peaks in January at an average rate of11.2/100,000. The 2003/04 peak P&I-related mortality rate didnot differ significantly from the average historic peak rate. Of the 66 documented influenza-related deaths in BC between October 2003 and June 2004, 63 were individuals aged 65years or older, two were individuals aged 20 to 64 years, andone was aged 0 to 9. Historically during the same months, anaverage of 60.2 individuals aged 65 years and over, 2.2 individ-uals aged 20 to 64 years, 0.4 individuals aged 10 to 19 yearsand 0.4 individuals aged 0 to 9 years die with influenza as arelated cause of death. These are known to be underestimatesof the true rate of death since influenza is often missed as thecause of death, especially in aggravating underlying conditions. Enhanced surveillance identified one child whose death was related to influenza. The 7-year old died from myocarditis, aknown but rare complication of influenza in children. InfluenzaA/Fuijian/H3N2 was isolated.22Measles Measles Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.08.09.0 BC Measles Reports 30 15 39 273 2 8 42 22 3 1 BC Measles Rate 0.8 0.4 1.0 6.9 0.1 0.2 1.0 0.5 0.1 0.0 Canadian Measles Rate 1.8 8.1 1.1 2.0 0.0 0.1 0.9 0.1 0.0 0.11994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population There was one case of measles reported in British Columbia during 2003 in a 7 year old without a record of prior measlesvaccination. 5.123Measles Rates by HSDA, 2003 Measles Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 Measles Reports - Female 0010000000 Measles Reports - Male 0000000000 Measles Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Measles Rate - Male 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 5.2 5.3There were 29 reports of invasive meningococcal infection in BC during 2003 for a rate of 0.7 per 100,000 population. This iscomparable to the 2003 Canadian meningococcal rate of 0.5per 100,000. Three cases occurred in infants under the age ofone year, so that infants had the highest rate (15.6/100,000) ofinfection. However, the majority of cases (20) occurred in thoseover the age of 14 years. There was no significant geographicclustering. The Northeast Health Service Delivery Area reportedthe highest rate of infection at 6.1/100,000. Serogrouping ofthe 29 isolates indicated that 9 (31%) were serogroup B (a decline from 53% in 2002); 9 (31%) (3.4%) serogroup W-135, and 10 (34.5%)serogroup Y. This is a considerable increase from the 19% ofserogroup Y disease reported in 2002. In September 2003, BC introduced two routine childhood immu- nization programs against serogroup C disease: one at 12months of age, the other at 11 years of age in a school-basedgrade 6 program. 24Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6 BC Meningococcal Reports 54 40 40 35 16 27 24 53 32 29 BC Meningococcal Rate 1.5 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.4 0.7 0.6 1.3 0.8 0.7 Canadian Meningococcal Rate 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.5 0.7 0.8 1.2 0.7 0.51994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 6.125Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by HSDA, 2003 Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.0 Meningococcal Reports - Female 3010440 1330 Meningococcal Reports - Male 0220200 1111 Meningococcal Rate - Female 15.6 0.0 0.9 0.0 3.0 2.8 0.0 0.3 0.5 0.7 Meningococcal Rate - Male 0.0 2.4 1.6 0.0 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.2 0.3 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+ UnknownRate per 100,000population6.2 6.3There was one case of mumps reported in British Columbia in 2003 in a 27 year old male. 26Mumps Mumps Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 BC Mumps Reports 47 35 46 139 18 19 17 26 6 1 BC Mumps Rate 1.3 0.9 1.2 3.5 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.6 0.1 0.0 Canadian Mumps Rate 1.3 1.4 1.1 0.9 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.7 0.11994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 7.127Mumps Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8 Mumps Reports - Female 0000000000 Mumps Reports - Male 000000 1000 Mumps Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Mumps Rate - Male 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population7.2Pertussis Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.045.050.0 BC Pertussis Reports 395 438 960 720 369 541 1812 643 645 960 BC Pertussis Rate 10.7 11.6 24.7 18.2 9.2 13.4 44.6 15.7 15.6 23.0 Canadian Pertussis Rate 35.0 33.5 18.3 14.8 29.2 20.1 16.1 9.3 10.5 5.81994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 8.1The rate of reporting of pertussis in 2003 was elevated compared to the previous two years, but still below rates witnessed during the large outbreak of 2000. Pertussis outbreaks occur every three to five years so it is possible thatthis represented the next due cyclical peak (Figure 8.1). As in 2000, highest rates of pertussis occurred in the 10-14 year age group - surpassing even that of infants (Figure 8.2).Careful evaluation of pertussis rates by one year age group in2000 compared to 2003 shows ongoing evidence of a moving cohort effect with age group of peak incidence shifted to theright by three years (Figure 8.4). This prompted recommendationfor replacement of the routine tetanus-diphtheria (Td) boostergiven in Grade 9 with an acellular pertussis (aP) containing ver-sion (TdaP) to provide protection to the highest risk cohortbefore (implemented in early 2004). 28Pertussis29Pertussis Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.020.040.060.080.0100.0120.0140.0160.0180.0 Pertussis Reports - Female 26 45 57 204 67 20 8 37 49 11 Pertussis Reports - Male 32 36 56 189 60 6 6 9 30 11 Pertussis Reports - Unknown 0001000000 Pertussis Rate - Female 135.0 56.1 48.7 158.9 50.5 14.1 5.9 11.7 7.8 2.7 Pertussis Rate - Male 157.4 42.4 45.2 139.6 42.8 4.2 4.4 2.9 4.8 3.2 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 8.230Pertussis Rates by HSDA, 2003 050100150200250300350 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 41 51 61 71 81 92 02 1 + Age in yearsRate per 100,000 2000 2003 Incidence of Pertussis in BC by One Year Age Group 8.3 8.431Pneumococcal Disease ( invasive) Pneumococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Year, 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.08.09.0 Note: Pneumococcal meningitis was replaced with Invasive Pneumococcal in Jan. 2000BC Invasive Pneumococcal Reports 41 3 461 2 5 102 186 343 322 BC Invasive Pneumococcal Rate 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.1 2.5 4.5 8.3 7.7 Canadian Invasive Pneumococcal Rate 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.5 1.0 6.8 7.6 7.2 4.01994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population In 2003, British Columbia reported 322 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) , for a rate of 7.7 per 100,000 population. There have been an increased number of casesreported over the past three years, reflecting the broadenedcase definition for IPD. The BC IPD rate in 2003 continues to be higher than the national rate of 4.0/100,000. The highest rates of IPD are seen in infants and children less than 5 years of age. The incidence of IPD in male infants is double that of females, with 16 and 8 cases reported respectively. For the 1 to 4 yearage group, the incidence in males is also higher than in females,with 44 and 28 cases reported respectively. The age group of 60 years and over continues to have the next highest rates of IPD, at 11.5/100,000 for females and15.1/100,000 for males. Health Service Delivery Areas reporting the highest rates of IPD were Fraser East (13.2/100,000), Northern Interior(11.2/100,000), and Okanagan (11.1/100,000). In 2003, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program was initiat- ed, targeting high-risk and aboriginal children 2 to 59 months ofage (April 2003), and infants starting at two months of age(September 2003). There are continuing efforts to increasepneumococcal vaccine uptake in high-risk groups of all ages. 9.132Pneumococcal Disease ( invasive) Rates by HSDA, 2003 Pneumococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.0 Invasive Pneumococcal Reports - Female 82 8 9 3 2 3 2 3 2 9 4 7 Invasive Pneumococcal Reports - Male 16 44 5 5 3 0 9 14 40 52 Invasive Pneumococcal Rate - Female 41.5 34.9 7.7 2.3 1.5 2.1 1.5 0.9 4.6 11.5 Invasive Pneumococcal Rate - Male 78.7 51.8 4.0 3.7 2.1 0.0 6.6 4.4 6.4 15.1 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 9.2 9.3The rate of reporting of Rubella remained very low in 2003 and only one case was reported in a 24 year old female without a recordof prior rubella vaccination. 33Rubella Rubella Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.0 BC Rubella Reports 36 26 19 5 4 3 2 2 2 1 BC Rubella Rate 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Canadian Rubella Rate 0.8 1.0 1.0 13.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.01994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 10.134Rubella Rates by HSDA, 2003 Rubella Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.00.20.40.60.8 Rubella Reports - Female 0000010000 Rubella Reports - Male 0000000000 Rubella Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Rubella Rate - Male 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 10.2 10.3SEXUALLY BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS 20032003 35The HIV rate per 100,000 population decreased in 2003 to 10.4.

Rates for health regions vary across the province. The Vancouver, Richmond, Fraser North and Fraser South healthservice delivery areas have rates exceeding the provincial rate(7.6/100,000 population). The highest incidence rate was report-ed from Vancouver and Richmond (20.3 and 13.6 /100,000 pop-ulation respectively) while the lowest was in East/West Kootenay(0.0 /100,000 population).Compared to 2002, the rate of tuberculosis increased in Thompson/Cariboo/Shuswap, Okanagan, Fraser East, Northeastand North/Central Vancouver Island. The age specific rates are shown in figure 18.3. Overall, the tuberculosis rate was higher in men than women (8.2 vs 7.1), but for the age group 40 years and under, the rate of tuberculosiswas higher in women than men. In those > 60 years old, the rate of tuberculosis in men was almost twice that in women (21.0 vs11.8). 51Tuberculosis Tuberculosis Rates by 9.0 8.2 8.3 10.4 8.4 8.3 7.1 9.5 7.3 7.6 Canadian Tuberculosis Rate 7.1 6.6 6.3 6.6 5.9 5.9 5.5 5.5 5.21994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 18.152Tuberculosis Rates by HSDA, 2003 Tuberculosis Rates by Age Group and Gender, 2003 0.05.010.015.020.025.0 Tuberculosis Cases - Female 0.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 11.0 14.0 28.0 37.0 48.0 Tuberculosis Cases - Male 0.0 1.0 3.0 6.0 5.0 12.0 24.0 46.0 72.0 Tuberculosis Rate-Female 0.0 0.0 1.7 3.1 4.5 7.7 10.3 8.8 5.9 11.8 Tuberculosis Rate-Male 0.0 1.2 0.0 2.2 4.3 3.5 8.8 7.6 is not endemic in Canada.

Participation in this project is broadly representative of the popu- lation of British Columbia, and includes data from laboratoriesserving both the in-patient and out-patient settings. The fifteenparticipating centres are listed at the end of this report.BCCAMM agreed that after collection, the data would be com-bined to prevent the identification of sites and/or patients.Following review and approval of this report by BCCAMM and allparticipants, it is made available to BCCDC and any use or fur-ther dissemination acknowledges BCCAMM. This is the third report from this group, with cumulative data to December 31, 2003. With this report, two new sites have beenrecruited to participate in the data collection. However, thisreport is considered interim as not all sites have provided datafor the 2003 calendar year. Some previously reported data hasbeen adjusted to reflect new information received back to thebeginning of 2003, as the new sites provided retrospectivedata. Interpretation of these data must be done with an under-standing of limitations as discussed in the next section. It is intended that these data will be collected every six months, with extension to other surveillance information and other centers as is possible or needed. While it would be desirable to collect additional demographic or clinical data, this would requireadditional resources. Details are in: Table 1: Methicillin-Resistent S. Aureus (MRSA) reported by BCCAMM ARO Surveillance Project Table 2: Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) reported by BCCAMM ARO Surveillance Project Within the limitations of the data, it is interesting to note the consistency of the number of patients newly identified to carryMRSA and the total number of S. aureus isolates tested in each six month period. During the 24 month period of this project, theapproximate proportion of MRSA/total S. aureus has remained fairly constant. For 2003 it is 10.5%. While a slight increasefrom the previous year, data from 3 sites are missing and thismay be a factor. It is recognized that under this system patientsmay be counted more than once if presenting at different hospi-tals or community laboratories, and therefore the absolute num-bers may over-represent the problem. What is important is thetrend over time. These data do not suggest a clear escalatingproblem with MRSA, despite some small local outbreaks. Withrespect to VRE, it is also encouraging that this organism contin-ues to be very uncommonly isolated from our patients. 54Antimicrobial Resistant Organism Surveillance in British Columbia (ARO) 20.1 Table 1: MRSA reported by BCCAMM ARO Surveillance Project aSee limitation 1 bSee limitation 2 cThe range of up to 62.7% is high, representing probable repeat counting of the same patient having multiple positive specimens submitted for testing * Fourteen sites reporting, data to be amendedTime period Total new Total Approx % Approx % Approx % MRSA S. aureus MRSA patients: The patient numbers sub- mitted are those identified at each participating laboratory,each patient counted only once at each site. However, patientsmay be counted more than once if they submitted cultures tomore than one of the participating laboratories. The degree oferror introduced by this is not felt to be significant. 2.Number of isolates: The number of isolates reported is gener- ated by laboratory information systems. Laboratories use avariety of approaches to count isolates, some of which arechosen according to local need and some of which are dictatedby the constraints of the laboratory information system. Forexample, some laboratories re-test every isolate on a patient(and thus re-count every isolate), while some laboratories havepolicies which require that the same isolate be re-tested (andthus re-counted) only every four or seven days, depending onthe source of the isolate, or the location of the patient. Thusany calculation using the number of isolates tested, e.g.#MRSA/total MRSA tested, is subject to a degree of error. 3. Number of enterococci: Denominator data for enterococci is not provided, as the degree of resistance would be largelyover-estimated. This is due to the fact that enterococci arecommon colonizers, or are present with other more virulentpathogens. They therefore are not subject to susceptibility testing and are not counted in laboratory information sys-tems. Or to state it another way, the search for VRE is muchmore vigilant than the testing and reporting of enterococci ingeneral. The same is not as much of a problem for S. aureus , since when S. aureus is present in a specimen it is usually considered a pathogen, subjected to susceptibility testing,and is counted. Having said this, it is still fair to estimate thatVRE represent less than 1% of all enterococci isolated in B.C. 4. Community versus hospital incidence: Further epidemiologic investigation is required to meaningfully separate the isolatesas arising from the community or arising in the hospital set-ting. Breaking the numbers down into those reported by com-munity laboratories and those reported by in-patient settingswould not necessarily reflect acquisition in the community,but could be provided if of interest. 5. Time Period: Centres may differ on the periods used for counting, some counting on calendar months, and othersusing \"periods\" within a fiscal year. The data collected wasrequested for the 6 calendar months or \"periods\" which bestreflect those months. This is not felt to introduce significanterror into these statistics, as it will be the trend of these datathat is most useful. 5520.2 Table 2: VRE reported by BCCAMM ARO Surveillance Project aSee limitation 1 cSee limitation 3 *Fourteen sites reporting, data to be amendedTime period Total new Estimate of VRE as VRE patientsa% of all enterococcic Jan 1-Jun 30, '02 35 <1% 1-Dec Total 43 <1% Jan 1-Jun 30, '03* 5 << 1% Jul 1 - Dec 31, '03 38* < 1% Total 2003 43Participating Laboratories 1.

Although reporting exceeded expected values during several weeks in 2003, thesewere not consecutive, no outbreaks were identified and no sea-sonal pattern was evident. Seventy-seven percent of caseswere male with reporting rates highest among males aged 30 to59 years of age. Vancouver experienced a higher rate of illness (32.3 cases per 100,000 population) than other health authori-ties. The location of a large screening program for newCanadian immigrants in Vancouver partially accounts for height-ened levels of reporting. 58Amebiasis Amebiasis Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.0 Note: Amebiasis was from national surveillance in January 2000BC Amebiasis Reports 306 313 372 327 302 306 280 351 365 325 BC Amebiasis Rate 8.3 8.3 9.6 8.3 7.6 7.6 6.9 8.6 8.8 7.8 Canadian Amebiasis Rate 6.0 5.5 5.6 6.0 5.3 4.51994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 21.159Amebiasis Rates by HSDA, 2003 Amebiasis Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2003 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.0 Amebiasis Reports - Female 005414 1 1 9 2 0 1 3 0 Amebiasis Reports - Male 0247 1 0 13 11 98 80 24 1 Amebiasis Reports - Unknown 10011 1 0 040 0 Amebiasis Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 4.3 3.1 0.8 2.8 8.1 2.8 3.2 3.2 Amebiasis Rate - Male 0.0 2.4 3.2 5.2 7.1 9.0 8.0 31.1 12.8 7.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+ UnknownRate per 100,000population 21.2 21.32003 Amebiasis Reports Compared to Historical Numbers from 1992 to 2002 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.0 12 34 56 7 891 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 41 5 1 61 71 8 1 9 2 02 1 2 22 3 2 42 5 2 62 72 8 2 93 03 1 3 23 3 3 43 5 3 63 73 8 3 94 04 1 4 24 3 4 44 5 4 64 74 8 4 95 05 1 5 25 3 Week NumberNumber of Reports 2003 Cases Median There were no confirmed cases of Botulism was reported in 2003. Botulism 6021.4Annual reporting has continued to decline to its lowest level since 1992, with a continued downward trend since 1998. Thisdecline may be partly artifactual as it coincides with the intro-duction of a provincial protocol, introduced in the late 1990s,that reduces the number of stool tests ordered by physicians. In2003, there were 1696 reports for a rate of 40.6 cases per100,000. Reporting was highest during the summer (weeks 21through 37). The age distribution of cases followed an expected bimodal dis- tribution, with peak reporting rates in the less than 5 year agegroup, and the 20 to 29 year age group. There are marked regional differences in reporting of Campylobacter infections with the highest reporting rates in theLower Mainland and the lowest rates in Northern Health.Regional differences in laboratory practices may, in part,account for the differences in reporting.

In 2003, BC rates of infection reached a ten year low at 14.4 cases per 100,000population. The highest rates of infection were seen inVancouver and other parts of the lower mainland, on VancouverIsland and in Fraser East. Reporting was highest in male childrenunder 5 years of age. In 2003, Salmonella Heidelberg replaced Salmonella Enteritidis as the second most commonly identified serotype in theprovince (see graph below). A new risk factor for S. Heidelberginfections was documented in BC; consumption of raw or under- cooked chicken nuggets and strips from the freezer section ofthe grocery store was found to be significantly associated withillness. Two outbreaks of Salmonella Typhimurium involving 18 con- firmed cases were identified in 2003. Both outbreaks werelinked to cakes prepared by the same bakery. Cross-contamina-tion of raw egg batter with uncooked frosting was consideredthe likely source of infection. An outbreak of S. Typhi involving26 confirmed cases was linked to travel to India. 80Salmonellosis Salmonellosis Rates by Year, 1994-2003 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0 BC Salmonellosis Reports 852 868 820 637 653 706 704 715 743 600 BC Salmonellosis Rate 23.1 22.9 21.1 16.1 16.3 17.5 17.3 17.4 17.9 14.4 Canadian Salmonellosis Rate 22.2 21.8 22.2 20.1 23.4 18.5 18.4 18.0 19.1 14.51994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Rate per 100,000population 29.181Annual Incidence of the Top 10 Salmonella Serotypes in BC 050100150200250 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 YearNo. cases S.

All cases were acquired while traveling to Alberta,Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Colorado, or the Caribbean. Ninecases presented with neurological infections while eleven hadmanifestations of WNV fever syndrome. The largest number ofcases were residents of Interior Health and Vancouver Island. (7each). Ages ranged from 10 to 79 years, with the highest rate ofreported infections occurring in those over 40 years of age.Cases occurred between mid-August and early OctoberWest Nile virus enzootic transmission did not occur in BC in 2003, but did reach Alberta. BC had an extensive WNV surveil-lance program in 2003 testing 1,911 corvids (birds of the crowfamily) using an antigen-capture test strip and 6,840 mosqui-toes using PCR. All were negative for WNV.

The fungus generally causes respiratory disease in immunocompetent humans and animals, however about 20% ofcases may develop Cryptococcal meningitis. Environmentalinvestigations have recovered the fungus from soil and air sam-ples as well as from the bark of many different tree species onVancouver Island. Humans are exposed to the organism in theenvironment; it cannot be passed between people or animals. The rate of Cryptococcal infection due to variety gattii has increased over the three years since its discovery as humancontact with the fungus increased as did recognition and diagno-sis of the disease. In 2003, the rate of infection began to leveloff. Infection with C. neoformans var gattii is more common in males and those over 60 years of age. All cases have eitherlived on or traveled to Vancouver Island. 103Cryptococcus Cryptococcal Infection Rates by Year, 1999-2003 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 became notifiable in BC in 2003BC Cryptococcal

projections are taken from P.E.O.P.L.E. Projection 28 (Population Extrapolation forOrganizational Planning with Less Error). Health DataWarehouse Release Date: September 2003. 3) National rates are provided by Health Canada - Population and Public Health Branch. All published 2001, 2002 and2003 national rates are preliminary numbers and are sub-ject to change. National rates for 2003 cover January toOctober 2003. Saskatchewan numbers are not included in2003. 4) Amebiasis, cryptosporidiosis and listeriosis were removed from national surveillance in January 2000. Lyme disease,HIV, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycinresistant enterococci, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and yersinio-sis are not nationally notifiable diseases. 5) Data for influenza, invasive meningococcal disease and inva- sive group A streptococcal disease are collected throughenhanced surveillance systems. 6) Data for HIV and AIDS are collected through the HIV/AIDS Surveillance System. Data for other sexually transmitted dis-eases (STD) are collected through the STD SurveillanceSystem. 7) Data for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 1992-1999 had previously been limited to pneumococcal meningitis.Since July 2000, changes in the case definition now includeall other invasive cases in addition to meningitis. 8) The Jenks Natural Breaks Classification method was used for defining different classifications of disease rates in themaps. This classification method identifies gaps or depres-sions within the data distribution and creates the categoriesbased on the best fit of the data (i.e. groups based on simi-larities).9) Health Service Delivery Area boundaries are taken from BC STATS, Ministry of Management Services. 10) Participating laboratories for the BCCAMM Surveillance Project: (i) BC Biomedical Laboratories(ii) Burnaby General Hospital(iii) Children's and Women's Hospital (Vancouver)(iv) Fraser Health East (MSA General, Chilliwack General, Mission Memorial, and Fraser Canyon Hospitals (v) Kelowna General Hospital(vi) Lion's Gate Hospital(vii) MDS Metro (Burnaby, Victoria, Kamloops, Omineca and Prince George locations) (viii) Prince George Regional Hospital(ix) Providence Health Care(x) Richmond Hospital(xi) Royal Columbian Hospital (New Westminster)(xii) Royal Inland Hospital (Kamloops)(xiii) Surrey Memorial Hospital(xiv) Vancouver Acute (VGH and UBCH sites)(xv) Vancouver Island Health Authority (Victoria) Data collected and report prepared by Diane Roscoe, MD, FRCPC. Distributed for review by BCCAMM, August 2004 11) Numbers in this report were generated in March 2004 and are subject to change due to possible late reporting and/ordata clean up in the regions. This may also explain changesin the number of reported cases in previous years for somediseases.Sources 110Epidemiology Services Dr. David Patrick, Associate EpidemiologistLaura MacDougall, Field EpidemiologistSunny Mak, Geographic Information Systems AnalystMei Chong, Surveillance Analyst Mary Jane Trepanier, Surveillance AnalystWrency Wu, Surveillance AnalystSTD/AIDS Control Dr. DirectorGina Ogilvie, Associate DirectorLinda Knowles, Nursing AdministratorPaul Dr. Kevin Elwood, DirectorDr. Ramak Shadmani, Consultant 111BC C ENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL 2003 Contributors "}
