An herbalist is a practitioner who uses herbs/plants in their healing protocols. We are known as a \"Specialist in Herbal Medicine\". The herbal medicine we use is made of herbs that have been prepared in liquid form (alcohol/glycerol/water), powder, capsules, oil bases remedies, and tablets. We use our knowledge of plant medicine to promote healing and relieve symptoms of your health issues. Herbs work on the body synergistically. They turn on the healing powers of your body so your body is able to start healing itself by itself. Our body is a remarkable vessel and because of the way we have lived our lives, and how our parents have lived, the signals that our body produces have been turned off. Herbs help to turn those signals back on and re-educate your body to start healing itself. We are all individuals and your response to herbal medicine will also differ from other people. Herbal medicine is not a quick-fix solution so you will be working with us for a number of weeks or possibly months until we get the right herbal treatment and train your body to take back control of your health. Herbal Medicine can help improve and support our bodies in a range of conditions. Acne Eczema Chronic Fatigue SAD Stress Digestive health - IBS, IBD Inflammation - Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis Female/Male reproductive system problems Headaches Colds and flu And so much more...... An Herbal practitioner treats you as a whole person - we look at all aspects of your life - your physical, mental and spiritual health. We look at your diet, lifestyle, and past and present medical history including your family's health issues.
