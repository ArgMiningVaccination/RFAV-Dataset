In 2002, only 124(58%) of 214 countries or terri-tories around the world had im- plemented a rubella vaccinationprogram. 1An Australian study found that women born in Asia,sub-Saharan Africa and SouthAmerica were 5 times as likely asother women to be seronegativefor rubella virus. In a review ofall cases of infants with congeni-tal rubella syndrome in theUnited States reported from 83% (20/24) Hispanic mothers and 91%(21/23) were born to foreign-born mothers. Sri Lanka does not have a rubella vaccination program;therefore, if our patient's lowpositive titre from 1993 was atrue-positive result, it was likelythe result of natural immunity.Since serologic testing for rubellawas documented only once pre-ceding this pregnancy, westrongly suspect, but cannot con-firm, that this case of congenitalrubella syndrome resulted fromrubella reinfection: the IgG titre had increased markedly, from17 IU/mL in 1993 to 281 IU/mL10 years later, with a positive IgMtitre and no history of revaccina-tion. A rubella-specific IgM testperformed at 12 weeks' gestationwould have confirmed infectionrather than immunity. Numerous cases of congeni- tal rubella syndrome due torubella reinfection have been re-ported. 2All involved exposure to rubella the first after both naturaland vaccine-induced immunity,usually with subclinical infectionin the mother. The immune re-sponse may involve more thanhumoral immunity, but it isclear that rubella antibodies de-cline over time and may increasethe risk of reinfection. In a studyinvolving Korean children,18.8% of those who had beenvaccinated and 13.8% of thosewith natural immunity werefound to be seronegative forrubella virus after 3 years. AnTEACHING CASEREPORTDOI:10.1503/cmaj.050230THECASE: In January 2004 a female infant was delivered by cesarean section at 36 weeks' gestation because of severe intrauterine growth restriction. The mother was a healthy 31-year-old gravida 4para 2 woman who had been travelling in Sri Lanka from before conception until 6 weeks' gesta-tion. Blood drawn for antenatal tests at 6 weeks' gestation upon her return to Canada was not ini-tially tested for rubella titre. A rubella titre at 12 weeks' gestation (425 IU/mL) was interpreted asindicating immunity. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, without a history of fever or rash. The mother had immigrated to Canada from Sri Lanka in 1993, at which point her rubella titre had been 17 IU/mL. She did not recall a history of rubella infection or of rubella vaccination. She haddelivered a healthy child in 1996, but rubella screening had not been requested during that preg-nancy. In her other 2 pregnancies, which did not carry to term, her rubella titre had not been tested. Findings on initial physical examination of the daughter born in 2004 were unremarkable. Her birth weight was 1.58 kg, head circumference 28.3 cm and length 41 cm (all below the third per-centile). Hematologic studies revealed a normal leukocyte count and hemoglobin concentration buta low platelet count (49 \u00d710 9/L). During the first few days, the infant had hypoglycemia, hypocal- cemia and hyponatremia, with a single seizure being attributed to hyponatremia. Ultrasonographyof the head yielded normal findings. A murmur was noted on day 3 of life, and echocardiographydemonstrated a large patent ductus arteriosis, a patent foramen ovale and severe pulmonary valvu-lar stenosis. The infant was subsequently given a diagnosis of bilateral congenital cataracts. On the first day of the infant's life, her rubella IgG titre was 243 IU/mL (immunity is indicated at a titre of 10-15 IU/mL or greater ) and the rubella IgM titre was 1.123 index units (a positive re- sult is 0.3 or more index units [Behring Enzygnost, Behring Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany]).Rubella virus was cultured from the urine and from both extracted cataracts. After delivery, the stored antenatal serum that had been collected at 6 weeks' gestation was tested, and the rubella IgG and IgM titres were both positive (281 IU/mL and 0.619 index units re-spectively). All rubella titres were performed at the Ontario Central Public Health Laboratory. Key points \u007f Consider rubella vaccination of nonpregnant im- migrant women at their first encounter with thehealth care system. \u007f Women with a low positive IgG titre (e.g., 10- 15 IU/mL) before pregnancy may benefit from re-peat rubella vaccination. \u007f Women should be screened for rubella susceptibil- ity at each pregnancy, because immunity (from pre-vious vaccination or natural immunity) can wane. \u007f If a pregnant woman with a low positive IgG titre has recently been exposed to rubella, measure-ment of her IgM titre can help distinguish betweennew infection and immunity. \u007f Seronegative pregnant women need to be given rubella vaccine after delivery.PRACTICE CMAJ \u007f JUNE 21, 2005; 172 (13) 1679Italian study showed that 9.8% of vaccinated girls were re-infected by wild-type rubellavirus within 5 years. Prenatal serologic testing for rubella usually includes only theIgG titre, and the result is re-ported as \"immune\" or \"non-immune\" (Box 2). There is con-troversy over what level of titreconfers immunity. Bullens andcoauthors 2documented that 8 rubella IgG start of preg-nancy, a level considered to beprotective. Their finding ques-tions whether the current cutofflevel 10-15 IU/mL is too low considered with low posi-tive rubella titres before preg-nancy might benefit from repeatvaccination.In the absence of quantitative IgG reporting, clinicians do notknow which women have lowpositive titres. A further problemis single IgM titre cannot differentiaterecent infection from by the case wehave reported. Processing allrubella serologic tests in a cen-tralized laboratory with quanti-tative IgG titres may enable thedetection of rises inIgG in subsequent sam-ples. Rubella-specific IgM titrescould be routinely measuredduring the prenatal screening,but the cost-effectiveness of thisapproach would be questionable. Given that more than half of the world's population lives incountries without a rubella vacci-nation program, many are susceptible Physicians should con-sider offering measles-mumps- rubella vaccination to nonpreg-nant immigrant women from de-veloping countries at their firstcontact with the health care sys-tem. 3Serologic screening before vaccination is not recommendedand may result in a missed op-portunity to vaccinate if preg-nancy occurs in the interim or ifthe woman is lost to follow-up.Consultations before travel mayrepresent an opportunity to re-view rubella immunization statusof women of childbearing age. Because rubella antibodies wane over time, screening forrubella susceptibility is recom-mended at the first prenatal visitfor all pregnant women inCanada. In a Canadian study,2.3%-13.3% of pregnant womenwere seronegative for rubellavirus. A Quebec study thatonly half of the 8.4% womenwho were rubella seronegativereceived the vaccine after deliv-ery. Standing orders for rubellavaccination after delivery may in-crease immunization rates. Anna Banerji Public SciencesUniversity E, De- Serres G. Prevention of congenitalrubella syndrome.
