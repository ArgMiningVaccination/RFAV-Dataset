Infrared saunas increase the body's core temperature resulting in a much deeper, more detoxifying sweat from the cellular level of the skin where many toxins are housed. Conventional hot rock/steam heat saunas heat the air with steam, which can often be unbearably hot and will cause you to only sweat at the surface of the tissue. Steam also makes the air difficult to breathe. An infrared sauna uses soothing, dry, infrared heat that is well ventilated and extremely comfortable and relaxing. Because infrared heats the body directly instead of simply heating the air, infrared saunas are seven times more effective for detoxification. The experience of an infrared sauna is similar to sunbathing, which gives you the radiant heat that is invigorating and transformative. Unlike sunbathing, infrared heat therapy is completely healthy and safe. You can relax in an infrared sauna and it will not cause your skin to burn. Cost 30 minutes | $35 45 minutes | $50 60 minutes | $60 Packages 30 minute sessions - 5 for $160 | 10 for $300 45 minute sessions - 5 for $225 | 10 for $420 When to use it? Choose to use the sauna on its own as part of a healthy living regimen as many people do. Or use the sauna directly before your acupuncture or massage session to aid in deeper relaxation and treatment benefits. Others prefer to use the sauna after their acupuncture treatment or massage to aid in the detoxifying benefits from the increased circulation moving accumulated toxins out of your system, and continuing the healing process of their treatments earlier. Guidelines Check with your Doctor before starting saunas. Start gradual with less time, slowly increasing your duration and the temperature in the sauna. Hydrate!!! Drink 8 oz prior to entering the sauna. (Do NOT bring water in the sauna due to heating coils that can be damaged). And drink 24 oz plus after. Increasing your hydration on the days you are using the sauna is vital! Do not sleep in the sauna. How safe is infrared? Infrared heat is completely safe and healthy for all living things. You can be exposed to infrared light for hours without the risk of burning. Infrared is a naturally occurring output of the sun but does not contain the harmful UV rays associated with unprotected sunlight. In fact, infrared heat is so safe, it is used in hospitals to warm newborn infants. What is infrared? Infrared light (experienced as heat) is the invisible part of the sun's spectrum with the ability to gently and comfortably penetrate human tissue, giving a soothing, natural warmth. Naturally occurring from the sun, it is the basis for all Sunlighten saunas. Infrared light also comes in several forms. Each form offers unique wellness perks that together provide a holistic approach to achieving a better mind and body. The Sunlighten infrared technology aids in cleansing the circulatory system and more fully oxygenate the body's cells. Better blood circulation means more toxins flow from the cellular level to improve cell health, aid in muscle recovery, and strengthen the immune system. "}
