LA FETRA* INTRODUCTION The free enterprise syste m is the engine that drives America's healthy economy , the benefits of whic h necessarily include inherent risks. Unfo rtunately, many facets of America's civil justice syste m operate to shift all of those risks to the entrepreneurs who produce the consumer goods and services that make people's lives easier or more pleasant. Moreover, just as taxes imposed on businesses are necessarily passed on to consumers, consumers must also realize that businesses have passed the costs of outlandish tort verdi cts onto them in the form of higher prices. Even wors e, many vitally import ant businesses have si mply cho sen not to operate in the Uni ted States out of fear of litigatio n. The tort syste m has unde rgone a transformation from one designed solely to redress wron gs to one focusing more and more on criminal -style retribution and redistribution of weal th. In circular fashion, this expansion in tort liability is both a cause and effect of the mind-set that any injury, damag e or untowar d turn of events in a person's life is the fault of another, for whic h a lawsui t could bring hefty monetary returns. The lawyers who bring these actions become not only the legal voice for their immediate clients, but for all their potential clients who might s omeday, som ewhe re, be \"vict imized\" by peo ple engaged i n business. To counteract this mindset, many states and the federal government are enacting to rt reform laws to reduce the most obvious abuses of the civil justice syste m. These laws seek to equitably balance the risks and benefits of the free enterprise syste m in a way that protects consumers and promotes a healthier economy . As described below, limitations on tort actions are premised on three import ant policies: (1) American society as a whol e benefits when the freedom to innovate and make mistakes allows entrepreneurs to bring ever- better products to market; (2) people must accept responsibility for the consequences of their choices, even when those choices are foolish; and (3) individuals must be *Princip al Attorn ey, Pacific Legal Foundation , Clarem ont McKenna College; J.D., 1990, Univ. of So.

Part I of this Article describes the import ance of innovati on and competi tion to America's economic and social health and then addresses the impact of tort liability on one of the sec tors of the econ omy that most requires an ince ntive to innovate: vacci nes and biomedical technology. Part II of this Article focuses on personal responsibility by tracing some of the factors that have encouraged an abdication of individu al choice and responsibility in favor of a victim mentality that looks for others to blame. This part considers the impact of \"junk science\" and the media in promulgat ing the worldview that every accident or injury must be compensa ted. Part III of the Article considers the ability of individu als to engage in their own risk assessment and how this intersects with the legal concept of for eseeability. Finally, Part IV of this Article examines a sample of tort reform measures that have emerged in the past ten years in an attempt to once again acknowl edge the country's economic and social health as a factor justifiably con sidered in the formati on of tort policy. I. FREEDOM: THE CATALYST FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND INNOVATION A. Th e Prospect of Tort Liability Inhibits Innov ation Scientists and invent ors toiled for fifty years trying to perfect the electric lamp. The trick was to find the perfect filament that could withstand the heat and still conduct energy for long periods of time. Starting in 1878 , Thomas Edison's crew experimente d on 6000 types of materials for the filament, eventu ally narrowing the choices down to just two: platinum and carbonized cotton thread. Platinum coul d not handle the current without melting, b ut the carbon filament lasted thirteen hours on the first test. This success went far beyond academic satisfaction. Edison immediately began develo ping a comm ercial electric syste m, and in less than three years after obtaining the patent for the electric lamp, New1 York Cit y's first powe r station we nt into operation in 1882.2 But imag ine if Thomas Edison's innovation had come upon the scene 100 years later. The Edison El ectric Light Company's l egal d epartment woul d dog the innovator s in research and develo pment every step along the way: \"Sorry, Tom, we think this electric light bulb idea has promise, but think of the potential liability! We can't risk some bulb overhe ating and exploding, disfigurin g a child and having his parents sue us for everythi ng we've got. Or what if a lamp burns out during some critical medical procedure and the surgeon can no longer see the 1.\"Patent law creates ownership rights in the results of certain types of innovation .

And, frankly, Tom, at this stage of our business, it woul dn't take but3 one or two advers e judgm to bankrupt us.\" Fortunately, no legal department stifled Edison's invent ions, and the benefits to society multiplied in his wake. Innovat ion creates societal value whene ver resulting products are brought to market. Cons umers who need the product rush to buy it; producers who manufacturer the good at a cost below what people are willing to pay rush to sell it. As more people demand the product, and the number of producers increase to respond to the demand, pr ices decrease. 4 Innovat ion depends on the ability to experiment and m ake mistakes. A fair legal syste m must provide for the evolut ion of technology and manufacturing or risk the loss of invent ions that benefit all members of society. Unfo rtunately, the American civil justice syste m weighs heavily on innovator s. As Harvard Business Scho ol Professor Michael Porter described it: \"In the United States . . . product liability is so extreme and uncertain as to retard innovati on. The legal and regulat ory climate places firms in constant jeopardy of costly, and, as import antly, lengthy product liability suits.\" It is as thou gh an anvil lab eled5 \"potential tort liability\" swings precariously over any invent or, manufacturer, or business that dares to deviate from current knowled ge and technology. Any6 decision to diver ge from a well-worn path risks sever ing the rope holding the anvil and delivering a crus hing blow to the business and it s innovat ion. This is particularly anomalous when part of traditional tort law's philosophy is to encourage in novati on and repair to decrease future harm.7 A manufacturer that conducts no research can genera lly avoid liability 3.Certainly such acc idents are in the realm of possibil ity.

The increasing incidence and varia bility of punitive damag es awar ds prompt businesses to allocate great er resources into risk management and insurance to protect agains t potential financial ruin. This allocation draws resources away9 from new product designs and other innovati ons. But businesses cannot simply10 reallocate existing resources by gutting research and develo pment. A certain amount of innovati on is required to maintain one's competi tive position in the market. Cons equently, a business must compensa te for an overal l increase in costs by raising prices or by reducing paym ent levels to its creditors (e.g., bond holders and vendo rs).

Most companies have a limited ability to insure them selve s. For example, if a large , heavily indebted firm that self-insu res has to pay for a major loss, its re sultin g finances may render it unable to obtain future capital. The company may have to delay other investm ents in resea rch and developme nt to pay for the disaster. Small companies face different, but equally daun ting, prospects. If a small company is funded by many small investors for whom this one company is their major investm ent, the investors may not be willing to accept a company policy of paying for disasters that could have been covere d by insurance. Conversely, companies that insure against every possible risk could alienate investors for fa iling to ma ximize sharehold er value. Id. 11.See Jonath an T.

As o ne scholar writes: 14 Drug manufacturers on the whole produce valuab le, someti mes life-savin g products. The specter of liability . . . chills the manufacturer's incentive to develo p new products, making it prefer instead the tried and true remedies whic h appear safer from a liability standpoint. Beca use it is the nature of medical science to advanc e and progress, a pharmaceut ical industry that lags woef ully behind scientific advance s prevents the public from par taking in ne w remedies for illness.15 Tort liability may even force manufacturers to take existing products off the market. The public then suffers from the current liability syste m because16 \"whe n it is not cost-benefit effective to produce approved drugs or develo p new drugs, the public pays the price in unnecessary and un relieved su ffering.\"17 The stifling effect of the tort syste m is not speculative; examples abound. For instance, vacci nes have saved countless lives and great ly improved the health of millions. The statistics demonst rating vacci nes' beneficial effects are18 striking. For the week ending June 8, 1946 , health departments reported 161 cases of poliomy elitis (polio), 229 cases of diphtheria, 1886 cases of pertussis, and 25,041 cases of measles. For the first half of 1996 , through the week19 ending June 22, there were no cases of polio, one case of diphtheria, 1419 cases of pertussis, and 263 cases of measles. The difference is largely due to20 wide spread vacci nation. The Cent er for Disease Cont rol licensed vacci nes for all these conditions after 1946 : diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vacci ne in 1949 , inactivate d polio vacci ne in 1955 , live polio vacci ne in 1961 , and measles vacci ne in 1963 . The import ance of vacci nes could not be more21 clear. In 1980 , eight pharmaceut ical manufacturers produced the DPT vacci ne; yet, by 1986 , there were only two.

Not coincidentally, the number of liability25 suits filed agains t vacci ne manufacturers from 1978 to 1985 increased signifi cantly. These lawsu its, resolved e ither by cour awar ds or out-of-court26 settlements, forced the pharmaceut ical manufacturers to reallocate \"an ever larger percentage of the revenues from vacci ne sales to the costs of insurance and of defending agains t potential liability.\" Thus, the cost of products entering the27 market reflects the manufacturers' increasing cost of purchasing insurance needed to defend again st actual and potential lawsui ts. Desp ite vacci nes' spectacular accomplishments , fewer drug compani es than ever currently produce much-needed vaccines.

First, they reallocate resources to self-insure; second, they work to improve the safety of their product designs as well as the langua ge of their warning labels to cover any conceivable m ishap. While thes e extr a efforts do32 not present a problem per se, compani es cannot recover the costs of excessive efforts through an unending series of price increases. The increasing costs,33 therefore, may ultimately drive t he product off the market. Manufacturers are rightfu lly wary of wide ly varying jury awar ds, partic ularly when punitive damag es are invol ved. Given of vacci ne litigatio n,34 the pharmaceut ical compani es cannot be faulted for their fear of future liability. The compani es' responses to the vacci ne litigatio n sugg est that \"low liability costs have a positive, stimulat ive impact on innovati on, but high liability costs tend to depress it.\" However, future cases are unlikely to echo precisely the35 cases that came before because of the highl y complex interaction between liability, product design, and product distribution. Under standably, they have36 become apprehensive about entering new markets and cautious about remaining in old ones. In the past, product liability actions related to vacci ne products did not differ from other types of product liability litigatio n: plaintiffs proceeded unde r theories of negli gence, breach of express or implie d warranty, st rict liability in terms of design def ect, and failure to war n.

Of those sales, only .0057% were to biomedical-implant manufacturers. However, DuPont ended up spending eight years and $4050 million successfully defending itself agains t lawsui ts involving a faulty jaw implant that contained a nickel's worth of Teflon\u00ae. DuPont was the defendant51 of choice in these lawsui ts despite its negli gible participation in the develo pment of the defective product for the obvious reason: it had deep pockets. In52 contrast, the lawsu its soon bankrupt ed the small implant makers . 53 Biotechnology represents more than simply the hope of improved health care products; it holds the potential to revolut ionize products and manufacturing in a varie ty of industrial sectors and thus is critical to the health and competi tiveness of the national economy . However, recent close brushes with the tort syste m bode ill for this strategic industry. Full-blown litigatio n over some real or perceived injury is almost inevitab le, and the complex scientific issues raised by such litigatio n appear certain to bring out the wors t in our present dispute resolution process.54 As described in Part IV below, the sever e impact of tort litigatio n on these critical industries ultimately led t o a statutory res pons e.55 2. The Impa ct of Tort Liability on Compet itiveness.\u2014As the section above demonst rates, not only do consumers of medical and safety device s suffer these losses, but uncontrolled tort liability hampers American businesses' ability to compete in the global market. As li ability standards have bee n expanded since the 1970 s, manufacturers have made great er inves tments to reduce the extent of of spinal implant products outside the United States. Howe ver, it chose not to enter the $300 million domestic spinal implant products market because pend ing litigation over such products involves sums three times the annu al market size.

These investments do not occur in a vacuum,56 however , and must be evalua ted in terms of both benefits and costs. From an economic view, manuf acturer invest ments in produc t design is o nly one means of achieving safety. Cons umer inves tments also play a role. Cons umers may57 choose to reduce the probability of a product-related injury in vario us ways, \"including choos ing a product suitable for the consumer' s needs and using the product in a way that optimizes safety, both with respect to the method and frequency of use.\" Cons umer inves tments tments: the more manufacturer's inves t in safety, the less careful consumers must be, and vice-ve rsa. Alon g these lines, one district59 60 court has emphasi zed that defendants should not have to spread among its customers the economic loss resulting from injuries from a product that is not defective, and for whic h the risk of harm can be eliminat ed by operating the product properly and heeding given wa rnings.61 Safety equip ment for various sports has also suffered from the anvil of tort liability. Julie Nimm ons, Chief Exec utive Officer of Schu tt Spor ts Grou p, testified to Congres s in 1993 that material suppliers are reluctant to sell to her company, a manufacturer of protective sporting goods equipment, for fear of liability. As a result, the company was unable to obtain the raw materials needed to produce and market a new baseball safety helmet that functioned well in prototype testing. This reluctance someti mes kills new product develo pment. 62 For example, the company chose not to produce hockey helmets, even though interest in the sport has grown substantially in the United States. Nimm ons testified that \"[i]n the final analysis, we felt we could not pursue this market because of the additional, uncontrollable liability exposure it woul d create.\" 63 56.See George L.

Rather than take that chance, they do not make the64 improvem ent. And even while manufacturers hesitate to innovate new products65 or improve existing products, \"certain older technologies have been removed from the market, not because of sound scientific eviden ce indicating lack of safety or efficacy, but because product liability suits have exposed manufacturers to unacceptable financial risks.\" 66 These lawsui ts\u2014bo th actual and potential\u2014have a deleterious effect on a company's competi tiveness by drawing resources away from innovati on and production to legal defense.

Ev Tort Law f rom Victim Mentality Historically, many comm unities woul d stigmatize a member of their group who sued another member in tort. Most accident victims did not look to the76 courts for their recovery; either they accepted their fate or sought to recover their damag es informall y. Obvio usly, this is no longer the state of affairs. These77 days, comm unities expect people to sue if they suffer an injury of any magnit ude. Acci dent victims want to \"get theirs\" because \"ever ybody else is doing it.\" 78 Many victims believe themselves entitled to recovery, and, if at all possible, eager ly transfer blame for the ir predicament away from themselves. They m ay find such lawsui t appealing as they are cast as the underdog agains t what they perceive as a huge, f aceless corporation.79 The media's role in this transformati on should not be unde restimated . Certain news papers, popu lar magazines , and televisio n shows have placed victims in some personal injury cases in the national spotlight, allowing the plaintiffs to bask in their fifteen minutes of fame while the journalists rake the corporate defendants over the coals. For example, in 1990 , CBS anchorwom an Conni e Chung interviewe d wom en who claimed to have autoimm une disease caused by breast implant s. \"The broadcast implic itly blamed the FDA [Food80 and Drug Adm inistration] for permitt ing hazar dous medical device s to be sold.\" 81 An FDA advis ory panel heard impassi oned testimony from wom en who believed their implant s made them ill. In April 1992 , FDA Com missioner David Kessler banned breast implant s for all purposes except in clinical trials of breast reconstruction after cancer surger y. 82 Two years later, the New England Journal Of Medicine published a retrospective cohort study from the Mayo Clinic finding no association between breast implant s and 12 connective-tissue diseases.

By then, however , the implant manufacturer Dow84 Corn ing Corp oration had filed for protection unde r Chap ter 11 of the Bankrup tcy Code . The impact of these events is borne out by the numbers : In 1991 , breast85 implant plaintiffs filed 137 lawsui ts agains t Corn ing; the next year saw 3500 lawsui ts filed and by 1995 , the year Dow Corn ing filed for bankrupt cy, the company was defending more than 19,000 lawsui ts. Richard Hazlet on, the86 Chai rman and CEO of Dow Corn ing, wrote at the time that the company was facing \"more than 75 trials, many with multiple plaintiffs, in a period of a few months. . . . [S]imulta neously fielding dozens of trial teams and witnesses to defend ourselves when settlement demands are unreasonable has become impossi ble.\" Dow Corn ing was a $2 billion company that provided jobs to87 more than 8,000 employees. Thanks to a health \"crisis\" that, as it turns out,88 was little more than media-driven hyste ria based on junk science, a thriving company was destroyed, taking with it all the livelih ood of its employees, a devast ating human cost when one considers the ripple effect through those employees' families contending wit h joblessness and uncertain prospects.89 B.

Phylli s Eisen, director of risk management for the National Association of Manufacturers, identifies both sides of the coin: The unde rlying question is, what kind of risks are we willing to take and what kind of personal responsibility do people have to take in order to have a society that encourages risk?

Auto mobile accidents have genera ted a substantial body of law whic h, in practice, absolve drivers from personal responsibility when their own negli gence is coupled with alleged design defects. In thirty states, automobile manufacturers are not permitted to introduce eviden ce in cour t about whet her a pers on injured or killed in an accident was wear ing a seat belt.

The court held that just because some injuries may occur does not mean that a product is defective. Second, a user could avoid the dangers associated with the101 elasticized cord and cord locks by being mindful of the propensity of elastic cords to recoil and by exercising care by not pulling forcefully on such a cord in the vicin ity of the user's face . Such care could reasonably be exercised even in advers e weat her conditions. Finally, citing the genera l public's awar eness of102 elasticized items such as rubber bands and bungee cords, the court assumed that avera ge consumers are well acqu ainted with the tendency of all elastic items to recoil after they have bee n extended and released.103 In Mass achusetts, the Supr eme Judicial Cour t dismissed the case of Jo seph O'Su llivan, who was visiting his girlfriend's grandp arents in Methuen and decided to dive into the shallow end of their pool.

For example, the more safety devic es an automobile manufacturer installs in a particular model, the more expensive the car. Manufacturers therefore choose to make some sa fety device s optional. The consumer theoretically was awar e of the optional safety device and, after making a similar conscious or unconscious cost-benefit analysis, elected to forgo purchasing the device . The consumer apparently possessed more knowled ge as to his or her needs, the amount of money avail able, or the ultimate use of the product as evince d by the consumer' s rejection of the options. The manufacturer did not and could not possess knowled ge of the consumer' s purchasing criteria. Cons idering current technology, there is no possible way a manufacturer can read a consume r's mind to ascertain each individu al's needs, and until there is a way to do this, the manufacturer must at some point be able to rely on the decisions a consumer makes.

Both concepts presume the ability to decide on a course of action. What brings into play the notion of137 responsibility is that some one makes a decision having discernible consequences. As people perceive themselves as safer or better equipped138 against a danger, they are more likely to take more risks. For example,139 regardi ng the increasing volunt ary use of ski helmets, Jasper Shea ly, a ski injury expert at the Roch ester Institute of Technology in New York believes that some fatalities were caused by people who took risks they otherwise woul dn't have taken because the helmets made them overco nfident. \"I've heard sever al people say, 'I only wea r my helmet when I ski t hrough the trees.' Peop le think, 'I can do things I normally woul dn't want to do because I'm weari ng a hel met.'\"140 The word \"foreseeability\" comm only is used to describe \"actual, subjective awar eness of possible future occurrences.\" It connotes a consciousness of-and141 ability to plan for- future possibilities. A foresighted person considers the142 future and takes necessary precautions to protect himsel f (and others) from risks while taking advant age of oppo rtunities. Thus, foreseeability is an integral part143 of prudent human behavior. To the extent that we expect humans to be rational beings, they must be charged with some degree of foreseeability. In the context of moral analysis, the meaning of foreseeability derives from its relationship to the concepts of choice and fault. If an actor foresees a possible consequence harmful to himsel f or others and, disregardi ng this foresight, acts in a way which allows the avoida ble harm to occur, his action woul d be condemned as morally blamewor thy.

For example, in Romi to v. Re d Plastic Co., a cons truction worker who f ailed to tie himself to150 a safety line died when he accidentally fell through a skylight. His family brought a products liability action agains t the skylight manufacturer unde r negli gence and strict liability theories. The California Cour t of Appea l rejected the claim: We acknowl edge the appeal of the logic that Dur-Red, in the interest of public safety, readily could have used a stronger material at no extra cost that woul d have saved Rom ito's life. This logic, however attractive in this case, fails to satisfy our broader policy concerns. Any product is potentially dangerous if accidentally misused or abused, and predicting the different ways in whic h accidents can occur is a task limited only by the scope of one's imag ination. To require skylight manufacturers to adopt technological safety advanc es and recall, replace, or retrofit their older products or risk exposure to tort liability woul d be unreasonable in the absence of defined risks of h arm. . . . Here, the injury resulted from an accidental fall. If we were to impose a duty of care in this situation, should the manufacturer also owe a duty of care to a victim of crime? As the level of viole nce in modern society increases, even state of the art products may soon be rendered unsafe. For example, automobile wind shields and home and office wind ows could be made of bulletproof glass but most are not. Must glass compani es refuse to sell anythi ng but bulletproof glass to auto manufacturers and construction compani es simply because the stronger material exists and the risk of shootings is ever increasing in many urban neighborho ods?151 Other types of injury may impose such substan tial society costs that a legislature may legitim ately curtail person al freedom . For example, motorcycle helm et laws were fiercely debated as legislators attem pted to strike a balance betwe en the competing interests of riders who valued the person al freedom of ridin g without a helm et with the societal value of saving taxpayer dollars used to supp ort un insured rid ers w ho had accidents and suf fered hea d inju ries, re quiring long-term care. See, e.g ., Picou v. G illum, 874 F.2d 1519, 1522 (11th Cir. 1 989): A motorcyclist without a helm et is more likely to suffer serious head injury than one wearing the prescribed headgear.

If defendants must pay judgm ents from personal assets, many individu als and small businesses may be forced out of the market or into bankrupt cy. Fear of this possibility may compel entrepreneurs and individu als to act very cautiously, becoming risk-avers e rather than risk-preferring.164 If we are to treat adults as adults, they must be permitted to assess and accept risks dependent on their own level of risk-avers ion.

The successful claims then repay the initial inves tment many times166 over through a percentage of the clients' damag es (especially when punitive damag es are awar ded).

Alternatively, Congres s177 also worr ied that given the uncertain nature of litigatio n, some deserving victims of vacci ne-related injuries might not be fully compensa ted. Therefore,178 Congres s passed the National Vaccine Injury Com pensation Program , that179 provided a specified recourse for families to pursue injury claims while discouraging further private mass tort litigatio n against the pharmaceut ical compani es. \"Am ong other things, the Act established a special tribunal (the180 It is not difficult to see how this has come abou t: The law of the state in which the allege d harm occurs genera lly decides tort cases.

Statutes of repose reflect the public policy that, after the passage of a reasonable length of time, manufacturers should be free from the burdens of disruptive litigatio n over products that are alleged to cause harm after many years of safe operation and use. Almost half of the states have enacted statutes of repose of varying197 lengths. On the federal level, i n 1994, the Ge neral Aviati on Re vitalization Act (GARA) was signed into law to breathe life into an industry that had experienced a ninety-five percent decline in production and a loss of 100,000 jobs in the preceding two decades.

The purpose of GARA is to199 establish a Fede ral statute of repose to protect general aviat ion manuf acturers from long-term liability in those instances wher e a particular aircraft has been in operation for a considerable number of years . A statute of repose is a legal recognit ion that, after an extended period of time, a product has demonst rated its safety and quality, and that it is not reasonable to hold a manufacturer legally responsible for an accident or injury occ urring af ter that much time has elapsed.200 Five years later, the Gene ral Aviati on Manufacturers Asso ciation issued a report on the Act declaring it \"an unqualified success.\" Acco rding to the201 report, genera l aviat ion production lines created 25,000 new manufacturing jobs as well as thousands of additional jobs in support industries.

This one narrow tort reform measure had very202 positive results, and a strong ripple effect in comm unities across the country. For example, Cess na located a new smal l aircraft plant in Montgom ery Count y, Kansas, that revived the local economy. [P]rior to 1995 , Montgom ery Coun ty ranked ninety-eighth out of 105 Kansas counties in economic indicators. Its popu lation was dropping, employm ent was on the decline, per capita income was down, and property values were depressed. Economic growth since the construction of the plant began has exceeded all predictions made in a study the county prepared in 1995 .

In204 California, wide spread dissatisfaction with joint and sever al liability, the \"deep pocket\" rule, resulted in the overwhe lming passage of Proposition 51, the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986 , by a 62% affirmati ve vote. Proposition 51205 abolished the principle of joint and sever al liability for nonpecuniary damag es by requiring a defendant to pay only his or her proportionate share of none conomic damag es, but still allowe d joint and sever al liability for all economic damag es.

However, each defendant is liable solely in proportion to its assessed degre e of fault for none conomic damages, including pain, suffering, or emotion al distress. 209 Proposition 51 thus allows an injured plaintiff to recover the full amoun t of economic damag es suffered, regardless of whic h defendants are named. The defendants are left to sort out paym ent in proportion to fault among st themselves, and they must bear the risk of nonrecovery from impecun ious defendants.

In response,213 Florida's tort reform law places restrictions on joint and sever al liability. Under the new law, a defendant found less than 10% at fault in lawsui ts invol ving multiple defendants is not jointly and sever ally liable; a defendant found 11% to 25% liable is jointly and sever ally liable only for economic dam ages, and t hen for an amount not exceeding $200 ,000, and so on.

In addition, Florida's tort reform law prescribes reasonable caps on215 the awar d of punitive damages.

KARR, SMALL BUSINESS AND THE CORPORATI ON, in AN OUTL INE2003 ] FREEDOM, RESPONSI BILITY, AND RI SK 685 CONCLUSION The present system in the United States for resolving product liability disputes and compensa ting those injured by defective products is costly, slow, ineq uitable, and unpr edictable. Such a system does not benefit manufacturers, product sellers, or injured persons. The syste m's high transaction costs exceed compensa tion paid to victims. Those transaction costs are passed on to consumers through higher product prices. The system's unpredictability and inefficiency have stifled innovati on, kept beneficial products off the market, and have handicapped American firms as they compete in the global economy .226 Tort reform efforts seek to reduce transaction costs, provide great er certainty as to the rights and responsibilities of all parties invol ved in product liability disputes, encourage innovati on, increase the competi tiveness of American firms, reduce burdens on interstate comm erce, and safeguard d ue process rights. The word s of former Justice Benj amin Cardozo are instructive: the law is \"guide d by a robust comm on sense whic h assumes the freedom of the will as a working hypothe sis in the solution of [legal] problems.\" 227 For most of its 250 years, America's hallmark has been the vibra nt entrepreneurial spirit and energy of its people. Indeed, American free enterprise has facilitated the success stories of millions of individu als and businesses, which have in turn driven the most productive, progress ive and responsive economy in the history of the world. But there is mounti ng conc ern that over the course of the past three decades that traditional entrepreneurial spirit and energy has contracted a weakeni ng condition, not unlike the symptoms of a parasitic illness. Unle ss thi s condi tion is rec ognized and addr essed, it will eventua lly succeed in sapping that entrepreneurial spirit and energy so vital to free enterprise.
