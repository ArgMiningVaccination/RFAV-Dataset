The hard evidence, though, remains elusive as officials say Canada's track-ing system is too woefully inadequateto accurately ascertain the controversy'seffect in Canada. Many immunologists and public health experts believe the study trig-gered a worldwide decline in the num-ber of children receiving the vaccine( Lancet 1998;351:634-41, removed on- line). In the United Kingdom, coveragerates for the vaccine dropped to 75%. There are little empirical data of a similar decline in Canada. The PublicHealth Agency of Canada (PHAC) re-ported in the 2006 National Immuniza-tion Survey that approximately 91% ofCanadian children had received theMMR vaccine. That rate was onlysible to determine with absolute cer-tainty what kind of \"uptake\" there hasbeen on all the major childhood vac-cines ( CMAJ 2007:176[13]:1811-3). A widely cited 2006 study found that less than 70% of Canadian 2-year-oldsreceived their full range of vaccines ( Pe- diatrics 2006;117:595-602). The result was especially troubling given the factthese children had, on average, visiteda physician 19 times. Dr. Joanne Embree, the head of pe- diatric infectious diseases at the Uni-versity of Manitoba, says there is wide-spread concern the lack of specificdata, and poor vaccine coverage, is aby-product of the difficulty many Cana-dians have in finding a regular familydoctor or pediatrician. Embree says parents who rely heav- ily on walk-in clinics for their healthcare needs often slip through thecracks of the system. They only ap-proach a physician when their childrenhave a specific health problem, and thesubject of whether vaccines are up todate never arises, she adds. \"If you donot have a family doctor then you likelydon't have someone to remind you toget your vaccines on time.\" The shortage of family doctors is also depriving the health care system ofmuch-needed data on how many parentsrefuse to allow their children to be vacci-nated, Embree adds. Almost all familyphysicians and pediatricians can anecdo-tally reference families that decline cer-tain vaccines. \u2014 Dan Lett, Winnipeg DOI:10.1503/cmaj.071199slightly lower than the 94% coverageprojected in 1997. That suggests that coverage rates for the vaccine haven't been impacted andthat parents haven't stopped doctorsfrom administering the the vaccine.\" Public concern about an MMR- autism link resurfaced this summer af-ter the UK General Medical Council an-nounced it would hold hearings into al-legations of professional misconductagainst Dr. Andrew Wakefield, Profes-sor John Walker-Smith and ProfessorSimon Murch, 3 of the original authorsof the Lancet study. Subsequent clinical studies have since failed to confirm thefindings. In 2004, 10 of the 12 expertswho collaborated with Wakefield re-tracted the study. Now before the UK General Medical Council are such alleged ethical breachesas paying children at birthday parties toprovide blood samples, and failing to in-form the Lancet that Wakefield was ad- vising lawyers who were representingparents who believed their children wereadversely affected by the vaccine. Although the study's findings have been widely discredited, immunolo-gists and public health officials remainconcerned. \"Right now, nobody is able to docu- ment or trace the true impact of theMMR study,\" says Mary Appleton, thesenior manager for the Canadian for Immunization Awareness andPromotion. \"Our registration system issimply insufficient.\" In Canada and the United States, the health care systems get data on immu-nization coverage rates from a varietyof sources including patient records.However, national surveys in eachcountry rely most heavily on publicopinion survey methodology to comeup with coverage rate estimates, an ap-proach that many in the field believe islittle more than an educated guess. Among Canadian provinces, only Manitoba has a formal system in placethat requires physicians to record in aprovince-wide registry every immuniza-tion administered, Fahrang Mehr said.Without a national registry, it is impos-Vaccine-autism link discounted, but effect of\"study\" is unknown Data on immunization rates in Canada are suspect in the absence of a national registry.Leah-Anne Thompson / iStockphoto US Medicare will stop paying for preventable errors In a major policy change projected to save lives and millions of dol-lars, Medicare will stop paying US hospitals to correct 8 preventable med-ical errors caused by their own negli-gence, commencing in October 2008. The new payment guidelines are part of a 3-year effort by Medicare, thelargest health care payer in the UnitedStates, to improve care for elderly andNews disabled Americans. Under guidelines issued in August, Medicare will nolonger pay hospitals to retrieve objects,such as sponges or surgical tools, leftin patients after surgery, or to treatproblems arising from air embolismsor incompatible blood transfusions.Nor will it pay the additional costs oftreating bedsores developed while inthe hospital, injuries caused by hospitalfalls, or infections arising from pro-longed use of urinary and vascularcatheters or after coronary artery by-pass surgery. \"The overall mission of the Medicare program is changing,\" saidHerb Kuhn, deputy administrator ofthe Centers for Medicare & MedicaidServices. \"Our efforts are focused onbecoming an active purchaser, ratherthan a passive payer, of health care.\" The Bush administration estimates the new regulations will save $20 mil-lion annually, but others predict fargreater savings. About 1.7 millionAmericans contract infections eachyear in hospitals \u2014 almost 100 000 die\u2014 with Medicare paying to treat morethan 60% of them. Catheter-associatedurinary tract infections alone cost $451 million annually, according tothe US Centers for Disease Controland Prevention. Hospitals themselves will pay for the additional procedures and ex-tended hospital stays required to fixthe problems; the regulations ex-pressly forbid them from shifting thecosts to patients. Emanating from a deficit-reduction law passed by the US Congress in2005, the new rules require hospitalsto start reporting secondary diagnosesthat are present on admission for pa-tients discharged on or after Oct. 1. Al-most no US hospitals currently recordsuch data. Hospitals will not be reimbursed for the extra cost of treating patients whoacquired conditions while in hospital. With the help of experts, Medicare selected conditions that were consid-ered preventable, then sought publiccomment on the proposed changes inMay. Medicare anticipates adding 3more conditions next year. Private insurers are expected to fol- low Medicare's lead, said Susan Pisano,guish between a preliminary bedsoreand mere redness of skin? Hospitalare also inventing data collection sys-tems on the fly, she said. \"You need tolay the groundwork, if you're going tomake this a national policy.\" The American Medical Association declined to comment on the new rules,saying it had not yet reviewed them. InJune, the association told Medicare thatcutting payments to hospitals for treat-ing complications that are \"often a bio-logical inevitability regardless of safepractice\" was discriminatory. The pro-posed changes could result in delay ordenial of care to vulnerable patients, in-cluding elderly patients with compro-mised immune systems, the associa-tion added. \"Continued access to care for these patients has already become more diffi-cult due to the costs of care and thispolicy could significantly compoundthe problem by leading hospitals toerect barriers to admission,\" it wrote. Consumer groups generally lauded the changes. But the founder of theCommittee to Reduce Infection Deaths,a non-profit patient advocacy group,decried the decision to strike staphylo-coccal aureus septicemia infectionsfrom the final list. Betsy McCaugheysaid Medicare's historical indifferenceto quality has increased costs and putpatients at risk. \"Hospitals aren't goingto clean up until their biggest customerin this country demands it,\" she said. The new policy also drew a favourable response from heavy hitters like the New York Times , which, in an editorial, pointed to the \"perversity\" of a systemthat rewards incompetence by payinghospitals more when surgeries are com-plicated by infection caused by the hospi-tals' own sloppiness. Medicare should also consider docking the doctors who make themistakes, the Times argued. Ken Con- nor of the Center for a Just Society, aconservative Christian think tank,went even further, urging Bush to re-quire hospitals to repay the \"billionsof dollars\" they have received fromMedicare over the decades to fix theirmistakes. \u2014 Janet Brooks, Salt LakeCity, Utah DOI:10.1503/cmaj.071347a vice-president of America's Health In-surance Plans, a trade group. A few USinsurers already have similar policies,and \"a considerable number\" aremulling such changes. \"Payment in-centives play a good role in encourag-ing quality and enforcing it where it ex-ists,\" she said. Nancy Foster, vice-president for quality and patient safety policy for theAmerican Hospital Association, saidshe couldn't predict whether thechanges would increase hospital costs.But when hospitals make clearly pre-ventable errors that cause harm to pa-tients, they shouldn't expect Medicareto pay for them, she said. Other conditions, such as falls, are not completely preventable, Fostersaid. \"We have lots of ways of reduc-ing falls, but nothing approximatingzero yet.\" The new reporting requirements are likely to \"significantly\" increaselaboratory testing to determine if in-fections are present on admission,Foster said.
