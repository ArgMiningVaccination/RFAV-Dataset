It can be done either directly through the environment or through another person, who is called healer. The healer is one who has long perfect the art of tapping that cosmic energy. The healer by placing his/her hand on the patient transfers the cosmic energy into his/her body. Considering the disease of the patient, the healer also chants a mantra.
