Shatavari is another Ayurvedic herb that is known for its especially potent benefits for conditions specific to women\u2014as such, it's a revered adaptogen that all women should know about. A powerful immunity booster, Shatavari can strengthen fertility, reduce menopausal symptoms, combat stress and more. What Is Shatavari? Shatavari is a member of the asparagus family, and in Sanskrit, it translates to \"one hundred roots,\" which reflects its complex root system and its multiplicity of healing powers. Another translation is \"one who possesses one hundred husbands,\" an even more vivid testimony to how Shatavari makes a transformative impact on women's reproductive health. As Cecilia Lacayo, MD, tells [Well + Good](https://www.wellandgood.com/health-benefits-shatavari/), Shatavari has \"been used for centuries to help women with their reproductive health, restore and balance hormones, increase libido, fight fatigue, treat PMS and menopausal symptoms, support healthy production of breast milk, strengthen the immune systems, and improve digestive health.\" Shatavari is also an adaptogenic herb, which means that it adapts to the specific needs of your body and enhance the body's ability to respond to stress. They've been used in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine for centuries as an all-natural tool for boosting immunity and health. Given its adaptability, Shatavari offers a variety of benefits for women of all ages. Benefits of Shatavari for Women Relieves PMS symptoms As naturopathic doctor Amanda Frick tells [Well + a natural diuretic, this Ayurvedic herb can thus relieve PMS symptoms such as stomach pains, cramps and bloating. Regulates periods and supports healthy ovulation Shatavari regulates vaginal pH levels and estrogen production, which in turn helps to regulate periods. It also stimulates production of the luteinizing hormone, which triggers ovulation. If you're struggling with getting regular periods or are looking to conceive, Shatavari might offer a particularly useful solution. Promotes breast milk production [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3869575/) has shown that Shatavari acts as a galactagogue, or an ingredient that can boost breast milk production. While galactagogues don't boost milk supplies on their own, they can act as a natural and effective stimulant for breast milk production; many nursing mothers have found them helpful in increasing their milk. Reduces menopausal symptoms [Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210803318300010) has also shown that Shatavari is effective in significantly reducing menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats and brain fog. That's because Shatavari has a potent phytoestrogen component that helps to treat decreased estrogen levels faced by menopausal women, making it a continuously potent natural remedy for women as they age. Alleviates stress and improves mood Whether we're menstruating, experiencing pre-menstrual syndrome, going through menopause or simply feeling overwhelmed by the demands of daily life, a negative mood can be difficult to shake. In Ayurveda, it is believed that Shatavari has antidepressant qualities and can reduce stress, soothe irritability and boost one's mood.
