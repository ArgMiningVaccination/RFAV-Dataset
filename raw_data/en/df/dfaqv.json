Segment Description: Colleen Kelley, MD, MPH, associate professor at the Emory University School of Medicine, discusses some of the themes in developing HIV science. Interview Transcript (modified slightly for readability): Kelley: Some of the biggest themes continue to be prevention and cure. The new prevention modalities, including preexposure prophylaxis, but also monoclonal antibodies, and hopefully a traditional vaccine, are very exciting. And then the cure agenda. Every year we continue to learn more about how we might be able to cure people with HIV. We're not there yet. But I think that the science is moving quickly. There have been a lot of advances that are moving us forward and hopefully at some point will give us the key to curing people of HIV. "}
