The teams, which are managed by the ROTC, often compete against each other, with the loser buying the winning team dinner. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the women's team regularly places in the top five spots of the National Women's Rifle Championships, though many of its members had never shot a rifle before joining. After ROTC ceases the program in the late '60s, the two Drexel teams evolve into a club sport until 2003, when the program is shut down again amid changing political and social norms. At the time, the organization was the nation's second-oldest collegiate rifle team. "}
