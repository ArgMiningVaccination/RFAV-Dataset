Why was this preservative incorporated in thefirst place? Was there any real evidence that it caused harm? And how didthimerosal become linked in the public mind to the \"autism epidemic\"? I examine the origins of the thimerosal controversy and their legacy for the debate that has followed. More specifically, I explore the parallel histories ofthree factors that converged to create the crisis: vaccine preservatives, mercurypoisoning, and autism. An understanding of this history provides important lessons for physicians and policymakers seeking to preserve the public's trust in the nation's vaccinesystem. ( Am J Public Health . 2008;98:244-253. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2007.113159) DESPITE THE REASSURANCE of no less than eight safety reviewpanels conducted by the Instituteof Medicine (IOM) since 2001,many parents continue to fearthat childhood vaccines can causea host of adverse effects rangingfrom immune dysfunction to at-tention deficit disorder andautism. 1Several trends no doubt contribute to this anxiety: fadingmemory of vaccine-preventablediseases, adverse media coverage,misinformation on the Internet,and litigation. 2Yet global explana- tions of this sort fail to do justiceto the fact that controversies overvaccines have often followed quite disparate trajectories in dif-ferent settings. For example, al-though the alleged relationship|Jeffrey P . Baker, MD, PhD One Controversy, Three HistoriesMercury, Vaccines, and Autism between childhood vaccines and autism has been the dominantcontroversy over child immuniza-tion of recent years, British anxi-ety has centered on the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, whereasAmericans have focused muchmore on the role of mercury invaccine preservatives. 3 I examine the origins of the American debate surroundingvaccines, mercury, and autism to illuminate how historical analysiscan contribute to understandingpublic attitudes toward vaccinesafety. It is not my intent to an-swer whether mercury in vaccinesexplains the increasing prevalenceof autism; the IOM has alreadydetermined over the course oftwo reviews that available evi-dence fails to support such a con-clusion. 4Instead, I examine the historical questions that havebeen raised in the debate butonly superficially addressed bythe IOM. Why was the mercury-containing preservative thimerosalintroduced in infant vaccines inthe first place? Why was its usenot questioned until the late1990s, long after the toxic effects of mercury had been recognized?Why was autism perceived to be\"epidemic\" in the 1990s, and howdid it become linked to vaccines in the public's mind? I argue that the thimerosal story is best envisioned in termsof three historical \"streams\" datingback to the early 20th centurythat converged unexpectedly andmomentously in the summer of1999. These three tributaries, corresponding to the histories ofvaccine preservatives, mercury poisoning, and autism, are exam-ined successively to illuminatewhy various groups responded sodifferently to the debates begin-ning in that year. THIMEROSAL AND VACCINES Understanding why mercury was first incorporated into child- hood vaccines leads back to thepreantibiotic era, a time whenphysicians employed a variety ofcompounds known as \"germi-cides\" to combat bacteria. Perhapsthe best known was Joseph Lis-ter's carbolic acid, developed inthe 1860s for surgical antisepsisand as a germi-cide and preservative known asphenol. 5Yet a variety of mercury compounds were also used forthe same purpose. No less an American Journal of Public Health |February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 244 |Public Health Then and Now |Peer Reviewed |BakerPUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW From a therapeutic standpoint, the trial was a failure, but investigatorswere struck by how well the pa- tients seemed to tolerate such highdoses. 9Combined with the animal studies, the data further reinforcedthe impression that thimerosal wasfar more benign than earlier mer-curials, preparing the way for itsincorporation at low concentra-tions into a wide range of biologi-cal products as a preservative.Vaccines would become an espe- cially important niche. One of the most troublesome safety issues afflicting early 20th-century child immunization wasthat of bacterial contamination.This could easily occur on a spo-radic basis, when general practi- tioners might have to draw vac-cines from multidose vials underpoor hygienic conditions. Con-tamination of entire lots couldbe much more spectacular. InColumbia, South Carolina, in1916, a tainted batch of typhoid vaccine stored at room tempera- ture caused 68 severe reactions,26 abscesses, and 4 deaths. A still more disturbing incident tookplace in 1928 in Queensland,Australia, where 12 of 21 chil-dren with contami-nated diphtheria need for effec-tive preservatives was readily ap-parent and represented one of themost important safety issues forthe promoters of new vaccines. 10 In this context, Powell and Jamieson's studies suggested thatMerthiolate had an unexpectedadvantage. The problem with ex-isting preservatives such as phe-nol and cresol was that they oftenreduced the potency of the bio- logical products they were in-tended to protect. By contrast,thimerosal not only inhibited bac-terial growth in vaccines and anti-sera at concentrations as low as1:10000 but also had no such deleterious effects. 11A series of other investigators confirmedthese findings over the next sev-eral years, and by 1940thimerosal was incorporated intodiphtheria toxoid, meningococcalserum, pertussis vaccine, and ahost of other biological products. 12 Indeed, in 1938 Lilly's assistantdirector of research listed Merthi-olate along with insulin as one ofthe five most important drugsever developed by the company. 13 Thimerosal's efficacy was sometimes challenged during thefirst 50 years following its synthe-sis, but rarely its safety. In 1948, the American Medical Associa- tion's (AMA's) Council on Phar-macy and Chemistry issued a re-port calling attention to a series ofinvestigations asking whetherorganomercurials were any moreeffective as germicides than inor-ganic mercury compounds hadpreviously been. 14The AMA's council, it should be noted, playedan important role before 1950 inproviding independent assess-ments and approvals of drugs; theUS Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) did not require manu-facturers to submit prelicensuresafety testing until 1938 or effi-cacy testing until the 1960s. 15De- spite these voices of dissent,thimerosal remained popular inpractice. Its defenders pointed totheir own studies and the simplefact that contamination incidentsauthority than Robert Koch cham- pioned the use of mercury chlo-ride as an antiseptic, although theproduct's propensity to cause tis-sue irritation limited its use. In theearly 20th century, investigatorssynthesized a new class of com-pounds they claimed to be bothmore effective and less toxic, theorganomercurials. Often brilliantlycolored, these products soonfound widespread usage, from op-erating suites to home medicinecabinets. 6 Thimerosal was one of the most promising new organomer-curials that excited the pharma-ceutical industry after WorldWar I. It was a white, crystalline powder, approximately 50% mer-cury by weight, in the form ofethylmercury bound to thiosalicy-late. The emerging pharmaceuti-cal giant Eli Lilly and Companyprovided grant support for itssynthesis at the University ofChicago and in 1928 patented itunder the trade name Merthio-late. 7Over the next several years, Lilly's investigators Jamieson conductedextensive in vitro testing, thimerosal was 40 to 50times as effective as phenolagainst Staphylococcus aureus . The two men evaluated toxicityby injecting the compound into over 300 rabbits and a variety of other animals observed for aweek's time. The animals ap- peared to tolerate significantdoses\u2014up to 20 mg per kg bodyweight in rabbits and still higher in rats\u2014without apparent injury. 8 These encouraging results prompted the Lilly team in 1929to offer their product to the Indi-ana General Hospital during anepidemic of meningococcal men-ingitis. Hospital physicians gave22 patients as much as 180 mL ofa 1% solution of thimerosal intra-venously divided over five doses.\"\"One of the most troublesome safety issues afflicting early 20th-century child immunization was that of bacterial contamination. This could easily occur on a sporadic basis, when general practitioners might have to draw vaccines from multidose vials under poor hygienic conditions. February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 |American Journal of Public Health Baker |Peer Reviewed |Public Health Then and Now |245PUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW had become exceedingly uncom- mon following its introduction.16 Although Jonas Salk's experiencewith inactivated polio vaccine infield trials from 1954 to 1955suggested that in some casesthimerosal, contrary to expectation,did in fact harm vaccine immuno-genicity, this case was regarded asan exception to the rule. 17 The first real questions regard- ing thimerosal's safety wereraised in the 1970s, p rovoked (as will be described in the nextsection) by rising awareness of the dangers of organ ic mercury poisoning. Although the latter de- bate centered on the organomer-curial methylmercury found infish and industrial pollution,ethylmercury did not escapescrutiny. series of case reportsdemonstrated the compound'spotential for neurotoxicity whengiven in large volumes, such used as a topical antisepticto \"paint\" large omphaloceles. 18,19 These exposures exceeded thosein vaccines, however, by manyorders of magnitude. Only oneroutine infant vaccine in the 1970s, the diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis combination, containedthimerosal. A formal review ofthimerosal by the FDA concludedin 1976 that no dangerousquantity of mercury was likelyto be received from vaccines andother biological products over alifetime. 20 Concerns over neurotoxicity in infants receiving thimerosal fromvaccines were never raised by medical or governmental authori-ties before the late 1990s. To besure, some bacteriologists contin-ued to question its efficacy in thelaboratory. As noted by dermatolo-gists (and eventually the FDA),skin testing revealed that contactwith thimerosal caused hypersensi-tivity in many people. There wasno evidence, however, that thisphenomenon had any medical sig- nificance. 21Thimerosal's toxicity at high doses was clearly establishedby the 1970s, but the compara- tively miniscule exposures in-volved in vaccines were well within all published guidelines formercury exposure. The over-whelming consensus was that eth- ylmercury in low concentrationswas safe and effective in practice. What broke this consensus was the convergence of the history ofethylmercury with the parallel his-tory of methylmercury in the mid-1990s. This story, known better to environmental scientists thanvaccinologists, evolved in a direc- tion that eventually suggested thateven relatively low exposures toorganic mercury could be danger-ous to the fetus and young infant. METHYLMERCURY AND THE DEVELOPING BRAIN Methylmercury, the form of mercury linked most closely inthe public mind with environmen-tal pollution, has a history as pub-lic and infamous as the history ofethylmercury has been quiet andinconspicuous. Much in thethimerosal debate hinges on thealleged similarity, or dissimilarity,of ethylmercury to methylmer-cury. The two compounds soundalike, differ by only one methy-lated side chain in their structure,and tend to be mentioned inter-changeably in the popular press.Yet the chemical distinction is not trivial; it may be compared withthat between ethanol (the form ofalcohol in wine) and its highlylethal counterpart methanol.Methylmercury was once usedwidely in developing countries asa fungicide as part of the \"GreenRevolution\" that transformed agri- culture after 1945. It is also syn-thesized by bacteria living in mercury-polluted waters, where itis passed up the food chain and concentrated in fish. The dangersof methylmercury in both con-texts have been vividly demon-strated in a series of environmen-tal disasters. The first and best remembered of these took place in the fishingcommunity of Minamata Bay,Japan. In the early 1950s, theChisso chemical company con-structed a factory that began ex-pelling large quantities of effluentinto the bay. The area's inhabi-tants soon began witnessing a va-riety of disturbing events. Seagullsfell from the sky, dead fishwashed ashore, and frenzied cats were seen whirling in a mad dance ending in death. Soonthereafter, doctors began seeingpatients with a staggering gait,numbness in the hands and feet,and more profound neurologicalimpairments. A new form of viralencephalitis was initially sus-pected. An investigation by Ku-mamoto University, however,pointed instead to the similarity ofthe symptoms to those describedin an obscure 1940 case report offour workers in a manufacturingplant producing methylmercuryas a seed disinfectant. Bacteria inthe bay, the researchers con-cluded, had converted inorganicmercury discharged from theplant into methylmercury. 22 The Minamata Bay disaster became one of the definingevents in the rise of environmen-tal awareness of the toxic effectsof mercury. The Chisso companylong resisted pressure to imp rove its discharge system, and victimscontinued to appear in the1960s both in Minamata and in Niigata, Japan, the site of a sec-ond outbreak. Only in 1968 didthe Japanese government releasea formal statement implicatingmethylmercury in the outbreaks.A series of lawsuits began American Journal of Public Health |February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 246 |Public Health Then and Now |Peer Reviewed |BakerPUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW shortly thereafter that would last until the end of the century. Themagnitude of the disaster re-mains hard to determine, but asof 2003, over 2265 patientshad been certified to have hadMinamata disease. 23The specta- cle was brought to Americaneyes in the 1960s on the pagesof Lifemagazine through the poignant work of documentaryphotographer and activist W. Eu-gene Smith. 24 Some of Smith's most enduring images depicted children withmercury poisoning, some ofwhom, born to asymptomaticmothers, had been exposed inutero. Here was the first indica-tion that the fetus was more vul-nerable than the adult. \"congenital andsevere mental deficiency. So greatwas the shame associated with the syndrome, however, that in-vestigators had a great deal of dif- ficulty enrolling patients for for-mal studies. 25 Tragically, a still greater disas- ter soon provided researchers an-other opportunity. In Iraq in 1971and 1972, an estimated 6530farmers and family memberswere hospitalized for methylmer- cury poisoning, of whom 459died. The source was homemadebread derived from seed wheatthat had been contaminated byfungicide. 26Extensive study of the Iraqi victims provided the basisfor the first standards definingsafe organic mercury exposure foradults. Specifically, the FDA drewupon this data, as well as a varietyof animal studies and reportsfrom other mercury poisoning in-cidents, when it proposed in the1970s an acceptable daily intake of 0.4 \u00b5g per kg of body weightper day, based on the threshold atwhich paresthesia occurs in adults. 27 Determining safe exposure for the fetus and newborn provedmuch more challenging. 28At an early point, investigators in Iraqidentified cases of severe congeni-tal mercury poisoning character-ized by profound retardation andspasticity similar to those that hadbeen described in Japan. 29Only gradually did it become apparentthat these infants represented theextreme of a continuum of toxic-ity. The first published studies ofapparently asymptomatic Iraqi in-fants exposed to intrauterine orpostnatal (through breastmilk)methylmercury were reassuring,with tests revealing normal devel-opment at age 1 year. As surveil-lance of these children continuedinto the 1980s, however, a dis-proportionate number began toshow signs of delays in languageacquisition. 30The probability that mercury might be analogous tolead, which was also shown tohave more subtle yet real cogni-tive effects by researchers in thesame time period, was becomingmore compelling. 31 Two major longitudinal studies were launched during the 1980s in the hope of answering whetherrelatively low maternal methyl- mercury exposures could result inany degree of neurological injuryto the fetus. Both were conductedin isolated island populations con-suming large quantities of fish.The first, based in the Seychellesin the Indian Ocean, used globalmeasures such as overall IQ andthe Denver DevelopmentalScreening test, whereas the sec-ond, based in the Faroe Islandsin the North Atlantic, employedmore-specialized, domain-relatedtests of function. The two studies produced dif- ferent results. The Seychelles chil-dren did not appear to suffer anyadverse outcomes. By contrast, the Faroe children demonstrateddeficits in language, attention, andmemory at age 7 years. It is un-clear whether these differencesreflect testing strategies, different genetic vulnerabilities, or thesource of mercury. The Faroe Is-landers consumed mercury inmore of a \"bolus\" fashion in theform of meals, including pilotwhale blubber, which is heavilycontaminated with pol-lutants and pesticides.Still, more-specific types oftesting in the Faroes led many en-vironmental experts to give theresults there precedence. 32,33 The stage was now set for the confusing array of advisory rec-ommendations on methylmercurythat emerged in the 1990s. Agen-cies differed with respect to di-recting recommendations at adults or pregnant women, bal-ancing the conflicting data for theSeychelles and Faroes, and deter-mining how much of an uncer-tainty factor to take into accountthe extent to which individualsmay metabolize mercury differ-ently. As of 1999, the FDA con-tinued to set its acceptable dailyintake at 0.4 \u00b5g per kg of bodyweight per day, the standard pro- posed for adults in the 1970s. Itnoted that this figure should prob-ably be set lower for pregnantwomen. By contrast, the Environ- mental Protection Agency in1994 lowered its reference dose for methylmercury exposure to0.1 \u00b5g per kg of body weight perday on the basis of the Iraqi dataon women and children. To makethe situation still more confusing,the Agency for Toxic Substancesand Disease Registry lowered itsminimal risk level to 0.1 \u00b5g perkg of body weight per day in1994, only to raise it back to 0.3 \u00b5g per kg of body weight per February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 |American Journal of Public Health Baker |Peer Reviewed |Public Health Then and Now |247PUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW day in 1999, prioritizing the Sey- chelles over the Faroes studies.34 Beyond the discrepancy be- tween official recommendations,two other points deserve em-phasis. First, there was anemerging consensus among en-vironmental scientists that thefetus was indeed more sensitiveto methylmercury than the adultand that this toxicity was betterexpressed as a continuum than aclear-cut syndrome. The secondpoint is that this concern had todo with relatively subtle cognitiveand language delays, detectable inolder children through domain-specific testing. Autism was noteven discussed. It was not de-scribed among either the pro-foundly injured children in disas-ters such as Minamata Bay andIraq or the milder delays de-scribed in the Faroes. Autism onlyentered the discourse in 1999,represented by a third set of com- munities with their own historicalmemories. AUTISM AND ITS HISTORIES The hypothesis that thimerosal- containing vaccines could explainthe remarkable rise in the preva-lence of autism arose not amongenvironmental scientists butamong the communities that haveemerged over the past 20 yearsof parents and professionals car-ing for autistic children. 35Specifi- cally, parents and clinicians whohave framed autism in biomedicalterms (such as immune or gas-trointestinal dysfunction) havebeen critical agents in promotingboth the concept of the \"autism epidemic\" and the primacy of vac-cines as its cause. The passion be-hind their arguments stems froma long history of advocacy on be-half of their children, often in theface of psychiatric theories per-ceived as \"parent blaming\" and in-adequately funded developmentaland educational resources inmany communities. The psychoanalyst Leo Kanner first coined the term \"autistic\" in aclassic 1948 case report of 11children exhibiting what he char-acterized as \"an extreme autisticaloneness\" shutting out all socialcontact, as well as an \"obsessivedesire for the maintenance ofsameness\" in their play and dailyroutines. The typical autistic child in his series eventually acquiredlanguage but used it in a mechan-ical way devoid of emotion, some-times combined with striking rotememory. One preschool childcould recite 25 questions of thePresbyterian Catechism, another could distinguish 18 symphoniesfrom one another. Kanner (alongwith his contemporary Hans As-perger, who described a similarsyndrome in 1944) was especiallystruck that all the children wereborn to highly intelligent par-ents. 36Over the next two decades, autism researchers such as BrunoBettelheim developed an explic-itly Freudian explanation to ac-count for the association: autismarose in infancy in response to by an emotionally distant(although typically well-educated)parent\u2014a so-called \"refrigeratormother.\" 37In 1965, psychologist Bernard Rimland (himself the father of anautistic child) rejected the psy-chogenic model of autism in hisground-breaking Infantile Autism , proposing that the condition wasinstead rooted in biology. 38The collapse of the psychoanalyticmodel gave rise, however, to tworather different explanatory frameworks in its place. The waysin which these have diverged andhave been embraced by differentcommunities of parents and pro-fessionals is of critical importanceto understanding the current de-bate over the existence of anautism epidemic. What might be characterized as the \"mainline\" community ofautism researchers has reconcep-tualized autism as a neurodevelop-mental condition. 39Four tenets have characterized most ap-proaches by these researchers.First, the cause of autism is funda-mentally biological and no moreattributable to parental behaviorthan is cerebral palsy or Downsyndrome. Although the nature ofthe cause remains unknown, a va-riety of studies (ranging from radi-ographic imaging to genetic twinstudies and family pedigree analy-sis) have increasingly highlightedthe importance of genetics. 40Sec- ond, autism is conceptualized as aspectrum of disorders. In the1970s, investigators modified Kan- ner's original restrictive diagnosisto encompass children withgreater intellectual and languageimpairment and then expanded itin the opposite direction to en-compass higher-functioning chil-dren with labels such as \"perva-sive developmental disorders\" and\"autistic spectrum disorders.\" 41 Third, if autism represents a spectrum disorder rooted in biol-ogy as proffered in the first twotenets, its treatment must belargely rehabilitative rather than\"\"In 1965, psychologist Bernard Rimland (himself the father of an autistic child) rejected the psychogenic model of autism in his ground-breaking Infantile Autism ,proposing that the condition was instead rooted in biology.38The collapse of the psychoanalytic model gave rise, however, to two rather different explanatory frameworks in its place. American Journal of Public Health |February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 248 |Public Health Then and Now |Peer Reviewed |Bakercommunity of autism research. This approach viewed autism inbiomedical terms. Rather thanviewing autism as a continuum ofdisability, it characterized the con-dition as a heterogenous collec-tion of discrete entities with differ-ent etiologies sharing a commonpresentation. Most importantly,this viewpoint offered hope thatat least some forms of autism arenot simply treatable, but curable.Many such cures have been pro-posed. Among the most popularwere those focusing on special diets, based on studies suggestingthat an abnormality in intestinalpermeability (a \"leakygut\") may admit intestinal toxinsor opioids affecting the nervoussystem at an early age. Althoughpromoted by researchers whoviewed themselves as \"dissident\"with respect to mainline thinking,these theories recast autism asbiomedical in origin and poten-tially curable in ways that pro-foundly reflected late 20th-century American hopes in thepower of medical technology. 45 The most notable organization promoting this framework is theAutism Research Institute in SanDiego, Calif, which through itsDefeat Autism Now! conferencesand educational materials seeks toprovide parents with the tools tounderstand and treat their ownchild. Parents provide much of theleadership and energy in this andrelated organizations. A smaller cadre of professionals participateas well, some of whom are veryprominent in their own right. TheAutism Research Institute wasorganized with the full support ofpsychologist Bernard Rimland,who had earlier played such apivotal role in dethroning the psy-chogenic approach. 46 It was among these parental advocacy groups, not the medicalor educational professions, thatthe notion of an autism \"epi- demic\" first took root. These or-ganizations provided a context tobring parents out of isolation andinto a realization that others\u2014many others\u2014shared their hopesand frustrations. Against thisbackground, an alarming possibil-ity became more plausible: thecause of autism was not only bio-logical but environmental, theconsequence of some new expo-sure faced by young children. In-deed, it seemed fair to speak ofan autism epidemic as a means ofsummoning the sense of urgencythe situation required. In 1998, British gastroenterolo- gist Andrew Wakefield proposeda hypothesis linking the \"leakygut\" etiologic framework ofautism to a new environmentalfactor explaining its rise. In thatyear, he published a report de- scribing a small number of pa-tients and diarrhea followingtheir measles-mumps-rubella im-munization. 47Wakefield's study launched a major controversy inBritain, despite the failure of largeepidemiological studies to confirmits results. 48Aided by the Internet, the controversy soon crossed theAtlantic and was viewed withconcern by many parents of autis-tic children as well as the parallelnetwork of parent groups oppos-ing compulsory immunization.Both groups gained a powerfulally when Congressman Dan Bur-ton (D, Ind) began a series of con-gressional hearings on autism andvaccine safety after his own grandchild was diagnosed withautism following the 12-monthvaccinations. 49 By 1999, a growing body of ar- ticulate and well-organized parentsof autistic children were set on atrajectory destined to collide withthat of the vaccine community.Their collective experience hadPUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW curative. For example, EricSchopler of the University ofNorth Carolina developed the in-fluential TEACCH (Teaching andEducation of Autistic and relatedCommunication-handicappedChildren) program as a modelcombining parental education andtherapy to assist parents in under-standing their children prior tosetting realistic management ap-proaches. 42Fourth, as with other developmental disorders, early re-ferral and intervention offer thegreatest hope for a positive out-come. Many autism researchersand parent allies have workedtirelessly to promote screeningtools and special education pro-grams in the schools. In 1991,autism was officially added to thelist of covered disabilities in theIndividuals with Disabilities Edu-cation Act passed the precedingyear, providing a major boost to its diagnosis and early treatment. 43 The essential point to under- stand is that the rise of autism di-agnoses in the 1990s was exactlywhat the mainline researchers ex-pected. 44It represented the logical consequence of their ongoing ef-forts to expand its definition andpromote its recognition in devel-opmental evaluation centers andthe schools. What perhaps wasnot expected, and certainly notwelcome, was the gap that fre- quently appeared between thesupply of and rising demand forautistic services. All too often, par-ents confronted with their child'sdiagnosis in the 1990s were metwith long waiting lists and pri-mary care doctors who seemedbarely familiar with the condition.Placed in this predicament, par- ents not surprisingly turned toone another and the Internet. Parents frustrated by the main- line approach to autism werelikely to meet what might becharacterized as the \"alternative\" February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 |American Journal of Public Health Baker |Peer Reviewed |Public Health Then and Now |249PUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW taught them the importance of chal- lenging conventional wisdom andexpertise. Many were highly capableindividuals, such as Rick Rollens, anassociate of California GovernorGray Davis (and, again, the fatherof an autistic child), who persuadedthe legislature to fund millions ofdollars for autism research at theUniversity of California at Davis, aswell as a study examining the histor- ical trend in children receivingservices for autism in the state'spublic school system. 50Released on March 1, 1999, the report indi-cated that the rate of autism hadincreased 273% over the past 10years. Reported widely in the press, the California Department of Devel-opmental Services study gave newurgency to calls for investigation ofan autism \"epidemic\" as the sum-mer approached. 51 CONFLUENCE The events that would bring these three histories togetherbegan in 1997, when New JerseyRepresentative Frank Pallone, rep- resenting a district concerned about environmental mercury poi-soning, appended a rider to theFDA Modernization Act of that year to assess all of the agency's products for mercury content. 52In response, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER) at the FDA initiated a formal riskassessment of thimerosal in vac-cines beginning in April 1998. Bythis point, the vaccine schedulehad expanded, and three of thevaccines routinely given to infants (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular per-tussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, and hepatitis B) po-tentially contained thimerosal.The analysis was completed inthe spring of 1999. The actualcumulative exposure varied con-siderably, given that not all manu-facturers used the preservative,but the CBER scientists calculated that a minority of infants couldreceive as much as 187.5 mg of ethylmercury during the first 6months of life. Lacking any stan-dard for ethylmercury, the CBERteam compared this exposure tostandards for methylmercury anddiscovered that it exceeded thatset by the Environmental Protec-tion Agency. Although acknowl-edging the many uncertainties in-volved, the FDA responded by inviting vaccine advisory bodiesfor consultation in June 1999. 53 There followed a rapid series of meetings and conference calls in-volving representatives of the American Academy of Pediatricsand the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC), culmi-nating in a joint statement releasedon July 9, 1999. Although notingthat there was no evidence thatthe use of thimerosal as a vaccinepreservative had caused any trueharm, the groups agreed that\"thimerosal-containing vaccinesshould be removed as soon as pos-sible\" given the concerns raised bythe Environmental ProtectionAgency's guidelines. 54The contro- versy was now out in the open. Many have criticized the proc- ess leading to the release of thejoint statement, charging that ittook place too rapidly and with-out proper consultation from im-portant parties. 55Its call to sus- pend the use of hepatitis B virusvaccine in infants younger than 6 months until thimerosal-free vac-cine became widely available wasparticularly contentious. Althoughthe ban lasted only for severalmonths, it resulted in considerableconfusion and inconsistency inhepatitis B virus vaccine deliveryin some hospital nurseries. 56One study later found that the propor-tion of hospitals failing to vacci-nate infants born to seropositivemothers rose by over 6 times(from 1% to 7%) during the sus- pension. 57The consequences of this were harder to calculate butclearly worrisome given the veryhigh (up to 90%) chance that in-fants who acquire hepatitis B in-fection at birth will develop theinfection in a chronic form, with asignificant (25%) risk of liver can-cer. 58By contrast, the statement's defenders asserted the prime im-portance of preserving the pub-lic's trust in the vaccine system,particularly given the rising influ-ence of populist \"vaccine safety\"groups since the 1970s. Manufac-turers, moreover, did successfullymobilize to remove thimerosalfrom their routine infant vaccinesin a remarkably short time; the ef-fort was largely complete by thesummer of 2001. 59,60 Meanwhile, the third of the his- torical streams, represented byparents within the \"alternative\"autism community, rapidly en-tered the debate. As detailed byjournalist David Kirby, it was infact a group of parents of autisticchildren (rather than parental or-ganizations critical of vaccinationsuch as the National Vaccine In-formation Center) who first seizedupon thimerosal as an explana-tion for the autism epidemic. Inkeeping with their identity as par-ticipants in shaping research,some spent long hours on thecomputer or in libraries research-ing studies on mercury. Eventu-ally, their efforts led to a pub-lished study in Medical Hypotheses that compared the features ofautism to various signs reportedin past studies and case reports ofmercury exposure. 61The publica- tion of this study in turn helped tolegitimize the hypothesis andthereby reinforce a growing bodyof individual testimonies acrossthe Internet and in conferences. Parents organized effectively in the political realm as well. The American Journal of Public Health |February 2008, Vol 98, No. 2 250 |Public Health Then and Now |Peer Reviewed |BakerPUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND NOW self-designated \"Mercury Moms\" created an advocacy organization,Safe Minds. They were instrumen-tal in persuading CongressmanBurton to shift his focus frommeasles-mumps-rubella tothimerosal in his congressionalhearings. And they organized suc-cessfully to oppose a rider to theHomeland Security Bill in 2003that would protect thimerosal'smanufacturer from legal action. 62 These events are chosen among many that have takenplace since 1999 that illustratethe polarization that soon charac-terized the entire debate. Al-though a full analysis cannot beprovided here, two themes de-serve emphasis. One is the issueof trust. Physicians and publichealth leaders have generallyturned to the scientific process tosort out the controversy and havebeen reassured by the negativeconclusions of the IOM reports.Vaccine opponents have repeat- edly rejected these studies, charg-ing that the data have been ma-nipulated for political reasons. 63 The second factor has been theentry of personal injury lawyersinto the debate, accompanied byfull-page advertisements in promi-nent newspapers and an infusionof financial support. Althoughhardly the primary agent in thestory, litigation has without doubtfueled the polarization of the de-bate and further obscured scien-tific testimony through the pro-motion of expert witnessesdissenting from the IOM posi-tion. 64Today, the mercury-autism hypothesis continues to be ac- cepted widely among the parentsof autistic children. CONCLUSION At this point, it is fair to ask whether this narrative shouldmore properly have focused onthe story of the thimerosal contro- versy since 1999. Has not a new group of actors, including mem-bers of Congress, professionalgroups, antivaccine organizations,and personal injury lawyers, as-sumed central relevance since thattime? Is it really that necessary tounderstand the long-term histori-cal trends that converged justprior to the 1999 joint statement? There are three answers, each corresponding to one of the his-torical streams already examined.The first is directed at the insinua-tion prevalent on the Internet thatthimerosal was a dubious productsmuggled into vaccines by avari-cious drug companies bent onprofits rather than the welfare ofchildren. A more sober assess-ment would suggest thatthimerosal was the result of ethi-cal scientific and corporate re-search in the 1920s and 1930s,specifically to improve vaccinesafety. Despite questions regard-ing its efficacy, it has performedwell in practice and posed toxicity so low as to be considered negligi-ble until recent years. The second point concerns the history of mercury poisoning.Central to the public story ofthimerosal has been a battle overthe meaning of \"mercury.\" Thosein the scientific community take itas axiomatic that all forms of mer-cury are not created equal; in par-ticular, there are good reasons tobelieve that the ethylmercury usedin vaccines is very different fromthe methylmercury studied in en-vironmental science. In public dis-course, however, such distinctionsare subsumed under a single en-tity, mercury, with a long and verypublic history. Perhaps unfairly,history has endowed mercury inall of its forms with a notorietythat is not easy to erase, as willquickly be discovered by any pe-diatrician trying to convince ananxious mother that a \"trace\" of mercury in a vaccine is safe. Onecannot simply brush aside thisperception in constructing policy. Finally, however important per- sonal injury lawyers, vaccine skep-tics, and their allies in Congressmay have been in shaping thethimerosal cont roversy since 1999, they did not create it. Par- ents within the \"alternative\" wingof the autism community were theprimary agents in popularizing theconcepts that autism had becomeepidemic and that vaccines wereits cause. Jumping from the first tothe second proposition may havebeen highly conjectural, but thequestion of whether the rise inautism is real or defined (or both)remains open to reasonable de- bate. There is genuine anger inthe autism community that has fu-eled the polarization of thethimerosal debate, but this angeris best understood in terms offrustration with the medical andeducational systems, not the cyni-cal manipulation of lawyers. Although historical understand- ing may not readily translate intopolicy guidelines, it is essential forthose responsible for conductingand implementing such policy. Apolarized debate both draws uponand contributes to polarized un-derstandings of history. Partici-pants within each of this story'sthree streams judged the samedata using different sets of as-sumptions, each shaped by his-tory. Articulating and sharingthese narratives represent a firststep toward transcending thepowerful boundaries shapingtoday's vaccine controversies.
