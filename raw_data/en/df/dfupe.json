In general, people do not visit a doctor until there is a serious issue or disease, this is why Traditional Chinese Medicine looks beyond the walls of traditional clinics to investigate and help treat certain chronic conditions to reverse them when possible. So, what is Traditional Chinese Medicine? To answer questions that we are frequently asked we have spoken to our TCM educators at SITCM, who have been teaching the [Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.sitcm.edu.au/he-courses/bachelor-of-traditional-chinese-medicine/) at our Sydney-based institute. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) holistically approaches several issues to help alleviate problems such as pain, IBS, colitis, infertility, neuropathy, arthritis, insomnia, stress and depression. This includes the acute and chronic phases of these issues. TCM has a long history of treating numerous conditions through a range of treatments that come under the umbrella of TCM, such as acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Chinese herbal dispensing, and biomedical sciences. All of these treatments are taught in the various courses offered at SITCM, with a teaching clinic that provides hands-on experience for students under staff supervision since herbal dispensing requires in-depth knowledge of hundreds, if not thousands, of herbs used in TCM. Of our patients, many are attracted to TCM because they believe natural remedies to be healthier while others seek treatment after they find no success with Western doctors. Is TCM suited for everyone? TCM is not exclusive for any ethnic group or demographics. It has been used all over the world by different people for various purposes. From our experience, we believe that Western medicine is crucial for emergencies but that TCM has an important role to play for chronic conditions. Why herbal dispensing? Herbs are great for not only treating symptoms but also boosting nutrition in the body thanks to their antioxidants, immune boosters, adaptogens and anti-inflammatories. TCM has been popular for many years, especially since celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Michael Phelps have been publicly vocal about the benefits of its role in their lives. A good first step to take for those who are looking for TCM treatments is to start their research about the benefits of the various treatments and how they can benefit from them.
