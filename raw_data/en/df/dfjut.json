These factors combine to form unique local practice characteristics, regional clinical trends and national characteristics. Definition of general practice The term 'general practice' is not consistently used in international literature. The terms family m edical practitioner, family physician and family doctor are also used. In Australia, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners defines general practice as follows: General practice is the provision of primary continuing comprehensive whole pati ent medical care to individuals, families and their communities.1 General practice involves the ability to take responsible action on any medical problem the patient presents , whether or not it forms part of an ongoing doctor -patient relationship. In managing the patient, the clinician - called general practitioner in Australia - may make appropriate referral to other doctors, health care professionals and community services. General practice as a speciality in Australia In Australia, general practice is recognised as a specialty by a range of criteria including by statute. A number of key events have lead to the recognition of general practice as a specialty in Australia: in 1978, the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee stated that 'general practice is a specific and defined discipline in medicine' in 1989, general practice was established as a specialty with the introducti on of the vocational register of recognised general practitioners2 in 1999, the Australian Medical Council (AMC) developed a model to assess recognition of medical specialti es and recognised general practice as one of the then 17 medical specialties in Australia.3 Since 1989, changes to the Health Insurance Act 1973 have led to the establishment of a separate listing of general practitioners who met the RACGP training, experience and assessment requirements. As a result of the legislation and further changes: Fellows of the RACGP are specialists as they have met the RACGP requirement s for entry into the specialty of general practice recognised general practitioners are specialist as they have met the RACGP requirements prior to the cutoff date in 1995 for vocational registration since 1996, Fellowship of the RACGP is the minimum sta ndard of entry into unsupervised general practice and the only route to recognised general practice. In 2003, the AMC, in line with its national processes for the review and accreditation of specialist education and training programs, accredited the RACGP education and training programs for general practitioners.4 A third group of nonspecialists practice in the specialty of general practice, but are not Fellows of the RACGP or recognised general practitioners and are not specialists. Generally these doctors are referred to as 'other medical practitioners' or nonvocational registered general practitioners. General practice: core char acteristics and practices General practice has a core set of clinical characteristics and practices, unique within medicine. These characteristics and practices are defined by the general practice curriculum developed and maintained by the RACGP and reflec ted in the standards set for clinical practice and the award of Fellowship of the college (FRACGP). General practice training, as determined by the standards set and maintained by the RACGP, is intended to equip graduates with both core clinical skills an d the ability to assess and address the learning needs arising from differing clinical contexts over a professional lifetime. In addition, general practitioners may need to develop, maintain and expand skills as supervisors/teachers, mentors, researchers a nd leaders over their professional lifetime. National health priorities The Australian Government has established national goals, targets and strategies for better health outcomes into the next century.5 These focus on the prevention, early detection and management of specific chronic problems including: cardiovascular health cancer control injury prevention and control mental health diabetes asthma musculoskeletal condi tions renal disease. General practitioners need to be aware of the Australian Population Health Development Principal Committee (APHDPC) and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), which incorporates the National Public Health Partne rship, which previously brought Australian Government and States together on public health issues. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and the Australian Population Health Development Committee will advise all Australian jurisdictions in t he integration of prevention across all aspects of chronic disease management, and in bringing a greater focus to health protection. Issues identified include: controlling communicable diseases (including immunisation, HIV/AIDS Hepatitis C programs) bioterrorism and pandemic preparedness environmental health nutrition physical activity injury prevention child, youth and mothers' health chronic disease prevention Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health health of prisoners.

Definition of curriculum This publication, the RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice ('the curriculum'), details what vocational general practitioners need to learn throughout their general practice learning life. This curriculum details the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for: competent, unsupervised general practice general practitioners to be able to meet their community's health care needs general practitioners to be able to support current national health priorities and the future goals of the Australian health care system. This curriculum is an essential reference for general practice registrars, general practice supervisors, medical educators, regional training providers and anyone involved in implementing the training of future general practitioners. For this reason, this curriculum also details learning objectives for medical students and prevocational doctors who will eventually become general practitioners. T he acquisition of these skills will also be of interest to many medical specialities. The curriculum emphasises self directed learning, the development of critical self reflection and lifelong learning skills, and the maintenance of professional practice s tandards. Training placements are undertaken in RACGP -accredited posts. These include both community based practices and hospital based posts. In general practice posts, general practice registrars (ie. participants in the Training Program) are assigned a general practice supervisor who provides onsite supervision, guidance and feedback. Other general practice teachers acting in the roles of medical educators, external clinical teachers, GP mentors and training advisors provide additional teaching, suppor t and feedback throughout training. Curriculum development The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice was developed after taking into account: the discipline of general practice as a medical speciality what general practitioners need to know (' the domains of general practice') the lifelong learning needs of general practitioners (from medical student through to prevocational doctor, vocational training and containing professional development) the reasons most people have for seeking the servic es of a General Practitioner ('common patient presentations') the health needs and priorities of Australia's population (national health priorities). The common learning objectives were developed using this framework, as were the specific learning objectives in the curriculum statements that relate to various population groups and aspects of general practice. Individual curriculum statements are grouped under four headings, depending on whether they relate to: problems patients populations processes of care. The teaching and learning approaches and feedback and assessment mechanisms will be found in the learning resources for the RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice. 'Star of general practice' and development of new curriculum framework Combining the domains of general practice with lifelong learning provides a powerful con ceptual framework for positioning the RACGP Curriculum for General Practice in the Australian clinical context in which the knowledge and skills are applied. Diagrammatically, this can be represented as the 'Star of general practice' (see Figure 3). This framework enables educators to flexibly train general practitioners across the diverse and wide range of clinical presentations, which vary according to social, demographic, cultural and epidemiological circumstances. Even though local practice chara cteristics, regional clinical trends or national characteristics may vary, this model provides a common ground for the essential discipline of general practice knowledge across the learning life cycle and domains of general practice. Figure 3. The 'star of general practice' provides a model of the discipline of general practice that meets the training requirements across the general practice learning life. The five domains of general practice The five domains of general practice represent the critical areas of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for competent unsupervised general practice. They are relevant to every general patient consultation. This RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice bases lifelong teaching and learning on these domains. They are: Domain 1 - Communication skills and the patient -doctor relationship - eg. communication skills, patient centredness, health promotion, whole person care Domain 2 - Applied professional knowledge and skills - eg. physical examination and procedural skills, medical conditions, decision making Domain 3 - Population health and the context of general practice - eg. epidemiology, public health, prevention, f amily influence on health, resources Domain 4 - Professional and ethical role - eg. duty of care, standards, self appraisal, teacher role, research, self care, networks Domain 5 - Organisational and legal dimensions - eg. information technology, records, reporting, confidentiality, practice management. The domains provide a comprehensive framework fo r ensuring that the key skill areas of general practice are included in education and training. \u0018Contents Definition 2 Rationale 3 The five domains of general practice 6 References 10The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice \u00a9 The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners 2007. All rights reservedCommon learning objectives\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives Definition The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice defines common learning objectives for general practice as those learning objectives which are relevant to consulting with all patients in unsupervised general practice. This statement provides the required common learning objectives for general practice and was first developed by the RACGP for its vocational training registrars in 1999.1 It has now been revised to represent the common learning objectives of all those preparing for, or practising in, general practice. Common learning objectives: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives Rationale The RACGP developed the common learning objectives after taking into account: what general pracitioners need to know (the domains of general practice) why most people seek the services of a general practitioner (common patient presentations) the health needs and priorities of Australia's population (national health priorities). The domains of general practice The domains of general practice represent the critical areas of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for competent unsupervised general practice. They are relevant to every patient interaction. Teaching and learning is based on the acquisitions of these key knowledge, skills and attitudes. The five domains of general practice are: Domain 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship: communication skills patient centredness health promotion, and whole person care. Domain 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills: physical examination and procedural skills. medical conditions. decision making. Domain 3. Population health and the context of general practice: epidemiology public health prevention family influence on health, and resources. Domain 4. Professional and ethical role: duty of care standards self appraisal teacher role research self care, and networks. Domain 5. Organisational and legal dimensions: information technology records reporting confidentiality, and practice management. Common learning objectives: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives Common patient presentations General practice primarily involves providing advice to individual patients in the diagnosis, treatment and management of medical conditions. General pracitioners manage the majority of medical presentations in the community. The curriculum reflects the type of patient presentations that come to the attention of a general practitioner and therefore highlights: problems which significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality common presentations which exemplify general practice presentations requiring special skills health problems which present differently in different population groups presentations with a public health significance health problems that have been shown to be preventable. National health priorities The Australian Government has established national goals, targets and strategies for better health outcomes into the next century.2 These focus on the prevention, early detection and management of specific chronic problems including: cardiovascular health cancer control injury prevention and control mental health diabetes asthma musculoskeletal conditions renal disease. General practitioners need to be aware of the Australian Population Health Development Principal Committee (APHDPC) and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), which incorporate the National Public Health Partnership and previously brought the federal and state governments together on public health issues.3 The AHPPC and APHDPC will advise all Australian jurisdictions in the integration of prevention across all aspects of chronic disease management, and bring a greater focus to health protection, especially pandemic readiness. Issues identified include: controlling communicable diseases (including immunisation, HIV/AIDS hepatitis C programs) bioterrorism preparedness environmental health nutrition physical activity injury prevention child, youth and mothers health chronic disease prevention Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health health of prisoners. For more information, see the RACGP curriculum statement: Population health. Common learning objectives: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives Common learning objectives: RationaleKey educational principles and concepts This curriculum is based on the following key educational concepts and principles: Needs focused training Directed toward meeting the health care needs and priorities of the Australian community. Learning as a continuum Integrates vocational training with undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education. Lifelong learning Encourages a commitment to continuous improvement of knowledge and skills throughout a general practitioner's learning life. Experiential learning Emphasises training as a supervised 'real world' clinical experience of consulting with patients presenting with the common and significant conditions which exemplify general practice. Purpose driven learning Clearly states purposes and curriculum requirements to enable learners make informed choices about learning pathways. Integrated training Balances and integrates experiential, information based and reflective learning. Adult learning Uses of models of learning based on a recognition of different learning styles and needs. Self directed learning Expects adult learners to exercise significant autonomy in making choices about their learning. Feedback Requires high quality and regular feedback to learners on their performance as an integral and critical part of the teaching and supervision. Assessment Regular assessment of learner achievement of curriculum learning objectives during and at the end of training to determine satisfactory completion of training requirements. \u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives The five domains of general practice - common learning objectives for general practice Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Good communication skills enable a general practitioner to develop a relationship with patients in order to understand both the illness and the patient's experience of that illness, and to move freely between clinical problem solving and the patient's experience of the problem. General practitioners who are competent in this domain will need to demonstrate: a critical appreciation of the nature of the relationship between patient and doctor and its therapeutic potential an understanding of different consultation models a patient centred approach the communication skills and attitudes needed to foster effective whole person care the skills to undertake effective individualistic and opportunistic health education and promotion. The minimum knowledge, skills and attitudes in this domain that the general practitioner needs to demonstrate are how to: establish rapport and be empathic with patients develop good listening and language skills appropriate to the patient adopt appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication styles for different situations (eg. emotional states, state of health, disadvantage, cultural background) elicit the patient's issues, problems and concerns engender confidence and trust (and advocate on the patient's behalf where appropriate) use body language and touch in an appropriate manner, to establish trust in a therapeutic relationship find common ground with patients about their problems and expectations negotiate an effective management plan and agree on respective responsibilities and limits with the patient and their family communicate effectively and appropriately with significant others (eg. partner and family) recognise opportunities for health promotion and education and respond appropriately to increase the patient's capacity for self care confirm the patient's understanding of the problem, management, advice and follow up. Applied professional knowledge and skills The application of professional knowledge and skills requires a comprehensive, patient centred approach. This applies not only to health and disease, but also to the individual's experience of illness in terms of their culture, family and community. This approach includes analysis of the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of all clinical interactions. General practitioners who are competent in this domain will need to demonstrate: a knowledge of significant medical conditions and approaches to undifferentiated problems skills in information gathering, physical examination, the undertaking of procedures, and clinical decision making a critical appreciation of the need for continuity and integration of care, cost effective investigations, rational prescribing, and the need to continually undertake critical self appraisal. The minimum knowledge, skills and attitudes in this domain that the general practitioner needs to demonstrate are how to: take a history and perform a physical examination relevant to presenting problems develop a working diagnosis from their knowledge and experience, and the information gathered Common learning objectives: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives critically use investigations, and interpret the results, to refine the working diagnosis recognise and manage the significantly ill patient consider the possibility of serious illness inherent in many common presentations competently manage common problems (including undifferentiated illness) negotiate, prioritise and implement management plans prescribe safely and cost effectively from an informed knowledge base use hospital and community based expertise, resources and networks effectively make valid and timely decisions about referral and follow up develop and maintain essential procedural skills recognise their own abilities and limitations, responding appropriately accept and manage uncertainty be critical and discriminating in the use of information from a variety of sources consistently apply universal precautions principles. Population health and the context of general practice Population health, in the context of general practice, is an essential component of primary health care. The general practitioner has an evolving role, with the potential to create change at the individual patient, practice, and community levels within the health care system. This requires knowledge of the sociopolitical, economic, geographical, cultural and family influences on the health of patient groups in their communities. General practitioners who are competent in this domain will need to: have an understanding of demographics, epidemiology, public health problems and health needs of special groups be aware of the patterns and prevalence of disease and be able to participate in population based preventive strategies have a critical appreciation of the impact on the health of the patient of their sociopolitical, economic, work, spiritual and cultural background and needs, and their relationships with family and significant others possess skills in advocacy and in using community resources appreciate the importance of a public health perspective in general practice. The minimum knowledge, skills and attitudes in this domain that the general practitioner needs to demonstrate are how to: elicit and take into account a patient's sociopolitical, economic, work, spiritual, linguistic and cultural background and needs, and their relationships with family and significant others in relation to their health understand and respond to the special needs and characteristics of their practice population, including: - disease prevention and health promotion - screening and recall systems - access and equity issues use a working knowledge of, and be involved in, assisting the health of the community locally, regionally and nationally, including: - participation in community based prevention and education strategies - accessing available health services - networking with other general practitioners, general practitioner organisations and health care providers - involvement in public health systems and strategies (eg. notifiable diseases and environmental issues) understand and utilise the Australian health care system (including its funding planning, services, policies and community resources). Common learning objectives: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives Professional and ethical role The general practitioner's professional and ethical role relates to their behaviour with respect to patients, colleagues and the community. Professional ethics are based on belief systems of the profession and the community. The three major components to this domain are: the special duty of care that arises when a patient-doctor relationship is established and the patient's needs involve the risk of injury. Doctors have a duty to exercise due care and skill to avoid any such injury and will become legally liable for the consequences of their own negligence reflective skills and self appraisal maintenance of professional standards that imply that all doctors have an obligation to keep abreast of and be informed about technical advances, new techniques, and new therapies appropriate to their field of medicine (or field in which they profess to have special skills). General practitioners who are competent in this domain will need to: exercise a special duty of care at all times strive to maintain professional standards of practice according to contemporary ethical principles have skills in reflection and professional self appraisal and be committed to lifelong learning and continuous professional improvement have the skills to fulfill their role as teacher, leader and change agent have an understanding of research, evaluation and audit skills develop professional networks and maintain their own wellbeing and that of their families. The minimum knowledge, skills and attitudes in this domain that the registrar needs to demonstrate are: special duty of care: - responsibility for the optimal care of patients (including acting on patient cues, respecting patient-doctor boundaries and confidentiality, recognising own limitations, ensuring appropriate reporting and follow up, and undertaking advocacy as appropriate) - respect for a patients' culture and values, and an awareness of how these impact on the therapeutic relationship - understand the rights of patients to access competent, compassionate care, to be fully informed, and their right to self determination reflective skills and self appraisal: - the capacity for self awareness, reflection and self appraisal - the skills of lifelong learning - basic skills in clinical audit, critical appraisal and critical incident analysis, and professional networks for personal and clinical support - time management and coping skills sufficient to maintain care of self and family maintenance of professional standards: - achieve and maintain professionally defined clinical practice standards - adhere to the professional codes of ethics - contribute to the development of general practice by gaining skills in areas such as teaching, research and evaluation. Common learning objectives: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Common learning objectives Organisational and legal dimensions The organisational and legal dimensions of general practice require that each practice be considered as an entity that delivers a clinical service to patients in its practice population and the community. There is a wide range of practice types, with common essential components. There are legal obligations that must be observed from both the business and service perspective. General practitioners who are competent in this domain will need to: ensure adequate arrangements are made for the availability and accessibility of care, and to ensure safety netting, screening and recall systems are in place have a critical appreciation of patient and practice information technology and management requirements, medical records and legal responsibilities, and reporting, certification and confidentiality requirements understand effective practice management principles and processes. The minimum knowledge, skills and attitudes in this domain that the general practitioner needs to demonstrate are: use of personal, organisational and time management skills in practice accurate and legible recordings of consultations and referrals, to enable continuity of care by general practitioners and other colleagues use and evaluation of practice management skills relating to: - patient access guidelines - staff management - teamwork - office policies and procedures - financial and resource management manage information and data systems relating to: - clinical standards, guidelines and protocols - medical records - information technology - communication and transfer of patient related information - screening, recall and related systems - access and confidentiality incorporate medicolegal knowledge and responsibilities relating to: - certification - confidentiality - legal report writing - prescribing - informed consent - duty of care - litigation work within statutory and regulatory requirements meet acceptable practice standards.

All rights reservedPhilosophy and foundation of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice Definition This foundation of general practice includes the philosophy, concepts and principles that define the roles of general practitioners and the discipline of general practice. This foundation defines: what is involved in being a general practitioner how this role is different to other disciplines within medicine the role of general practice in the lives of individual patients, their personal context, their communities and the health system. For medical students and prevocational doctors, an understanding of this foundation will improve understanding of the place and significance of general practice in their working life. For vocational trainees, this foundation will provide a framework for building a detailed and comprehensive understanding of their chosen profession of general practice. For established general practitioners, this foundation provides an external reference as a basis for reflection on the knowledge, skills and attitudes developed in training and from clinical experience. The philosophies, concepts, and principles of general practice permeate all aspects of general practice. The learning objectives of this statement should therefore be borne in mind in relation to all the priority learning areas. Philosophy and foundation of general practice: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice Rationale General practice is the primary focus of the health care system. General practitioners provide ongoing patient centred health care for all members of the community based on an understanding of health and illness as a uniquely personal experience, shaped by past experience, cultural, social and contextual dimensions. General practice manages patient health and illnesses grounded in knowledge from biomedical, psychosocial and intrapersonal perspectives. At both a systemic and consultation level, general practice is the interface between medicine and the community, science and humanity, evidence and creativity. Australian general practice in the twenty-first century is the continuation of a millennium long tradition of caring for the sick, and the central place of general practice will continue to evolve as part of a dynamic, diverse society, which it will reflect and influence. The discipline of general practice has evolved through historical, cultural, social, political and contextual influences, but certain core characteristics relating to the relationship between patient and doctor, and doctor and community have remained immutable over time. These include: the patient as the centre of concern the patient-doctor relationship as the basis of the therapeutic process the distinctive problem solving skills of general practitioners primary care management a holistic perspective to care comprehensive scope a community based context. The patient-centred approach to general practice care General practitioners have the breadth and depth of knowledge of disease as covered by this curriculum, but integrate this knowledge with an understanding that the presence or absence of disease does not necessarily correlate with a health to illness continuum, being patient focused, rather than disease focused. '...the kind of commitment I am speaking of implies that the physician will \"stay with\" a person whatever his problem may be, and he will do so because his commitment is to people more than to a body of knowledge or a branch of technology. To such a physician, problems become interesting and important not only for their own sake but because they are Mr Smith's or Mrs Jones's problem. Very often in such relations there is not even a very clear distinction between a medical problem and a nonmedical one. The patient defines the problem.'1 Managing complexity and uncertainty in general practice care The relationship general practitioners have with their patients, together with the importance of the context in which patients and their doctors live, mean that general practitioners need to be skilled in managing complexity and uncertainty. The challenge of managing complexity and uncertainty is also increased by the natural epidemiology of disease in the community and changes in the technology of medical care. Issues contributing to complexity and uncertainty in these areas include: early presentation of disease relatively infrequent occurrence of serious illness Philosophy and foundation of general practice: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice recognition, integration and management of multiple issues, often in a single consultation, but also over time influence of comorbidities on each individual health problem ongoing management of the increasing prevalence of chronic illness in the community ability to manage complex illness based on advanced and developing technologies constantly evolving boundaries between other health care providers and general practice based care, including issues of access and affordability, which may be practice and/or location specific understanding of the structure and the dynamics of the community collaboration with patients in drawing on and developing their self care skills. General practitioners as patient advocates in complex health systems In contrast to specialist practice, in which patients are selected to match the service provided, general practitioners need to be flexible and able to draw on an extensive range of knowledge and skills in meeting the health needs of individual patients, both in the short term and over a long professional relationship. General practitioners incorporate the expertise of other health care providers as appropriate, and this includes the essential role of acting as patient guide and advocate in an increasingly fragmented health care system. Good general practice primary care improves the health of populations Health systems firmly based on primary health care have been shown to achieve better health outcomes, improve health equality and are cost effective.2 Philosophy and foundation of general practice: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice Integrating the foundation skills of general practice into a comprehensive care approach - key principles The foundations of general practice need to be understood in the context of a complex, integrated totality that reflects the whole of the patient, their environment, and how these interact with each other. The following key principles are the specific skills necessary for quality general practice care. The quotes after the key foundation principle expresses this concept as a general practitioner might describe them, followed by the key skills required to demonstrate these principles. While the skills are listed individually, every element needs to be integrated into the whole of general practice to meet the aim of comprehensive care. The patient is the centre of concern 'It is important to know my patients. I am more concerned about patients as individuals than about the disease. I take my patients' beliefs, circumstances and concerns into account when deciding what to prescribe or when and where to refer them.' This principle requires general practitioners to: demonstrate respect for patient autonomy work in partnership with the patient as determined by the needs of the patient negotiate management plans in terms of the patient's preferences and priorities. The patient-doctor relationship is the basis of the therapeutic process 'It's important that patients can trust their general practitioner. Sometimes more good is done by just listening.'This principle requires general practitioners to: develop communication skills to underpin effective diagnosis and management, eg. listening, reassuring, explaining, interpreting develop effective communication skills to build and maintain a therapeutic relationship develop more specific counselling skills in different situations foster continuity of care as determined by the needs of the patient develop self awareness and boundaries. Distinctive problem solving skills 'I know the community. I know the \"horses and zebras\". I often need to juggle several problems at a time. General practice is an art and a science.' This principle requires general practitioners to: relate the diagnostic process to the community context, eg. disease prevalence recognise serious and urgent problems use time as a tool tolerate uncertainty collaborate with patients on acceptable management plans integrate comorbidities into management decisions use investigations and technology appropriately Philosophy and foundation of general practice: Integrating the foundation skills - key principles\u0018Curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice integrate scientific evidence and other relevant factors toward a solution move from one mode or role to another (eg. diagnostician, counsellor) as required by the problem at hand or by the patient's needs engage in reflective practice. Primary care management 'I am the first port of call. I have colleagues I can call on when I need to and I know the available services in the community.' This principle requires general practitioners to: deal with unselected and undifferentiated presentations triage appropriately work in teams integrate the expertise of other healthcare providers practice ongoing management of patients with chronic health problems. Holistic perspectives 'I know this patient's background and it really influences how he is suffering now. I also know whether he can afford treatment.' This principle requires general practitioners to: take into account social, psychological, cultural and existential dimensions be integrative rather than reductionist. Comprehensive scope 'You never know who walks through the door. General practice care is more than dealing with the presenting complaint. At times it's difficult to know where to start.' This principle requires general practitioners to: recognise that the range of patients not limited by age, gender, culture, or health problem diagnose and manage disease at any chronological stage in the process including: - health promotion - prevention - case finding - acute presentations - chronic illness - palliative care know how to diagnose and manage a broad range of health conditions across multiple systems diagnose and manage multiple morbidities or concerns in the one patient. Community based context 'I meet patients where they live and take our community into account when planning their care.' This principle requires general practitioners to: be limited only by what may be managed in the particular community (not just primary care) respond to the needs of community adapt to the political context mediate between medicine and community understand the private practice context work effectively within the health care system, eg. legal requirements for prescribing and legislative regulations. Philosophy and foundation of general practice: Integrating the foundation skills - key principles\u0018Curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice The five domains of general practice - philosophy and foundation of general practice Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship General practitioners need to: demonstrate respect for patient autonomy work in partnership with the patient as determined by the needs of the patient negotiate patient-centred management plans which consider the patient's preference of treatment and priority of treatments use communication skills to underpin effective diagnosis and management of the patient (eg. listening, reassuring, explaining, interpreting) use communication skills to build and maintain a therapeutic relationship between patient and doctor apply specific counselling skills in different situations foster continuity of care as determined by the needs of the patient move from one mode to another (diagnostician, counsellor) as required by the problem at hand or the patient's needs. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need to: relate the diagnostic process to the community context when problem solving recognise serious and urgent problems use problem solving skills to collaborate with patients on acceptable management plans integrate comorbidities when problem solving use investigations and technology appropriately when problem solving integrate scientific evidence and other relevant factors when problem solving manage unselected and undifferentiated presentations manage patients with chronic health problems have a holistic perspective that is integrative rather than reductionist be able to diagnose and manage a broad range of health conditions across multiple systems. Population health and the context of general practice General practitioners need to: have a holistic perspective, taking into account the patient's social, psychological, cultural and existential dimensions treat a wide range of patients not limited by age, gender, ethnicity or health problem be able to diagnose and manage disease at any chronological stage in the process including health promotion, prevention, case finding, acute presentations, chronic illness and palliative care be limited only by what may be managed in the particular community (not just primary care) respond to the needs of the community adapt to political priorities mediate between medicine and community.

These terms are contested and need to be considered in local contexts. The following definitions are offered as a way to understand these concepts in the context of this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Curriculum Statement. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting This phrase is used throughout this document to refer to any professional interactions with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, or to discussion about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health issues in any professional setting. Aboriginal community controlled health service Today there are community controlled health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) describes an aboriginal community controlled health service (ACCHS) as: 'a primary health care service initiated and operated by the local Aboriginal community to deliver holistic, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate health care to the community which controls it (through a locally elected Board of Management).'1 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health The National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party defined health as: 'Not just the physical well-being of the individual but the social, emotional, and cultural well-being of the whole community. This is a whole-of-life view and it also includes the cyclical concept of life-death-life.\"2 This is the definition used in this curriculum statement. Consistent with the holistic approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, as well as with the World Health Organization (WHO) model of primary health care,3 delivery of healthcare to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients is more than just a clinical service. The learning objectives in this curriculum statement reflect this approach of broader healthcare delivery by being closely linked across the domains of general practice, and by referencing the individual patient. Community control The 1989 National Aboriginal Health Strategy describes community control as: 'the community having control of issues that directly affect their community... Aboriginal people must determine and control the pace, shape and manner of change and decision-making at local, regional, state and national levels.' 2 Cultural advisor This term is used in this document to refer to those who provide advice to assist healthcare professionals working in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. Most commonly and appropriately these people will be Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Culture This term has a wide range of meanings but for the purposes of this document the following is used: 'Culture, for us, then, is more than \"a people's way of life\". Culture tells us what is pretty and what is ugly, what is right and what is wrong. Culture influences our preferred way of thinking, behaving and making decisions. Most importantly, culture is living, breathing, changing - it is never static.'4 Cultural safety This term describes: 'an outcome of health practice and education that enables safe service to be defined by those who receive the service.' 4The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Healthy Profession. www.racgp.org.au Healthy Australia. 3 Empowerment This term describes the state of being empowered.5 Empowerment cannot be 'given'. Individuals and groups can only empower themselves when they make informed choices, determine their own fates and acquire resources to support their decisions. Empowerment, then, is part and parcel of self determination.4 Partnership A term used in this document that refers to a mutually respectful relationship with equity that seeks to achieve agreed outcomes having regard to legal, ethical, cultural and policy considerations. Self determination This term is used to refer to: 'a process where Indigenous communities take control of their future and decide how they will address the issues facing them.' 6 Social determinants of health These are defined by the WHO as: 'The poor health of the poor, the social gradient in health within countries, and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services, globally and nationally, the consequent unfairness in the immediate, visible circumstances of people's lives - their access to health care, schools, and education, their conditions of work and leisure, their homes, communities, towns, or cities - and their chances of leading a flourishing life. This unequal distribution of health-damaging experiences is not in any sense a 'natural' phenomenon... Together, the structural determinants and conditions of daily life constitute the social determinants of health.' 7 In the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting this includes the processes of colonisation, dispossession, racism, marginalisation, oppression, stigmatisation, paternalism and prejudice. 8 World view This term is used in this document to describe the perception and experience of existence as shaped by the culture, history, spirituality, belief systems, and political and social interactions of the individual. Rationale The health of Australia's first peoples is this country's most pressing and important health priority. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people are among the most disadvantaged indigenous peoples in the developed world. 7,9,10 The available evidence suggests that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continue to suffer a greater burden of ill health than the rest of the population. Overall, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience lower levels of access to health services than the general population, are more likely than non- Indigenous Australian people to be hospitalised for most diseases and conditions, and are more likely to experience disability and reduced quality of life due to ill health, and to die at younger ages than other Australians. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people also suffer a higher burden of emotional distress and possible mental illness than is experienced by the wider community. 11 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health inequity occurs across all health indicators and many areas of health continue to worsen. Whilst there have been recent gains, the gap is widening as the health of other Australians improves faster. 12 General practitioners have a key service delivery role in addressing this inequity in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, either within an ACCHS or other GP settings. General practitioners are also important advocates in improving the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Australian governments have not only failed to deal with the ongoing consequences of The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Healthy Profession. www.racgp.org.au Healthy Australia. 4 colonisation but in some cases, they have actively promoted racism for political ends. Key health policies such as the National Aboriginal Health Strategy2 remain largely unimplemented.8 It is time that Australia dealt with its history of suppression and oppression of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in accordance with international best practice in the field of human rights. 8,13 It is time that the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including their inalienable rights to self determination and community control are not only recognised but given full expression. Empowerment is central to this critical process in the maturation of modern Australia. To overcome Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage requires political will and leadership. It requires the recognition of the profound, diverse and dynamic cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It requires the generous provision of appropriate and sustainable resources and the commitment of those in leadership roles in our community. To most effectively assume these roles of health service provision and advocacy, GPs require relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes. The National Aboriginal Health Strategy (1989) 2 recommends that: 'Tertiary institutions for undergraduate and postgraduate medical, nursing, and paramedical courses be approached to include the compulsory study of Aboriginal culture and history and health issues as part of formal course work,' also recommending that: 'Aboriginal people should be involved in the development and teaching of these units.' This is the guiding principle by which this document was developed. This curriculum statement sets out a framework of essential attitudes, skills and knowledge required by GPs in order for them to work respectfully and appropriately in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health settings and to advocate for equity in health and related outcomes with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The five domains of general practice - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Culturally safe communication skills are fundamental to the GP's effective engagement in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. There is a diversity of cultural beliefs and practices, world views and behaviours among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. General practitioners should respect and be sensitive to this. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' views of health and wellbeing differ to, and are more holistic than, those encapsulated by the biomedical model. They include diverse aspects such as social and emotional wellbeing, community relationships and connection to land. General practitioners who incorporate this into their practice will be better able to understand their Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients' needs and motivations. Trust plays a very important role in the development of a therapeutic relationship in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. A GP may find that they are unable to achieve their desired outcomes until a certain level of trust has been established. General practitioners working in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting must ensure at all times that they avoid a paternalistic approach when delivering healthcare. A partnership approach is more empowering and is more likely to lead to successful outcomes. Applied professional knowledge and skills 'Applied professional knowledge and skills', contains further learning objectives relevant to 'Communication skills and the doctor-patient relationship'. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to have a complex interaction of significant health issues including risk factors and medical conditions as well as underlying social and emotional issues. General practitioners require comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge and skills across the spectrum of these health issues.The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Healthy Profession. www.racgp.org.au Healthy Australia. 5 Management strategies should incorporate an understanding of the views of health and wellbeing, and the social determinants of health and their influence on health behaviours of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people and communities. They should be consistent with the comprehensive patient centred approach outlined in the RACGP Common learning objectives14 curriculum document. A key component of assessment and management in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting is recognising and incorporating the knowledge and skills of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander health workers, liaison officers and cultural advisers. The capacity to work in a multidisciplinary team partnership approach is a GP key skill for better health outcomes. There are related learning objectives in domains 4 and 5. Population health and the context of general practice Colonisation and government policy decisions have had and continue to have a profound effect on the wellbeing of past, current and future generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. General practitioners need to understand that the healthcare they deliver is affected by these policies and the social determinants they have influenced. General practitioners working in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting require a sound knowledge of the epidemiology of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and relevant preventive and other population health strategies. Family and community can have a powerful influence on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the healthcare of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people needs to be understood in the context of family and social relationships. Effective primary healthcare in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting requires the provision of equitable access to holistic healthcare that addresses the social determinants of health and the right to self determination. Professional and ethical role Cultural advice is a key component of working in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. Each GP needs to be conscious of their worldview and its influence on their work within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. This is an ongoing process across the learning life of the GP and includes openness to feedback from cultural advisors. Self care strategies are important in order for GPs to overcome the personal impact of the level of disadvantage and inequity in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. General practitioners have a role to play in advocating for their patient group and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health equity. In the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting, academic roles including those of teacher and researcher have the potential to contribute to reducing health inequalities. These roles require an awareness of ethical considerations specific to this setting. Organisational and legal dimensions There are many models of health service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The ACCHS model has a pivotal role in the delivery of primary healthcare to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and is an expression of self determination.The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Healthy Profession. www.racgp.org.au Healthy Australia. 6 Learning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Compare Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander views of health and wellbeing with the prevailing models of healthcare Define culturally safe communication with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people Demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and their relationship to identity in contemporary Australian society Explain the importance of establishing trust when communicating with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people Discuss the differences between a paternalistic approach to health service delivery and an empowering approach and demonstrate how they might influence outcomes in the provision of healthcare to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients.

All rights reserved\u0018Curriculum statement: Aged care Definition Aged care in general practice is the management and care of the health of the elderly. This definition of aged care does not imply debility, as most older people live active lives. Although aging is associated with increasing levels of disability, most older people have a positive view of their own health with the majority of Australians aged 65 years or older (70%) rating their health as either good, very good or excellent, while 30% report their health as being fair or poor.1 The term 'frail aged' is used to describe aged people in need of a substantial level of care and support. The definition of older varies between individuals, communities and cultures. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander peoples have a lower life expectancy than most other people living in Australia, and so people from such communities are likely to need aged care services earlier in life compared to the nonindigenous population.2 Aged care: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Aged care Rationale Australia has an aging population. By the year 2010, 14% of the population will be over the age of 65 years.3 Around 27% of general practice patient encounters are in adults aged 65 years and over, and general practitioners are seeing fewer children and an increasing proportion of older patients, particularly those aged 75 years or more.4 This presents significant challenges for clinical care, population health and economics of health care. The underlying pathologies among the elderly are the same as among the whole population, but at higher rates. However, there are specific issues in the diagnosis and management and the functional and social ability of elderly patients, eg: symptoms with no clearly identifiable aetiology altered patient presentations difficulties in cognition and communication multiple pathologies multisystem disease that often involves chronic disease management problems of polypharmacy decreased reserves in elderly people (physiological, psychological, financial) the importance of functional assessment and support sensory deficits such as impaired vision, hearing and balance nutrition, physical activity and continence the need to relate to carers, relatives and other health professionals the need to be aware of community resources the importance of continuity of care. A knowledge of the physiology and epidemiology of aging helps in managing the conditions that have special significance in the elderly, eg. dementia and atherosclerosis. General practitioners need to try to ensure that the appropriate continuity of care and coordination of management are provided to maintain older people in an optimal state of health in the best possible setting. Quality aged care in general practice requires: the ability to deal with and prioritise the numerous problems that the aged may present with, including associated diagnostic and management dilemmas feeling comfortable when working with the aged, their families, carers and friends positive attitudes toward empowering elderly patients to take an active part in maintaining their health recognising the special issues (including discrimination) facing older people from diverse backgrounds, including issues of gender differences, ethnicity, poverty and issues of sexuality, including sexual preference. Other curriculum areas Most other curriculum areas have implications for aged care, including: Acute serious illness and trauma for managing emergencies; Chronic conditions ; Mental health ; Multicultural health for successful crosscultural communication including the correct use of translators; Oncology ; Pain management ; Palliative care ; and Population and public health regarding disease prevention. Aged care: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Aged care The five domains of general practice - aged care Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Communication strategies need to promote comfortable discussion with aged people and accommodate patients with failing sight, hearing and mental capacities. Cultural and linguistic issues can affect patient-doctor communication, as many aged patients will not have English as their first language. Sensitivity is required when communicating with next of kin or carers, particularly in circumstances where the patient lacks the capacity to make an informed decision, or where there is a question of consent for treatment. In some cases, the patient care instructions will be given to carers rather than the patient. Clear direction and instructions are required for caregivers and residential aged care facility staff. Applied professional knowledge and skills The knowledge underlying aged care is the same as in other areas of medicine, although the context and goals of diagnosis and treatment may differ. Optimal care of elderly patients requires the generic background medical knowledge required for disease diagnosis and management, and an awareness of how this differs in the aged patient. This applies to diagnosis, management and prognosis, however, may be affected by the presence of altered presentations, comorbidities (and their treatments), and socioeconomic and cultural factors. Specific skill areas include the ability to: understand the biological and psychosocial processes of aging, and how this affects the interpretation of investigations and the metabolism of drugs consider and evaluate the role of screening, prevention and health promotion in aged patients diagnose and treat the classic geriatric syndromes such as confusion, falls, leg ulcers and incontinence be aware of the general practice implications of multiple pathological processes occurring simultaneously manage distressing symptoms, even in the absence of demonstrable pathology (eg. dizziness, isolation, constipation and dry skin) be aware of the concepts of care versus cure and the impact on quality of life consider the goal of maintaining functional status manage the wide range of conditions seen mainly in the aged (eg. dementia, congestive heart failure, Parkinson disease) manage the problems of polypharmacy, and the importance of systematic recording and review of medications make appropriate arrangements for care for the dying and for the bereaved is an important skill in the care of the aged perform or refer patients for appropriate practical procedures that are often used in the management of conditions common in the elderly. Population health and the context of general practice Familiarity with government policies that impact upon the aged5-7 and knowledge of the increased burden of disease in the elderly helps plan general practice aged care. These policies aim to promote health and to prevent and reduce the loss of function from illness, injury and disability. Changes in policy may have implications for general practice aged care. Rational prescribing practices (see Quality use of medicine guidelines8) that consider the cost and benefits of prescribing medications to individual patients helps incorporate public health initiatives into daily clinical practice. Health promotion and preventive care is becoming increasingly important in the elderly. The cost of different care options such as home support versus institutional care may influence general practice management options. Cultural and linguistic diversity, socioeconomic status, gender, family and Aged care: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Aged care community supports, and geographical location may affect the needs, acceptance and availability of services and activities for the aged. General practitioners need to be aware of the special services available to help meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Cultural differences, perceptions and expectations of aging may affect levels of carer responsibility and involvement. Comprehensive care plans are funded under government chronic disease plans and other initiatives. Assessment of carer stress allows early intervention including the possible need for respite care. Professional and ethical role Professional attitudes and age discrimination can affect the management of older patients. General practitioners need to work as part of a multidisciplinary team and understand the role, knowledge and skills of each member of the aged care team. Informed consent may be impaired in the elderly and the care of aged patients may involve carers, issues of power of attorney and regulatory administrative bodies such as guardianship boards. Informed consent may also involve discussing, formulating and documenting advanced care plans and decisions concerning the end of life. When evaluating the benefits and risks of proposed treatments, patients must not be denied useful treatment purely on the basis of age. General practitioners identifying elder abuse (including physical, psychological, social, financial, sexual abuse and neglect) have legal reporting responsibilities. Patient safety risks need close attention in the aged, especially in relation to inappropriate use of physical restraint, missed diagnoses due to failure to evaluate vague or unclearly expressed symptoms, and ensuring that patient information is as clear as possible. Organisational and legal dimensions General practice aged care service provision involves working in conjunction with a variety of government and nongovernment agencies, and specialist aged care assessment teams. This includes working with aged care GP panels initiatives, aged care assessment teams and many other community services.9 This can result in complex referrals, service overlaps and gaps, as well as differing criteria for service eligibility. Patients may need to be treated outside of the general practice setting, eg. at home, hospital or aged care facility. Written health summaries for patients and carers are required to assist continuity of care, including care plans that include the systematic recording of medications to help manage polypharmacy. Older patients may require assessment for fitness to drive and laws may affect their licence eligibility. Other legal requirements that may require general practice involvement include pension eligibility, taxi concessions, death and cremation certificates. Clinicians need to a knowledge of legislative reporting obligations to state public health units that may involve older patients.

All rights reserved2Curriculum statement: Children's and young people's health Definition General practice care for children and young people covers physical, psychological and social primary health care from birth to adulthood. The age ranges of childhood and adolescence overlap, reflecting the fact that the developmental transitions through childhood, adolescence and adult life are not determined only by reference to chronological age. Physiological, psychological and social developmental milestones are also markers of maturation, and these vary considerably between individuals. The ways in which adolescence and young people are defined can be confusing. Over the past 3 decades, the end of adolescence has been marked by the acquisition of skills and responsibilities such as financial independence, entering the workforce and undertaking lifelong partnerships. More recently these skills and responsibilities have not been attained until a later stage in life. 1 For international epidemiological comparisons, most authorities define adolescence as the period between age 10-19 years. 2,3 The term young people is used more loosely internationally. For example, the Australian Institute of Health defines a young people as a person between age 15-24 years, 4 while the preferred use of the term young people by the UK Royal College of General Practitioners is for a person between age 10-19 years.5 This statement uses the term young person rather than adolescent. This reflects the current preference of professionals working in the field. Children's and young people's health: Definition3Curriculum statement: Children's and young people's health Rationale The prenatal, childhood and adolescent phases of development strongly influence an individual's subsequent health, wellbeing and opportunities in life.6 Therefore the general practice care of children and young people takes on a special role in creating future opportunities, especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other disadvantaged communities. 7-10 Families consult general practitioners and community nurses for problems arising in infancy more commonly than any other health professional. 11,12 Many presentations that appear medical at first may be related to parenting issues such as parental exhaustion, lack of confidence, or even guilt, eg. the single most common problem for families nurturing infants is poor sleep, which affects up to 45% of families. Sleep deprivation has a high impact on the family in a number of measurable ways. Inappropriate medicalisation of this and similar presenting problems may result in these families missing out on effective evidence based help. 13-15 General practitioners often see the same young children as community nurses and other health care workers, and need to communicate appropriately for optimal patient care.16 Nine percent of consultations in general practice are with patients aged 15-24 years,17 but many young people do not feel comfortable raising certain important health issues with the doctor18 while others experience barriers to accessing general practice care. General practitioners often find it challenging to provide optimal care for young people for a number of reasons. 19-22 General practitioners in Australia are becoming increasingly involved with the adult care of young people with chronic disease or disability who face particular challenges when they become adults and need to move from tertiary paediatric care to adult models of care. 23,24 Capacity at the 'system level' refers to opportunities for working with others that can only be put in place as a result of negotiation by GP organisations and government in concert with other stakeholder organisations in community. Children's statement: Children's and young people's health The five domains of general practice - children and young people's health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Achieving an understanding of the patient's real concerns is the most effective and cost efficient way to achieve desired health outcomes.25 When the patient is a newborn, an infant or a child, the rewards of the work are enhanced when the doctor is able to establish a social relationship with the patient and their family. This includes insight into the child's view of their situation and managing parental concerns in a way that enhances the parent understanding, self confidence and capacity to manage. Parents report that they value doctors who understand the complexities of family life. 26 Communication difficulties between doctors and young people, either real or perceived, are barriers to young people accessing medical care in any setting. 27-31 These arise in part because of the unique developmental processes that occur during adolescence which may make the young person self conscious, mistrusting or cautious about authority figures such as doctors. Young people often have critical concerns about privacy and confidentiality and may be anxious about dealing independently with systems of health care which are not familiar to them. Doctors' confidence in dealing with young people is improved by training in communication skills. 32 Adolescent friendly practices clearly can make the practice attractive to young people (see Organisational and legal dimensions ). Applied professional knowledge and skills Applied professional knowledge and skills when dealing with children and young people require a synthesis of: communication skills medical knowledge procedural skills knowledge of the social and cultural factors that influence the wellbeing of patients and their families. General practitioners need to manage urgent, life threatening problems (eg. impending upper airway obstruction, significant dehydration or a child or young person at risk). General practitioners need to be able to deal with situations where serious disease (eg. meningococcal bacteraemia) may be indistinguishable from a common self limiting condition at the initial presentation. These presentations demand that the doctor is able to formulate a differential diagnosis, exclude a serious illness and children at risk of abuse, neglect, homelessness or nonaccidental injury, and negotiate 'safety net' arrangements with the parents. The safety net must be sufficient to cover the dangerous possibilities within the differential diagnosis. Families under stress may find that minor childhood illness or difficult behaviour threatens their ability to cope, and may then seek inappropriate investigations or treatments. The general practitioner needs to explore the sources of the family's distress in a way that promotes family functioning. Effective management is required for the common causes of preventable childhood morbidity such as asthma or anxiety. Ear disease is an example of a condition that is a particular threat to the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. 33 Young patients with a disability may need their general practitioner's help when it comes to finding strategies that build on their strengths and work around their weaknesses. In these instances, patients will benefit if their general practitioner is able to recognise the need and either supply the support or mobilise other providers. Children's and young people's health: The five domains of general practice5Curriculum statement: Children's and young people's health Psychosocial factors affect the wellbeing of young people regardless of whether there is coexisting organic disease or disability. These factors include multiple and often conflicting cultural influences and pressures. Threats to adolescent health and wellbeing largely arise from psychosocial factors 3, 4 yet healthy adolescent development often involves behaviours that constitute health risks. General practitioners need to be able to assess risk and protective factors in the context of the developmental tasks of adolescence 35,36 Population health and the context of general practice General practitioners need be able to implement evidence based guidelines for developmental surveillance and early intervention strategies for children and adolescents (aged 0-19 years), including immunisation, as documented in section 3 of the RACGP Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice (the 'red book'). 37 General practitioners need to understand their practice communities in order to target identified problem local health areas and priorities. Professional and ethical role When the patient is a child or young person, general practitioners need to recognise professional and ethical issues specific to childhood and adolescence. These include: recognising that the best interests of the child or young person may not coincide with the perceived best interests of parents, carers or other significant adults taking responsibility to advocate for the child or young person while respecting the views of the child or young person involving the child or young person in negotiating treatments or other interventions where appropriate encouraging patient and parent independence and confidence in managing problems or illnesses as appropriate understanding the negative consequence of utilising guilt as a tool of patient management (eg. when dealing with the choices parents make about infant feeding or lifestyle choices of young people) utilising systemic counselling approaches, when appropriate (eg. strengths based counselling which seeks to recognise strengths of families and/or other systems supporting the child/young person and to assist in building on them). 38 Organisational and legal dimensions Individual practitioners need the support of effective systems inside and outside the practice. Inside the practice there needs to be a child, family and young people friendly philosophy, atmosphere and ease of access. Externally, systems are needed that enable communication and collaboration with the community, colleagues in general practice and other health professionals. High quality information management enhances clinical practice especially by supporting audit of clinical work involving children and young people. The practice needs to: ensure confidentiality measures are in place that respect the needs of young people, especially in relation to consent 39 minimise the barriers often experienced by young people when seeking access to care in general practice40 recognise and implement reporting requirements mandated by law.

All rights reservedDisability\u0018Curriculum statement: Disability Definition Modern concepts of disability have broadened the traditional focus on individual impairment to one that recognises that the effect of impairment on an individual depends not only on the underlying condition, but also on the environmental and social factors. Therefore, a person with an impairment may not necessarily be disabled or handicapped by it. Alternatively, inadequate supports in an environment may lead to an unnecessary handicap as a result of an impairment. This new and holistic concept of disability, which combines the medical and social models, is reflected in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).1,2 The concept of support needs - which can assist the person to overcome some of these limitations - has recently been added to the classification. The main types of disability are: Physical disability A disability associated with physical impairment and physical activity limitation in performing required day to day activities. Intellectual disability The presence of significant limitations in intellectual functioning (usually defined as IQ less than 70), and in at least two areas of adaptive behaviour (eg. self care, communication, social skills) with an onset in the developmental period.3 Developmental disability The presence of physical, intellectual and/or social (autism spectrum disorders) impairment with deficits in adaptive functioning, with an onset in the developmental period. Intellectual disability may be a prominent feature in people with developmental disability. Important note: unless otherwise stated, this curriculum uses the term 'disability' to include physical, intellectual and developmental disability. Some disabilities are often associated with comorbid conditions (eg. intellectual disability and epilepsy, cerebral palsy and vision impairment or epilepsy). Clinicians need to be aware of the likelihood of these comorbidities, and recognise that cognitive and communication difficulties can present barriers to accessing health care. Clinicians should not let the disability distract from or overshadow these health problems, but to approach them as in any other person without a disability. Other disabilities may also be acquired in adult life, including sensory, psychiatric, musculoskeletal and neurological disabilities. These can have a significant impact on the affected person's life, and need to be addressed. Disability: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Disability Rationale In 1998, an estimated 16.2% of Australians reported one or more physical/diverse disabling conditions, 2.7% reported one or more intellectually disabling conditions, 7.5% reported sensory or speech impairment and 12% reported a psychiatric disability.4 People with disability make up a significant part of most general practice populations due to multiple comorbidities, and general practitioners have a key role in the management of these disabilities and associated health problems. In addition, the disability itself can be a barrier to accessing health services, and the general practitioner will often have a role in facilitating appropriate and timely access to services, as well as providing ongoing management of health issues. Australian general practitioners and registrars indicate that they receive inadequate training to care for people with intellectual disability and consider that they need better training in the assessment of behaviour problems, mental disorders, communication, sexuality, neurological problems and an increased understanding of other common comorbidities, be they related to a syndrome or not.5-7 The vast majority of general practitioners are interested in improving their skills, knowledge and management of this population.8 In addition to disability related conditions, people with disability will have the full range of medical conditions affecting people without disabilities and will require access to appropriate services. This includes the need for access to the full range of preventive health services such as smoking cessation, nutritional and other population based health initiatives. People with disability come from a wide range of backgrounds. Practitioners need to recognise the special issues (including discrimination) facing people with disabilities from diverse backgrounds, including issues of gender difference, ethnicity and poverty, and issues of sexuality, including sexual preference. Disability: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Disability The five domains of general practice - disability Communication skills and patient-doctor relationship Effective communication forms the foundation for good general practice management of disabilities. When a patient has significant communication difficulties, whether due to cognitive, social or physical impairment, then additional communication skills and strategies will be required of the medical practitioner to ensure good communication between doctor, patient and, where appropriate, family and/or support workers. Applied professional knowledge and skills People with disabilities have the same medical issues as the rest of the population, although certain disabilities may be associated with an increased (or decreased) risk of particular medical conditions. Knowing the cause of the disability therefore informs medical management. The guiding principle when providing medical care to people with a disability, whatever the aetiology, is to employ the same diagnostic and management strategies and standards that apply to patients without a disability. Population health and context of general practice People with disabilities are part of, and contribute to, their communities, however, they often encounter barriers to participating in and accessing the services they choose and require. Medical practitioners must be aware of the social, financial and legal frameworks and services that support people with a disability and their families and carers within the community. General practitioners need to be aware of population based measures for disability prevention (eg. periconception folate supplementation). Professional and ethical role Patients and families come from diverse social and cultural backgrounds that may influence their attitudes and knowledge with respect to disability. When working with, and providing care to, people with a disability, fundamental principles that guide good practice include clearly focusing on and respecting the person with the disability, an awareness of the impact of the disability on the person's life and the need to employ the same standards of care that apply to patients without a disability. Organisational and legal dimensions Legislative frameworks empower individuals and protect those who are not able to advocate for themselves. Good procedures, including those for regular review and follow up, underpin proactive medical management and are particularly important to the care of people, including those with a disability, who find it difficult to understand and organise their medical care.

All rights reservedDoctors' health\u0018Curriculum statement: Doctors' health Definition Doctors' health is an understanding and practice of safe health behaviours necessary for the doctor to aim for 'a state of complete ideal physical, mental, social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity'1 and includes aspects of: self care safe, effective and appropriate utilisation of the health system involvement in appropriate personal health screening practice of appropriate health promoting behaviours. Doctors' health also includes the provision of appropriate health care to other doctors and their family members. Physician impairment is been defined as any physical, mental of behavioural disorder that interferes with ability to engage safely in professional activities. Doctors' health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Doctors' health Rationale Doctors have historically been reported to have high rates of mental health problems, alcoholism and drug use disorders,2 often in the context of disciplinary action taken against them. Doctors need to see themselves as people who practise medicine and, as such, are people first and foremost, with all the human needs and weaknesses that everyone else can have.3-5 Doctors and their families are a disadvantaged group within society by virtue of their poorer access to a doctor of choice, including medical families,6 and may have poorer health outcomes as patients in the health system due to under- and over-treatment and their failure to utilise their own referral networks when in crisis. However, in addition to maintaining health for personal wellbeing, doctors have a professional obligation to maintain their own health in order to ensure that they perform optimally when treating patients. The medical profession needs to support doctors to maintain health by recognising that the benefits are not only personal ones for the doctor, but extend to the wider community as well. A doctor, therefore, has both a personal and a professional responsibility to ensure they are accessing and optimising quality health care. Doctors have difficulty accessing health care for many reasons. Education to ensure that doctors can effectively confront the barriers to effective health access is essential; these barriers may be personal ones or related to the culture of the medical profession. Reducing these barriers necessarily requires an understanding of what it is like to be a patient and what it is like to be involved in caring for a medical colleague.7 Recent literature has concentrated on the mental health issues of doctors including stress, depression and job satisfaction. Doctors' health encompasses more than this and includes the physical health of doctors and the social supports that doctors establish during their lives with their peers and outside their medical circle. Doctors' health includes many diverse issues: illness, impairment, the impact of medicolegal issues and the personal safety of the doctor in their work environment.8 Special issues may confront some groups of general practitioners, eg. rural practitioners may be confronted with issues of reduced access to independent care and longer hours of work. Similarly, medical students have unique pressures as do new medical graduates.9,10 As a profession, general practitioners have an obligation to all patients, including doctor-patients, in ensuring that they have access to appropriate care. Boundary issues are a significant component of doctors health, and understanding the boundaries within the doctor-patient relationship is one aspect of this issue. Decisions regarding self treatment and the need for independent health care is another. Medical families may also suffer problems with their access to health care, and it is important that doctors and their families are taught how to recognise the boundary issues involved. Doctors have a professional obligation to ensure the welfare of impaired colleagues by providing appropriate support in their access of care, ensuring the community is protected from potential harm and assisting those returning to the workplace. The doctor as a patient Doctors need to confront issues relating to being a patient at some stage of life, and to be aware that some doctors find this transition difficult. Specific issues of confidentiality and participation in the process of shared decision making may need to be considered. Doctors' health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Doctors' health Doctors should be advised of the advantage in having an independent general practitioner to assist with personal health care, and should actively seek to develop rapport with their own general practitioner before developing any significant health issues. Doctors need to understand the distinction between being ill and being impaired, and to be prepared to voluntarily withdraw from work in the event of impairment and to notify those who will be able to offer assistance. Doctors, like all patients, have the right to confidentiality and privacy, and should not have any of their details disclosed unless obliged ethically or legally. Fear of lack of access to a confidential doctor is a fear disclosed by some doctors.11,12 Doctors have special issues relating to their own health, and treatment should be sensitive to these needs. For example, some doctors may have difficulty accepting a diagnosis when they have spent a large amount of their professional life treating the same or similar conditions. Denial of illness and vulnerability may be an important issue, and doctors may also self medicate, including adjusting dosages without consulting their own treating doctors. Like all patients, doctors need to take responsibility for their own health, in terms of being proactive about professional and occupational health needs, such as immunisation and complying with legislative health requirements in the case of illness or impairment that threatens patient safety, as well as being proactive about their own health needs, (ie. exercise and other health promotion activities). Treating doctors - the doctor as a doctor's doctor All general practitioners are likely to treat a doctor as a patient during their career and will need to recognise that there are some specific issues that may arise in such consultations. Doctors treating medical practitioners need to ensure that the same due care is offered when caring for doctors as for other patients. General practitioners should follow their usual method of history taking, examination and investigation as they would with any other patient, without taking shortcuts or making assumptions about a medical patient. Treating doctors should recognise that doctor-patients require the same explanations of investigations and management and be prepared to act as an advocate within the medical system as they would for all patients. Doctor-patients often need to be reassured that they have made the right decision to seek medical care even if the problem appears to be a minor one. The barriers that many doctors experience when they access health care need to be recognised. The issues of confidentiality are especially important here. Doctor-patients need to be encouraged to follow the routine preventive health screening and healthy lifestyle practices just as other patients are encouraged. They need to be included in the routine recall system for follow up and screening. They should be encouraged to develop a continuing regular relationship with their practitioner. Treating doctors should encourage doctor-patients to participate in a shared decision making process with the guidance normally offered to any patient. Doctor-patients should be allowed to be the patient and not be expected to make decisions without support. This therapeutic alliance should take into account the health literacy of the patient without making assumptions but nevertheless acknowledging the doctor-patient's special knowledge. During this process the treating doctor needs to be aware of the issues of transference within the relationship.13,14 There is a need to actively negotiate the potential concerns of self treatment. If the treating doctor feels that the doctor-patient should take time off for any illness then this will need to be discussed and the appropriate certificates offered as many doctors expect to work through illness and simply do not consider this option. When caring for an ill and potentially impaired doctor, treating doctors need to accept the professional and ethical responsibility to ensure that the doctor receives care and that the general community is protected. Doctors' health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Doctors' health The five domains of general practice - doctors' health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship As a basic skill of training, doctors will have learned to communicate effectively with their patients, but communicating with their own health provider involves their ability to take on the role of a patient. This includes seeking medical assistance in appropriate environments, developing a therapeutic partnership that allows them to become aware of, and deal with, their own health concerns, and to promote appropriate positive health behaviours. Doctors may not be personally familiar with the role of patient and may need exposure to this role to feel comfortable. Doctors treating doctors need specific skills and training in effective communication including: skills required to communicate to the doctor when they are a patient communicating that their health concerns will be treated confidentially, and acknowledging the difficulties that doctors have when taking on the patient role. Applied professional knowledge and skills Doctors need to: know the importance of maintaining their own physical and emotional wellbeing and its impact on their provision of health care know the factors that influence doctors health demonstrate compliance with personal occupational health and safety requirements (eg. vaccination requirements, managing needlestick injuries and complying with requirements if they have an infectious disease including chronic bloodborne viruses), and have the necessary skills to recognise and manage stress from both work and outside of work. Doctors treating other doctors need an awareness of the impact of transference and countertransference within the therapeutic relationship. Population health and the context of general practice As well as doctor specific conditions, doctors experience the same diseases as the general community and need to be aware of how to access and provide the same screening and health promotional activities as the rest of the population. Some doctors have been identified as having high risk of specific conditions including anxiety, relationship difficulties, depression, suicide and the use of psychoactive medication. Doctors need to ensure compliance with personal occupational health requirements, including vaccinations, as health care workers are at increased risk of acquiring some diseases such as blood borne viruses. Professional and ethical role Doctors have a professional obligation to maintain health to ensure optimal performance in patient care and have a responsibility to seek care and assessment in the event of illness. An impaired doctor who continues to work presents a potentially serious health risk to the community.

All rights reservedGenetics\u0018Curriculum statement: Genetics Definition General practice genetics deals with the general practice management of hereditary issues, problems and conditions, including those involving the mechanisms of hereditary transmission. Genetic counselling is a procedure by which patients and their families are given support and advice about the nature and consequences of inherited disorders, the possibility of being affected or having affected children, and the various options available for prevention, diagnosis, and management of such conditions.1 Genetics: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Genetics Rationale The last decade has witnessed significant advances in genetic medicine such as the mapping of the human genome and the understanding of genetic causes of disease. These advances have increasing relevance to clinical care in general practice including the management of people with a family history of cancer and heart disease, carrier testing for common autosomal recessive conditions, and the diagnosis of inherited diseases such as haemochromatosis and thrombophilia. The role of the general practitioner in genetics Australian2-4 and international5-7 studies have highlighted the need for general practitioners (GPs) to develop genetic literacy and understand the important role played by primary care in the management of genetic conditions. This includes: taking and using the family history to determine the risks of common diseases such as cancer and heart disease identifying patients with specific genetic conditions who may benefit from referral for genetic counselling or specialist management prepregnancy counselling from a genetic perspective, including discussion of prenatal screening and diagnostic tests for genetic conditions identifying, assessing and, when appropriate, referring children and adults with developmental delay, developmental disability or dysmorphic features for diagnosis and specialist services using genetic tests appropriately including those listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule be aware of the growing field of genomics and the use of genetic markers to determine therapeutics discussing newborn screening programs with parents and managing children who test positive supporting families with genetic conditions and coordinating their care between clinical genetics services and other clinical specialties. Genetics can affect many areas of general practice care, and genetic issues may also occur in other curriculum statements. Genetics: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Genetics The five domains of general practice - genetics Communication skills and the patient - doctor relationship General practitioners need to be able to: apply communication strategies, appropriate for those receiving the information, in discussing the implications of a genetic diagnosis or genetic test result including the implications for family members address the potential personal impact of a diagnosis of a genetic condition in themselves or their family understand the inherent variation in risk perception and use a range of strategies for its communication to support informed decision making discuss strategies that the patient may use for communication of genetic risk with other family members respect the different belief systems that may impact on perceptions of health, disability, kinship and understanding of genetic risk communicate sensitively when exploring family relationships, including issues of adoption, paternity and consanguinity communicate the implications and limitations of genetic tests and their potential to lead to uncertainty, and recognise and develop strategies to support families in the face of uncertainty or lack of a clinical diagnosis. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need to: use a three generation family history to recognise patterns of inherited disease or disability use family history information to identify patients who are at increased risk of common, preventable multifactorial conditions be aware of the wide range of conditions that may have a genetic factor in their aetiology and the role of disease predisposition genes understand the importance of ethnicity in determining risk of certain common inherited conditions understand the implications of genetic conditions for other family members who may benefit from genetic counselling know the clinical indications for ordering common genetic tests including those on the Medicare Benefits Schedule, and understand the role of genetic tests in the assessment of people with developmental delay, developmental disability and/or dysmorphic features. Population health and the context of general practice General practitioners need to be able to: understand the process of newborn screening, which conditions are included, and be aware of issues relating to retention and access to the newborn screening cards discuss the value of prepregnancy counselling from a genetic perspective, including discussing prenatal screening and diagnostic tests for genetic conditions and the protective role of folate discuss prenatal screening tests that are available in both public and/or private sectors to support informed reproductive choices adhere to screening guidelines for genetic conditions as summarised in the RACGP Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice (the 'red book')8 recognise that genetic conditions are often lifelong, reflecting many issues related to chronic conditions and disability, and be familiar with, and encourage the appropriate use of, community services such as genetic support groups. Genetics: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Genetics Professional and ethical role General practitioners need to be able to: recognise the impact of rapid scientific developments on the ability to provide current information and diagnosis, and the benefits of specialist referral in this context be aware of own values and belief systems and how these may impact on patient care when dealing with the implications of a genetic diagnosis or the result of a genetic test (eg. the decision whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy) and the need where necessary, for extremely timely referral to an alternative medical practitioner understand the family context of genetic conditions and the ethical issues, including right of access to, and need for, consent in the disclosure of genetic risk or genetic test results to blood relatives discuss the personal and family implications of third party interest (eg. employers and insurers) in a genetic diagnosis in a family member or a predictive genetic test result, and recognise the psychosocial impact of a genetic diagnosis or genetic risk and provide patients with appropriate support or referral. Organisational and legal dimensions General practitioners need to: discuss the ethical, legal and social implications of common genetic tests maintain confidential medical records to include information about genetic conditions and genetic risks maintain medical records that adhere to privacy legislation when recording or disclosing information to, or about, other family members understand how privacy laws impact on communication about genetic conditions within families, and understand the role of clinical genetics services and how to access them.

All rights reservedMen's health\u0018Curriculum statement: Men's health Definition Men's health in general practice is defined as the holistic management of health conditions and risks that are most common or specific to men in order to promote optimal physical, emotional and social health in the general practice setting.1 While male sexual health is important, men's health goes beyond sexual and reproductive health. Men's health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Men's health Rationale Australian males are less healthy than females, dying 6 years earlier than Australian women,2 especially in the 25-65 years age group - the main working period of men's lives. The median age at death of Australian males in 2004 was 76.6 years compared with 82.6 years for women, and this shorter life expectancy of men than women occurs when measured across every age group. The overall inequality in mortality burden is 50% larger for males than females in Australia.3 General practitioners are well situated to address the specific health care needs of men. Good general practice men's health care not only includes the management of disease, but involves recognising that major improvements to men's health will be achieved by challenging the way masculinity is defined in Australian culture, recognising the importance of how boys develop socially, exploring ways of taking general practitioners and health teams to the men who under attend general practices, as well as addressing the marketing of general practice to men. Building these links between general practices and the community have the potential to enhance the relationships between men and their general practitioners. General practitioners are less likely to see males in patient encounters than females. In 2004-2005, BEACH reported that of 94 386 patient encounters surveyed, 43.5% of patient encounters were males compared with 56.5% females. This was reflected across all age groups except for children aged less than 15 years and was greatest among the younger adults (15-24 years and 25-44 years).4 This low rate of presentation of men across the decades of middle and older age develop which has been linked to men's shorter life expectancy. Deaths in working age males are more common than in working age females. At age 25 years, male deaths are three times as common as female deaths, falling to 1.5 times as common at age 50 years, before beginning to rise again to age 64 years to approach being twice as common. Among younger working age males (aged 25-44 years), death is more likely to result from external causes rather than other causes. In 2004, the leading single cause of death for males aged 25-44 years was intentional self harm (26 deaths per 100 000 population), followed by transport accidents (14 per 100 000). Although called 'working age people', relatively few deaths are formally work related, however, over 90% of these deaths are in males, with more than one-third (34%) aged 55 years or over. In males aged 25-44 years, injury (including suicide and poisoning) is the leading cause of death. Unhealthy behaviours are also more common in men than women. For example, smoking accounts for around 12% of the total burden of disease in males compared with 7% in females.5 In 2004, 12% of males were found to be more likely to drink daily compared with of 5.8% of females,6 and there were 1.5 million males who had used illicit drugs in the previous 12 months compared with 1.0 million female users7. Over 92% of cases of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS in Australia are in men.8 Gender in health care9 Women and men experience health differently. Biological sex differences, such as reproductive health and sexuality, are responsible for health issues traditionally regarded as men's health or women's health issues. However, gender refers to the different social and cultural roles, expectations, and constraints placed upon men and women because of their sex. When analysing the different experiences and impacts of health on men and women, differences relating to gender in addition to biological sex, need to be considered. Men's health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Men's health Gender differences can influence both women and men's health through: exposure to risk factors access to, and understanding of, information about disease management, prevention and control subjective experience of illness and its social significance attitudes toward the maintenance of one's own health and that of other family members patterns of service use, and perceptions of quality of care. Male socialisation and masculinity, social connectedness and work-life balance significantly impact on health. Masculinity has been identified as a key factor leading both men and boys to risk taking and self harming behaviours. Male emotional responses may deny access to the healing effects of emotional release, and valuing their own physical, emotional and mental health. Knowledge of the impact of masculinity on health and health care is critical to the successful provision of effective general practice care. Masculine identity and behaviour vary over the course of a man's life and also vary considerably according to cultural and ethnic background, sexual identity, socioeconomic and geographical locations. An understanding of masculine behaviours and notions of maleness needs to take into account the wide range of masculinities that exist within multicultural Australia. For example, this includes: men living in rural and isolated areas; non-Australian born men; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men; older men; men with a disability; men affected by mental illness; war and armed service veterans; and men with other special needs such as divorced and separated men who may, or may not be primary carers. The health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men is worse than any other subgroup in Australia. Excess morbidity and mortality relates to unemployment, poverty, incarceration and low self esteem.10 Life expectancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men is approximately 20 years less than other Australians at age 56 years. Men are more likely to be both the perpetrators of violence and its victims. Violence is a significant health issue for Australian men for many reasons including the effects on victims, the health impacts of imprisonment on perpetrators and the deleterious effects on healthy relationships. Males are responsible for the vast majority of cases of domestic violence and general practitioners have responsibilities to deal with its effects. Exposure of boys to violence during their formative years contributes to a range of issues including homelessness, drug use, depression, relationship difficulties and perpetuation of the cycle of violence later in their lives. In addition to the clinic, general practitioners may become involved in community activities where men congregate to provide services, heighten the awareness of men's health issues and act as advocates for male patients. Refer to curriculum statements: Population and public health regarding health promotion programs; Philosophy and foundation of general practice for general consultation issues; Mental health for the general mental health issues that affect men; and Multicultural health for successful crosscultural communication including the correct use of translators. Men's health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Men's health The five domains of general practice - men's health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Men are less likely to discuss their health problems with their GP than women for emotional, cultural and gender related issues. Nonjudgmental communication helps to reduce any associated embarrassment when attending for treatment. General practice communication strategies should focus on strategies to help improve the ability of male patients to disclose their health concerns. This may include detecting whether a male patient prefers to see a male doctor. Communicating with young men and adolescent men poses particular challenges for clinicians. Applied professional knowledge and skills Men are at higher risk of mortality than women at all ages, although they may be dismissive of their own risks and health problems. General practice care requires knowledge of key men's medical problems and lifestyle risks throughout the entire male lifecycle. This includes men's mental health and wellbeing. General practitioners should educate men about how their bodies function and their special health needs, especially in the link between lifestyle risks and diseases. Knowledge of the role of men in the family, their roles in the workplace and the problems caused by unemployment among men is critical to successful men's health care. In addition to the primary care presentation of male genitourinary problems, general practitioners must be aware of potential genitourinary emergencies such as testicular torsion and penile injuries. Population health and the context of general practice General practitioners need to be aware of the range of key medical conditions and lifestyle risk factors affecting men in order to successfully promote men's health needs. Knowledge of the conditions affecting men at each age helps to identify key health promotion issues and opportunities. Familiarity with the impact of demographic factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, helps target health promotion activities. This includes men living in rural and isolated areas, non-Australian born men, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, older men, men who have sex with men, men with a disability, mental illness or other special needs. Circumcision is also important for some religious beliefs. Some areas of men's health promotion such as prostate screening, are controversial and up-to-date knowledge and skilful counselling may be required to help patients reach informed decisions. Professional and ethical role General practitioners need to identify when a male patient may prefer to see a male doctor, respect this choice and to arrange this when practical. Men are more likely to be involved in a variety of activities that involve the law and general practitioners may need to adapt their management appropriately. These include accidental or self inflicted injury, work related injuries and incidents, and violence including partner abuse. Organisational and legal dimensions General practices need to be aware of the requirements for effective delivery of men's health care. This awareness may involve evaluating the practice's effectiveness in providing men's health services or incorporating routine opportunistic health promotion into male patient consultations, especially for those patients who do not attend regularly. Men's health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Men's health Other interventions may involve creating more male friendly environments such as: using men's health posters and displays of information related to men; providing evening clinics or appointment schedules that accommodate men working shifts or commuting over distances; promoting a front of office culture which acknowledges men's problems with appointments and waiting times; and providing as broad a range of services as possible either within the walls of general practices or via cooperative arrangements with other local providers. General practitioners may need to offer services in areas where men congregate such as offering clinics at sporting facilities, in workplaces or entertainment areas, while seeking to coordinate and cooperate with existing general practices and other health service providers.

All rights reservedMulticultural health\u0018Curriculum statement: Multicultural health Definition Multicultural health in Australian general practice reflects how the core principles of multiculturalism operate within the context of general practice, including ensuring that the training of general practitioners has a strong and specific emphasis on building cultural competence and effectiveness, ie. the ability to work competently and effectively in a culturally diverse workplace and with encounters with people from different cultural backgrounds to ensure the delivery high quality general practice care. The concept of multiculturalism in Australia is based on the principles of pluralism which recognises, accepts and respects the rights of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage within an overriding commitment to Australia, its people and the basic structures and values of Australian society. The key to Australian multiculturalism is inclusiveness rather than division. Terms often used within discussions of multicultural health include: NESB: Non-English speaking background (NESB) is used most frequently to describe people who were born in a country where the predominant language is not English. They are first generation NESB. Their children are second generation NESB. CALD: Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD)1 refers to the wide range of cultural groups that make up the Australian population and Australian communities. The term acknowledges that groups and individuals differ according to religion and spirituality, racial backgrounds and ethnicity as well as language. The term 'culturally and linguistically diverse background' is used to reflect intergenerational and contextual issues, not only migrant experience. CALD is a term used in policy documents but is often poorly defined. The term is commonly used to refer to people living within culturally diverse communities in Australia that may differ from mainstream dominant culture. Specific general practice issues affecting people from CALD in Australia are many and diverse, eg. the effect on the provision of high quality culturally relevant, appropriate and accessible services and information; recognising the potential for discrimination as a result of services targeted toward mainstream dominant culture being inappropriate for people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds; and the use of language services to best effect and the specific needs of different communities and promoting the benefits of a culturally diverse community. These are only a few examples of the many complex issues impacting upon people from CALD and Australian general practice. Ethnic: This term is no longer favoured and not officially used in some states and territories of Australia, and is largely understood to refer to people born in a non-English speaking country or whose parents are born in a non-English speaking country. Multicultural health recognises that the issues addressed in this curriculum are interconnected with many but not all indigenous health issues. Even so, the users of this curriculum statement should not apply it directly in developing teaching and training materials for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Multicultural health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Multicultural health Rationale A patient's presentation of illness is influenced by culture. The general practitioner needs to understand how the cultural background of both the doctor and the patient influences the general practice consultation. Multicultural health in Australian general practice involves making a holistic assessment of the patient's needs, recognising the impact of cultural issues in the Australian environment. Every individual constructs the meaning of their experience of health from within their cultural background. The social group within which we live influences our interpretation of the meaning of our experience of health and illness and affects our understanding of what symptoms are significant. Cultures help determine the behaviours we use when presenting to the general practitioner. The development of cultural competency is an integral skill in general practice. Cultural competence2 is a set of congruent behaviours, attitudes and policies that come together in a system, agency or health service or among professionals and enable the organisation or those professions to work effectively in crosscultural situations. Cultural competence is much more than awareness of cultural differences, as it focuses on the capacity of the health system to improve health and wellbeing by integrating culture into the delivery of health services. To become more culturally competent, a health service or professional or system needs to: value diversity have the capacity for cultural self assessment be conscious of the dynamics that occur when cultures interact institutionalise cultural knowledge, and adapt service delivery so that it reflects an understanding of the diversity between and within cultures. This involves challenging practitioner cultural assumptions, developing empathy for patients and colleagues with a different worldview, and developing the necessary skills to ensure that appropriate communication and interaction occurs within the consultation to result in quality care. Multicultural health issues impacting upon general practice Multicultural health issues can adversely impact upon primary care and general practitioners are in a strong position to be advocates to improve the health of people from CALD backgrounds. Australia's society is linguistically and culturally diverse consisting of 3% of Australians being of indigenous origin, while 97% who have settled or are descendants of settlers over the past 200 years.3 Multicultural diversity in Australia is increasing. In 2001, 23.1% of people living in Australia were born overseas compared to 14.35% in 1991. Those born in the United Kingdom (5.6%) and Europe (11.6%) are decreasing but those born in east, central or southern Asia (6.0%) are increasing over the past 10 years.4 Forty-three percent of Australians were either born overseas or had at least one parent born overseas compared with 26% in 1991, and 25.2% spoke a language other than English at home in 2001 compared to 18.9% in 1991.5 Issues in multicultural health in Australian general practice are complex and exist at every level of the health system, community and individual social and environments. These issues include: access to health care is expected for all Australians. Patients from a CALD background may find they have specific problems accessing health care compared to others. Like many others in the community poverty, poor educational levels, difficulty with transport are likely issues to impact health opportunities for those from a CALD background. In addition to these well documented social determinants of health, those from a CALD background may not be aware of the care available in the community and may not be able to access that is readily available because of language, religious or other cultural barriers Multicultural health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Multicultural health equity of health care access is important for all Australians and is difficult to achieve when access issues are not addressed. As well as these issues, some patients from a CALD background experience discrimination from the health care system due to their country of origin, cultural background and religious beliefs. Health care professionals need to recognise this potential and be prepared to advocate for their patients when necessary to ensure adequate care. Social discrimination in health is experienced by many people from a CALD background, as well as inequality in employment, education and other areas language difficulties can negatively impact upon the care received by those from a CALD background. Over 200 languages are spoken in Australia, and in addition, nonverbal communication, communication styles, use of family or a third person for communication support and differing understandings of English words and phrases can all impact on clinical care. Different cultures attach different meanings to parts of the body and types of illness and this can impact upon the presentation of the illness or the compliance with treatment. culture encompasses many issues and there are significant cultural differences even between those that speak the same language or come from the same country. Cultural issues that need to be considered are: - cultural lens: each person, including health professionals, needs to recognise that they have their own unique personal worldview influenced by the cultures that nurtured them. This 'cultural lens' may influence the way a health professional may judge and make assumptions about patients of a different background, and recognising this cultural bias is a necessary step for clinical effectiveness in a crosscultural environment - diversity within diversity: there are issues of age, gender, sexuality and social issues within each group reflecting the diversity within each cultural group. General practice care needs to remember this diversity in its provision of health care - religious issues: can alter the management of a patient. Religion can determine the patient's worldview and has a major influence over a person's life, lifestyle and understanding of illness. It may affect diet and use of medications. All major religions are worshipped in Australia. Multicultural health in general practice involves tackling health inequalities and in reducing barriers to accessing general practice care. The general practitioner also has a role to play in breaking down cultural stereotypes through the provision of high quality care for people from CALD backgrounds to address these inequalities. Multicultural health in general practice includes recognising the 'diversity within diversity' and avoids treating all migrants and humanitarian entrants the same category terms of social and environmental determinants of health, health care experiences and health status. Multicultural health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Multicultural health The five domains of general practice - multicultural health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Cultural competence in general practice is demonstrated through effective communication. Language difficulties are a major barrier to the delivery of general practice services. Even when the patient speaks English, lack of English proficiency can cause communication problems resulting potentially serious medical situations such as giving details in how to take medications; subtle misunderstandings which can be critical in emotionally charged issues and mental health issues; and cultural assumptions resulting in important issues not addressed. Skilful and effective use of interpreters and the avoidance of potential problems encountered during translation are central to general practice quality care. During translation, the conversation needs to be directed between doctor and patient and not directed to the interpreter, and not interfere in the patient doctor interaction. Confidentiality must be assured, especially in small communities, and health professionals need to be aware of the pitfalls of using families in this role. There may also be different factions within a community that are important to the patient. Lack of awareness of culturally specific spiritual needs, beliefs and practices may impede addressing specific cultural issues such as, female genital mutilation, domestic violence, sexual violence, as well as being a potential cause of offending patients. Awareness of the risk of mental health issues in CALD communities, as a result of trauma, torture, social isolation and language isolation, may impact on effective communication. There are many relevant written materials available for patients from a CALD background seeking medical information. Educational background and literacy levels may be difficult to assess when there is a language barrier and the relevance of educational materials will vary for each individual. Some people speak one particular language but only read in another. This will have implication when offering reading materials when determining which resources are appropriate for the patient. Health professionals also need to be aware of their own cultural lens when communicating with patients. This includes health care providers' worldviews, beliefs about disease, health and health care, impact of faith, religious beliefs and ethnopharmacology. Applied professional knowledge and skills Social and environmental determinants of health are a major aspect of quality multicultural general practice care such as: diseases from the country of origin of the patient - nutritional deficiencies, health effects of war, torture and trauma, tuberculosis diseases relating to migration including refugee health diseases of settlement - lifestyle diseases of host country mental health specific diseases common to certain populations such as thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia, haemochromatosis, and culturally specific practices such as female genital mutilation. In addition, social, linguistic and cultural isolation commonly experienced by patients from a CALD background have the potential to escalate minor health problems into serious health concerns. Multicultural health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Multicultural health Due to a lack of evidence base and the emergence of new conditions, clinicians require an innovative approach to accessing new knowledge such as relying on specialist multicultural agency advice and online information access. General practitioners should be prepared to pool new knowledge with others to increase the general awareness of issues that have risen within the medical community to enhance the profession's ability to care for these communities. Refugees can have major health problems and access can be limited due to systemic barriers. General practitioners need to be aware of these patients' individual health issues, complexity of family structures and health issues related to their communities, and how to ensure adjustment and ongoing access to the Australian health system. A holistic approach helps address multicultural health including attention to factors at the level of the: individual - physical and emotional dimensions family - social and relationship dimensions community - cultural and political dimensions. As a health professional's own perspectives will have significant impact on their interaction with patients from different culture and thus affect health outcomes, GPs need to develop skills including: tolerating ambiguity suspending judgment developing empathy. Population health and the context of general practice There is limited access to evidence based information for some problems faced within CALD communities and the GP needs to be prepared to deal with these culturally specific conditions despite the lack of evidence. Language barriers and cultural acceptability are major barriers to accessing specific services such as breast screening, Pap tests, palliative care and immunisation. The experiences of people of CALD background in accessing health care in their country of origin have an impact on their level of access in the Australian health care setting. People with better access in their country for various reasons (including socioeconomic status and level of education) would have relatively improved access to health services in the Australian health system compared to those who have had little past experience of accessing health care. The Australian health system has been set up for the majority culture, which may be culturally very different to that of some CALD communities. Population health risks can change with time, acculturation and in subsequent generations. Professional and ethical role General practitioners need to be aware that they are cultural beings and since there is a power differential between patient and doctor, their personal cultural beliefs and attitudes will impact on management outcomes for patients of CALD background. In many countries, medical practitioners have been involved in the torture of political detainees and that this can impact upon the trust that is often assumed within the doctor-patient relationship. Patients may have a specific concern accessing services in a large government hospital if they have had previously negative experiences in a similar context in the countries they have left. Important professional issues may be experienced or perceived differently by people of CALD background including: privacy and confidentiality informed consent Multicultural health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Multicultural health autonomy and adherence to treatment and treatment plans, and equality and partnership in management. Organisation and legal dimensions Necessary cultural information needs to be recorded within the medical records in a culturally sensitive manner that still enables others within the practice to access the relevant information needed to enhance a patient's care. Practices and practice staff needs to: supplement their previous medical education with knowledge of illnesses that are not common within the general community to enable them to care adequately for those from a CALD background be innovative in their approach to accessing this knowledge such as relying on specialist advice and internet searches engage within and beyond the medical settings to enhance the practice's ability to care for these communities access health information in different languages cater for family groups have systems for efficient access to interpreters before and during consultations manage time and costs involved in providing culturally appropriate and inclusive services detail how to gain access to interpreter services for routine and emergency consultations and be aware of the costs, and have opportunities for training to ensure effective service delivery to CALD background patients from the initial contact and throughout the health care process.

All rights reservedPopulation health and public health\u0018Curriculum statement: Population health and public health Definition The consensus statement of the joint advisory group on general practice and population health has defined general practice and population health as: 'the prevention of illness, injury and disability, reduction in the burden of illness and rehabilitation of those with a chronic disease. This recognises the social, cultural and political determinants of health. This is achieved through the organised and systematic responses to improve, protect and restore the health of populations and individuals. This includes both opportunistic and planned interventions in the general practice setting.'1 Population health is the study of health and disease in a population as specified by geographical, cultural or political guidelines. This includes defining health problems and needs, identifying the means by which these needs may be met, and providing the health services required to meet these needs.2 Other related terms commonly used in general practice include: community medicine which tends to apply more to the integration of population based health interventions in a clinical context, and community health which is often used to describe the application of broad based public health interventions at a community or individual level. Public health is the efforts organised by a society to protect, promote and restore the people's health. Population and public health are the combination of sciences, skills and beliefs directed to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all people through collective or social actions. There is considerable overlap between population and public health, and differing models of this interface have been developed. A continuum can be considered between population health activities within general practices, public health activities with the community, and what have been termed 'new public health' movements which include the engagement of communities, organisational development, and specialisation or leadership in fields such as policy development. Some health professionals use the terms population health and public health interchangeably, however, there are subtle nuances between these two disciplines.3-7 Preventive medicine is the application of preventive measures into medical practice by focusing clinical skills on the health of defined populations in order to promote and maintain health and wellbeing, and prevent disease, disability and premature death. Health promotion is a range of practices including health education, community development, preventive services, policy advocacy and regulations which seek to better health at the individual and population level, and goes beyond simple prevention. In general practice, population health represents an extension and expansion of existing clinical roles toward an emphasis on prevention and a focus on groups or populations rather than on individual patients. This may involve activities such as immunisation, risk assessment and management, patient education and screening in which general practitioners are already engaged within their practice. General practice public health also involves notification of diseases of public health importance to the relevant government agency. Population health and public health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Population health and public health Rationale General practice care goes beyond the individual patient to involve patient populations. 'General practice is the provision of primary continuing comprehensive whole patient medical care to individuals, families and their communities.'8 General practitioners are ideally placed to implement population based health activities as about 85% of Australians attend a general practitioner at least once during any one year.9 In the 2004-2005 financial year, there were about 94 million unreferred Medicare attendances at an average rate of 4.5 general practitioner visits per person.10 Integrating population health into general practice A population health approach means implementing these activities more effectively and consistently across a whole population. Population based health activities in general practice should include, as a priority, activities that are designed to meet the specific needs of disadvantaged population groups. General practice also has an important advocacy role around the structural issues that affect health status, especially for socially disadvantaged groups. The best outcomes from general practice population health activities result from: better integration across disciplines within primary care, and a partnership between general practice and public health services, and consumer and community organisations. Population based approaches to prevention and health promotion often require approaches across and beyond the health system. A useful strategic framework for strengthening and extending general practice involvement in population health at national, state, division and practice levels in Australia includes focus at the following levels:11 organisational structures and roles - developing organisational and practice structures and systems to enable general practitioners to identify and undertake effective population health activities and interventions, and to facilitate collaboration with outside services and professionals. communication - including community awareness, patient education and communication between population health and general practice agencies. information management/information technology - developing population health data collection, dissemination and analysis, and relevant clinical tools and guidelines for information management and decision support workforce planning, education and training - developing materials to improve access by general practice staff to education, training and quality assurance programs; and increasing understanding and skills in relation to the population health role of general practice, patient risk assessment and effective interventions financial systems - implementing appropriate incentives and payment systems to support the engagement of general practitioners in effective population health activities both inside and outside the practice partnership and referral mechanisms - developing and implementing organisational supports to facilitate effective collaboration between general practice and others working in a population health context, and evaluation and research - participating in research and evaluating alternative models of general practice organisation, funding and integration. Population health and public health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Population health and public health National health priorities The Australian Government has established national goals,12 targets and strategies for better health outcomes into the next century. These focus on the prevention, early detection and management of specific chronic problems including: cardiovascular health cancer control injury prevention and control mental health diabetes asthma musculoskeletal conditions, and renal disease. General practitioners need to be aware of the Australian Population Health Development Principal Committee (APHDPC) and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) incorporates the national public health partnership,13 and previously brought the Australian Government and states together on public health issues. The Australian health protection principal committee and the APHDPC will advise all Australian jurisdictions in the integration of prevention across all aspects of chronic disease management and bring a greater focus to health protection, especially pandemic readiness. Issues identified include: controlling communicable diseases (including immunisation, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C programs) bioterrorism preparedness environmental health nutrition physical activity injury prevention child, youth and mother's health chronic disease prevention Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, and health of prisoners. Population health and public health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Population health and public health The five domains of general practice - population health and public health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Enabling patients to take control of their health involves two way communication in the formation of a patient-doctor partnership. General practitioners need to be able to assess risk factors of the individual patients and the broader population, explain and implement preventive health interventions in general practice, including the modification of lifestyle risk factors. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need to be able to describe the epidemiology of common conditions encountered in Australia and internationally, as well as the recommended preventive activities conducted in the Australian community including general practice, and access current guidelines for screening and prevention. In addition, general practitioners need to be able to assess health needs of a specific population, eg. the elderly, men, women or young people. Population health and the context of general practice General practitioners need to be able to describe national health priorities, methods for assessing the health status of a community, and population health and public health approaches to prevention in general practice and the broader community. Professional and ethical role General practitioners need to be able to compare and contrast their professional and ethical role in their obligations to the patient and the broader community, eg. the rights of the individual versus the rights of the community, or patient confidentiality versus the public good. General practitioners also need to be able to describe methods of infectious disease control. General practitioners need to liaise with other health professionals to optimise population health care outcomes and advocate on behalf of patients. Organisational and legal dimensions General practitioners need to be able to describe the role of population based general practice activities within the context of the Australian health system, as well as work effectively within these systems to improve the health of patients and the broader community. General practitioners also need to be able to describe the medicolegal duties of the general practitioner in public health.

All rights reservedRural general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice Definition In addition to general practice as defined by The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP),1 rural general practice provides its own diversity of contexts and characteristics of general practice. In rural and remote Australia, geographical and demographic features lead to great diversity in both the ranges of presentations general practitioners may encounter and the facilities that may be available to administer primary care. Research has shown2-7 that rural general practitioners are more likely to: provide in-hospital care as well as private consulting room care; provide after hours services; engage in public health roles expected of them by discrete communities in which there are few doctors to choose from; engage in clinical procedures; engage in emergency care; encounter a higher burden of complex or chronic health presentations; and encounter larger proportions of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander patients in their overall patient load. The extent to which the general practitioner will engage in any of these activities and roles, however, will depend on the rural or remote practice context and the range of general practice skills in which they are required, ie. some rural doctors in smaller rural towns are based primarily at the local hospital, but the practice they conduct is still predominantly primary medical care, even though some secondary and tertiary care are also possible due to the hospital facilities. Rural general practitioners often value: professional autonomy3 the variety of medicine practised practising to the extent of their clinical knowledge and skills value the communities in which they work, and being valued by the community.8 Rural general practitioners are more likely to experience professional and social isolation than their peers in urban contexts.4 While rural practice requirements conform to the core curriculum set for the Fellowship of the RACGP (FRACGP), they will also involve specific skills sets appropriate to the rural and/or remote health context. These skills sets may be practised at an extended or advanced level, depending on patient requirements. These characteristics and practices are supported by the RACGP Standards of general practices and a curriculum developed and maintained by the RACGP and reflected in the dual awards of Fellowship of Advanced Rural General Practice (FARGP) and the RACGP Graduate Diploma of Rural General Practice (Grad Dip Rural). Rural general practice: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice Rationale Australia is predominantly an urban society. In 2005, of the estimated 20 328 159 people living in Australia, about 66% of the population was living in major cities, 21.2% in inner regional Australia, 10.2% in outer regional Australia, 1.6% living in remote Australia and 0.9% living in very remote Australia.9 According to analysis of national data by the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory,10 26.4% of the whole patient load on medical practitioners in Australia is to be found in what most people would regard as 'rural' Australia. The proportion of general practitioners per patient population decreases with increasing rurality.11 Geographical isolation and social accessibility are significant factors in the decision to attend a general practitioner for rural patients.12 Health outcomes such as higher death rates tend to be poorer outside major cities.13 The main contributors to higher death rates in regional and remote areas are coronary heart disease and other circulatory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, motor vehicle accidents, diabetes, suicide, other injuries and some cancers such as lung cancer perhaps reflecting differences in access to services, risk factors and the regional/remote environment. Rural areas have lower rates of some hospital surgical procedures, lower rates of general practice consultation and generally higher rates of hospital admission in regional and remote areas than in major cities. People from regional and remote areas tend to be more likely to smoke and drink alcohol in harmful or hazardous quantities than people in major cities. Environmental issues such as more physically dangerous occupations and factors associated with hazardous driving play a part in higher accident rates and related injury death in country areas.14 Higher death rates and poorer health outcomes outside major cities, especially in remote areas, also reflects the higher proportions of the populations in those areas who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander15 associated with higher mortality and morbidity (see Australian Institute of Health and Welfare studies16). Rural general practice training in addition to the FRACGP Vocational training is structured to ensure all doctors to have some rural exposure and an understanding of what may be helpful for working in different environments such as procedural skills and knowledge of Aboriginal health, hospital work and population health. This rural exposure is an essential part of preparing a general practice for unsupervised practice anywhere in Australia. This curriculum will assist any general practitioner understand the knowledge, skills and competencies helpful for unsupervised practice anywhere in rural Australia. Doctors with a particular interest in rural general practice can integrate enhanced rural training with general practice vocational training toward the FRACGP under the formal framework offered by the RACGP FARGP/Grad Dip Rural. These doctors may also wish to undertake advanced rural skills (ARS) training in curriculum shared with other medical specialties, such as anaesthesia, obstetrics, emergency medicine and mental health, which has additional curriculum requirements to those of the FRACGP. Specific curriculum statements have been developed by joint consultative committees between the RACGP and relevant specialist colleges in the areas of anaesthetics, obstetrics, emergency medicine, mental health, child and adolescent health, adult internal medicine, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and surgery. Curricula are in development in areas such as palliative and aged care, musculoskeletal medicine, rehabilitation, medical education or research. These advanced rural skills are not required for attainment of the FRACGP or included in this rural general practice curriculum statement. However, 12 months of training in accredited ARS posts is required for attainment of the FARGP and Grad Dip Rural. Doctors planning to undertake ARS training are encouraged to integrate these into their general practice vocational training, under the Rural general practice: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice FARGP/Grad Dip Rural framework. Medical students, postgraduate doctors and general practice registrars are encouraged to undertake as much of their education and training in rural general practice as practicable. Most RACGP curriculum statements will refer to rural and remote contexts. This rural curriculum statement serves both as the rural statement of the RACGP curriculum in general and as the baseline curriculum for the RACGP FARGP and Grad Dip Rural. The Grad Dip Rural will only be available as an accredited tertiary qualification until 28 February 2010. As qualifications beyond vocational FRACGP, FARGP and Grad Dip Rural candidates, for which the full 12 months of ARS training is undertaken in the one ARS curriculum, can include that curriculum in their postnominals, ie. a 12 months ARS training post in obstetrics, the postnominal is FARGP (Obst) and Grad Dip Rural (Obst). This assists the graduate in seeking visiting medical officer credentialing in rural hospitals. Please check the FARGP information available on the National Rural Faculty page of the RACGP website for specific educational and assessment requirements of the FARGP and Grad Dip Rural. Rural general practice: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice The five domains of general practice - rural general practice Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Effective communication skills enable a general practitioner to develop a relationship with their patient so as to understand both the illness and the patient's experience of that illness, and to move freely between clinical problem solving and the patient's experience of the problem. The communication skills of the rural general practitioner are especially important because of the likelihood of higher than average workloads and the greater reluctance of many patients to freely discuss problems they may experience. In a local rural environment, where patients are friends and neighbours, special care is required to communicate with patients in a manner not likely to confuse professional, social and personal boundaries. Rural general practitioners need to: establish rapport and be empathetic with patients from different socioeconomic, occupational and cultural background within rural communities adopt appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication styles adapted to the needs of patients in rural communities develop a capacity to place special emphasis on health promotion and education to increase patients willingness to look after themselves, especially in relation to major risk factors in rural communities communicate to patients appropriate doctor-patient boundaries associated with living within a close knit rural community develop a specific cultural awareness of the indigenous populations living within the boundaries of the medical practice manage with sensitivity communication on issues such as family arrangements during transfer to a major centre for treatment ability to work effectively as part of a multidisciplinary team appreciate the different cultural norms of interpersonal communication for specific patient populations (eg. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, non-English speaking people), and acquire knowledge to be able to communicate effectively with these patient groups, and appreciate and maintain good working relationship with all members of hospital staff/hierarchy. Applied professional knowledge and skills Rural general practitioners are likely to be called upon to manage a wider range of patient presentations, including emergency treatment, obstetrics and minor and major procedures without referral. Rural communities place great reliance on the applied professional skills of their resident general practitioners whose response must be skilful and appropriate in order to instil confidence and trust. Rural general practitioners need to: recognise the range of common and significant patient presentations found in rural communities demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of relevant anatomy, physiology, pathology and psychology, including related research findings in the management of conditions commonly found in rural practice competently manage the range of illness and disease occurring in their community, including possible serious illness which may be inherent in many common presentations demonstrate enhanced clinical skills in the management of common conditions Rural general practice: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice demonstrate continual improvement of their repertoire of procedural and clinical skills required for effective general practice in their rural communities, and the ability to perform appropriate medical procedures under minimal or no supervision demonstrate the ability to manage emergencies to the level of skill attained in recognised intensive emergency medicine courses such as the early management of severe trauma (EMST), advanced paediatric life support (APLS), advanced life support obstetrics (ALSO) and emergency life support (ELS), including the management of emergencies in the rural hospital setting demonstrate a level of competence in those aspects of medicine, surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics, intensive care, and anaesthesia appropriate to the practice of a rural general practitioner taking part in inpatient/hospital care demonstrate ability to take X-rays and use teleradiology facilities, when necessary demonstrate competent implementation of procedures for evacuation, disaster, trauma management and retrieval recognise and take into account the factors which need to be balanced when arranging an evacuation, including family considerations implement appropriate protocols for arranging an evacuation and for undertaking the preparations required in a community for air evacuations demonstrate competence performance of appropriate diagnostic procedures relevant to the advanced skills of rural general practice, and make decisions with confidence and accept the outcomes of these decisions while working within their limitations. Population health and the context of general practice Because rural communities in general have higher levels of morbidity and mortality, the rural general practitioner has an important and evolving role, with the potential to influence change at the individual patient, practice, and community levels within the health care system. Rural general practitioners are more likely to be called upon by local authorities to plan a public health role, eg. as a police medical officer. To optimise their effectiveness in providing primary health care to their communities, the rural general practitioner needs to develop a detailed understanding of the particular sociopolitical, economic, geographical, cultural, and family influences on the health of their patients. These factors contribute substantially to the unique context of rural general practice. Rural general practitioners need to: provide or contribute to ongoing health education and health promotion sessions to other rural health professionals and members of their rural community develop a detailed working knowledge of their rural community's patterns of morbidity and mortality, health services, and be able to participate in regional and national community based prevention and education strategies apply public health principles including disease control management and utilise the appropriate health and community service networks as part of their rural practice participate in a range of public health roles understand the need for multidisciplinary teamwork and work collaboratively with other health care practitioners in rural areas deliver an appropriate level of care while understanding the limitations of resources in rural general practice involve consumer groups in the development of policies relating to health service provision utilise relevant protocols and guidelines and, where necessary, participate in development of these guidelines, both for acute and preventive care demonstrate an understanding of the environmental, social and cultural influences on illness, health needs and priorities of rural and remote people and their communities recognise the importance of the family unit and the home environment in illness and health, and acknowledge the extended support structures Rural general practice: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice utilise the extended role of other health care practitioners in rural areas, recognising the value of multidisciplinary teamwork, and deliver an appropriate level of care while understanding the limitations of resources in rural general practice. Professional and ethical role Exercising a special duty of care is particularly relevant to the rural general practitioner who may deal with more emergency cases and problems requiring procedural skills than urban based general practitioners. All general practitioners are legally liable for the consequences of their own actions, however, rural general practitioners need to develop awareness of the particular clinical practices in which their need to minimise risk may be higher than others such as procedural practice. The dependence of rural communities on their local general practitioner means it is especially important that rural general practitioners continually review their own practice. It is essential for rural general practitioners, who must deal with a broad range of often complex patient presentations, to keep abreast of new developments and ensure that their own practice - like all of general practice - reflects current best practice based on scientific evidence. Rural general practitioners need to: ensure that they exercise due care and responsibility, have respect for patients rights and be willing to act as advocate for their patients clarify the potential ethical dilemmas arising from the multiple roles which general practitioners fulfil in small communities be clear about the many roles rural general practitioners can undertake in their community hospital, including combining of primary and secondary care and participating in hospital committees improve their skills in critical self reflection and evaluation of their practice to ensure that the needs of the rural communities they serve are met as effectively as possible develop skills in balancing the case load and demands of: - working in isolation in a rural practice with the associated social and personal responsibilities - self care and self reliance - family, and - professional and social boundaries which can be difficult in a small rural community. demonstrate an ability to establish professional networks and utilise available rural resources and referral agencies demonstrate an understanding of the difficulties and importance of maintaining confidentiality in small communities critically review relevant literature, analysing and utilising it appropriately in the workplace develop a commitment to continuing self directed learning and professional development sufficient to provide quality medical care be skilled in providing mentoring support for peers and others in the rural general practitioner learning life cycle, and outline the protocols for media involvement in emergency and disaster situations. Organisational and legal dimensions There are a wide range of practice types in rural communities, although they are frequently characterised by high patient loads and shortages of general practitioners to meet the demand in rural communities. This places a special burden on rural practices to be managed and administered as efficiently and effectively as possible. Rural general practice: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Rural general practice Rural general practitioners need to: balance time management between the demands of the consulting rooms and the community hospital be aware of local issues which impact upon the general practitioner's decision to treat the patient locally or to refer on develop an understanding of the principles of small business management relevant to a rural general practice utilise the principles of triage and disaster management in the rural setting utilise appropriate protocols for hospital, home and hostel visiting understand the principles of public health, including disease control arrangements within their state and utilise appropriately public health infrastructure outline legal responsibilities regarding notification of disease, birth, death, autopsy, nonaccidental injury and substance abuse appropriately prioritise patient management in rural general practice, according to individual patient needs, time, and other resources available recognise stress and grief symptoms in staff, patients, their relatives and friends, and provide empathic and culturally appropriate support and follow up clearly outline patient consent procedures clearly outline the consent procedures in emergency care clearly outline the local transfer and evacuation processes from the rural community apply the principles of retrieval medicine establish and utilise a comprehensive professional emergency referral network be able to apply the state legislation relevant to involuntary admission to a psychiatric unit power of attorney, child protection and abuse and guardianship outline how to access the metropolitan clinical, academic, research, literature, hotline and legal resources available keep comprehensive patient records and be able to articulate why this is important, and be aware of local issues which influence the general practitioner's decision to treat a patient locally or refer on.

All rights reservedWomen's health\u0018Curriculum statement: Women's health Definition The general practice management of women's health involves a holistic patient centred approach to the physical, mental and emotional health of women, their families and relationships.1 Women's health needs to be understood in the context of their psychosocial and cultural environment.2 Women's health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Women's health Rationale As 50.9% of Australian general practice consultations are with women aged 15 years or older, the gender specific primary health needs of women constitute a significant proportion of the general practice workload.3 Women tend to make most health care decisions for their family, tend to request more information than men, expect a greater role in decision making, and often have higher expectations of timeliness and quality of health care provision.4 Barriers to accessing general practice may include: general access and equity issues such as financial restrictions, lack of available child care, lack of access to transport cultural issues impacting on access to health care related to a lack of availability of the appropriate gender or culture of primary health provider and language barriers, and fear of discrimination and disclosure of sensitive issues for a wide range of marginalised and vulnerable groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, immigrant, same sex attracted, disabled, abused, homeless and refugee women. Gender specific health issues in general practice care across the women's lifespan often involve accessing multiple health care providers, including those in relation to reproductive issues. Regular preventive health care is also a large part of women's health.5 Specific health problems can be related to gender power differences such as lower incomes than men or being subjected to violence. The key principles for delivering quality women's health care in general practice include:6,7 understanding key gender differences in health and illness responding to the particular health needs of women associated with their social roles, responsibilities and position, and the health needs of their reproductive roles understanding the need for women to have access to sensitive health care and choice in health care provider being aware of common differences in practice styles of female general practitioners, including a tendency to provide longer consultations, more preventive health and mental health/counselling, and understanding the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of general practice in meeting women's health needs, including issues of equity and access to health information and services for women. Women's health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Women's health The five domains of general practice - women's health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship An understanding of the roles and position of women in Australian society is critical to delivering quality primary care. Similarly, quality care involves recognising that certain cultural groups will need to see only female doctors, and recognising that there are differing health beliefs and health seeking behaviours of women from diverse cultures. Gender, power and cultural differences can influence the dynamic of the patient-doctor relationship and consequent effective communication. The doctor's gender may also impact upon the disclosure of sensitive issues. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need to be able to manage a wide range of gender specific health conditions. An evidenced based knowledge of the physical, psychological, social and cultural factors impacting upon these conditions facilitates quality women's general practice health care. For example, understanding the impact of hormonal fluctuations on women's physical and mental health including menarche; menopause; premenstrual syndrome; pregnancy; breastfeeding; and postnatal changes, and that these occur within a framework of diverse cultural, social, economic, psychological and emotional factors impacting upon care. In the clinic, sensitivity to history and examination processes and respecting patient autonomy facilitates good patient care, eg. obtaining consent for physical examination including adequate explanation of its purpose, the use of screens, drapes and the role of chaperones. Population health and the context of general practice General practice care should address the health inequalities of socially disadvantaged groups of women including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women; women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, including those with language barriers; disabled women; women living in rural and remote areas; lesbian, bisexual and same sex attracted women; single mothers; injecting drug users; homeless women; refugees and asylum seekers; women in prison; and women who have experienced abuse at any stage of their life. Health promotion and public health prevention programs for women are diverse and need to incorporate gender sensitive strategies that incorporate the specific role of general practice in meeting these national health priorities. General practitioners need to be able to work in conjunction with the other women's health groups to effectively deliver quality care to women such as women's health centres, BreastScreen Australia, as well as community based organisations. Professional and ethical role The general practitioner needs to have respect for women's autonomy in their health care and decision making and be aware of his/her own values, and the potential impact upon his/her management decisions, especially in sensitive issues such as reproductive medicine. Effective management of the practical considerations of consent and confidentiality is facilitated by a gender sensitive trusting doctor-patient relationship. Ethical considerations include referring to female doctors on request, the use of chaperones when appropriate, reproductive ethics and the role of the general practitioner as a patient advocate. Women's health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Women's health Organisational and legal dimensions Attention to patient confidentiality and the recording of sensitive medical information are critical to protecting women's health, especially when in vulnerable situations such as intimate partner abuse. The general practitioner also needs to be aware of how legal obligations (ie. notification of child abuse, sexually transmissible infections) and antidiscrimination laws impact upon their role in caring for women.

All rights reserved\u0018Curriculum statement: Acute serious illnesses and trauma Definition Acute serious illnesses and traumatic injuries in general practice are conditions that require immediate care to relieve suffering. Some of these conditions may be life threatening, requiring urgent intervention. The core skills required for the competent general practice management of acute serious illness and trauma presentations are similar to those required to manage emergency department presentations, including major trauma. Acute serious illnesses and trauma can occur in patients of any age, may involve one or more body systems, and the context of the history may contribute to the required treatment response (eg. the collapsed patient or an accident site). Acute serious illnesses can be classified by body systems including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, immune system, dermatological and metabolic conditions.These presentations can also be classed into groups such as paediatric, obstetric, gynaecology, orthopaedic, surgical, general medical, psychiatric, ophthalmology, eye, and ear, nose and throat, among many others. Traumatic conditions (accidents and injury to self and others) can generally be divided according to the causes, eg. road trauma, environmental, toxicological, envenomation, assaults and occupational injuries. Acute serious illnesses and trauma: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Acute serious illnesses and trauma Rationale Emergency life threatening presentations in general practice are uncommon and the presentation of traumatic injuries to general practice is decreasing with a trend for hospital emergency departments being used as the first line of management for physical injuries.1 This creates a professional development challenge as general practitioners need to maintain skill levels even for the management of rare life threatening conditions, as well as for the more common conditions that present to general practice. General practitioners are more likely to see acute serious illness in the early stages when early recognition of warning signs, early investigation and referral may be life saving. Early treatment and patient education may help prevent disease exacerbations and avoid conditions deteriorating into more serious and potentially life threatening conditions. The diagnosis of acute serious illnesses may be clearer in patients presenting later in the natural history of the condition, but these patients may bypass the general practice and go to an emergency department. Trauma due to injury may vary in severity of presentation. Minor trauma such as musculoskeletal injuries and lacerations can be managed in general practice. As with serious acute illness, patients with major trauma are less likely to present to general practice and may go straight to emergency departments, but these may be staffed by GPs, especially in smaller or remoter rural hospitals. General practitioners in rural and remote areas require a higher level of emergency care skills due to lower numbers of general practitioners, reduced access to specialist services, and the logistic and geographic difficulties of evacuating seriously ill patients. There is also a higher incidence of farming, mining, industrial and motor vehicle accidents and greater access to firearms in isolated areas. General practitioners may also be required to treat acute conditions outside of the general practice or hospital setting such as a collapse on a street or an accident site. Acutely ill patients require stabilisation and transfer and admission to an acute care setting. This may involve advocating for the admission of a patient. Continuity of care for seriously ill patients requires the use of handover skills. Emergency situations may require general practitioners to provide clear instructions to staff, take control of situations and demonstrate the ability to lead the general practice or another team. This may occur outside the general practice setting such as an accident site where leadership skills in sometimes chaotic and dangerous settings are critical to effective emergency management. Personal safety issues for the general practitioner and practice staff are of more concern in emergency situations such as the management of acute psychiatric conditions or at the scene of an accident. General practitioners need to be prepared to manage complex medicolegal and ethical decisions in the acute care setting such as the management of the unconscious patient, the patient with impaired ability to give informed consent when ill, next of kin issues, and being sensitive to patient and next of kin choices that may not accord with best possible treatment outcomes. General practices also need to be able to prioritise patients according to treatment urgency. Within the context of regular general practice appointment systems, this will require the time management and organisational skills of both the GP and the general practice systems. Acute serious illnesses may occur outside of usual practice hours. General practitioners require skills in after hours care, including telephone triage, to ensure that patients have access to appropriate levels of care. Acute serious illnesses and trauma: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Acute serious illnesses and trauma The management of acute serious conditions has the potential to cause fear, fatigue and stress, and may be a significant risk to the doctor's own health and may impair clinical performance. General practitioners need to ensure that they have self care strategies in place to prevent and manage work related stress. Refer to other curriculum areas as required. Acute serious illnesses and trauma can occur in any medical specialty area, although there is a common set of management skills required in managing any emergency situation. For specific areas consult other curriculum statements including Aged care for management of acute fractures in the elderly; Children and young people's health for consent issues in an emergency if no accompanying parent; Chronic conditions for medical emergencies; Drug and alcohol medicine for drug overdose and trauma including legal implications; Men's health for traumatic injury; Mental health for acute psychoses and follow up to manage post-traumatic stress disorder; Multicultural health for the use of translators; Occupational health for emergency workplace injuries; Pain management for acute pain management principles; Sports medicine for acute musculoskeletal injuries; and Women's health for domestic violence, partner abuse, and pregnancy. Acute serious illnesses and trauma: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Acute serious illnesses and trauma The five domains of general practice - acute serious illnesses and trauma Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship General practitioners need to communicate clearly with patients and their carers when managing acute illnesses and trauma. During times of crisis, patients and carers are often distressed. Skilful, sensitive and accurate patient communication is critical in allaying anxieties and achieving successful management, especially in potentially life threatening situations. The patient may be unconscious or severely ill, impairing their ability to provide informed consent. Communicating with acutely ill patients may be influenced by age, and other factors including gender and ethnicity. Sensitive, empathic communication is also required when breaking bad news to patients and carers, in times of bereavement, for issues around certifying death, and coroner and police involvement. General practitioners providing out of hours emergency care will require appropriate telephone triage communication skills. Applied professional knowledge and skills Maintaining skill levels in general practice for the management of acute illnesses is educationally challenging as emergency presentations are not common, but require immediate skillful treatment by the clinician. Some general practitioners, such as those in rural and remote settings, may require a higher level of emergency general practice skills. Emergency general practice care involves the diagnosis and immediate management of a range of life threatening medical, surgical and psychiatric conditions. General practitioners need to be able to recognise and evaluate acutely ill adults and children, and identify which patients require immediate resuscitation and transfer to acute care settings. An appropriate level of care is required when transferring severely ill patients from the general practice to the acute care setting. Time management skills will be required to prioritise patients according to the seriousness of the patient's condition. Identifying which patients are likely to become progressively more ill and providing management advice, including how to access care if the condition deteriorates, helps prevent acute serious illness in the general practice setting. General practitioners may also have to deal with manipulative patients who request inappropriate emergency treatment. Out of hours management skills are required to manage acute serious illnesses and trauma, which may occur when the practice is closed. General practitioners will need to be able to diagnose and certify patient death. Population health and the context of general practice Although acute illnesses and trauma are not common in the general practice setting, knowledge of the range of presentations is necessary to be able to identify and manage acute illnesses and identify potentially life threatening situations. Cultural, occupational or other factors may affect management of acute illnesses and trauma in the general practice setting. Carers may be involved at the time of the acutely ill person's presentation in the general practice setting and there may be conflict between patients and their relatives. Education of the patient and carers may also help to prevent disease exacerbations and the frequency of preventable emergency presentations, eg. the use of preventive asthma medications to prevent asthma attacks. Professional and ethical role Complex ethical decisions often need to be made when managing acute illnesses and trauma, and the patient's choices and wishes need to be respected. Decisions are often best made in consultation with colleagues. Leadership is required in times of crisis such as the management of acute illness. General practice staff will look for clear direction and instruction in the management of acute illness, trauma and crisis situations. The general practitioner may need to act as an advocate for patients requiring admission when referral centres refuse admission where another doctor has not assessed Acute serious illnesses and trauma: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Acute serious illnesses and trauma the patient. The management of acute illnesses and trauma can engender fear and stress in the general practitioner, staff and others. Self care strategies need to be in place to reduce the potential health adverse effects on clinicians who care for acutely ill patients. This is for personal occupational health and safety, and to prevent stress related performance impairment. Colleagues in distress may require intervention and support. Organisational and legal dimensions Acute serious conditions and trauma may present to general practice at unexpected times, requiring that patient consultation times be prioritised according to the severity of the presenting illness. Triage procedures need to be in place to ensure that seriously ill patients are seen first, and the clinician will need to manage time accordingly. Seriously ill patients needing referral and transfer from general practice to the acute care setting require clear communication between the general practitioner and other health workers within and outside of the practice. Patient transport requires that an appropriate level of care is maintained throughout the journey to the acute care setting. Acutely ill patients need to be able to access appropriate out of hours general practice care and the management of acute illnesses and trauma may take place outside of the general practice setting at accident sites or in the patient home. Some serious conditions may present potential significant personal security risks to self, staff, patients and others, eg. in an acutely disturbed psychiatric patient or at an accident site. Patients will require follow up after referral to the acute care setting and some patients may require rehabilitation services to help recover from serious conditions. Handover skills and procedures are vital to ensure continuity of care for acutely ill patients. Some serious illnesses will require exercising legal responsibilities such as using mental health regulations, certifying death or contacting the police and coroner. Sick adults may have an impaired ability to give informed consent and there are special issues when obtaining informed consent for treating an ill child.

All rights reservedChronic diseases\u0018Curriculum statement: Chronic diseases Definition Chronic illness is the irreversible presence, accumulation or latency of disease states or impairments that involve the total human environment for supportive care, maintenance of function and prevention of further disability.1 Chronic diseases are defined by the World Health Organization as having one or more of the following characteristics: they are permanent, leave residual disability, are caused by nonreversible pathological alteration, require special training of the patient for rehabilitation, or may be expected to require a long period of supervision and care.2 A chronic condition is defined as including any form of chronic illness, disease or symptom complex or disability. A distinction needs to be made between chronic illness, which impacts on the wellbeing and the holistic functioning of the patient, and chronic disease, which may have little impact on the day-to-day life of the patient other than the medical management required to prevent future mortality and morbidity. For instance, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are chronic diseases that require effective management and monitoring to prevent future cardiovascular events, but these diseases are unlikely to have a significant impact on the daily wellbeing of the patient. Chronic diseases: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Chronic diseases Rationale Chronic disease represents a substantial and increasing portion of health care expenditure and practitioner workloads.3 The burden of chronic diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide, with chronic diseases contributing approximately 60% of the 56.5 million total reported deaths in the world and approximately 46% of the global burden of disease. The proportion of the burden of noncommunicable disease is expected to increase to 57% by 2020.4 The rate of chronic problems managed by general practitioners significantly increased from 46.5 to 50.8 per 100 encounters in 2004-2005,5 resulting in an estimated average annual national increase of 180 000 occasions of general practice management of a chronic problem (ie. 1.1 million more occasions of chronic problem management in 2004-2005 than in 1998-1999). Most working age Australians consider their health to be good, but results from the 2004-2005 Australian Bureau of Statistics National Health Survey indicate that 87% had at least one long term health condition.6 Most common among these were problems with eyesight, including long or short sightedness (affecting 32% and 27% respectively) and back and disc problems (21%). Other commonly reported conditions include hay fever and allergic rhinitis (19%), chronic sinusitis (12%), asthma (9%), arthritis (17%), partial hearing loss (10%) and hypertensive disease (11%). The prevalence of these diseases increases with age and nearly all people in Australia aged 65 years and over report at least one long term condition.7 Two chronic conditions, cardiovascular disease and cancer, constitute the two major causes of death in the Australian community. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare identifies the following conditions as having a large impact on the burden of disease in Australia: coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, depression, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, oral diseases, arthritis and osteoporosis.8 Chronic diseases: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Chronic diseases The role of the GP In Australia and internationally, traditional medical and social care based on the disease centred, acute hospital model has not met the needs of people with chronic illness, particularly with respect to psychosocial and long term care management. General practice care models have been shifting in recent times from professional and service centred management to care that emphasises the individual managing and living with chronic disease, illness and disability. This has been identified as helping health outcomes.9 In addition, the primary aim of chronic disease management shifts from cure to reducing the progression of symptoms and further complications. Patients with chronic disease will have varying needs for medical management and support, depending on the type of the disease, the disability that is associated with the disease and the stage of the disease. Health system responses, including general practice, will need to match the appropriate level of health care need (see Figure 1 ).10 Figure 1. Levels of health care need to be matched to the care needs level of chronic disease Chronic diseases: RationaleLEVEL 3 High disease complexity requiring care coordination LEVEL 2 High disease risk requiring disease/care management LEVEL 1 Lower level of chronic disease (70-80% population) requiring self management supportPREVENTION ACTIVITIES\u0018Curriculum statement: Chronic diseases Lifestyle modification, general practice and chronic disease There are many complex determinants of chronic disease, including social, economic and cultural factors. While some strategies that are needed to attenuate the effects of these factors, such as income support or population health initiatives require action at governmental and societal levels, modification of lifestyle factors is particularly important in managing chronic disease in general practice. Important common lifestyle factors in the development of chronic disease identified for change in general practice are the SNAP11 risk factors - smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity. Lessening exposure to these risk factors helps prevent and control chronic disease. Much of the reduction in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease in recent decades has been due to primary care strategies to reduce risk factors such as assisting with smoking cessation. A multidisciplinary approach to general practice chronic disease Care for patients with chronic illness is complex and needs to be supported by a systematic approach to self management, information management and multidisciplinary teamwork.12-14 The increasing prevalence of chronic disease has led to major changes in the methods of health care delivery and the role of different health professionals in delivering such care. The role of the general practitioner in chronic disease management varies over time but is central for most patients. General practitioners have an ongoing relationship with their patients, which provides a central point of coordination for long term chronic disease management. Continuity of care, which is a key feature of general practice, has been shown to improve the quality of care and health outcomes for patients with chronic diseases.15 This continuity of care is particularly important in the significant proportion of patients who have more than one chronic disease that cause the management of the disease to be relatively complex. General practitioners can coordinate care and are able to provide more holistic care for patients than the primarily disease focused care of the secondary and tertiary health care. The health care team includes the team within a general practice (general practitioners and practice nurses), other primary health care professionals (eg. pharmacists, physiotherapists, psychologists) and health care professionals from the secondary sector. In particular, practice nurses have an increasingly important role in the delivery of systematic care for chronic diseases in the general practice setting, and are similarly becoming better placed to participate in holistic rather than just disease specific care. In some locations and practices (eg. in rural and remote settings) the boundaries between primary and secondary care may be less distinct, and the general practitioner may be responsible for a greater proportion of the in-hospital patient care. Patients and their carers have an extremely important role in the management of chronic diseases. Supporting and educating patients in their self management is a critical role for general practitioners and general practice staff involved in the care of patients with chronic disease. National health priorities The Australian Government has established national goals, targets and strategies for better health outcomes into the next century. These focus on specific chronic problems that are most important in terms of their contribution to the burden of disease: cardiovascular disease, cancer, injury, mental illness, diabetes, asthma, musculoskeletal conditions.16 Other important priorities include immunisation and HIV/AIDS. These priorities are based on the burden of disease at a national level but the priorities within an individual clinical practice may vary. The priority for a general practitioner is always determined by the patients who present at each point in time and the practice population over the longer term.

Chronic diseases: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Chronic diseases The five domains of general practice - chronic diseases Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship General practitioners need skills in the following areas of chronic disease management: diagnosis: - use of appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication techniques (eg. open and closed questions, reflection, summarising) to gather additional history from patients and, when appropriate, family members, carers and/or other members of the multidisciplinary team, especially relating to lifestyle factors and chronic disease - nonjudgmental assessment of adherence to medication regimens and ability to sympathetically ascertain from the patient or, where appropriate, family members, carers and/or other members of the multidisciplinary team, factors contributing to adherence - explain need for specific physical examinations to be made in the context of a specific consultation at one point of time and obtain patient consent to perform these examinations or, when appropriate, the consent of a family member or carer - effective communication of diagnoses of chronic diseases including comorbidities, acute exacerbations, complications to patients and, when appropriate, family members, carers, and other members of the multidisciplinary team investigating conditions: - explain the role of tests and investigations (including pre and posttest counselling) at different time points in the disease course for prevalent chronic diseases (including at times of potential acute exacerbation or acute complication) and obtain patient consent to perform those tests/ investigations or, when appropriate, that of a family member or carer; this should include explanations when tests and investigations are not required - communicate test and investigation results in the context of particular chronic disease(s) to patients and, when appropriate, family members, carers, and/or other members of the multidisciplinary team management: - use a patient centred, supportive approach and develop long term relationships that help patients with chronic conditions to take as much responsibility as possible for their own chronic diseases health outcomes - understand the patient's knowledge, attitudes and meaning of their illness - understand the importance of patient centred communication in improving health outcomes - be responsive and empathetic to fluctuations in the physical and mental state of patients with chronic conditions -

All rights reservedDermatology\u0018Curriculum statement: Dermatology Definition General practice dermatology refers to the assessment, treatment and referral of disorders affecting the skin, nail, hair or mucous membranes. Dermatology: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Dermatology Rationale Skin conditions account for 15.6 out of every 100 patient encounters in general practice, accounting for 10.4% of total reasons of encounters making skin complaints one of the most common presentations in Australian general practices.1 In addition to being a major source of patient morbidity, skin conditions can be the first presentation of serious systemic disease including infection and malignancy. Skin cancers are a major and increasing source of premature death in Australia,2,3 highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis and management. Dermatology: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Dermatology The five domains of general practice - dermatology Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Clinicians must be able to take an accurate and complete history as skin conditions may reflect serious systemic or psychiatric disturbance. In addition, skin diseases may be influenced by lifestyle, work, psychological state, cultural practices, geography and travel. Skin conditions also impact on the patient's family and community. When chronic, their full assessment demands special attention to the long term physical, psychological and social impact of the disease on that patient. A patient's own conception of their disease can markedly affect the management and outcomes Applied professional knowledge and skills Clinicians require knowledge of regional anatomy relevant to skin surgery. They need to be able to describe skin lesions using standard dermatological terms. Clinicians also require knowledge of the clinical and historical features of major common diseases including: eczemas: atopic, practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Dermatology General practitioners need to be able to perform a competent skin examination, choose appropriate investigations and perform appropriate dermatological procedures. Such procedures may include: biopsy: shave, punch, and nail scrapings for fungal disease skin swabs for bacterial or viral disease dermoscopy. Clinicians must also be able to recognise life threatening emergencies snake bites. Population health and the context of general practice Population based preventive general practice medicine includes patient education about the avoidance of environmental hazards such as solar radiation, workplace or household exposures that may cause skin problems. Skin condition morbidity and mortality is significant, and public health measures exist to help reduce the health burden of adverse outcomes such as disease notification requirements. While each patient presenting with a skin condition is unique, some significant skin conditions are more common among particular groups within Australia. Indigenous Australians are prone to streptococcal skin disease and to secondary renal disease. Travellers can present with unusual skin problems such as cutaneous larvae migrans. The vulnerability to skin cancers including melanoma is increased in the highly immune suppressed, especially transplant recipients. Refugees may have tropical skin infections or dermatological manifestations of systemic diseases uncommon in Australia (eg. tuberculosis). Professional and ethical role Managing skin conditions may involve a team approach using specialist colleagues in dermatology, plastic surgery or skilled nursing staff. It is important to acknowledge the limitations within general practice and refer patients in a timely and appropriate manner when necessary. Organisational and legal dimensions Clinicians need to recognise which dermatological treatments are appropriate to the general practice setting, and to refer those which are not; referral strategies need to be in place. Accurate documentation of examinations, care and patient outcomes is an essential organisational requirement to ensure quality in patient care. Clinicians need to be aware of standards required for practical procedures (eg. infection control) and ensure that their practice complies with these.

All rights reservedDrug and alcohol\u0018Curriculum statement: Drug and alcohol Definition Drug and alcohol medicine in general practice potentially covers all drug and substance use disorders. There are significant areas of overlap with mental health, as comorbidity is common among substance users. Pain management and addiction issues, as well as doctor's health, tobacco and gambling problems, are also part of this field. Drug and alcohol: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Drug and alcohol Rationale Australia is a drug using society. National household surveys show that alcohol is consumed by the majority of the population and that cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug.1 Two legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco, are the two greatest causes of preventable disease and death in this country. These causes include lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco, while alcohol contributes to various cancers, alcoholic liver cirrhosis and road injuries. The role of general practitioners in drug and alcohol medicine General practitioners are being increasingly asked by government and public health authorities to become more involved in the diagnosis and management of drug and alcohol problems among their patients. Many general practitioners resist taking on this role.2 This may stem from lack of confidence and skills in the area, and a belief that intervention is doomed to failure. Other perceived barriers are lack of time, difficulties in raising the topic during the consultation, and having negative attitudes towards individuals with alcohol and other drug problems. Yet the results of interventions by general practitioners can be very significant.3 Brief interventions for alcohol abuse and opiate pharmacotherapies for heroin addiction are two common examples of effective general practitioner initiated treatments proven by multiple studies in Australia and overseas. Refer to other curriculum statements: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, Child and young person's health, Men's health, Mental health, Multicultural health and Women's health. Drug and alcohol: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Drug and alcohol The five domains of general practice - drug and alcohol Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Effective general practice communication in the management of drug and alcohol problems requires the ability to take a drug and alcohol history in a nonjudgmental and empathic manner, and to effectively engage a patient who has a substance use disorder. General practitioners also need to be able to effectively and appropriately communicate with significant others (eg. the family of person with a substance use disorder). General practitioners need to: be able to discuss common terms and quantities (eg. standard drinks consumed of alcohol and other common drugs used in our community) know what constitutes harmful alcohol and other drug use understand the reasons people have for using drugs apply harm reduction principles, especially in relation to the medical interview be able to use motivational interviewing skills and assess readiness to change early intervention in substance use disorders be able to use principles of providing objective health information on drugs to the patient and also to community groups if required develop appropriate boundaries in managing the patient's problems which take into account medicolegal responsibilities, limits of confidentiality, and a respectful, therapeutic relationship be aware of risks of inappropriate behaviour when dealing with patients who are socially stigmatised and who may have boundary problems but can be needy and manipulative at times be able to manage drug seeking behaviour be able to develop a long lasting therapeutic relationship for managing the variety of chronic medical and behavioural issues in the addiction lifecycle. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need a wide range of medical and psychological skills when managing drug and alcohol problems, as these substances can affect a wide range of physical and mental functions that directly impact upon successful management. General practice is well positioned to manage substance use disorders and the degree to which a particular general practitioner will manage these conditions will depend upon the level of skills they possess. General practitioners need to know where and when to refer patients, and clinicians working in communities with a high rate of substance use disorders may consider incorporating more specialised skills into their everyday work and this may involve further training in drug and alcohol medicine as required. In particular, general practitioners need to: be able to take a nonjudgmental medical history and perform physical examination relevant to the presenting drug and alcohol problem be familiar with the management of the main drugs of abuse in the Australian community be able to manage adolescent drug problems with affected persons and their parents, especially regarding cannabis, alcohol and psychostimulants safely prescribe medications for dealing with drug withdrawal from alcohol, heroin, cannabis and amphetamines according to skill level be able to assess and advise on comorbidities including hepatitis B and C, and HIV manage common coexisting psychiatric conditions, including personality disorders and how they interact with substance abuse issues Drug and alcohol: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Drug and alcohol apply the principles of management of substance use disorders to addictions (eg. gambling) assess patients with chronic pain and opiate dependence. Population health and the context of general practice Drug and alcohol problems are a major public health burden, and general practitioners are in an ideal position to help reduce drug related morbidity and mortality through: identifying drug and alcohol conditions in practice patients identifying those at high risk of drug and alcohol problems detecting and, where appropriate, managing mental illness in all drug and alcohol patients managing drug and alcohol disorders in conjunction with the carers, families (including children) and the local community managing drug and alcohol problems in patient subpopulations (eg. people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and men, women, and young people managing, where appropriate, the treatment of drug dependent colleagues, including issues of medical board involvement. Professional and ethical role The maintenance of clear professional roles and boundaries is a key principle in the management of drug and alcohol conditions in the general practice setting. In order to establish and maintain key professional and ethical outcomes, general practitioners need to: understand and practice appropriate confidentiality including confidentiality issues with a minor (and breaching this), including mandatory notification if needed display nonjudgmental attitudes when managing drug and alcohol conditions outline common responses in the health professional when caring for patients with mental illness, and strategies for self care demonstrate management of common drug and alcohol presentations, intoxication and withdrawal in a nonjudgmental and safe manner demonstrate ability to assess patient capacity and competency for making decisions when they are intoxicated maintain appropriate professional boundaries with patients who have drug or alcohol problems maintain professional boundaries and behaviours when managing health professionals with drug dependence where appropriate, participate in peer support activities directed at self care and support for colleagues regularly update knowledge of drug and alcohol legislation and policies that apply to local practice context. Organisational and legal dimensions The management of drug and alcohol conditions requires a multidisciplinary approach to patient management, often in conjunction with other medical and social service agencies. The prescribing of some drugs is also governed by strict legislative requirements that practitioners need to work within. In particular, general practitioners need to: practice confidentiality and consent in the practice setting and the circumstances in which these processes may be modified be familiar with drug and alcohol legislation and policies that apply to local practice context work as part of a multidisciplinary team work in conjunction with available local counselling services (eg. drug withdrawal services, forensic services, local psychiatric services, and drug and alcohol physicians and demonstrate ability to collaboratively with them).

While this curriculum refers to 'ear' medicine, this term is used to include the more commonly accepted terms 'ear, nose and throat' medicine. Eye problems in Australian general practice The burden of visual impairment is not distribut ed uniformly throughout the world: the least developed regions carry the largest share[3] with 87% of blindness occurring in developing countries.[4] Visual impairment is also uneq ually distributed across age groups, being largely confined to adults 50 years of age and older.[4] General practice eye consultations have increase d from 2.5 out of every 100 consultations in 2001-2002 to 2.8 in 2006-2007, and this trend a ppears to be statistically significant, perhaps reflecting the above discussed population trends. In addition, 8% of medical specialist referrals are to an ophthalmologist.[5] Blindness rates in Indigenous ad ults at 1.9% are 6.2 times hi gher than in the non indigenous population. Low vision occurs in 9.4% of I ndigenous adults, which is 2.8 times the rate of mainstream. Major causes of blindness in Indige nous adults include cataract (32% of cases of blindness), optic atrophy (14%), refractive error (14%), diabetic eye disease (9%) and trachoma (9%). Indigenous adults in very remote areas have more cataract and are less likely to have glasses but diabetic eye disease, u noperated cataract and poor reading vision are problems across the whole of Australia.[6] Indigenous children especially in remote area s have better vision than their mainstream peers. Overall, low vision occurs in 1.4% of Indigenous children (age standardised rate) which is five times less common than in mainstream children. Indigenous children in very remote areas have better vision and less refractive error but still suffer from trachoma.[6] General practitioners need to take into account their own skill level, the availability of specialised equipment that they are competent to use, the likelihood of patient injury from either the condition or intervent ion, and the appropriateness of referral before treating sense- threatening conditions. The ability for a general practitioner to treat eye conditions also depends upon availability of equipment. For example, general practitioners in emergency departments may have access to slit lamps, but limited access in other clinical settings. Similarly, rural and remote general practitioners may require a differing skill set to treat a different range of eye problems depending upon availability of resources. About 9.4% of Australians aged 55 or older ar e visually impaired and about 1.2% are blind. Almost 170,000 Australians aged 65 years or over have visual im pairment caused by eye disease. Of these, 51,000 people are classified as blind and almost 119,000 other people have low vision.[7] There is a strong associ ation between visual impairment and advancing age and vision problems will become increasingly important within the context of an ageing population. RACGP Curriculum Eye and ear medicine Curriculum Statement: Eye and Ear medicine - 2 Based on studies that have included an eye exam ination, cataract is the most common eye disease among Australians aged 65 or older, affecting over 1.2 million people (almost half of that population). This is followed by age-re lated macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. A further 398,400 older Australians are estimated to have early age-related maculopathy, which usually carries no symptoms, and are therefore at risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.[8] The increasing rate of Type II diabetes in t he Australian population will also contribute to the total burden of eye disease in Australia.[9] A distribution imbalance is also found with rega rd to gender throughout the world with females having a significantly higher risk of having vi sual impairment than males.[4] Notwithstanding the progress in surgical intervention that has been made in many countries over the last few decades, cataract remains the leading cause of vi sual impairment in all regions of the world, except in the most developed countries.[4] In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the major eye conditions remain diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, the need to wear glasse s and, for some regions, trachoma, trichiasis, and trauma.[10] Ear problems in Australian general practice In 2008, ear problems constituted 3.8 out of ev ery 100 general practice consultations, with 1.5 of these being for ear pain.[5] Of the 3.8 per 100 encounters, 1.2 of these encounters were due to acute otitis media/myringitis, and 0.8 due to ear wax problems. In addition, 6.4% of medical specialist referrals are to an ear, nose, and throat specialist.[5] In 2005, there were an estimated 3.55 million Australians with hearing loss.[11] The early detection of hearing loss in children is critical for the development of speech and is a critical role for general practitioners. Around 3.5 out of every 1000 children below the age of 14 have some hearing impairment.[11] The overall prevalence rates of hearing loss in Australian adults are 26.3% for males 15 years and over, 17.1% for females 15 years and over, and 21.6% for the adult population overall which equates to more than one in every four men and more than one in every five Australian adults who have hearing loss.[11] Around 60% of adults with hearing loss are males which is attributed to greater workplace noise exposure for men than women. Approximat ely half of hearing impaired people are in the working age population (aged 15-64 years), and 74% of people over the age of 70 years have some hearing loss.[11] The level of ear disease and hearing loss among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remains higher than that of the general Austra lian population, particularly among children and young adults. Ear infection, otitis media (OM), part icularly in suppurative forms, is associated with hearing impairment, which affects language development and can cause learning difficulties in children. Permanent hearing lo ss can occur when not adequately treated and followed up. Otitis media can affect Indigenou s babies within weeks of birth and a high proportion of children will continue to suffe r from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) throughout their developmental years.[12] The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Isl ander Social Survey (NATSIHS) 2008 reported that one in ten Indigenous children aged 4-14 years experienced an ear or hearing problem. Ear/hearing problems were reported by 12% of Indigenous people who participated in the 2004-2005 NATSIHS. Complete or partial d eafness was reported by 9% of Indigenous people living in both remote and non-remote areas, but the level of otitis media was higher for Indigenous people living in remote areas (4%) than for those living in non-remote areas (2%). After adjusting for differences in the age struct ures of the two populations, otitis media was around 2.8 times more common for Indigenous people than for non-Indigenous people.[12] For information on appropriate managem ent for Indigenous Australians visit the Aboriginal Health and Torres Strait Islander health curriculum statement . RACGP Curriculum Eye and ear medicine Curriculum Statement: Eye and Ear medicine - 3 THE FIVE DOMAINS OF GENERAL PRACTICE \u2014 EYE AND EAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE PATIENT -DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP Communication strategies need to acknowledge the needs of patients with hearing and visual disabilities. General practitioners need to ensure that their diction and volume of speech is suitable for patients with hearing disabilities. Being able to access Auslan interpreters and to engage in a three way communication or to access other appropriate means of communications assistance is an essential skill when consulting with patients with a hearing disability. Clinicians need to be aware that a deficit in one or more senses may impact on a patient's ability to understand medical communications or their ability to access health services. A patient centred, supportive approach and the development of long term relationships help patients with hearing and/or visual disab ilities to access effective general practice care. APPLIED PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS General practitioners require the following knowle dge for the effective general practice care of eye and ear conditions: the principles of diagnosis, management and m onitoring of acute, sub-acute and chronic eye and ear conditions the importance of accurate documentation of visual acuity, its impact on a patient's life and the importance of monitoring changes in visual acuity the indications and use of prescription and over-the-counter medicati ons in the treatment and prevention of common eye and ear conditio ns; for example, the use of wax softening agents, use of pH altering drops in chronic otit is externa, avoidance of steroid eye drops unless under the care of a specialist colleague the \"red flag\" diagnoses that require urgent and immediate specialist advice or treatment to prevent hearing/visual loss or misdiagnosis of potential carcinoma the increasing use of alternative and complementary medicines and how they may adversely impact on vision and hearing the epidemiology of tumours effecti ng eyes, ears, nose and throat areas the relevant anatomy, physiology, pat hology and psychology appropriate to the management of common eye and ear conditions, the current best evidence for their management and the potential harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological forms of treatment. General practitioners require the following skills for the effective general practice care of eye and ear conditions: the skills of history taking for eye and ear medicine including appropriate documentation of positive and negative findings a systematic and competent examination of the eyes including the appropriate use of an ophthalmoscope, as well as the use of visual acuity testing, visual field testing and manoeuvres for everting the upper lid a systematic and competent examination of the ears including the appropriate use of an auroscope (otoscope) and other equipment such as tuning forks in the assessment of hearing, or Valsalva manoeuvres and pneumat oscopy for the detection of ear drum movement RACGP Curriculum Eye and ear medicine Curriculum Statement: Eye and Ear medicine - 4 the ability to manage potentially urgent eye and ear conditions such as glaucoma and epistaxis the ability to detect and safely remove foreign bodies in the eye, ear, nose or throat, and to manage any residual corneal ulcer or rust. POPULATION HEALTH AND THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL PRACTICE General practitioners should encourage behavioural changes such as smoking cessation for the prevention of age-related macular degeneration and orolaryngeal cancers. General practitioners are required to be familiar with international and government policies for treatment and prevention of dise ases that impact upon patients' vision and hearing and have knowledge of the increased burden of disease in specific populations to help target appropriate screening and diagnostic strategies. A knowledge of policies that aim to promote health, and prevent or reduce the loss of function from illness, injury and disability and changes in these policies may have implications for general practice eye and ear care.

All rights reservedMental health\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health Definition General practice mental health in Australia covers the assessment, management and ongoing care of the full range of mental health disorders seen in the community. General practice is also increasingly involved in the early intervention and prevention of mental disorders1,2 and the optimisation of mental health.3,4 While general practitioners commonly see high prevalence disorders such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders, most will also encounter a range of less common mental health problems including psychosis. In addition to obvious mental illness, general practitioners also see and manage lesser degrees of mental health conditions and distress as part of the full spectrum of mental health seen in the community. A mental disorder is a diagnosable illness that significantly interferes with an individual's cognitive, emotional or social abilities.5 Mental disorders differ in type and severity and some major mental disorders are significant public health issues, including depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, psychosis and dementia. Mental disorders are diagnosed by standardised criteria such as those contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)6 and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th revision)7 (ICD-10). The term mental illness is synonymous with mental disorder. A mental health problem also interferes with a person's cognitive, emotional or social abilities, and to a lesser extent than a mental disorder. Mental health problems are more common mental complaints and include mental ill health temporarily experienced as a reaction to life stressors. Mental health problems are less severe and of shorter duration than mental disorders but may develop into a mental disorder. The distinction between mental health problems and mental disorders is not well defined and is made on the basis of severity and duration. Comorbid mental health conditions are defined as mental health problems that present in people with another condition. Patients may present with other complaints, eg. somatic symptoms for which their mental health problem is a comorbidity. People with mental illness have all of the conditions that people without mental health problems have, and so comorbidity is a common general practice presentation. For these patients, the mental health disorder can complicate the management of their other conditions which needs to be understood and dealt with by the general practitioner. Available evidence demonstrates that persons with mental illness still struggle on a daily basis to access appropriate health care or be treated with respect or dignity when they do enter our health care systems.8 Patients whose primary problem is a mental health disorder also deserve the full range of care including preventive services which is offered in general practice. Mental health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health Rationale Mental health problems and mental disorders are estimated to affect over 20% of the adult population and 10-15% of young people in any one year.9 In 2004-2005, there were an estimated 10 million mental health related general practice encounters.10 The burden of disease due to mental disorders is 15% of the total burden of disease in Australia - third in importance after heart disease and cancer,11 and may be increasing. Depression was the tenth most frequent problem12 managed in 1998-1999 and has now increased to the fourth most common condition requiring treatment in 2005-2006.13 The 1997 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing14 detected that 1 in 7 adults met criteria for a current mental health disorder, and 1 in 15 was moderately to severely disabled by this, and half the people with a disorder did not seek help. Intentional self harm or suicide accounted for 26% of injury related deaths in Australia in 200415 and is a major form of death for people with mental disorders. In Australia, the rate of youth suicide peaked in the 1990s and is now decreasing. However, after transport accidents, intentional self harm remains the leading cause of death for young people in the 15-24 years age group accounting for 20% of deaths.16 People with mental illness have an elevated risk of preventable natural and unnatural death 17 with psychiatric outpatients being twice as likely to die as the general population from diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, which has often gone undetected before death.18 Despite a steady decline in cardiovascular mortality for most Australians, people with mental illness have received little or no benefit from this progress.19 Clinical depression also predicts increased mortality for those who have need of general medical inpatient care20 with comorbid clinical depression and coronary heart disease, especially having been associated with increased mortality.21 Many other chronic disorders have been found to be associated with increased depressive morbidity.22 Health related quality of life measures suggest the effects of depression are comparable to those of arthritis, diabetes and hypertension, and that depression and chronic medical illnesses interact to amplify the effects of the medical illness.23 Managing depression as a chronic disease has been shown to improve emotional and physical functioning reflecting the reality of high rates of symptom recurrence and sustained functional impairment.24 Special mental health conditions (including effects of discrimination) affect people from diverse backgrounds, including issues of gender differences, cultural and linguistic diversity, poverty and issues of sexuality including sexual preference. The role of general practitioners in mental health Although mental health work is multidisciplinary, general practitioners are often the first point of contact for patients experiencing mental health problems, including when patients do not disclose their mental health problems. In additional, general practitioners have been reported as the most common providers of mental health services.25 General practitioners require skills to be able to: perform a behavioural, emotional and cognitive assessment within the context of a patient's physical findings, including background chronic and current acute problems, with knowledge of their current personal and social circumstances and past experiences identify early warning signs provide appropriate care, and provide continuity of care - a key factor in the successful treatment of people with mental illness. Mental health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health Successful general practice management of mental problems requires skills in chronic disease management26 and willingness to work in formal liaison with other mental health providers27 to enhance patient outcomes. Stigma is a key mental health issue for general practitioners. Many patients will be reluctant to disclose their mental health issues because they regard these problems as stigmatising and prefer not to discuss them. Often the general practitioner may be the first health professional to identify a mental health problem in someone who is presenting with a somatic complaint and has been reluctant to discuss mental health issues. Managing such patients, including appropriate referral, may take time and effort for the general practitioner. General practice patients require competence in instituting initial management which may require using telephone advice from local mental health services or national general practitioner psychiatric liaison help lines such as GP Psych Support.28 If accessing appropriate local mental health services is difficult, the general practitioners may be required to both institute and continue management of mental health disorders. Many psychological disorders in general practice are self limiting physical illnesses and the general practitioner's role in these situations is to explain, ease distress, and act to speed recovery if possible.29 This requires background knowledge of normal and adaptive psychological reactions to life stressors, commencing from undergraduate education and updated over a general practitioner's lifetime. Patients prefer to be assessed for mental health problems by their general practitioner rather than a mental health specialist.30 General practice factors that can inhibit a patient from presenting emotional problems in a consultation include poor general practitioner interview behaviours, perceived lack of time and believing that the general practitioner can do nothing to help.31 Patient improvement in depression has been linked to the strength of the therapeutic relationship32 and general practice continuity of care may be an advantage where a previous doctor-patient relationship may have been well established already. There is also continuity between communication styles in everyday general practice consultations and communication in consultations with patients presenting emotional problems and psychotherapeutic communication.33 The general practitioner needs to learn time management skills to assist in managing patients presenting with mental health disorders who are often complex, involving considerable time and effort. Establishing the necessary rapport for effective patient management in these conditions also takes time. General practitioners may find difficulty in accessing appropriate local mental health services, particularly in rural and regional areas, and may be required to both institute and continue management of mental health disorders in such areas, whether or not they have a particular interest in mental health. Comorbidity of mental health conditions with drug and alcohol problems is another common general practice presentation. The majority of patients with serious drug and alcohol problems also have mental health disorders and visa versa, which complicates the management of both sets of disorders. The use of multidisciplinary teams in mental health services creates communication challenges between the general practice and mental health services participating in case discussion and care planning. Establishing effective communication and better links between general practitioners and Mental health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health mental health services facilitates mutual patient care. These links are being established though a series of government initiatives. General practitioners with more experience in managing mental problems and with relevant postgraduate qualifications have been shown to cope better with difficult mental health problems, including patients without medically explained symptoms, somatisation and hypochondria.34,35 In future general practitioners may well be leaders of primary health teams in their own practices, including teams that deal with mental health problems. The general practitioner may need to develop skills to lead such teams, including appropriate communication and the delegation of responsibility. Future trends in mental health care delivery will expect general practitioners to contribute to accessing providers of evidenced based psychotherapy after formulation of a care plan and utilising technological innovations36-38 that have proven feasible in Australian general practice.39 Refer to curriculum statements: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health; Aged care, Children's and young person's health; of general and Women's health. Mental health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health The five domains of general practice - mental health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Effective communication involves demonstrating appropriate respect and concern for patients with mental illness and their families and carers; establishing rapport and appropriate patient-doctor relationship boundaries; identifying relevant belief systems and cultural issues; and managing emotionally charged encounters, and the emotional impact of illness on the patient and the multidisciplinary health care team. Effective communication also helps manage the stigma associated with mental health and facilitates disclosure of patients' mental health issues. Effective communication involves: working with patients, acknowledging their dignity and respecting their attitudes, values and beliefs, using different counselling approaches, providing support, and outlining appropriate referral agencies (eg. for bereavement, interpersonal stress management, and angry/frightened patients), and if appropriate, working as part of a multidisciplinary team in the case management of people with mental health problems. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need to develop skills in mental health assessment - developing a mental health plan and ongoing review of patients with mental health problems. This is not only for patients with mental illness - it is for all patients including those with chronic disease. General practitioners who have difficulty in accessing appropriate local mental health services may be required to both institute and continue management of mental health disorders, especially in rural and remote areas. General practitioners need to be able to: recognise and assess mental health problems in the early stages of illness be aware of normal and adaptive psychological reactions to life's stressors take a mental health history that emphasises the patient's strengths and enhances self esteem perform a behavioural, emotional and cognitive assessment within the context of a patient's physical findings, including background chronic and current acute problems, with knowledge of their current personal and social circumstances and past experiences manage the comorbidity of mental and physical illness or problems differentiate a patient's reaction to normal life stresses from overt mental illness outline the indicators and management of at risk people which includes an understanding of the importance of early intervention and continuity of care help the patient manage normal life events to enhance coping skills and prevent secondary morbidity discuss the principles of family therapy, group therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy and psychosocial education outline the principles of handling a mental health crisis initiate appropriate counselling including the use of focused psychological strategies while identifying their own limitations coordinate the care of mental health patients at a level which is appropriate to the context in which they are working demonstrate the appropriate use of psychotherapeutic agents, and outline the principles of detoxification and withdrawal. Mental health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health Population health and the context of general practice Knowledge of risk factors and prevalence of mental illness enables early identification and management of mental health problems. Clinicians can also use this knowledge to institute screening and active case finding to help the early management of mental conditions. Mental health promotion and education help general practitioners assist patient populations in preventing and managing their mental health problems. This includes: recognising the importance of detecting and assessing mental health problems in the early stages of illness practising mental health promotion and preventive approaches, in line with the recommendations in the national mental health policies (eg. the National Mental Health Strategy40 or National Action Plan on Mental Health 2006-201141 acknowledging issues such as comorbidity with drug and alcohol problems acknowledging and addressing stigma affecting persons affected by mental health acknowledging cultural and linguistic issues, and special issues for patient subpopulations, eg. women, young people, children, the elderly and sexual minorities, and recognising and addressing the needs of carers, siblings and the children of those with mental health problems (eg. issues relating to dysfunctional families, stepfamilies, scapegoating, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and psychogeriatric patients). Professional and ethical role Knowledge of the role of the general practitioner in mental health services helps effective delivery of services within the multidisciplinary team, and general practitioners require an awareness of the roles of all team members to facilitate care planning and ongoing review. This includes relationships not only with the patient, but also with their carers, family and significant social supports. Management of mental health patients requires particular attention to the general practitioner's professional boundaries, particularly in the areas of time management and in managing transference issues.In addition to normal requirements, confidentiality and consent issues are important in mental health care due to the stigma associated with mental health and the potential for discrimination. The general practitioner may need to develop professional skills such as leading teams, appropriate communication and the delegation of responsibility when working in a multidisciplinary team or in shared care arrangements. General practitioners require a commitment to ongoing education in mental health which may include the need to participate in ongoing peer support programs. All doctors have a responsibility to recognise signs of mental illness in themselves and their colleagues, and to accept and provide appropriate support and referral. Key skills include: describing how own personal values, attitudes, and beliefs may impact on the patient-doctor relationship and subsequent management understanding the need for, and maintaining confidentiality in, the management of patients with mental health issues adhering to the appropriate boundaries in the patient-doctor relationship and avoiding behaviours that would breach these boundaries with mentally ill patients recognising and taking into account their own strengths, vulnerabilities, personal values, gender and cultural issues, attitudes and beliefs in relation to mental health management discussing how to increase community awareness of mental illness as a means of reducing the stigma outlining self care strategies and avenues for debriefing when caring for mental health patients, and Mental health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Mental health recognising signs of mental illness in colleagues and providing debriefing, support and appropriate referral. Organisational and legal dimensions Practice procedures need to ensure appropriate processes are in place for monitoring and ongoing patient review. General practitioners need to: learn time management skills to assist in managing mental health disorders which are often complex be able to work effectively with available community and hospital resources in the care of patients with mental health problems outline the current mental health legislation and procedures for the certification of involuntary patients (eg, power of attorney, Mental Health Act , Guardianship and Administration Board Act, Freedom of Information Act ), and discuss policy guidelines on accessibility, confidentiality and continuity of care.

Mental health: ReferencesRACGP Curriculum Project Musculoskeletal medicine Curriculum Statement: Musculoskeletal medicine \u2014 1 DEFINITION Musculoskeletal medicine embodies all medical disciplines that deal with the diagnosis of acute and chronic conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system in adults and children including the psychosocial impact of these conditions. Musculoskeletal conditions may result from a wide variety of processes including injury, inflammation, infection, metabolic or endocrinological conditions, and the normal ageing process. Musculoskeletal medicine incorporates aspect s of orthopaedics, rheum atology, rehabilitation medicine and pain medicine, and the emerging specialty, also known as musculoskeletal medicine or orthopaedic medicine . Musculoskeletal or orthopaedic medicine focuses on common ailments such as whiplash, back and buttock pain where findings on radiological investigation do not often correlate strongly with the clinical presentation requiri ng a detailed clinical examination to assess biomechanical dysfunction and to interpret referred pain patterns. This subspecialty provides professional links between medical practitioners and allied health disciplines such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, osteopathy , chiropractic, myot herapy and exercise physiology. Musculokeletal conditions cause a significant pain burden in the community that often involve complex psychological processes. Psychological conditions can result in somatic pain and many people with chronic pain have co-morbid psychological diagnoses. The successful management of musculoskeletal conditions requires a holistic, patient centred approach. The area of musculoskeletal medicine is closely related to other general practice curriculum areas such as Sports medicine , Pain management, Occupational health and safety and Research and critical thinking . Many patients with musculoskeletal pain or conditions also access alternative forms of medicine. For this see the curriculum statement Integrative medicine . RATIONALE Musculoskeletal conditions are responsible for a major burden in the Australian health system affecting around 31% of the population; that is more than 6 million Australians. Globally, one in four people report chronic musculoskeletal impairments in both less and more developed countries and these conditions consume enormous health care and social resources representing almost 25% of the total cost of ill ness in western countries.[1] In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that musc uloskeletal diseases were the fifth largest cause of global years of life lost due to disabilit y, accounting for more than 5% of the total.[2] Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common cause of severe long term pain and physical disability[3] and are major causes for work limitation and early retirement[3]. Back pain, joint disorders (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) and osteoporosis have the greatest contribution to this burden and have be en targeted as a national health priority area with a national action plan by the Department of Health and Ageing.[4] A common misconception is that chronic musc uloskeletal conditions are inevitable and an unavoidable consequence of ageing. In reality, the burden of arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions can be reduced through intervention at various points along the disease continuum including prevention, early diagnosis, prompt initiation of treatment, ongoing management and timely access to joint replacement.[4] In addi tion, children and you ng people can be affected by chronic musculoskeletal conditions, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These misconceptions may lead to missed opportuni ties to address potentially modifiable risk factors, prevent or slow progression, improve management and optimise health-related quality of life. RACGP Curriculum Project Musculoskeletal medicine Curriculum Statement: Musculoskeletal medicine \u2014 2 Musculoskeletal conditions and Australian general practice General practice plays an important role with in the Australian health care system in the prevention, early detection and m anagement of chronic disease[5] including musculoskeletal disease. Musculoskeletal conditions accounted for 15.4% of general practice encounters in 2008-2009, being the third most common reason for presentation. Back complaints accounted for 3.4% of reasons for presentation followed by knee (1.4%), foot/toe (1.2%), shoulder (1.1%), neck (1.0%), leg (1.0%) and other (0.8%).[6] The nature of general practice provides the opportunity for early screening for chronic diseas e and enables preventable risk factors to be addressed early. For example, the early diagnosis and managemen t of rheumatoid arthritis greatly reduces long term joint damage and improves outcome s. General practitioners need to be able to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis as early as possible in order to optimise outcomes for patients.[5] Up to 18% of women and 10% of men aged over 65 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis characterised by joint pain and mobility impairment. Comprehensive assessment leading to an early diagnosis and appropriate intervention can significantly relieve signs and symptoms and expedite joint replacement when required.[7] A half of all women and a third of all men will suffer minimal trauma fractures secondary to osteoporosis.[8] Early identification and mana gement can prevent many of the longer term disastrous consequences.[8] The impact of musculoskeletal conditions on quality of life is large, not only in terms of activity limitation and functional restrictions but also from pain and self-perceived state of health. For example, about 10% of people with rheumatoid arthritis reported very high levels of psychological distress.[4] Independent living of a large proportion of people with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions is compromised and many experience psychosocial changes in their lives such as a change in marital status an d employment as a result of their disease or condition.[4] Through both direct intervention and promotion of self management strategies, the general practitioner clearly has a critical role in t he management of these and other musculoskeletal conditions, which contin ue to increase in incidence and prevalence with our ageing population and poor health, secondary to obesity and life style choices. Note: this curriculum statement is consistent with the musculoskeletal medicine educational requirements for Australian general practitioners according to the Australian National Musculoskeletal Core Competencies;[9] and the global curriculum recommendations of the International Bone and Joint Decade Undergraduate Curriculum Group[10]. In addition, this statement is also consistent with the muscul oskeletal medicine syllabus of the Australasian Faculty of Musculoskeletal Medicine[11] and the evidenced based Clinical guidelines for Musculoskeletal Diseases of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.[12] RACGP Curriculum Project Musculoskeletal medicine Curriculum Statement: Musculoskeletal medicine \u2014 3 THE FIVE DOMAINS OF GENERAL PRACTICE \u2014 MUSCULOSKELETAL MEDICINE COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND PATIENT -DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP History taking is particularly important in diagnosing musculoskeletal conditions because presentations of pain are common and the subj ective nature of pain requires that the consultation process initially focus on taking a good pain history. This might involve history taking from the patient's family members, carers, em ployers and others requ iring skills for the efficient eliciting of information while simu ltaneously employing empathy and patience with patients suffering pain. In addition, many musc uloskeletal general practice presentations present with vague or non-specific symptoms, re quiring careful history taking to maximise the information to be gained from the patient. As the most common symptom is pain, treatment outcomes are directed at pain reduction as well as improving function, modifying disease progression and decreasing the risk of future loss of function or recurrence. This requires empathetic and motivational interviewing skills to increase the potential for developing a sound therapeutic partnership with the patient. Communication with the patient's family members, carers, employers and others is often needed for successful disease monitoring and planning rehabilitation options. Prevention of pain and dysfunction in common musculoskeletal c onditions includes the ability to communicate prevention strategies including ben efits and risks of lifes tyle factors, physical activity, minimising immobility, and avoidance of specific risks. Clinicians need appropriate communication skills for patient education and enhancing self management which are key strategies in effect ive musculoskeletal general practice care. APPLIED PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE & SKILLS A familiarity with a wide range of musculoskele tal conditions is nece ssary to successfully manage the diversity of musculoskeletal general practice presentations including assessment techniques, differential diagnosis and disease management. This involves a thorough knowledge of the basic sciences, normal versus abnormal function, and a biopsychosocial/multidisciplinary approach to care. While evidence based medicine is critical to managing musculoskeletal conditions, many treatments in medicine continue to be based on experience and empiricism. Patient safety concerns such as the overriding principle of \"f irst do no harm\" also apply to the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. POPULATION HEALTH AND CONTEXT OF GENERAL PRACTICE Musculoskeletal conditions are common genera l practice presentations and their early diagnosis and management not only improves patient quality and quantity of life, but is a major public health intervention to reduce community morbidity and mortality, and their economic impact. A knowledge of the epidemiology and patterns of musculoskeletal diseases helps the early diagnosis of many conditions. The chronicity and morbidity associated with many musculoskeletal conditions requires work, family and social factors to be considered in their general practice management. General pr actice identification of risk factors for musculoskeletal disease and disease prevention also helps to reduce musculoskeletal-related morbidity and mortality. PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL ROLE Musculoskeletal conditions require a biopsychosocial approach to pain care often requiring an ability to work with other health professionals. Clinicians may be required to consult with employers, and appropriate professional boundaries need to be maintained (see curriculum statement Occupational health and safety ). RACGP Curriculum Project Musculoskeletal medicine Curriculum Statement: Musculoskeletal medicine \u2014 4 Treatment of musculoskeletal pain problems requi res an understanding that patients will often seek help from alternative and allied heath pr actitioners using treatment paradigms which might differ widely from the traditional medical model. Clinicians need to develop strategies for working with patients using nonmedical paradigms to maintain doctor-patient relationships while maintaining an awareness of potential for harm as a result of other therapies. ORGANISATIONAL AND LEGAL DIMENSIONS Many general practice musculoskeletal consul tations involve legal as pects such as work related, motor vehicle, and assault injury ca ses. These require a basic knowledge of the prevailing legal system within each jurisdiction. Medical practitioners are often required to make assessments and pronouncements which impac t in a significant manner on the patient and their legal outcomes. Clinicians need to be aware of the various health practitioner registration boards to be able to distinguish between registered and non-r egistered musculoskeletal therapists.

All rights reservedOccupational health and safety\u0018Curriculum statement: Occupational health and safety Definition Occupational health (occupational medicine) is the branch of medicine dealing with all aspects of the relationship between the work environment and the health of workers,1 with the aim of improving health and minimising injuries in the workplace. General practitioners can bring medical expertise to the human interface of the workplace to provide improved outcomes in both physical and mental health, the reduction and elimination of preventable accident or injury, and to reduce and prevent the potential for negative health impacts from the work environment. Occupational health and safety: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Occupational health and safety Rationale In Australia, around 4% of general practice patient encounters are work related, with nearly 63% being men and 37% being women. Nearly all of these patients (96%) are aged 15-64 years and half are in the 25-44 years age group. Around 17% of work related encounters were with people from non-English speaking backgrounds.2 Typical general practice occupational health activities traditionally include accident prevention, injury management, workers' compensation, and pre-employment and occupational health medical examinations. In reality, the scope of occupational medicine in the general practice setting goes beyond just these tasks. General practitioners are well situated to give advice on the most diverse of working environments, from a sterile laboratory in a large company to a farmer on the family farm or the probable health outcomes of manufacturing processes. They may not only treat, but may also anticipate biomechanical sequelae for operators of equipment, often specifically engineered for a particular process with little regard for the impact on worker health. The list of potential occupational health and safety roles for the general practitioner are great: fitness to operate equipment like forklifts or tractors; the effects of drugs, either legal or illegal, in the workplace; first aid including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); information seminars; safety drills; and interpretation of material safety data sheets. Some general practitioners may be involved in monitoring the health effects of short and long term exposure to noxious substances. With the increasing rates of work related stress, doctors not only have a treatment role, but also have a role in implementing strategies to reduce its incidence. General practitioners have a central role in the quest for a safer, more effective and fulfilling workplace with the potential to improve the health and welfare of a significant proportion of our society. The workplace is one of the few places in society outside of schools where people gather on a regular basis often in large numbers, providing an ideal opportunity for health promotion and wellness programs. General practitioners are ideally placed to play a pivotal role in brokering positive outcomes and preventing the spiral into chronic incapacity with its attendant consequences. General practitioners are in a unique position to act as a moderator between the patient and employer to ensure the best possible outcomes for both parties. Specific occupational health skills are needed to maximise the special opportunities that general practitioners have to effect good health outcomes. Poorly managed work related conditions may cause great suffering not only in the patient and the employer, but may also disadvantage the patient's family. People may become unemployable and families can disintegrate. General practitioners are also often employers and need to be aware of their own occupational health and safety obligations towards employees. Refer also to curriculum statements: Practice management for areas of occupational health and safety within the general practice workplace; Population health and public health for health promotion programs which may occur in a workplace setting; Philosophy and foundation of general practice for issues of confidentiality and privacy; and Multicultural health for successful crosscultural communication including the correct use of translators. Occupational health and safety: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Occupational health and safety The five domains of general practice - occupational health and safety Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship General practitioners need to integrate knowledge of the specific confidentiality and privacy demands of work related injuries into patient management. General practitioners must communicate with the patient's employer, workplace, insurance agencies, work rehabilitation providers and a wide range of health professionals. The general practitioner needs to be aware of the potential for communication conflicts between these agencies and the patient. The general practitioner is in an ideal situation to facilitate good outcomes for both the patient and the employer. Good communication with the patient and all parties involved in the injury management is critical to prevent adverse outcomes for the patient their employer. Patients from non-English speaking backgrounds may require translators during consultations and general practitioner communication skills should meet the requirements listed in the Multicultural health curriculum statement to ensure cultural competence when managing work related injury and illness. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need a basic understanding of the role of proactive risk management in the workplace to prevent physical and mental work related illness and injury. General practice aspects management of occupational medicine may include medical management of work related illness and injuries, administrative and legal involvement with work insurance authorities, accident prevention, proactive risk management including pre-employment medicals and onsite assessment. The early intervention and active management of work related illnesses and injuries utilises evidence based medicine, however, successful patient outcomes requires both the knowledge and skill to manage not only the medical condition but also the expectations of all stakeholders. When making management plans, general practitioners need to be aware of the realities of the patient's workplace, the available resources and the prevailing culture. While complying with legislation, company cultures of worker safety may vary between industries and workplaces, as may the human resources and management skills available. The opportunities for satisfactory outcomes are more readily grasped by those doctors who are aware of these issues when negotiating the best patient outcomes, especially when the patient has little or no portable skills. Population health and the context of general practice General practitioners are well placed to administer workplace health programs, eg. immunisations or the prevention of health through the reduction of potential for injury or substance exposure or general health promotion and lifestyle programs. General practitioners may influence workplace cultures to adopt practices consistent with long term beneficial health worker outcomes that may have significant flow on benefits to the wider community. General practitioners need to understand that work related health disability has a wider impact beyond the worker to the patient's family and supports. Being unable to work causes hardship and suffering, especially in people from disadvantaged socioeconomic and educational backgrounds being particularly vulnerable to the negative impact of unemployment, financial hardship and family breakdown. Occupational health and safety: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Occupational health and safety Professional and ethical role Successful management of work related injuries requires a general practitioner to work within a multidisciplinary team, including work insurance authorities. General practitioners need to be especially familiar with the medical and legal issues in relation to medical certification. General practitioners may need to act as an advocate for patients to ensure a successful outcome, especially for those from a socioeconomically and educationally disadvantage background. The management of work related injuries and illnesses can be challenging and may require balancing any competing priorities of worker and employment. General practitioners need to maintain an appropriate professional conduct by delineating their role to medical management to work toward the best outcomes for all parties. General practitioners need to understand the obligations of management and the role of statutory inspectors in workplace safety breaches. Organisational and legal dimensions General practice occupational medicine requires familiarity with the occupational health and safety (OH&S) legislative requirements of employers and employees, work insurance agencies, workers' compensation issues, industrial relations issues and many organisations. The general practitioner may need to manage large amounts of information from a range of sources and needs to ensure that health risks to the patient are minimised from communication errors, including the maintenance of patient privacy. Within their own general practice workplaces, general practitioners need to have expertise in safety matters, worker negotiations, unions and documenting workplace safety. General practitioners will also need to be familiar with their own workplace health and safety legislative requirements. Refer also to curriculum statement: Practice management .

Oncology: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Oncology Rationale Cancer is responsible for nearly 20% of the total burden of disease in Australia as measured by death and disability.1 Malignant neoplasms account for 2.18 out for every 100 general practice encounters, with skin cancers accounting for 1.07 of these encounters.2 The rate of general practice cancer related services is increasing.3 Skin cancers, including basal and squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas, are the most common cancers managed by general practitioners. The next most common cancers are prostate cancer, female breast cancer and lung cancer.4 Excluding nonmelanocytic skin cancers, around 101 000 new cases of cancer (55 000 males and 46 000 females) were diagnosed in Australia in 2006.5 Over 370 000 people are diagnosed with nonmelanocytic cancers each year.1 More than half the population will develop at least one nonmelanocytic skin cancer, and 1 in 3 men and 1 in 4 women will develop a major cancer before aged 75 years.1 Although survival rates are improving, cancer accounts for nearly 38 000 deaths per year.4 The most common cancers in Australia, excluding nonmelanotic skin cancers, are prostate, colorectal, lung and melanoma in men, and breast, colorectal, melanoma and lung in women. Australia's overall cancer death rates declined by about 14% in 1986-2004 and these rates are low when compared with other Western countries, however, despite these improvements, cancer is now Australia's leading cause of death among 45-64 year olds and causes more premature deaths and overall disease burden than cardiovascular disease.

Oncology: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Oncology The five domains of general practice - oncology Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Patient centred approaches help develop strong relationships with patients and their families to help provide support during the diagnosis and long term management of cancer. Specific communication skills include the ability to: break bad news discuss and explain management issues from a patient centred perspective discuss the patient-doctor relationship openly to restore any loss in confidence that may have occurred due to a diagnosis of cancer6 identify and manage psychosocial problems associated with the diagnosis and management of cancer work effectively within a multidisciplinary team recognise the importance of care coordination and to act in a coordinating role if this is appropriate and desired by the patient and care team discuss cancer risk and approaches to reducing risk and initiating behavioural change discuss the advantages and disadvantages of specific cancer screening tests and the interpretation of these tests, and empower patients to ask their oncologists about issues that are important for them such as prognosis and quality of life. Applied professional knowledge and skills Cancer care in general practice requires a diverse range of knowledge and skills including: understanding the role of lifestyle factors in contributing to cancer (smoking, exposure to UV radiation, poor diet, insufficient physical activity and excessive alcohol consumption), the extent to which lifestyle modification may reduce cancer risk and the ability to assist patients in such lifestyle modification assisting patients to quit smoking demonstrate the ability to perform skin checks and manage suspicious skin lesions obtain smoking and alcohol history and record this in the patient file monitor and record body mass index as part of cancer risk assessment identify individuals at increased risk of cancer due to familial, behavioural or environmental risk factors understand the familial factors involved in increased risk of certain cancers use a three generation family history to identify patients who are at increased risk of cancer an awareness of National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian Cancer Network guidelines on identifying those at increased familial risk, and the role of surveillance programs, specific interventions and familial cancer clinics knowledge of evidence based programs for the early detection of cancer demonstrating the skills required to perform Pap tests with attention to quality assurance issues such as sterilisation of equipment and follow up of abnormal smears knowledge of the presentation, diagnosis and management of common cancers in general practice the ability to recognise significant symptoms that could be related to cancer and the appropriate pathways for investigation and referral of cancer broad understanding of the principles of management of common cancers, including side effects of common treatments, potential interactions, and how to access specialised knowledge when needed an awareness of, and ability to, access information resources for patients to assist in their understanding of cancer and/or potential treatments knowledge of the potential psychosocial sequelae of cancer affecting people with cancer and their carers, as well as management of such issues and awareness of available support services Oncology: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Oncology the ability to identify those at risk and those with psychosocial problems and awareness of evidence based guidelines, and the ability to obtain vital information from oncologists to help facilitate their patient's regaining control over management decisions that affect their quality of life such as prognosis, understand reasons for treatment pathway choices, manage common side effects, accurate and understandable information about cancer trials they may be involved with, and explore the lived experiences for their cancer patients with empathy and validation.7,8 Population health and the context of general practice A broad understanding of the epidemiology of common cancers in Australia, and particularly the role of risk factor modification and early detection of asymptomatic cancers, is central to the role of general practice in reducing the impact of cancer in the community. This includes: an awareness that tobacco smoking is the leading cause of cancer and of the range of cancers for which tobacco contributes, as well as options to facilitate quitting an awareness of the relationship between ultraviolet radiation exposure and skin cancers an understanding of the evidence supporting the role of increased fruit and vegetables, increasing physical activity, maintaining a health body weight and limiting or avoiding alcohol in reducing the risk of certain cancers an awareness of current evidence based guidelines relating to healthy diet, physical activity and alcohol intake and ability to assist patients in adopting preventive lifestyle behaviours an awareness of biological risk factors for cancer, including viruses such as hepatitis B and human papilloma virus (HPV) knowledge about the evidence for, and current guidelines relating to, screening tests for cervical, breast and colorectal cancer including their pros and cons, appropriate use and follow up of abnormal screening tests having a broad understanding of cancer screening principles being familiar with the role of general practitioners in the national screening programs (eg. National Bowel Cancer Screening Program 2006), including the significance and management of a positive faecal occult blood test being aware of the complex issues surrounding testing for the early detection of prostate cancer and of the guidelines of organisations such as the Cancer Council Australia and the RACGP, and being able to describe the various community and consumer resources available for people and their families affected by cancer. Professional and ethical role General practitioners require a professional and patient centred approach to enable them to support patients across the spectrum of cancer control activities. General practitioners need to: be able and prepared to act as a patient advocate when appropriate recognise the importance of patient autonomy and respecting patients' choices when involved in making often complex treatment and management decisions which may include the decision to decline treatment support the patient's carers while maintaining the patient's right to confidentiality recognise the ethical issues associated with early detection of asymptomatic cancer liaise effectively with oncologists work professionally within a multidisciplinary team, and utilise evidence based guidelines to assist in the care of patients.

All rights reserved\u0018Curriculum statement: Pain management Definition Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.1 Pain is always subjective and each person's individual experience of pain is related to their life experiences such as injury in early life. Stimuli that cause pain may be associated with actual or potential tissue damage. While this sensation in itself may be unpleasant, there is also an accompanying emotional experience including fear. Patients who are unable to communicate verbally can still experience pain and may need appropriate pain relieving treatment. Some people report pain in the absence of tissue damage or any likely pathophysiological cause, which may indicate a psychological basis. Based on subjective reports, there may be no way to distinguish their experience from that due to tissue damage. If a patient regards their experience as pain, and if they report it in the same ways as pain caused by tissue damage, this should be accepted as pain. This definition avoids tying pain to the stimulus. Experiences that resemble pain but are not unpleasant, eg. pricking, should not be called pain. Unpleasant abnormal experiences (dysesthesias) may also be pain but are not necessarily so because subjectively they may not have the usual sensory qualities of pain. There is a wide range of terms to describe types of pain and pain related symptoms.2 Refer to curriculum statement: Palliative care for the management of pain in the palliative care setting. Pain management: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Pain management Rationale Pain is associated with many general practice conditions, and diagnosis and management is often poorly understood and undertreated. Patients in pain and their carers may feel hopeless, helpless, deserted and angry, and doctors may experience frustration when pain fails to respond to treatment. General practitioners manage the majority of patients with pain in Australia for both front line and last resort in pain management. Expertise in pain management is developed through education and exposure to clinical experience. Specialist advice in pain management can supplement general practice competence but cannot replace it. Interdisciplinary approaches are often helpful. There is no national data on the prevalence of pain in Australia. However, a large telephone survey of adults aged 16 years and over in New South Wales,3 reported that chronic pain (defined as pain experienced every day for 3 months in the 6 months before interview) was reported by 17% of male and 20% of female respondents. Interference in daily activities due to chronic pain was reported by 11% of male and 14% of female respondents, and was the highest in the 55-59 years age group. Pain management: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Pain management The five domains of general practice - pain management Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship The subjective nature of pain presents many diagnostic and management challenges to the general practitioner, requiring patient centred approaches and clear communication between patient and doctor. The therapeutic success of pain management also relies upon close communication to monitor progress. In addition, the patient perception of pain is influenced by a complex range of factors, including past experience of pain, medication history, family, culture, social and occupational history, as well as differing expressions and understandings of pain across cultures, making communication sometimes challenging. Applied professional knowledge and skills The successful management of pain requires a wide knowledge of many medical conditions, and can present in a variety of presentations and undifferentiated problems. Information gathering and physical examination skills are especially critical for clinical decision making. Continuity of patient care requires integrating pain management into all aspects of general practice clinical work. In particular, chronic pain management may present significant long term challenges to the general practitioner's skills. Population health and the context of general practice Pain is one of the most common and diverse presentations in general practice, and a significant cause of patient morbidity, as well as affecting the wellbeing of family and carers. General practice is both the front line and the last resort in pain management. Cultural, social, family, and work factors play a significant role in its daily management in general practice. Professional and ethical role In addition to the challenges of patient centred care in pain management, there are professional and legal requirements that significantly impact upon chronic pain management. These require a commitment to ongoing review of the general practitioner's professional and ethical role with respect to treatment advances and legislative changes. The general practitioner needs to work in close coordination with other professionals within a multidisciplinary team for successful pain management outcomes. Organisational and legal dimensions Pain can occur at any time of the day or night, and organisations have a responsibility to ensuring ongoing availability and accessibility arrangements to help alleviate patient suffering. Organisational systems need to ensure that patients with pain are regularly monitored, as well as ensuring that all legislative requirements around analgesia are met.

All rights reserved\u0018Curriculum statement: Palliative care Definition Palliative care is the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. Control of pain, of other symptoms, and of psychological, social and spiritual problems, is paramount to provide the best quality of life for patients and their families. Careful assessment of symptoms and needs of the patient should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team.1 The World Health Organization defines palliative care as:2 'an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual. Palliative care: provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms affirms life and regards dying as a normal process intends neither to hasten or postpone death integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death offers a support system to help the family/carers cope during the patient's illness and in their own bereavement uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families/carers, including bereavement counselling, if indicated will enhance quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness, and is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and includes those investigations needed to better understand and manage distressing clinical complications.' Palliative care: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Palliative care Rationale Palliative care requires a multidisciplinary approach with the general practitioner playing a central and increasing role, especially in the management of domiciliary care. For example, in 2002, of the approximate 134 000 deaths that occurred in Australia, about 64 000 (almost 50%) would have been cared for by a general practitioner several times during their last 12 months of life.3 Most patients who die from easily predictable deaths from a diagnosed terminal illness want to be cared for at home (>50%), however, only about 14% are able to exercise this option, as most patients now die in hospital.4 The community sector is increasingly caring for people at home rather than in hospital, and general practitioners often coordinate sometimes fragmented and competing community services and advocate on behalf of their patients and their families and carers for community based palliative care.5,6 Like other doctors, general practitioners are largely trained to work with curative or life prolonging models of health and many general practitioners have identified that they require further education in the skills that underpin the practice of palliative care such as basic communication skills, symptom control and management skills and skills for dealing with 'death and dying'.7 The provision of good general practice and community based palliative care requires general practitioners to organise their practices appropriately, help build and configure best use of community based health networks (eg. specialist hospital based to community based teams) to meet the palliative care needs of their patients and their families and carers for quality, comprehensive health care at the 'end-of-life' in the setting of their choice.8 There are government initiatives into palliative care, and general practitioners need to work in conjunction with government health priorities and other organisations toward better palliative care services.9 What are the core elements of general practice palliative care? Core education requirements for general practice palliative care curriculum need to ensure:10,11 physical aspects of care - close and detailed attention to symptom recognition and management, and knowledge of the pharmacology of any medications used, including dosing in elderly or renally impaired patients psychosocial aspects of care - emotional, social and spiritual aspects of end-of-life care, including developing specific communication skills needed to discuss end-of-life issues with patients and their families/carers cultural issues - crosscultural issues, appropriate use of independent interpreters ethical issues - state based legal requirement with death, wills and end-of-life issues, including managing requests for euthanasia and requests to hasten death with counselling and understanding teamwork - how to work in an multidisciplinary team; how to coordinate different models of care for best patient and family/carer outcomes practical issues - practice issues around 24 hour care rostering, appropriate use of Medicare Benefits Schedule to sustainably practice equitable palliative care for patients determined on the basis of need carer support - respite arrangements, depression screening and support, emotional support and bereavement care, and understand and recognise risk factors that may predict the early onset of psychosocial distress and complicated grief reactions12 in family members and carers and appropriately refer for further psychosocial support. Palliative care: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Palliative care career long learning - includes critical appraisal of the evidence base used for own practice and developing primary palliative care research skills to update own evidence base, as well as developing community education, advocacy and health promotional skills. complementary and alternative medicine13,14 - includes developing skills to help patients and their families/carers to be able to assess their own use of complementary therapies from an evidence based and/or safe perspective. audit, care pathway and outcome measurement - includes developing skills to measure own practice in the area of palliative care, eg. developing an end stage care pathway audit tool15 and be able to audit clinician use of symptom assessment lists and outcome measures (eg. pain scales). Palliative care: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Palliative care The five domains of general practice - palliative care Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship The general practitioner needs to establish and foster effective and empowering relationships with patients and their families as partners in care decisions, as well as with other health care professionals - as advisors. Effective communication promotes quality care and optimises health outcomes, including within multidisciplinary teams and community organisations, and administrative bodies, and enables general practitioners to be strong advocates for their patients. The general practitioner must: demonstrate good communication skills16-18 including active listening, breaking bad news, dealing with difficult questions, discussing end-of-life issues, and crosscultural care at the end-of-life19 understand the experience and consequences of disease from the perspective of the patient and their family help patients live as creatively and meaningfully as possible all the way to the end-of-life be sensitive to differing perceptions and expectations of disease and treatment among various family members be aware of spiritual, religious and cultural issues, and understand the normal process of grief, help prepare carers for bereavement and offer support during this process. Applied professional knowledge and skills The general practitioner needs to be competent in the physical aspects of palliative care including: underlying disease process: - appreciate and understand the broad range of terminal illnesses (eg. malignancy), neurological degenerative disease (eg. motor neurone disease), organ failure (eg. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive cardiac failure), and HIV/AIDS - understand potential treatments available, both disease specific and for symptom control, including palliative surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy - anticipate, diagnose and manage potential problems, either disease related or iatrogenic - understand indicators of disease progression pharmacology: - demonstrate a good understanding of drugs commonly used in palliative care (indications, doses, side effects, routes of administration) - be familiar with the use of a syringe driver - understand implications of renal and hepatic impairment - be familiar with dose equivalence of opioids and able to recognise signs of opioid toxicity - be aware of possible interactions of prescribed drugs with any complementary and alternative medicines their patients may be taking or be able to refer to available databases to advise their patients on available evidence of efficacy, safety and adverse interactions13,14 symptom identification and therapeutic responses (including counselling and psychosocial support) be able to demonstrate skills in diagnosing, identifying the cause and appropriately managing common symptoms of many end-of-life conditions: - pain (nociceptive, visceral, neuropathic and complex) - nausea and vomiting - constipation - anorexia Palliative care: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Palliative care - hiccups - fatigue, weakness and lethargy - mouth care - delirium and confusion - dyspnoea - depression and anxiety - existential distress - pressure area care - managing malignant effusions - managing peripheral lymphoedema - terminal phase events, eg. agitation, distress, 'noisy breathing', restlessness, haemorrhage and seizure be competent in recognising and appropriately managing and/or referring on patients with potential emergencies at the end-of-life such as: - opioid toxicity (especially in renal failure) - neutropaenic sepsis - hypercalcaemia - bowel obstruction - seizure - spinal cord compression - haemorrhage. Population health and the context of general practice The general practitioner needs to: be aware of the services available within the community and the means of accessing these services coordinate these services in the care of the patient and also consider health beyond that of the individual patient. This involves an advocacy role regarding community needs, including promoting the needs of disadvantaged groups. Part of this may involve developing crosscultural partnerships be aware of the needs for bereavement support, and appropriate referral or management of complicated grief reactions help allocate finite health care resources prudently to best serve the health needs of the population on the basis of need and equity of access to care and support. Professional and ethical role The general practitioner needs to display a professional attitude and be able to analyse and understand the ethical dimensions of clinical scenarios. This will involve the ability to: agree on treatment modalities, and priorities and goals of treatment respect patient wishes to decline treatment understand issues surrounding euthanasia, 'relief of suffering' at the end-of-life,20,21 and patient and community perspectives on a 'good death'22 understand issues surrounding advance health directives and end-of-life planning, including the need to complete 'unfinished business' be prepared to advocate strongly for patient needs reflect on own personal beliefs and the impact of these on interactions with patients and their care have an ongoing commitment to professional development that promotes the best available evidence based practice. This knowledge is used to provide patients with the best management. It is influenced by an awareness of spiritual, religious and cultural issues specific to each patient, which affects not only perception of illness and death, but treatment decisions made in partnership with the patient and their family/carers be able to recognise any personal emotional stress and seek assistance appropriately. Palliative care: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Palliative care Organisational and legal dimensions The general practitioner needs to: demonstrate an understanding of the complexities, and commitment to, working as part of a multidisciplinary team be able to work with several models of health care and service delivery, and be able to coordinate and integrate these services collaboratively and seamlessly for the best care of the patient23 be aware of local medical, nursing, allied health, community and respite services be able to locally access appliances as aids to daily living for patients be familiar with state legal requirements for: - carer's allowances - advance health directives - enduring power of attorney/enduring power of guardianship - will preparation be familiar with identification and certification of death, and surrounding legal issues structure practice to accommodate home visits for palliative patients, when appropriate be aware of nontime based Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items that reward team care and planning.

All rights reservedSexual health\u0018Curriculum statement: Sexual health Definition The general practice management of sexual health covers physical, emotional, mental and social wellbeing in relation to sexuality, and not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. According to the World Health Organization working definition,1 for sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled. As community based health practitioners, general practitioners are vital to the maintenance of individual sexual health and safe sexual practice, as well as the expression and control of fertility. Sexual health: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Sexual health Rationale Sexuality is a basic human attribute and, as such, is a vital part of human health and wellbeing. According to the World Health Organization working definitions:2 'Sexuality is a central aspect of being human throughout life and encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors.' Attending to sexual health and its problems is a basic task in primary health care and a core part of general practice in Australia. Sexual health presentations are common in Australian general practices. According to BEACH activity data, 5 out of every 100 patient encounters in general practice were for issues regarding the female genital tract (Pap tests/check ups and menstrual problems), 3.4 out of 100 encounters were for pregnancy and family planning issues (including oral contraception and pre- and post-natal check ups), 2.5 out of 100 encounters were urological, and 1.2 out of 100 encounters were for the male genital system.3 However, this does not include encounters for relationship counselling or many other sexual health concerns. Sexual activity can be associated with health risks and is estimated to cause 0.5% of the burden of disease in Australia in 2003.4 Sexual intercourse can transmit infections such as chlamydia, herpes, warts, hepatitis, B, gonorrhoea, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis. Sexual activity has also been associated with an increased risk for specific cancers such as cervical and anal cancer. While in recent times, sexual health services in Western countries have been provided by sexual health centres, family planning clinics and other facilities, there has been a global trend to integrate sexual health services into primary care.5 This aims to improve antenatal, perinatal, postpartum and newborn care; provide high quality services for family planning, including infertility services; eliminate unsafe abortion; combat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, reproductive tract infections, cervical cancer and other gynaecological morbidities; and promote sexual health. Due to the diverse nature of sexual practices, clinicians also need to be comfortable with discussing sex with a wide range of people including those of different ages; gender (male, female, transgender); sexual preference; culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and people with disabilities. The Australian Study of Health and Relationships (ASHR) in a population based sample of males and females aged 16-59 years indicated that 5.0% of the males and 5.7% of the females had had some homosexual experience in their lifetime, excluding nongenital sexual experience. Males who identified themselves as homosexual reported a higher number of lifetime sexual partners than lesbians or heterosexuals respectively.6 In addition, the ASHR7 indicated that the median age of reported first intercourse was age 16 years. About 40% of males and one-quarter of females reported having had intercourse when they were below the age of 16 years, and so the general practitioner must be able to manage sexual health concerns in young people where risks of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections are high. Issues of nonconsensual sexual activity can also emerge at this time. General practitioners should be able to elicit this history and be aware of available support services and resources. Sexual health in general practice also involves a working knowledge of legislative public health requirements of sexually transmitted infections and mandatory reporting. This includes a working knowledge of disease and partner notification. Refer also to curriculum statements: Women's health; Men's health; Young Sexual health: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Sexual health The five domains of general practice - sexual health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Clinicians need to communicate effectively when talking about sex and sexual health, and display confidence with language and cultural sensitivity. The clinician needs to be able to take an adequate sexual history in a nonjudgmental manner from various patient groups, including young people, same sex relationships, older patients, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, people with disabilities, injecting drug users, and sex workers. Sexual health counselling appropriate to the level of training involves a range of areas, including normal sexual activity, sexual aging, contraception, safer sex education, sexual rights, sexual diversity, contact tracing, gender sexual assault and abuse, and sexual dysfunction. Clinicians need to be able to explain to patients the importance of taking a sexual history as part of general health care. Clinicians also need to be able to provide competent pretest counselling and education for all sexually transmitted infections, in particular for HIV and hepatitis C. Applied professional knowledge and skills Sexual history taking needs to be incorporated into the general medical history, including recognising clinical presentations of potentially high sexual health morbidity and mortality Clinicians need to be able to assess the competency of young people in making their own health decisions regarding their sexual health including contraception. Appropriate genital examinations need to be performed in a sensitive manner, recognising common normal variants and respectful of cultural concerns. Clinicians need knowledge of: developmental sexuality: the physical, emotional and social changes of puberty in girls and boys psychology relating to sexuality and management of sexual abuse and violence sexually transmitted infections including epidemiology, bacterial/viral/fungal/protozoal infections, basic microbiology, signs and symptoms of disease pathology testing, results, interpretation and principles and regional knowledge of contact tracing requirements knowledge of treatments and test of cure or test of reinfection (when applicable) cervical screening and management guidelines contraception: pharmacology, use, cost effectiveness, accessibility and patient concordance issues genital dermatology and common gynaecological/urological problems, and sexual dysfunction as a common issue and have the ability to discuss this with patients. Population health and the context of general practice Clinicians need: knowledge of the prevalence of common sexually transmitted infections such as human papilloma virus, herpes simplex virus and chlamydia and how to access local and national information on these infections continuing awareness of changing incidence of sexually transmitted infections within certain population groups, eg. chlamydia in people under 25 years of age, sexually transmitted infections in men who have sex with men, and the indigenous population to be able to provide opportunistic sexually transmitted infection testing to patients at risk, eg. chlamydia testing for people under age 25 years and those who have recently changed sexual partners, in accordance with RACGP preventive screening guidelines8 to understand the key concepts of working with the Aboriginal community to promote indigenous sexual health to understand the general practitioner's or other health practitioner's role in contact tracing and follow up after a sexually transmitted infection diagnosis Sexual health: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Sexual health to promote safer sex practices when appropriate, to both young people and adults who have a recent change in sexual partner to have an awareness of sexual dysfunction as a common side effect of frequently prescribed medications and the ability to discuss this with patients, and to appreciate the prevalence of sexual assault and abuse within the community and be aware of this affecting own patient population. Professional and ethical role Clinicians need to: understand the heightened concerns for confidentiality with regard to sexual health care, eg. a person at high risk of HIV may prefer to have testing done within a facility which will allow coded testing such as a sexual health centre maintain confidentiality of adolescent patients seeking sexual health and other advice as limited by duty of care establish and maintain professional boundaries, and work effectively with local networks to support complete sexual health care including sexual health clinics, family planning centres and hepatitis C clinics. Organisation and legal dimensions Depending on the stage of training and the legal jurisdiction a clinician practises within, clinicians need to: understand and comply with legal requirements with regards to HIV pretest counselling and notification of results understand a medical practitioner's and patient's role in contact tracing be aware of notification requirements and procedures and compliance with these be able to coordinate contact tracing and notification using any local services that are acceptable to the patient noting your legal obligations understand and comply with legal issues surrounding termination of pregnancy understand and compliance with issues related to sexual assault, and understand legal issues surrounding treatment of minors, age of consent and notification of young people at risk of harm.

All rights reservedSports medicine\u0018Curriculum statement: Sports medicine Definition Sports medicine encompasses the whole range of study into the medicine of exercising people. This involves the assessment and management of sporting people, the prevention of injury through the application of sports science knowledge and the application of exercise physiology knowledge to our community at large. The core elements for consideration are knowledge of: the prevention and management of common sport and exercise related injuries the role of inactivity in the aetiology of chronic disease, and exercise as a therapeutic tool. Sports medicine: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Sports medicine Rationale Competitive sport holds a prominent place in the Australian psyche and recreational physical activity is a key strategy in promoting healthy lifestyles and preventive medicine. Although many patients first present with an acute sporting injury to hospital emergency departments,1 general practitioners provide a comparable or even higher number of sports medicine related services than hospitals.2 Therefore the assessment and management of sporting injuries is a significant part of the workload of general practice. The study and practice of sports medicine is a rapidly growing area of medicine, and athletes and recreational sports participants now expect a high standard of care which has had a direct impact on the practice of sports medicine by general practitioners. Patients present for a wide range of advice related to sport and exercise. The study of sports medicine also entails an understanding of the relevance of exercise to the general population and the aging Australian community. This includes the benefits and risks of exercise and the important role of exercise in the management of many chronic diseases. General practitioners are well situated to provide holistic care in these areas,3 helping to avoid fragmentation of management. Refer also to curriculum statement: Occupational health. Sports medicine: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Sports medicine The five domains of general practice - sports medicine Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Well developed skills in communication enable the clinician to be able to develop a good rapport with the patient. This can be achieved by developing the ability to: listen and understand the needs of the patient. Athletes may have different expectations of outcomes compared to other recreational sports participants or someone using exercise for chronic disease management use empathy and supportive strategies to encourage the patient to show their emotions and express their needs and fears, eg. athletes with injuries will often have fear of their injury and develop an early grief reaction when seen for treatment. Patients with diabetes and obesity may be fearful of an exercise program, with different types of fears. develop a partnership with the patient so that issues surrounding the injury and exercise can be assessed and explored more easily. It may be that the athlete has unrealistic expectations of their speed of recovery or has an eating disorder; or that the diabetic may have an underlying depressive illness. Applied professional knowledge and skills Knowledge of the basis of musculoskeletal medicine, physiology and pathology needs to be applied in an efficient and productive way to manage sports related conditions including: an understanding of applied anatomy and surface anatomy. It is important to assess sports injuries quickly and thoroughly knowledge of the concepts of injury causation (trauma versus repetitive microtrauma) knowledge of the differences between types of exercise and their effects on the body, the beneficial effects of exercise on the body (both normal body and diseased), as well as a basic understanding of potential risks of exercise are important to the practise of sports medicine knowledge of the more common sporting injuries and conditions that need to be excluded for proper and safe practise of sports medicine the ability to take a thorough history and apply a specific examination to elicit the information needed to make a proper diagnosis an understanding of the available investigations and how and when to apply them, and have the appropriate skills in directing treatment to the athlete or injured patient which may involve other health care professionals as part of coordinated care. Population health and the context of general practice While the benefits of injury prevention and exercise can be applied individually, they have benefits on a larger scale, such as in teams and clubs, and also apply to the wider population including the: opportunistic application of injury prevention, eg. the assessment of obvious biomechanical abnormalities in young athletes to the expected level of knowledge of the clinician, and application of exercise physiology concepts to the general community and specific targeted groups including: impaired glucose tolerance/metabolic syndrome; type 2 diabetes; obesity and hypertension; prevention of ischaemic heart disease; fall prevention in the elderly; and mental health, including depression, anxiety and premenstrual dysphoria syndrome. Sports medicine: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Sports medicine Professional and ethical role There is a professional need to educate the exercising public about injury prevention and injury management. Clinicians require an understanding of the ethical issues surrounding duty of care toward athletes and how this may have the potential to conflict with pressures from coaches and clubs. In addition, general practitioners require a working knowledge of drugs in sport requirements to meet legal and ethical responsibilities. Organisation and legal dimensions Sports medicine workplaces may involve sporting field/arena attendance and issues related to safety and security needs to be considered. Appropriate equipment needs to be available for any eventuality while the practitioner is responsible for the care of athletes. Guidelines for minimum on field equipment exist. Similarly, security, sound record keeping, confidentiality and safe handling practices need to be adhered to in this arena. The practice and practitioner need to comply with occupational health and safety guidelines when assessing and managing injured athletes and other patients, including universal precautions and safe management of sharps. Practitioners need to have knowledge of, and comply with, legal requirements for the safe management of athletes. This includes resolving the potential conflict of interest when the duty of care is to the athlete and a sporting club may employ the general practitioner. This also involves a knowledge and application of drugs in sport guidelines.4 Sports medicine: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Sports medicine Learning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Demonstrate how to take a history including the onset, mode of injury and consequent symptoms that relate to the injury.

All rights reservedCritical thinking and research\u0018Curriculum statement: Critical thinking and research Definition Critical thinking involves a continual questioning of the assumptions underpinning all aspects of a general practitioner's professional life and consists of: critical appraisal of scientific evidence which is necessary for the evaluation of research results and their application to practice critical evaluation of the context of general practice critical introspection to gain an understanding of personal knowledge, experience and values that influence the way medicine is practised.1 As well as being a core competency for general practice,2 critical thinking is also an essential precursor to research, and also for evaluating and understanding the implications of research for clinical practice. Involvement in research at medical school and during general practice training is associated with increased ability and confidence in interpreting research findings in subsequent clinical practice, in addition to increased subsequent involvement in general practice research.3-5 Using a broad, conceptual definition, the research process can be summarised as deliberately asking questions within the framework of existing knowledge and seeking answers following a systematic process which includes: obtaining appropriate information in an ethical, transparent and reproducible manner appropriately analysing the information drawing conclusions on the basis of the validity and reliability of the information and meaning of the results, and comparing these results to other studies disseminating the implications widely, including to those who may effect change. The spectrum of research activities is extremely wide and can include evaluation studies, intervention studies, clinical audits, large scale multicentre clinical trials and patient satisfaction studies. Research activities can use qualitative or quantitative research methods, or a combination of both. However, each of these activities must be conducted according to the established 'rules' of the research process in order to be considered research. Critical thinking and research: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Critical thinking and research Rationale Critical thinking and research promote essential lifelong learning skills throughout the general practitioner's working life. They enable the general practitioner to provide the best possible patient care by developing the general practitioner's ability to: identify the many important clinical and research questions arising in their everyday clinical practice critically appraise research papers to confidently and accurately answer these questions apply this research evidence to their patients and communities. To critically appraise a research paper, clinicians must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of a variety of research methods that can best be gained by undertaking formal and structured training in research methods. Critical appraisal skills are also important in assisting clinicians to implement or participate in research projects. Such clinicians need opportunities to do research, as well as access to appropriate mentoring and support, particularly through linking with research organisations or academic institutions including university departments of general practice. What is general practice research? As a person focused applied discipline, general practice research concentrates on applied research that goes beyond the biomedical aspects of illness and incorporates issues that address psychosocial aspects of wellbeing,6 which inherently requires multidisciplinary approaches and multiple methodologies.7,8 General practice research aims to solve the problems that arise within the specific context of general practice. The context and the way in which the research is conducted characterises general practice research rather than the nature of the problem investigated.9 General practice research must be conducted within general practice to provide answers to the specific and unique problems that arise within this context.10-14 Why critical thinking and research are needed in general practice Critical thinking and research improve patient care in general practice. Research evidence is the fundamental way in which routine clinical practice is improved. Critical thinking and reflection are essential precursors for the incorporation of research evidence into practice. Training in these skills also cultivates an interest in undertaking much needed general practice research. General practice research productivity is far lower than that of other medical disciplines, with an approximate publication rate in the 1990s of one general practice research article per 1000 general practitioners per year. Corresponding rates for medicine, surgery and public health were 105 per 1000, 61 per 1000 and 150 per 1000 respectively.15 Critical thinking and research: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Critical thinking and research Levels of engagement in critical thinking and research There are varying levels of engagement in critical thinking and research in general practice. Users and participants, as well as leaders, should be actively involved (see Figure 1 )16 at the highest order within each level on involvement. Figure 1. The levels of research engagement. Adapted from 'Glasziou's triangle'17 and reproduced from Australian Family Physician with permission Research leaders are those who conceptualise, design, find funding for, conduct and publish research. Research participants are those who participate in general practice research. Highest order participants are intellectually engaged in the research, understand and feel aligned to its purpose, could describe the project to a third party, and are interested in the results. Usually they are sufficiently part of the research to earn authorship. Lower order participants may just recruit patients for research projects conceptualised and instigated by others such as universities, specialist colleagues, or pharmaceutical companies. All general practitioners are research users, using research evidence (the base of the triangle) as clinical practice within general practice, and are informed by research from a myriad of health related fields ranging from biochemical to macrosocial levels. This research evidence is accessed in a range of forms from a wide number of sources such as from journals, medical newspapers, formal educational activities and discussions with their colleagues,18 and can lead to changes in practice. However, the critical thinkers consciously seek the best available research evidence, to appraise and combine with clinical experience and patient values to inform their clinical decision making (the principles of evidence based medicine [EBM]).19 The ability to critically appraise a research paper is included in the minimum entry level skill set for general practice.20 Increasing the numbers of general practitioners actively using research evidence (practicing EBM) will encourage critical inquiry within the discipline and highlight gaps in the evidence. Some general practitioners will want to address these gaps through leading or participating in research. Critical thinking and research: RationaleResearch leaders Research participants Research usersIncreasing degree of involvement in research\u0018Curriculum statement: Critical thinking and research Specific research needs of general practice The specific needs of general practice research impact upon all general practitioners, regardless of their level of involvement in general practice research. General practice has specific research needs with a high degree of contextual complexity (a broad range of relatively unevolved signs and symptoms, presented within the patient's psychological and social setting) compared with the technical complexity of the medical specialties (a narrower range of defined symptoms across single organ systems, more severe illnesses, and limited reference to the patient's social context).21 There are gaps in the evidence that general practitioners need for making decisions, limiting the ability to provide the highest quality care. These gaps are: basic science: - the lack of both biomedical and psychosocial evidence. The gap in biomedical science is exemplified by the lack of knowledge about the pathophysiology and natural history of many of the diseases commonly seen in general practice. The limited understanding of help seeking behaviour is an example of a psychosocial gap (eg. why do some patients with upper respiratory tract infections present to their general practitioner, while others with the same symptoms self medicate or take no action?) effectiveness: - the lack of evidence demonstrating both the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions routinely used in general practice (diagnosis, treatment and service delivery) applicability: - a lack of 'translation research' to ensure that evidence generated in nonprimary care settings is applicable in general practice implementation: - the gap between identifying effective care and who should receive it, and what occurs in routine general practice.22 General practice research also focuses on the taxonomy of general practice itself. A better knowledge of the processes employed in general practice and successful models of health care delivery will support more effective, cost efficient and sustainable practice. Critical thinking and research: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Critical thinking and research The five domains of general practice - critical thinking and research Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship General practitioners need to: be able to communicate the evidence for treatment or screening to patients in a manner that is both understandable to the patient and is patient centred involve the patient in the decision making process about their health and acknowledge the informed patient's right to choose to accept or decline new interventions based on research evidence be aware that beliefs and values, in both doctor and patient, influence the interpretation of research results in support of potentially divergent views. Applied professional knowledge and skills General practitioners need: well developed skills in reflective practice and critical thinking in order to identify and formulate questions as they arise in clinical practice sound skills in evidence gathering (eg. where to find resources, how to search databases, internet searching skills) sound skills in critical appraisal of different types of evidence sources an awareness of the hierarchy of evidence available for clinical decision making skills in applying research evidence from clinical trials to individual patients within their unique context and comorbidities the ability to disseminate the results of research or critical evaluation and literature reviews to peers or other health professionals an awareness of methods and practices to evaluate, reflect upon and improve clinical and nonclinical practice (eg. clinical audit, needs analysis, quality improvement cycles) to develop a rational approach to prescribing and investigation that includes knowledge of risk, costs and benefits of treatment and tests to understand how research funding and publication bias can lead to a bias in evidence.

Critical thinking and research: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Critical thinking and research Professional and ethical role General practitioners need to: ensure that issues such as privacy and ethical principles are adhered to when undertaking research or quality improvement activities, and to obtain approval from an appropriate human research ethics committee as required understand the power differential in the doctor-patient relationship when performing research or quality improvement activities, and ensure that patient's vulnerability is recognised and appropriately managed, including full information and informed consent think critically about issues arising both in individual clinical practice, (eg. critical incidents, mistakes, patient feedback) and in the wider context of general practice (eg. population heath status, medical politics) be aware of own knowledge, limitations, biases and values that influence the way one practices medicine be aware of external influences on own practice (eg. pharmaceutical companies, media) and be confident in dealing appropriately with these influences be flexible and willing to change beliefs and practice in the face of new evidence acknowledge uncertainty (to self and patients) in clinical practice, without foregoing the efforts to decrease uncertainty where feasible and necessary.

All rights reservedGPs as teachers and mentors\u0018Curriculum statement: GPs as teachers and mentors Definition Doctors have long held a tradition of teaching. The Hippocratic oath refers to the importance of teaching and mentoring.1 Even the origins of the word 'doctor' come from the Old French for 'teacher', based on the Latin 'docere ' (Oxford English dictionary ). General practitioners possess many teaching skills that are often not recognised. All GPs educate their patients, and these teaching skills can be transferred to teaching medical students, general practice registrars, peers and health professionals. The skills for teaching can be acquired throughout the professional life, beginning in medical school. GPs as teachers and mentors: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: GPs as teachers and mentors Rationale Teaching and mentoring are becoming a more common part of the everyday life of a GP: universities are directing learning away from the more traditional wards and lecture theatres of metropolitan tertiary hospitals, towards more community based settings, including general practices the advent of university departments of rural health and rural clinical schools in the early twenty- first century has seen much medical undergraduate education moved out of metropolitan centres to rural centres general practice vocational training has become regionalised, requiring an increasing number of teaching practices and supervisors, trainers and mentors in regional and rural Australia the general practice infrastructure of divisions of general practice has mainstreamed local delivery of continuing professional development. This decentralisation of general practice education has resulted in general practice teaching and mentoring becoming a real career path for any GP as either a supervisor or a medical educator. General practitioners need to develop education skills as an integral part of their professional repertoire. This curriculum statement aims to define the teaching and mentoring skills that GPs develop at different stages of medical and general practice training. The skills are generic, and are obtainable by all doctors at each stage. The statement also provides a list of extension skills and learning objectives to encourage those interested in furthering a career in teaching and mentoring in general practice. Medical students as teachers and learners Equipping students with teaching and learning skills helps students to self direct their learning. Peer tutoring is an educational strategy whereby student tutors - usually senior medical students - take on the helping role that facilitates first year students in activities by enabling them to support each others learning in undergraduate studies. Programs concentrating on clinically focused topics, evidence based medicine and physical examination skills in both conventional and problem based contexts have proven to be beneficial for all students, both teachers and learners Prevocational doctors as teachers and learners Education in teaching and educational skills is an important and necessary component of the prevocational doctor's overall medical curriculum. Prevocational residents also demonstrate teaching style preferences that indicate the need for education in this skills area. They prefer a didactic approach rather than developing learner problem solving skills, and rarely use feedback for educational purposes. They prefer to question learners rather than engage in educational discourses, demonstrate techniques and procedures, and reference literature only minimally.2 Several key features of teaching and mentoring skills required by graduates at this stage or hospital resident level have been identified. In particular, prevocational doctors: spend 20-25% of time teaching enjoy teaching and consider it vital for their own education, not only in clinical skills but also in their own self directed learning skills and motivation recognise the importance of teaching to the profession often have little formal instruction as educators would prefer to spend more time teaching than they do lack confidence teaching when they need education in areas taught demonstrate improvement in teaching skills when they are given formal tuition in teaching GPs as teachers and mentors: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: GPs as teachers and mentors demonstrate improvement in clinical skills and knowledge, although this cannot be directly attributable to the teaching skills program alone. Teacher training is therefore recommended for all doctors in their postgraduate hospital years. Vocational doctors as teachers and learners Both the teacher and learner benefit from peer assisted learning. Universities are encouraging vertical integration of medical education, and general practice trainees are increasingly likely to experience roles in teaching medical students within the practices where they work. Some vocational trainees also choose to undertake an academic post at a university in which they are expected to teach medical students on campus. Apart from student teaching, vocational trainees may frequently be involved with teaching peers and other health professionals within the training context. This may occur in workshop settings, small study groups or in clinical practice. Vocational trainees are also a valuable learning resource for their supervisors. Postvocational doctors as teachers and learners General practitioners need to develop, maintain and expand skills as trainers, educators, mentors, researchers and leaders over their professional lifetime. Many GPs will be involved in a variety of teaching roles, eg. staff education or educating medical students (in their practice or in a more formal academic setting), postvocational doctors and colleagues in a peer education process or in 'train the trainer' settings. Effective teaching demands ongoing review of educational skills, and professional development programs need to consider and review the level of teaching skills required in order to develop and maintain teaching skills to the appropriate standards. See also: Philosophy and foundation of general practice. GPs as teachers and mentors: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: GPs as teachers and mentors The five domains of general practice - GPs as teachers and mentors Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Teaching and mentoring require a degree of sharing of the teacher's clinical expertise. This requires good communication skills to ensure the messages are heard. Feedback is an essential part of teaching and mentoring in general practice. Listening to the learner's needs ensures that teaching occurs at the appropriate level and in the appropriate context. The learner-teacher relationship is the most important factor in the effectiveness of the supervision. Reflection and discussion are important learning tools in general practice. The teacher should demonstrate good interviewing and facilitation skills. Applied professional knowledge and skills Effective teaching requires specific knowledge and skills about teaching and learning. Knowledge of clinical skills is not necessarily enough to be an effective teacher. A good clinician is not necessarily a good teacher. Adequate clinical knowledge of the proposed topic is essential for effective teaching and learning, in order to answer the learner's questions. Instructions and practice in teaching skills should be available to clinicians involved in teaching. This could be in the form of short 'train the trainers' courses or postgraduate education. There should be some teaching skills provided at all stages of medical and general practice training. General practitioner teachers should be aware of the range of learning styles, and be able to adjust their teaching style appropriately. Population health and the context of general practice Preventive medicine is a key population health strategy for the individual GP, and education skills make a central contribution to the provision of preventive consultation in the clinical setting. General practitioners can play a key role in the community promoting the benefits of population based health strategies, and teaching skills greatly enhance their ability to fulfil this role. The development and use by the general practice teacher of appropriate education resources in the general practice training and education will greatly enhance a learner's educational experience of the population health domain in the RACGP curriculum. Professional and ethical role Professional codes of ethics highlight the professional obligation of passing on knowledge and skills to colleagues and students.3 Teaching should aim to improve patient outcomes and be in no way detrimental to the patient. An effective teacher should recognise their own limits (both in clinical and teaching skills) and knowledge. Effective teaching in general practice requires an enthusiasm for teaching, learning and general practice. Organisational and legal dimensions Teaching time should be set aside and protected against other intrusions. The environment in which teaching occurs affects the effectiveness of the teaching and learning. Learners generally respond well to being given increased responsibility with support and clinical advice. However, the supervising clinician maintains overall responsibility for the patient's care. Being available and approachable is a key component to effective supervision in general practice.

All rights reservedHealth informatics\u0018Curriculum statement: Health informatics Definition Health informatics1 is the appropriate and innovative application of the concepts and technologies of the information age to improve health care and health. With the evolution of the field, health informatics is probably best defined in the context of eHealth, which is generally accepted as an umbrella term composed of two elements: health informatics (related to the collection, analysis and movement of health information and data to support health care), and telehealth (related to direct, eg. videoconferencing, or indirect, eg. website delivery of health information or health care to a recipient). eHealth encompasses products, systems and services, including tools for health authorities and professionals, as well as personalised health systems for patients and citizens. The scope of eHealth includes desktop to bedside to population health activities, which present complex information management challenges to support individualised patient care. Health informatics: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Health informatics Rationale The majority of Australian general practices have computers for management and clinical care.2 Many general practitioners, like the wider Australian community, use email and web based communication, and Australian general practitioners are increasingly recognising, participating, and benefiting from advances in information technology and management.3 The context of Australian general practice has changed considerably over the past 15 years. The introduction of computers for patient and data records has changed the way practices operate as well as the dynamics of the patient-doctor relationship. From an international perspective, eHealth is seen to be increasingly important in ensuring system efficiencies and improving data quality in the care of an expanding and aging population.4 The uptake of computers in patient care is variable with most general practices having access to computers and a practice based electronic health record that does not utilise the functions of clinical software system in a maximal fashion or use the computer for limited purposes in conjunction with a paper record.5,6 Data quality continues to be an issue of concern. Reported barriers for uptake of information technology in general practice include lack of time, lack of skills/training, cost and nonuniform national standards.7 Research has shown that these barriers, especially that of time, can be overcome.8,9 Change management principles should be used to overcome these hurdles, however, inappropriate resource allocation has made this change difficult to enact.10 The use of information management can assist general practitioners to keep up-to-date with clinical advances through guidelines, summary services (eg. clinical evidence) and decision support. Effective use of medical records data can assist general practitioners to better understand the practice patient base, provide services and derive business benefit. The general practice profession must consider how various technological platforms will affect daily practice. Patients are referring to the internet for information11 and younger users are using web based technologies for routine day-to-day communication. From a professional aspect, future developments in the area of a national health record, e-billing and telehealth will need to be monitored by the general practitioner. General practitioners must be mindful of the potential risks of information management, including security and privacy issues. Refer also to curriculum statements: Chronic conditions, Population health and Practice management. Health informatics: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Health informatics The five domains of general practice - health informatics Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Communication skills are fundamental to a successful health informatics strategy. Health informatics is a technological science and a sociocultural field of study. General practitioners and practice staff must acknowledge that data collection and retrieval involves a relationship between the patient, practitioner and the computer/device. This relationship is fluid and the practitioner must be conscious of the use of the computer 'taking over' the consultation. There is a three way relationship between the doctor-patient-computer, however, the doctor-patient relationship remains paramount, and the practitioner needs to be able to facilitate and use the computer to enhance the relationship. Applied professional knowledge and skills Health informatics incorporates both basic and advanced professional knowledge and skills. Basic knowledge and skills include: basic computer literacy skills knowledge of appropriate and reliable websites for patient information basic knowledge of booking and billing systems, and understanding of the role of the electronic health record in health practice. Advanced knowledge and skills include: knowledge of evidence based practice search strategies, eg. PubMed and Cochrane knowledge of appropriate e-medicine websites for professional 'just in' time information, eg. E-Medicine, Harrison's Online, Dermnet understanding of infrastructure set up, eg. server system, security and data recovery telehealth including teleconsults, email consultations electronic billing via Health Insurance Commission (HIC) online, and higher level electronic health record skills involving using templates for application of medical summaries, medication lists, care plans and health assessments. Population health and the context of general practice Health informatics has a key role in assisting general practice in improving population health strategies. General practices that have an information management strategy in place and staff who promote clean data protocols can use informatics principles to retrieve population health statistics from their own practice. Health informatics strategies in the form of recalls and reminders can also assist general practices to engage in population health activities such as Pap tests and preventive health activities. Professional and ethical role General practice and medical technology is continuously evolving and general practitioners and practice staff need to engage in continual skill development. Mastering medical computer skills is independent of medical experience and knowledge. General practitioners, regardless of age, should acknowledge that health informatics can complement and coexist with traditional general practice. Change management is a key concept in assisting uptake in increasing usage of the electronic health records in health practice. Health informatics: The five domains of general practice\u0018Curriculum statement: Health informatics Organisation and legal dimensions Health informatics is different from practice management. Health informatics encompasses some elements of practice management and also has defined activities in the area of patient information and professional medical information processes. General practices require a long term view of system security and privacy, including virus protection, server firewall set up, encryption of patient information through emails or system networks, data recovery plan and back up procedures. The electronic health record is a patient record and, like the paper based, is a legal document. General practitioners need to ensure appropriate data quality and up-to-date record keeping is key health informatics strategy. Responsible practice staff need to ensure that practice systems are sound or have dedicated resources or a third party to ensure a reliable service for all users. Practices need to monitor developments in emerging technologies, eg. Voice over Internet Protocols (VoIP) and email/telehealth strategies.

All rights reservedIntegrative medicine\u0018Curriculum statement: Integrative medicine Definition Integrative medicine refers to the blending of conventional and complementary medicines and therapies with the aim of using the most appropriate of either or both modalities to care for the patient as a whole. Integrative medicine, like general practice, also embraces and encourages a holistic approach to practice incorporating patient involvement in self health care, prevention and lifestyle interventions. Integrative medicine encompasses more than complementary medicine, although the integration of complementary medicine is an important and obvious aspect of integrative medicine. For the purposes of the RACGP curriculum, complementary medicine will refer to therapies and medicines which are not conventionally used by doctors, but may complement medical management and be successfully integrated into it, whether the therapy is delivered by a doctor or a suitably trained complementary medicine practitioner. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine classifies complementary and alternative therapies into five categories1 or domains: Alternative medical systems Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. Examples of alternative medical systems that have developed in Western cultures include homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine. Examples of systems that have developed in non-Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and Ayurveda. Mind-body interventionsMind-body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms. Some techniques that were considered complementary and alternative therapies in the past have become mainstream (eg. patient support groups and cognitive behavioural therapy). Other mind-body techniques are still considered complementary and alternative therapies, including meditation, prayer, mental healing, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance. Biologically based therapies Biologically based therapies in complementary and alternative therapies use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, and vitamins. Some examples include dietary supplements, herbal products, and the use of other so-called natural but as yet scientifically unproven therapies (eg. using shark cartilage to treat cancer). Some uses of dietary supplements have been incorporated into conventional medicine, eg. folic acid for prevention of neural tube defects. Manipulative and body based methods Manipulative and body based methods in complementary and alternative therapies are based on manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body. Some examples include chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, and massage. Energy therapies Energy therapies involve the use of energy fields. They are of two types: biofield therapies involve the existence of energy fields that have not been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure and/or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fields. Examples include qi gong, Reiki and therapeutic touch. bioelectromagnetic based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields such as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating current or direct current fields. Because of the changing nature of evidence and clinical practice there is a grey area as to whether some particular therapies are classified as complementary or conventional. Integrative medicine: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Integrative medicine Rationale A significant driver for integrative medicine has been the rising community interest in complementary medicine. General practitioners need to be familiar with a number of areas within integrative medicine. This may be because the doctor: would like to take an integrative medicine approach to their medical practice needs to be able to discuss integrative medicine or complementary medicine with their patients, including finding out current patterns of integrative medicine use, if any, or may need to know where to find quality information to answer clinical questions. Nearly two-thirds of the community have used some form of complementary medicine and many do not disclose this use to their doctor. Research has demonstrated as high as 57% of people taking complementary medicines do not tell their doctor and about 50% used conventional medicines on the same day.2 This situation is potentially unsafe and needs to be addressed.2,3 Patients with chronic diseases are increasingly looking for health care outside of conventional health systems. Some doctors may not be confident in dealing with complementary medicine related issues and may have limited awareness of the evidence base and potential safety issues associated with use, and consequently fail to ask patients about use of complementary medicines because of these reasons. Nevertheless, an increasing number of doctors are using complementary medicine or referring patients for complementary medicine.4 There is a higher acceptance of complementary medicines in other parts of the world than in Australia, eg. 64% of medical courses in the United States have content on complementary medicine.5 Patients not satisfied with conventional medicine6 often self prescribe complementary medicines without professional supervision emphasising the need for general practitioners who use integrative medical approaches. Integrative medicine in general practice General practitioners are ideally placed to help patients in integrative medicine because of their broad based scientific and generalist training and their regular contact with the community. Comprehensive integrative medicine training aims to: provide a greater range of therapeutic options to patients help patients make safe and balanced decisions regarding complementary medicine use, and avoid potentially harmful interactions between complementary and conventional therapies. Integrative medicine does not reject or compete with conventional health care and overlaps significantly with what is currently widely accepted as quality general practice. Integrative medicine seeks to broaden conventional health care by emphasising principles that some doctors and patients believe are undervalued in conventional medical practice. Integrative medicine emphasises a number of issues including: a focus on wellness and illness prevention being holistic in nature by focusing on physical, psychological, spiritual, social and lifestyle issues incorporating evidence based, safe and ethical complementary therapies individualising the approach to any particular patient or clinical situation using the best of all available modalities in conjunction with informed patient choice integrating all of the above into conventional medical care, and acknowledging that advances in health care will be dependent on scientific advances, improvements in health care delivery systems, cultural change as well as practitioner and patient education. Integrative medicine: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Integrative medicine Therefore a comprehensive approach to integrative medicine means more than merely adding a little complementary knowledge to the 'kit bag' of the general practitioner. Integrative medicine incorporates a philosophy of health care as well as a way of practising. Prevention, holism and informed patient choice are obviously integral to the whole of general practice, and therefore the complementary aspects are often given the most attention when considering what integrative medicine is. For this reason, integrative medicine training is not seen as a separate or stand alone aspect of general practice training. Some aspects of integrative medicine may be taught as stand alone modules or in integrative medicine seminars and case discussions, but are best understood and applied when integrated appropriately into other aspects of general practice training. For example, when a doctor is learning about the management of depression or cardiovascular disease, training should integrate important principles of integrative medicine into this training or case studies. Integrative medicine: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Integrative medicine The five domains of general practice - integrative medicine Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Clinicians need to communicate effectively with patients about integrative medicine, including taking a nonjudgmental history about the use of complementary medicines and self care issues, while responding to a patient's context in terms of history, culture, gender, race, spirituality and personal choices. Communication is central to assisting patients to make decisions about their philosophy of health care and which treatment modality is best for them. Effective communication includes the ability to say no to unreasonable requests and setting limits for patients. The clinician also needs to be able to effectively communicate some integrative medicine skills, eg. relaxation techniques. Applied professional knowledge and skills Clinicians need to know the definitions, philosophy and main modalities of integrative medicine, have a basic but broad knowledge of the integrative medicine field, as well as the principles for appropriate use in conventional medical practice. Clinicians also require: an awareness of the current evidence for widely used complementary medicines an awareness of important interactions and side effects (common and/or severe) associated with complementary medicines skills in behaviour change and lifestyle strategies, and to know how to access quality sources of information on integrative medicine to suit therapist's and patient's needs. Some clinicians may need to know about or how to use a number of complementary modalities which are safe and well supported by evidence, as well as knowing about how to deal with situations where knowledge is lacking, and how to access quality information to help guide clinical decisions. Some clinicians may manage common conditions using or offering complementary medicines where appropriate, and develop an integrative management plan for patients with chronic and complex illnesses including combining complementary and conventional medicine. Population health and the context of general practice Clinicians require knowledge of integrative and complementary medicine usage in the community and an awareness of attitudes toward their use, both in the community and the medical profession. Professional and ethical role Integrative medicine requires appropriate clinical attitudes including respect, openness and tolerance for patient's choices and experience, as well as to nonmedical complementary practitioners, while being still able to give advice and direction when choices may be unsafe. Clinicians need to recognise presentations that require more intensive or specialised integrative medical management, and also need to be able to deal with interdisciplinary issues and be able to communicate with medical and nonmedical complementary practitioners. Ethical principles need to be applied to integrative medical clinical situations. Clinicians need to be aware of their legislative requirements and regulations regarding complementary medicines. Organisational and legal dimensions Clinicians need to maintain an awareness of medicolegal issues relating to integrative and complementary medicine issues, and need to be up-to-date with current laws and regulations regarding the use of complementary medicines including medical indemnity implications.

Integrative medicine: ReferencesRACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 1 DEFINITION Patient safety in general practice is the freedom from hazards due to medical care or medical error in the general practice setting. In reality, the total absence of harm is unachievable and so the concept of safety relates to the reduction of risk of unnecessary harm associated with health care to an acceptable minimum level. An acceptable minimum refers to t he collective notion of a level of risk that is generally acceptable given the level of curr ent knowledge, resources available and the context in which care is delivered weighed against the risk of non-treatment or other treatment. Patient safety initiatives in general practice often involve quite complex terminology and consistent use of language is required to enable constructive approaches to gaining skills in this area. This curriculum uses patient safety terms and language consistent with the World Health Organization and the taxonomy of the World Alliance for Patient Safety.[1] Important terminology A hazard is a circumstance or agent that may lead to harm , damage or loss. Harm includes unexpected or unintended disease, injury, suffering, disability and death. An agent is a person, substance, object or system that acts to produce a change that may lead to harm. A circumstance includes all the situations and factors connected with, or influencing, an event , agent or person/s. Loss is any negative consequence, such as the diminution of quantity, quality, or value resulting from the occurrence of some undesired event, including financial. A medical error is an action with potentially negative co nsequences for the patient that would have been judged wrong by skilled and knowledgeabl e peers at the time of the occurrence of the error, independent of whether the ac tion resulted in any negative consequences. Medical errors can be either failure to complete a planned action as intended (called omission ) and/or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (called commission ) including problems in practice, products, procedures, and systems. This excludes o when the natural history of disease does not respond to treatment o when the foreseeable complications of a correctly performed procedure occur; and o cases in which there is a reasonable disagreement over whether a mistake has occurred. A patient safety incident is an event or circumstance that could have resulted, or did result, in unnecessary harm to a patient. An incident can be a reportable circumstance, near miss, no harm incident or harmful incident (adverse event). A reportable circumstance is a situation in which there was significant potential for harm, but no incident occurred, such as a ve ry busy clinical session with staff absent or the discovery of faulty equipment although it was not needed. A near miss is an incident which did not reach the patient. For example, an antibiotic injection was prepared and was about to be given to the wrong patient, but this error was detected before the injection was given. A no harm incident is an event that r eached a patient but no discernable harm resulted. For example, an antibiotic inje ction was prepared and was given to the wrong patient, but there were no adverse reactions to the injection. RACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 2 A harmful incident (adverse event ) is an incident that results in harm to a patient. For example, an antibiotic injection was pr epared and was given to the wrong patient, and the patient dies from an allergic reaction. Other important terms used within discussions of patient safety and the context of general practice include: Adverse outcome: the outcome of an adverse event. Error : Error is a generic term to encompass all those occasions in which a planned action, such as a sequence of ment al or physical activities, fails to achieve its intended outcomes; or the application of an incorrect plan, and when these failures cannot be attributed to the intervention of some chance agency.[1, 2] There are many sorts of errors. These include: active errors , where the effects are felt almost immediately; and latent errors , where errors in design, organisation of training or maintenance may lead to operator errors at a later point in time. That is, the errors lie dormant or latent within a system that creates the potential for adverse events. The pre-existing conditions leading to latent errors are called latent conditions . Human factors: Human factors is the study of the interrelationship between humans, their tools and the environment in which they live and work.[1] Lapse : a skill-based failure when the operator knows what to do, but fails to do so, by omitting or forgetting a step in a sequence of events, often related to memory failure. Open disclosure : The process of open discussion of adverse health care events and the associated investigation and improvement undertak en to reduce the risk of recurrence of the harm. Risk management : The process of clinical, administrative and manufacturing activities undertaken to identify, evaluate, a nd reduce the risk of injury to patients, staff, and visitors and the organisation itself. Root cause analysis: a systematic process for investigating incidents or adverse outcomes in order to determine the multiple, underlying contributing factors and, where appropriate, to develop recommendations for improvements to decr ease the likelihood of a similar incident in the future. The analysis focuses primarily on systems and is interdisciplinary in nature. Slip/slip-up : an inadvertent skill-based failure of an executed action. Swiss cheese model : a model of how defences, barriers and safeguards for the patient may be penetrated by an accident.[3] Systems approach : An approach that focuses on multidisciplinary systems analysis to uncover both the: proximal cause (the superficial or obvious cause of the incident), and systemic causes of errors Systemic errors are based on the concept that although individuals make errors, characteristics of the systems within which t hey work can make errors more likely. Error inquiry then focuses on circumstances rather t han on operator characteristics. More errors are likely to be eliminated by focusing on systems than on individuals.[1] RACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 3 RATIONALE Patient safety encompasses all aspects of heal th care that all patients receive. This incorporates all the elements that may contri bute to an adverse event occurring during the process of health care provision. Safety covers everything from harm caused as a result of a wrong clinical procedure or decision, to the adverse effects of drugs, ha zards posed by medical devices, substandard products, human shortcomings or system errors . These events may occur in hospital settings but also in any other health care provision setti ng, such as primary health care clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies, patients' homes and clinical trials.[4] Patient safety is achieved primarily through th e development and implementation of strategies that reduce the risk of events that could cause harm to patient s. Collecting, classifying and aggregating data and information about these events, particularly with regard to preventive, mitigating and recovery strategies, is a central pa rt of the process for im proving patient safety. Classification of patient safety data requir es universal agreement and understanding of key terms and concepts as well as a standardised method for examining the data.[1] Although, by international standards, the quality of Australian general practice is generally high, risks of harm to patients, health workers, general practice organisations and their patient communities are always present. Research into the frequency and nature of error in primary health care shows diversity in the findings.[5] This may be due to different me thods of collecting data about adverse events which lead to differences in the reported rates.[6] However, the incident monitoring techniques can be successfully applied to Aust ralian general practice which could facilitate the identification of contributing factors to adverse events in order to allow the development of preventive interventions.[7] Contributing factors that infl uence safety can be seen as a combination of personal, contextual and task dependent factors[2] suggesting the need for general practitioners to assess risk attributed to the clinicians, syst ems, and to patients themselves[8]. Although patients are usually thought of in a passive way (a s the victims of error), there is considerable scope for them to play an active role in ensuring that their health care is appropriate, and in preventing mistakes.[9] General practice includes many invasive procedures, from seemingly simple actions such as immunisation to more complex tasks such as majo r skin flap surgery. Many of these activities, including apparently simple tasks, may be subject to error that may result in patient harm. As a result, there is a range of patient safety re lated knowledge and skills relevant across many general practice activities and contexts, for exampl e, the ability to identify causes of lapses in safety. Also, there is a range of context specific patient safe ty related knowledge and skills, such as processes for ensuring the correct proced ure is done at the correct site for the correct patient.[10] The importance of effective communication is a common theme in research about patient safety. Communication errors are reported to be the leading causes of patient harm. Communication occurs at a number of levels and can be verbal or written. The presence of effective communication tools such as br iefings, handover, good record keeping, patient information materials and checklists, and behav iours such as clinician assertiveness can reduce the rate of harm.[11] Poor communication after an adverse event, and not only the original injury, can determine the decision to take legal action. Concern about the standards of care, the need for an explanation, compensation, and the belief that staff and organisations should be accountable are emerging as reasons for litigation.[12] Research suggests that adverse events relat ed to medicines are common in primary health care[13], that medication errors are widely dist ributed amongst doctors and that a reduction in medication errors requires a systems approach.[14] There is a widespread practice in medicine that focuses on the forgetfulness, carelessness and poor motivation of the health care provider (the so called 'person approach'). This RACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 4 approach isolates safety from the context in whic h it is maintained or reduced. Although there is a tendency for health care team members to define error as a breach of standards by an individual[15], a systems approa ch that identifies contributi ng factors in the environment and builds defences against potential harm regardless of the cause is more appropriate. This approach takes a complementary role to a focu s on competence in the individual[3]. Members of high performing teams generally have a cl ear understanding of their roles and of the demands on other team members and work wi thin a climate of openness and trust where team leaders are receptive to alternate views.[16] Risk management in the health care system involves all levels of an organisation and is concerned with the creation and maintenance of safe systems of care.[17] Systems utilised by the primary health care provider will vary but may include such tools as monitoring and reporting, practice system audits, recall system s, incident logging and relevant continuous professional development activities.[10] Promoting a culture of safety in health care setti ngs is one of the pillars of the patient safety movement. A patient safety culture recognises t he inevitability of error and actively seeks to create safeguards for patients.[18] The journey of general practice can mean th at as workplace situations and patient populations change, some knowledge and skill s are enhanced, while other areas are diminished. This emphasises the role for ongoing vigilance of self and others in relation to competence, performance and maintaining the ability to refer appropriately. Advances in the 'science' of general practice, such as new m edicines, new technology and improved evidence about efficacy and effectiveness, also mean that th e risks to patients change. Therefore, key workplace attitudes that foster genera l practice patient safety promote: a just, supportive and transparent culture skills and knowledge in error-awareness, and a systems approach.

RACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 5 THE FIVE DOMAINS OF GENERAL PRACTICE -PATIENT SAFETY COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE PATIENT - DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP Communication during the therapeutic process includes interactions between attention to external cues (such as a patient describing t heir presenting problem) and internal cues (such as a sense of unease or internal thoughts qu estioning events). Active listening to patients helps clinicians recognise external cues while self-awareness and self-reflection helps critically appraise inte rnal cues. Self-reflection then also assesses when these cues are a help or hazard to patient safety. Effective patient communication helps clinicians acknowledge the experience that patients bring to their care, such as their knowledge about their symptoms and treatments, to help protect their safety. Patients can take an active role in patient safety, sometimes helping to detect errors and adverse events, which may al ert doctors to the presence of risk. Effective communication with patients and the ge neral practice team about complaints and the patient's concerns is a key skill for general practitioners in promoting patient safety. Effective skills in discussing adverse events with patients an d peers that aim to identify causes and prevent recurrence ar e key tools in reducing harm. APPLIED PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS Changes in the person (such as change in cogni tive state), the patient health care context (such as the emergence of new diseases) and in the nature of clinical care (for example, advances in technology) all create changes that may increase the likelihood of harm to patients, requiring ongoing vigilance as to t he impact of these changes on clinical care. The impact of human factors, such as the role of cognitive overload and resilience, need to be applied to the general practice setting in orde r to maximise the safety of patients. Knowledge about, and the use of, processes that en sure that the correct patient receives the correct treatment or procedure is integral to safe general practice care. These processes need to be compatible with those used in the acute health setting sector (such as the same rules are used for marking sites for procedur es), so that errors are minimised. General practitioners need to be able to recognise and manage adverse outcomes including adverse events and near misses in patient care. Understanding the characteristics of effe ctive teams and the skills needed to develop and sustain effective teams is a core element of ens uring a systemic approach to patient safety. Knowledge and skills in the identification of t he causes of near misses and adverse events are central to reducing risk of harm. The approaches to causal analysis used, need to reflect the Australian general practice setting. General practitioners also need to have the skills and knowledge necessary to undertake both quality assurance and quality improvement activities that reduce the risk of adverse events. POPULATION HEALTH AND THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL PRACTICE Knowledge about the incidence of harm to pati ents, for example, common causes of harm, focuses attention on the most effective interventio ns for reducing the risk of harm to patients. Factors that affect the capacity of patients to engage in reducing risk of harm during their health care need to be identified, so that care and patient safety measures can be tailored accordingly. Examples include the legal compet ence of patients and t heir views of medical care and the authority of doctors. A variety of ways of explaining risk is needed, in order to meet the needs of the community, of which some will have more difficulty understanding the magnitude, likelihood and impact of the risks they face in their health care. This includes adapting risk explanations to people from culturally and linguistica lly diverse backgrounds. RACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 6 General practice advocacy at a health system le vel helps to protect the safety of patients, whether this is by alerting manufacturers to de sign limitations (for example, poor packaging) or by ensuring that the health syst em itself is not a barrier to pat ient safety (for example, the impact of workforce numbers on safe general practice care). PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL ROLE Applying the legal and ethical requirements for obtaining informed consent from patients and carers is a key strategy in reducing patient ha rm. This application extends to the impact and implications of competence in decision making, and to advance decision making including advance care planning and health directives. Maintaining the safety of patients requires general practitioners to provide feedback on performance to all members of the general practice team. This includes engaging with peers, team members and other providers about issu es such as competency and then undertaking steps that protect patients from rela ted factors that may cause harm. Familiarity with the principles of natural justic e and procedural fairness helps this to occur when patient safety issues are investigated. An active role in seeking feedback from patients, general practice peers, team members, and acting on the feedback helps promote a safer patient environment. Documentation of processes and procedures, such as triage arrangements and quality improvement processes, helps promote patient safety and is an important component of the professional role of general practitioners. General practitioners need to undertake quality assurance and quality improvement activities which reduce the likelihood of harm to patients. ORGANISATIONAL AND LEGAL DIMENSIONS General practitioners need to communicate effectiv ely with members of their teams, to ensure that there is continuity of the information flow needed to optimise patient care and protect patient safety. General practitioners need to be able to engage with the members of their teams in briefings before, and where necessary, debriefings after pr ocedures with which team members assist. Effective recording of clinical encounters with pat ients is central to the continuity of safe, high quality patient care, and to the resolution of adverse outcomes. The development of an open, transparent, suppor tive and just culture within the general practice setting is regarded as the foundation of safety for patients and members of the health care team. Thus, the active engagement in this activity by general practitioners is a key dimension of patient safety. General practitioners need to facilitate teamwork, and demonstrate both leadership and the ability to take direction and work within teams when necessary. The protection of the safety of patients involves the reporting of incidents including lapses in safety, slips, errors, mistakes, adverse events and near misses within the practice. General practitioners need to assist in cultivating a meaningful and timely way of reporting and acting on reports. General practitioners need to report errors appropriately to organisations outside the practice such as their medical indemnity insurer, companies for equipment failures and other agencies such as adverse drug reporting authorities. It is important for general practitioners to underst and their legal obligations (including those to their medical indemnity insurers ), especially in the context of the discussion of adverse events. RACGP Curriculum Project Patient Safety Curriculum Statement: Patient Safety \u2014 7 A systems based approach to health focussing on the contributions to safety resulting from practice systems is likely to produce a safer health care environment, thus complementing the person based approach.

All rights reservedPractice management\u0018Curriculum statement: Practice management Definition Practice management involves decisions, actions and resource allocation to enable the provision of professional services to meet the objectives of the organisation. The management of a medical practice requires understanding of the needs of the health professionals, patients, nonmedical staff and the community. Management processes involve planning, finance, technology application, information and, most importantly, people. Practice management: Definition\u0018Curriculum statement: Practice management Rationale The effective delivery of health care to patients and the community depends on efficient practice management systems that address the needs of patients, the community and health professionals in a balanced, responsive and cost effective way. Involvement in management is not confined to practice owners and practice managers, but also requires the participation of all persons in the practice. General practitioners, as a health professionals, need to understand and apply management knowledge and skills to ensure the best outcomes for their patients and themselves. Important issues that need to be addressed in relation to practice management and health needs of the community include: workforce shortages and the increased reliance on team based community care funding for health care the application of quality management principles, evidence based management and risk management to all areas of practice management, and health information management. Practice management provides the medium for clinical practice and is a significant determinate in successful health outcomes. The application of practice management occurs across the five domains of general practice, and is critical in the working life of the general practitioner and needs to be sensitive to the context of general practice. Wherever a clinical activity occurs there is a management activity occurring in tandem. For example, performing a Pap test requires a range of management activities, including the provision of facilities and equipment, couriers for slides, information management, recall systems and staff. General practitioners need to effectively manage their professional role as medical practitioners and organisational role as a member of a general practice, regardless of whether the have an ownership or an employee role. General practitioners are increasingly working as part of a multidisciplinary general practice team, presenting new challenges to practice management. Human resource management will become more complex including processes associated with recruitment and ongoing staff management. General practitioners practice in a range of clinical situations and the management processes involved will vary according to the setting. To enable all doctors to fulfil their clinical role, knowledge of management is needed. More depth of understanding is required for general practitioners who are running their own practice compared to employed general practitioners. Refer also to curriculum statement: Health informatics. Practice management: Rationale\u0018Curriculum statement: Practice management The five domains of general practice - practice management Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Patients and their carers need clear communication with respect to practice operational procedures such as opening times, access to after hours services and home visits, and costs and billings. Potential barriers to communicating practice procedures need to be identified and overcome, eg. in patients with disabilities, young people and patients from linguistically and culturally diverse backgrounds. Applied professional knowledge and skills Knowledge of the regulations impacting upon the business of general practice is essential for effective patient management. Population health and the context of general practice An overall knowledge and special characteristics of the Australian health system and how general practice operates within this environment influences Australian practice management practice processes, including special issues relating to the local community. Professional and ethical role Practice governance, ethical and legal considerations all influence practice management process. Balancing work-life issues are central to professional and personal success management. Organisational and legal dimensions Organisational skills are the foundation of good practice management. While management skills have traditionally not taken a high role in medical education, they are essential to ensuring the viability of high quality general practice services, and therefore, the cornerstone of the Australian health system. While many individual issues require attention for effective practice management, they can be grouped into areas of financial management, working with people, managing facilities, practice quality and safety, and information management.

Practice management: Learning objectives - continuing professional developmentRACGP Curriculum Project Procedural skills Curriculum Statement: Procedural skills \u2014 1 DEFINITION Procedural skills encompass the areas of clinical care that require physical and practical skills of the clinician in order to accomplish a specific and well characterised technical task, or medical procedure (or just a procedure ). A procedure is a manual intervention that aims to produce a specific outcome during the course of patient care; it may be investigational , diagnostic, and/or therapeutic, and is usually able to be performed in the ambulatory primary health care setting thus excluding: manual skills which are part of routine clinical examination purely interpretive skills complex surgical procedures that require a general anaesthetic. Inherent in the term of medical procedure is the concept of invasiveness . This may involve discomfort for the patient and a risk of advers e effects and complications associated with the procedure in addition to those associated wi th the medical condition which initially necessitated the procedure. This aspect of invasiveness is not absolute, as some procedures are more invasive than others, for example, venepuncture compared with urinalysis. Procedures may require the use of equipment which, in turn, implies the need for appropriately equipped and resourced facilities with quality control processes in place for the successful completion of the procedure. Procedural skills requirements vary according to the context in which procedures are performed and according to the level of complexi ty of the required procedure. For example, general practitioners in rural and remote communities may be required to provide treatment such as emergency medicine procedures[1], which en tail a level of complexity different to that of their urban counterparts. The term advanced rural level skills has been developed to describe these requirements which include: major general surgery obstetrics (inc. management of the delivery, surgical or non surgical) anaesthesia (inc. general anaesthesia) orthopaedic surgery (inc. the management of dislocations and fractures requiring major regional or general anaesthesia) radiology (inc. personally performed x-rays , ultrasounds and/or echocardiograms with interpretation of results, not confined to limb x-rays) endoscopy (inc. colonoscopy or gastroscopy) Procedural skill competency is the type and level of behaviour required in relation to a specific skill to achieve a successful outco me. For example, the skill competency for one procedure (eg dipstick urinalysis) may include the ability to explain and perform the task appropriately in an unsupervised fashion. Other procedures may require just the skill to be able to explain the procedure's principles to a patient without the necessary skill for the clinician to perform the procedure themselves, eg. an abdominal CT scan. Clinicians need to be familiar with the professional, legal and jurisdictional requirements regarding eligibility to perfo rm particular procedures. Procedural competency often involves the ac quisition of specific psychomotor skills. Procedural skills training needs to provide the opportunity to perform and perfect the necessary psychomotor skills, taking into account that the acquisition of knowledge and skills takes place at an individual rate. RACGP Curriculum Project Procedural skills Curriculum Statement: Procedural skills \u2014 2 RATIONALE Procedural medicine is an integral part of Australian general practice and is becoming more common. During 2008-09, there were 16.7 procedural events for every 100 general practice encounters. This is a significantly higher nu mber of procedures than the 12.5 procedures per 100 patient encounters in 1999-00.[2] Patient safety and informed consent For many patients, a successful clinical outcome depends on having a well performed technical procedure. Therefore, technical co mpetence is a key aspect for procedural training.[3] The opportunities for learning and successfully performing procedural tasks necessary for unsupervised general practice need to be balanced with concerns of patient safety, which are of the highest priority during any medical procedure. The ability to educate and inform patients of t he risks and benefits of each procedure and to ensure that informed consent is obtained is part of procedural skills competency. This includes discussing any discomfort or pain and how these will be managed. Acquiring proficiency in proced ural skills requires skills in recognising and managing associated complications. Maximising procedural skill competencies not only helps to minimise any potential harm to patients, but may also help minimise potential medicolegal consequences. Continuing surveillance of reports from medical boards, alerts, bulletins, medical defence organisation, continuing education and surveillance authorities for trends in procedural risk complications provides an important opportunity to identif y and minimise adverse risk associated with medical procedures. Occupational health and safety Education on the potential hazards to the health of the clinician performing the procedure and their assistant(s) is critical for the prev ention and management of procedural-related harm. Clinicians and workplace managers need to be aware of their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a safe work environment during procedural tasks or procedural complications in accordance with workplace standards; for ex ample, the safe handling of body fluids and substances, or the clinician's responsibilities regarding blood borne virus transmission and the management of needle stick injuries. Clinicians must also recognise that psychomotor impairment or medical conditions may affect the ability to successfully and safely perform te chnical tasks and must act appropriate to each particular circumstance. This ma y require limiting participation to those tasks for which they can demonstrate competence. Procedural skills and the general practitioner learning life Over the general practice learning life, vary ing procedural skill le vels may be required. In general, procedural skills acquired as a medi cal student provide a basis for procedural skill acquisition later in the learning life, although career path changes can result in significant changes in procedural skill requirements and competency levels. General practitioners need to recognise their current procedural skill requ irements and ensure t hat the appropriate skill competency level is maintained. Skill level requirements will often depend upon the clinical context. For example, a prevocational hospital doctor may have acquired specific procedural skills that may not be required when they commence working in an urban general practice. This lack of demand for the use of this skill may result in a diminish ed skill level. However, should the need arise for this clinician to practise in a remote area, they may need to undertake additional training to acquire appropriate sk ill competency levels. RACGP Curriculum Project Procedural skills Curriculum Statement: Procedural skills \u2014 3 Some general practitioners will develop special in terest areas, for exam ple, dermatology or aviation medicine, requiring a different procedural skill set in addition to that of routine general medical practice. Clinicians in these situati ons need to be clear on their skill requirements and the ongoing requirements for pr ocedural skill maintenance. Procedural skill requirements fo r the level of final year medical students are set by medical schools and the Australian Medical Council.[4] Procedural skill requirements for prevocational doctors (first and second postgraduate year and later) are set by the Australian Curriculum Framework for Junior Doctors.[5] Procedural skill requirements for general practice registrars for Fellowship are set by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. General practitioners with a special interest area or undertaking additional procedural skills need to ensure that their skill levels meet t he recognised standards/curriculum requirements for procedural skill competency acquisition and maintenance. Examples include: advanced rural skills training[1] Fellowship of Advanced Rural General Practice[6] RACGP Joint Consultative Committees[7] other specialist medical colleges other jurisdictional requirements/standards, eg. the Australian Government requirements for Yellow Fever vaccination providers[8] or RACGP guidelines for Implanon insertion.[9] Procedural skills, Advanced Life Su pport (ALS) and the RACGP Fellowship Competencies in procedural skills related to em ergency life support measures are critical for successful patient management. Advanced lif e support training is a requirement for Fellowship, and doctors must complete training in the early management of trauma and advanced life support (ALS) during vocational training (see Requirement V.12. )[10]. Teaching of procedural skills Training of technical procedures through parts of a medical practitioner's learning life has been reported as being unsystematic and unstructured.[3] This may be because the need for procedures which can then be us ed to observe, learn, and dev elop skill levels often arises randomly. Doctors at all levels of their learning lives ar e often involved in teachi ng procedural skills to their juniors: the medical student may learn skills fr om the first year intern or the registrar from the vocational doctor, reflected in the traditional expression \"See one, do one, teach one\". Teaching can also be an important method of reinfo rcing learning in the teacher. Clinicians involved in teaching need to assess their teachi ng processes to ensure that they are teaching technical skills in a systematic manner. Use of simulation based teaching techniques to init ially acquire and to practice skills is highly recommended.

RACGP Curriculum Project Procedural skills Curriculum Statement: Procedural skills \u2014 4 THE FIVE DOMAINS OF GENERAL PRACTICE -PROCEDURAL SKILLS COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE PATIENT - DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP The ability to clearly explain all facets of the pr ocedure is critical to obtaining valid informed consent. This includes: explaining the reasons for the procedure explaining the steps of the procedure explaining the potential outcomes includ ing benefits, risks and complications addressing patient interests and concerns. APPLIED PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS Clinicians need a procedural skill competency level appropriate to their learning life level and workplace requirements. This is achieved th rough the application of medical procedural knowledge relevant to their requirements, explai ning indications, contraindications, patient preparation methods, sterile techniques, pain management and proper techniques for handling specimens and fluids obtained, and test results. Clinicians also need to be able to recognise and manage complications of pr ocedures. This may involve recognising complications of procedures that they did not perform. POPULATION HEALTH AND THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL PRACTICE A knowledge of the pattern of risks and complica tions of procedural errors through the reports from medical boards, alerts, bulletins, medical defence organisation, continuing education and surveillance authorities provides an important opportunity to identify and minimise adverse risk associated with medical procedures. Clinicians also need to be aware of other community risks, such as the transmission of blood bor ne viruses and their potential for transmission between patients and health care providers during procedures. PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL ROLE The level of competence required for each procedural skill level is dependent upon the specific requirements for the st age of the learning life and work requirements. Clinicians need to be able to detail their procedural requirements and to acquire and maintain skill competency levels appropriate to meet these requirements. The presence of psychomotor impairment or medical conditions may affect the ability to successfully and safely perform technical tasks and work practices may need to be altered to suit each particular circumstance. This may require limiting participation to tasks for which competence or suitabilit y can be demonstrated. Clinicians need to be familiar with any professional, legal and jurisdictional requirements regarding eligibility to perfo rm particular procedures. ORGANISATIONAL AND LEGAL DIMENSIONS Procedural tasks need to meet the ethical and l egal requirements for patient informed consent including documentation. Systemic processes need to include a mechanism for the ongoing identification and minimisation of procedural related risks (see Patient safety RACGP curriculum statement for more detail). Organisational measures need to ensure t hat facilities are appropriately equipped and resourced to meet procedural task requirements.

RACGP Curriculum Project Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice Curriculum Statement: Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice \u2014 1 DEFINITION Undifferentiated problems refer to ambiguous, uncertain, unexplained and undiagnosed symptoms, problems, conditions and ill nesses presenting to the clinician. The causes and management of undifferentiated problems may become clearer through history, examination or investigations, or may become clearer over time as a disease process progresses. For example, a connective tissue di sease such as systemic lupus erythematosus may first present as tiredness, but further inve stigation or the passage of time may result in the diagnosis becoming clearer. Similarly, the cause of an initial presentation of undiagnosed chest pain would become apparent if a dermatomal rash developed after one day, ie. herpes zoster. Some undifferentiated problems remain undiagnosed despite thorough assessment and investigation. Some undifferentiated problems may have a psychological origin, which presents potential challenges to patient safety because of the pot ential for missed, delayed or wrong diagnosis. RATIONALE Undifferentiated problems are most likely to present in general practice. For example, the presentation of weakness or tiredness is common in general practice and accounts for a significant proportion of the reasons for initiati ng further investigations, such as blood tests.[1] General practitioners are primarily diagnostician s[2] and are highly experienced at managing undifferentiated problems. These problems challenge diagnostic skills and clinical decision making processes that are ai med at discovering serious illness at an appropriate stage while minimising over-investigation of patients.[3] The expertise in dealing with undifferentiated problems places general practitioners in an ideal situation to educate and train other clinicians in this skill area. Important differences exist between primary care and secondary/tertiary care medicine, with distinct differences between the patients, pathol ogies, and presentations encountered by the GP in comparison with a specialist colleague. Conditions seen in general practice are often evolving, when text book descriptions and classifications simply do not apply. Early presentation of many illnesses defy categori sation because they are transient and self limiting, or are treated early before reac hing the stage of traditional diagnosis.[2] General practitioners also make different de cisions from specialists with the precise diagnostic labels being sometimes less important than deciding on an appropriate course of action. For example, a diagnosis may be framed in terms of dichotomous decisions: treatment versus nontreatment, referral versus nonref erral, and serious versus nonserious. For example, the management of a respiratory infect ion might not require a specific diagnosis, but rather a specific decision or whethe r antibiotics are required or not.[2] The range of common undifferentiated problems in general practice is large and includes such presentations as fatigue, insomnia, stress, dizziness, headache, anorexia and nausea, sexual difficulty, weight loss, loss of interest and abdominal discomfort.[4] The role of the passage of time and knowledge of the natural history of these conditions are a key general practice aspect in managing undifferentiated problems[3]. Characteristic of undifferentiated problems is the presence of uncertainty and ambiguity, which presents both management challenges for the clinician and how these uncertainties are communicated to patients.[2, 5] The role of uncertainty in clinical care is not clear. Uncertainty in clinical decision making has been linked to adverse outcomes in patient care in the prevocational setting and linked to a variety of potential adverse outco mes.[6] One study of uncertainty in primary care physicians does not demonstrate differences in patient outco mes, although the presence of uncertainty resulted in changing approaches to informati on seeking on the part of the physicians.[7] Regardless of the impact of uncertainty, clin ical strategies for managing undifferentiated RACGP Curriculum Project Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice Curriculum Statement: Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice \u2014 2 problems need to adopt a 'fail-safe' strategy[8 ] and recognise that some symptoms may never be attributed to specific conditions. The potential for diagnostic failures is com pounded by psychological cond itions presenting as physical symptoms, and clinicians need to develop clear strategies for attributing symptoms to both physical and psychological conditions. This may also require a multidisciplinary approach and professional support to ensure that diagnoses are not being missed.[9] Clinician explicitness and clarity in the decision making processes during the history taking, the examination, and investigations that incl ude the role of evidence based medicine, help maximise diagnostic effectiveness and patient sa fety and minimise over investigation. This includes familiarity with serious conditions that must not be missed, conditions commonly missed and conditions that may present with un usual or elusive symptoms. Evidence based approaches to assessment and management[10] ca n help to clarify and strengthen decision making processes. In addition, general practitioners develop familiarity with the disease patterns specific to their geographical areas of practice which may help establish local variations in disease presentations and diagnoses compared with other regions. For example, presentations of hay fever in spring may be due to local pollen conditions making this diagnosis more common in their area when compared to other localities. Communication skills are critical to characterising undifferentiated problems and to communicating management outcomes to patients. Patients with limited capacity to give completed histories, for example, children, patients with dementia or some patients with disabilities may need family, friends and carers to be consulted for further clarification. Uncertainty can be a source of considerable anxiety for patients, and learning to manage this is a key general practice skill. In addition, due to the role of psychological conditions in undifferentiated problems, communication skills are the key to successful counselling outcomes for managing undifferentiated problems of a psychogenic origin. Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice affects many other curriculum statement areas, but in particular see Patient safety and Critical thinking and research. RACGP Curriculum Project Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice Curriculum Statement: Dealing with undifferentiated problems in general practice \u2014 3 THE FIVE DOMAINS OF GENERAL PRACTICE - DEALING WITH UNDIFFERENTIATED PROBLEMS IN GENERAL PRACTICE COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE PATIENT -DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP Clear communication helps characterise symptoms as part of a diagnostic and management strategy for undifferentiated problems in t he general practice setting. Where patients are unable to give clear histories, history ta king may involve family, carers and others. Communication skills are also required to counsel patients when managing uncertainty of diagnosis and management. APPLIED PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS Skilful history taking, examination and appropr iate investigations are key skills in the successful management of undifferentiated proble ms in the primary care setting. Familiarity with early presentations of evolving conditions, their natural history and the impact of early treatment can help characterise undifferent iated problems in general practice. Some undifferentiated problems remain unexpl ained and undiagnosed despite thorough assessment and investigation, requiring sound communication to manage any uncertainties that may arise. Diagnostic strategies are cr itical in preventing missed, delayed or wrong diagnoses. An understanding of the role of appr opriate diagnostic tests in reducing diagnostic uncertainty helps prevent inappropriate investigations. The diagnosis and management of psychological factors in undifferentiated problem s are critical skills for long term management. POPULATION HEALTH AND THE CONTEXT OF GENERAL PRACTICE Undifferentiated problems are common in the general practice setting and clinicians need to be familiar with their common pa tterns of presentations includi ng transient and self limiting diseases. Clinicians need to be familiar with the patterns of serious conditions that should not be missed, difficult to diagnose conditions and common conditions which present as undifferentiated problems. Some undifferentiated problems may have a psychological origin, which presents potential challenges to patient safety because of the potential for diagnostic errors. PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL ROLE Self awareness of clinical decision making processes can help highlight potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of undifferentiated problems. Unders tanding the professional role of the general practitioner in the management of undifferent iated problems recognises that primary care patients present with differing patterns of undifferentiated problems from the secondary/tertiary setting, requiring particular diagnostic and management decisions. As managing undifferentiated problems is mainly the domain of the general practitioner, experienced general practitioners should consider the possibility of training registrars and others in the management of undifferentiated problems. ORGANISATIONAL AND LEGAL DIMENSIONS Multidisciplinary teams may be required to successfully characterise and manage undifferentiated problems. The legal implications of potential diagnostic errors also need to be considered.
