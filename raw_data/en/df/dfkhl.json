It gives you the best protection against COVID-19. Millions of adults and children around the world have had a COVID-19 vaccine. The safety of the vaccines has been extensively reviewed in both adults and children by independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The vaccines continue to be monitored and reports of serious side effects are very rare. Common side effects of COVID-19 vaccination Like all medicines, the COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. Most side effects are mild and should not last longer than a week, such as: - a sore arm from the injection - feeling tired - a headache - feeling achy - mild flu-like symptoms - feeling or being sick You or your child should rest. You can also take pain relief such as [paracetamol](/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/) to help you feel better. You cannot catch COVID-19 from the vaccine.

If you've ever had a serious allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis), tell healthcare staff before you're vaccinated. They may ask what you're allergic to. If you've had a mild allergic reaction before, such as a rash, wheezing or hives, you'll probably get a common COVID-19 vaccine. Staff giving the vaccine are trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately. If you are at risk of a serious allergic reaction, they may refer you to a specialist clinic to have an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.
