In the past, I reasoned this saying to be a metaphor for compassion...that as we work through our pain, we become more connected and loving toward others. What I discovered is; that introspective examination assigning the meaning to pain and painful events is soul work while the work of connecting and loving others is a good but superficial start. In A Separate Peace, the main character Gene goes through an identity crisis. An identity crisis is a physical or emotional state, where a person has trouble truly finding themselves, who she or he may be, what their role is in society and what meaning it has in the eyes of society. Also, it may be referred to by psychology as \"a period of uncertainty and confusion in which a person's sense of identity becomes insecure, typically due to a change in their expected aims or role in society.\" This makes sense because Gene as a new student and the impression is given that he is the smartest student in the whole school. He continues to feel like he is constantly competing with himself and Phineas strives to be the greatest that he can be.

A certain points in time for Religion is a means for people to find answers to life's big questions. Within Aboriginal spirituality, the natural and supernatural are closely linked. Their spirituality is lived in their daily lives and their supernatural deities are active in their activities. The sacred stories of the Aboriginal peoples take place in a timeless world. They are given various names across the numerous regions of Indigenous Australia. Some of these names include 'aldjeringa' in Arrernte of Central Australia and 'wongar' in Arnhem Land. These terms are translated in English as the \"Dreaming\", or the \"Dreamtime.\" This refers to the time when ancestral beings formed the land, the animals and plants, and the laws that keep everything in existence. It is an integral and important aspect in the life of Aboriginal people - it is a construction of how they view the world. Your body is made of various forms of matter and energy - organs, tissues, cells, molecules, blood, nutrients, hormones, neuron transmitters, ions, body liquids, water, oxygen - not only these biological substances, but also emotional and spiritual energies - all these are driven by your vital energy Qi life force to circulate within your body and mind along your energy meridians. The brain controls everything the body does. The spinal cord carries messages between the body and the brain. Together, they make up the central nervous system (CNS). Some prescription drugs slow down, or depress, the CNS. Others speed up, or stimulate, the CNS. People who abuse CNS stimulants or depressants give control of their bodies to the drug, sometimes with dangerous consequences. The inquisition and philosophies between the mind and body have been being discussed for hundreds of years. Whether or not we our minds have a practical influence on our body. Or human minds are of its own entity and contain a soul that constitutes how we act and function. Dualism constitutes that the mind and body are not identical and therefore the effect of one does not influence the other. Many philosophers believed in the concept of dualism. Many include Plato and his theory of forms. Substance dualism is the belief that there are three parts to a person: the mind, the brain and the physical body. The theory holds that although the mind and the brain interact, it is the mind that makes decisions. In other words, the brain's sole purpose is to transfer sensory information about the world to the mind, and in turn, the mind transfers the decision back to the brain, which then tells the physical body what to do. The question is whether or not substance dualism should be taken seriously. Before continuing to argue for substance dualism, it is important to note that the definition of the mind which substance dualism speaks of is separate from the traditional definition and understanding of the mind in modern society, which usually includes the brain. The brain is the most complex and magnificent organ of the human body. It controls the muscle movements, the secretions of glands,breathing and internal temperature. Every creative thought, feeling, and plan is developed by the brain. The brain acts as the body's control center. The human brain can be divided into the forebrain, mid-brain and hind-brain. The cerebellum and brain stem constitute the hind brain. The tectum and the cerebral peduncles form the mid-brain. The forebrain is made of the diencephalon, cerebrum, meninges and cerebro-spinal fluid. The brain is a complex organ made of several parts, each with a specific function. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that is involved in motor control such as maintaining physical balance, thereby allowing a person to be in control of his/her body movements. It also coordinates voluntary muscle movements like walking by controlling the timing at which different muscles work together to produce accurate movement in a particular body part. Because of its involvement in motor control, damage to the cerebellum will result in difficulty in moving body parts and keeping maintaining physical balance. Muscles will not work properly together and a person 's movement will be exaggerated. The hypothalamus is another part of the brain that is situated below the thalamus. This small structure, which is often referred to as the thermostat of the body helps regulate body temperature, amount of fluid in the In Judaism, life is determined by breath, which is the life-giving spirit. Neshama, which is for both \"breath and spirit\" can only be given by God. This is written in the Torah that \"God blew the breath of life into Adam\" (Genesis 2:7). The Zohar, also is the central text of Kabbalah, says that the soul is comprised of three parts. There are three levels that comprise the soul, nefesh, ruah, and neshamah. Nefesh is the lowest of all. Ruah is the sustenance, which actually rules Binge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the U.S. It occurs when a male consumes 5 or more drinks or when a woman consumes 4 or more drinks in a very short time (347). Binge drinking is also associated with many health problems, such as heart attack, suicide, child abuse and etc. It can lead to alcohol poisoning, blackouts and alcohol tolerance. People who chronically drink alcohol often develop alcohol tolerance, which occurs when the brain becomes less sensitive to alcohol (348). The debate of Naturalism versus Christian Views is a topic that garners a lot of attention, especially in scientific endeavors. Naturalism beliefs stem from the view that through scientific investigation you can discover how natural laws or forces operate in the world through evolution over time. On the other hand, Christians believe that God is in control of the universe and that He created humans with a body and a soul allowing a consciousness to be present during mental activities. When looking at this debate the questions that need to be asked is \"What is a soul\" and \"Are thoughts and brain activity the same thing\"? To try and explore the 'mind' it is necessary to examine if the mind and the brain are separate or if the mind and body are distinct from one another? Is the mind and body separate substance or elements of the same substance? Is consciousness the result of the mechanisms of the brain, wholly separate from the brain or inextricably linked? I will explore this question by looking at how this question has developed into two key schools of thought: Dualism and Monism. Dualism states that the mind is not physical and exists separately while Monism states that the mind and body are not separate. There are arguments for both theories and these dichotomous ideas have brought to light the mind-body problem, which I will analyse below. There are sub-forms of both schools of thought and one of the key sub-schools of thought under Dualism which I will discuss is Interactionism; that the mind and body are separate but both influence each other Energy is simply the capacity to do work. Energy has become one of the necessities of our modern life. Energy can have many forms like heat, electrical, chemical, nuclear, light, etc. In the pre historic era fuel wood was the major sources of energy. Conventional energy sources are the ones that have been using so far to fulfill most f our daily energy requirements of cooking, lighting, transportation etc. these are based on fossil fuels like coal, petrol, diesel, kerosene and natural gases. Fossil fuels are obtained from biologically degradable materials such as plant and animal but undergoing million years of excessive heat, pressure, chemical and biological reactions. Thus formation of these fuels takes very long time. Also they are non-renewable sources of energy. "}
