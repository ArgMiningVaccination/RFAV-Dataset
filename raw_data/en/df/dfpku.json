Content and Form of Application Submission . For more information on applying for grants, please visit \"How to Apply for a Grant\" on the ACF Grants & Funding Page at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/grants/how-apply-grant . The Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is announcing funds for the Domestic Victims of Human Trafficking Services and Outreach (DVHT-SO) Program. The DVHT-SO Program's goal is to directly fund organizations that will build, expand, and sustain organizational and community capacity to deliver services to domestic adults and minors who have experienced a severe form of human trafficking as defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, as amended, through the provision of direct services, assistance, and referrals. The following activities are required under the DVHT-SO Program: a) provision of comprehensive, culturally and linguistically responsive case management to individuals who have experienced sex and labor trafficking; and b) outreach efforts to increase identification of domestic individuals who have experienced sex and labor trafficking. The DVHT-SO Program, which is informed by a whole family approach, focuses equally and intentionally on services and opportunities for clients and their immediate family members living in their households. OTIP encourages establishing community partnerships, meaningfully engaging with individuals who have experienced trafficking, and hiring qualified professionals who reflect the communities being served in all project implementation strategies under the DVHT-SO Program. Under the DVHT-SO Program, there is a 12-month project implementation period for prime recipients to facilitate optional partnerships, on-board new staff, and develop service protocols specific to domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking. However, clients must be served during the 12-month project implementation period. Under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients must provide a statutorily mandated 25 percent match (cash or in-kind). I. Program Description Statutory Authority Section 107(f) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000 as amended; (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(f)), and U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(b). Page 4 of 65 Description DVHT-SO PROGRAM OVERVIEW Background Human trafficking is a crime involving the exploitation of someone to perform labor or commercial sex acts through force, fraud, or coercion. Per section 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7102(11) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, as amended, severe forms of trafficking in persons means: Sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age; or Labor trafficking in which there is recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. It is a crime when a minor, a person under the age of 18, is asked or made to perform a sex act in exchange for something of value (e.g., shelter, food, money). There does not need to be a third party (e.g., trafficker) or evidence of force, fraud, or coercion for that minor to be identified as a victim of sex trafficking. Human trafficking victims are often difficult to identify or assist without targeted outreach and referral efforts. Victims can be of any age, race/ethnicity, nationality/citizenship, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, with or without disabilities. At the same time, evidence suggests that individuals impacted by generational trauma, historic oppression, discrimination, and other societal factors and inequities are at higher risk of experiencing human trafficking. Project Objectives The DVHT-SO Program's goal is to fund cooperative agreements that will build, expand, and sustain organizational and local capacity to provide direct services, assistance, and referrals to domestic victims of severe forms of human trafficking as defined by the TVPA of 2000, as amended. Domestic refers to a U.S. citizen or Legal Permanent Resident (LPR). Under the DVHT-SO Program, the following activities are required throughout the project period: 1. Provide comprehensive, culturally responsive, and linguistically appropriate case management and victim assistance to domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking. 2. Conduct outreach to increase identification of domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking. Project Scope DVHT-SO projects' geographic areas may cross state lines, do not need to be contiguous, and can include federally recognized tribal and non-federally recognized Native communities, and urban and rural areas. Prime recipients must be located in the geographic area to be served by the proposed project. Page 5 of 65 The DVHT-SO prime recipient is authorized to form a partnership(s) with other organizations to achieve the DVHT-SO Program's objectives through subawards. If the prime recipient chooses to form a partnership(s), its principal office, or the office of the affiliate responsible for implementing and overseeing the DVHT-SO project, must be located within the proposed project's geographic area. The prime recipient must adhere to 45 CFR \u00a7 75.351 when formalizing partnerships with subrecipient(s). Prime recipients are encouraged to develop partnerships with established local entities to develop and deliver culturally responsive and linguistically appropriate services. See Section I. DVHT-SO Administrative Requirements, Subawards for more information. Refer to OTIP Notice of Funding Opportunity titled Victims of Human Trafficking in Native Communities Demonstration (VHT-NC) Program (HHS-2023-ACF-IOAS-OTIP-TV-0046) for a similar program focused on services, outreach, and public awareness in Native Communities. Lived Experience OTIP encourages the strategic integration and engagement with domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking into DVHT-SO Program project implementation strategies, including hiring qualified professionals who reflect the communities they serve. Prime recipients should incorporate input from individuals with lived expertise in all aspects of the anti- trafficking response development and provide these individuals with opportunities to contribute to program development and activity implementation. These opportunities should provide professional growth and development and not be limited to, or heavily rely on, presentations about their trafficking experience. Survivor engagement must include compensation based upon the level of engagement and comparable rates paid to practitioners and service providers. Domestic individuals with human trafficking lived experience should be involved in efforts including, but not limited to, the following: Developing agency-wide policies and comprehensive case management protocols. Developing strategies for project implementation, victim identification, program evaluation, etc. Developing and delivering outreach activities. Building organizational capacity. Leading or contributing to support groups and/or mentorship initiatives. Identifying community partners. Prime recipients should inform individuals with lived experience of any professional development, leadership training, consultant, and/or employment opportunities available to them in their community and beyond, including opportunities with the National Human Trafficking Training and Technical Assistance Center (NHTTAC) . NHTTAC provides individuals who have experienced human trafficking opportunities to participate in professional development and educational activities and develop anti-trafficking resources. Social Determinants of Health Page 6 of 65 In 2021, the Biden Administration published an Executive Order 13985 On Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government to support communities that have been historically underserved, including people of color and others who have been marginalized and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Social determinants of health have a major impact on people's health and well-being \u2014 and they're a key focus of Healthy People 2030 , the plan in which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sets data-driven national objectives to improve health and well-being over the next decade. Therefore, OTIP encourages community-driven outreach strategies that address the impact of structural inequities that can intensify risk for human trafficking in underserved communities by responding to Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). SDOH-responsive outreach plans should aim for the following: 1. Target historically underserved communities who may not have equal access to positive SDOH like safe housing or job opportunities. 2. Be rooted in community assessments, narratives, and/or studies of local SDOH challenges that increase risk for human trafficking. 3. Engage members of the target community to strategize how to reduce vulnerability to human trafficking. 4. Empower diverse outreach teams whose members are representative of the target outreach community. 5. Invest resources in culturally responsive outreach methods and spaces to build credibility, trust, and connections with assistance. SDOH-responsive prime recipients should substantiate evidence of previous efforts to respond to underserved, at-risk communities with the following: 1. More than two letters of support from community organizations in the service catchment area or representatives with standing in the community that can attest to the applicant's credibility, efforts, and trust among the target community. 2. Results (e.g., increased housing, job, opportunities, etc.) of targeted outreach efforts that have reached underserved communities and connected them to services, including descriptions of project activities and number of individuals reached and/or served within the past 3 calendar years. 3. Lessons learned and/or promising practices from previous work that will inform DVHT- SO strategies. Bonus Points Under the DVHT-SO Program, there are three separate opportunities to receive bonus points listed under Section V.I. Criteria. Bonus points will be awarded to applicants who: 1. Present a plan to meaningfully and ethically engage individuals with lived experience of human trafficking in project activities. 2. Present a SDOH-responsive outreach plan. 3. Substantiate evidence of previous SDOH-responsive efforts. DVHT-SO SERVICE APPROACH Page 7 of 65 The DVHT-SO Program incorporates trauma-informed and person-centered approaches to assist domestic individuals of different racial, ethnic, cultural, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, and religious backgrounds who have experienced human trafficking. A trauma-informed care model assumes that clients and staff have experienced trauma. This model includes organizational change that promotes resilience in clients and staff; engages individuals in care; prevents re-traumatization; and incorporates knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, practices, and settings. For more information on the development of trauma-informed services, and a framework for becoming a trauma-informed organization, system, or service sector, visit the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma-informed Approach . National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) Standards All DVHT-SO Program activities must adhere to the CLAS Standards , which are a comprehensive series of guidelines that inform and facilitate practices related to culturally and linguistically appropriate health services. Clients served under the DVHT-SO Program must receive comprehensive case management assistance and literature in their preferred language, including Indigenous languages. If on-site staff is not available to provide services, the recipient must provide the client with professional interpretation services. The DVHT-SO Program is voluntary; clients must have the option to decline services provided by the agency supported under the program. The clients' concerns and priorities should guide the actions of the service delivery strategy. Prime recipients must incorporate culturally responsive and traditional healing practices into the project design and implementation, if appropriate. Cultural wisdom and traditional practices are fundamental to achieving behavioral health improvements today and effecting change for future generations. Recipients must provide, or arrange for, services to be provided in a manner that is sensitive to the age, culture, religion, dietary needs, native language, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other important individual needs of each client. All clients enrolled in DVHT-SO funded services are entitled to human rights protections and freedom from discrimination and abuse. Recipients must ensure that clients who identify as Two-Spirit, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, and/or other sexual and gender minorities are fairly treated and served. Whole Family Approach The DVHT-SO Program is informed by a whole-family approach that focuses on services and opportunities for clients and their family members living within their households. While the TVPA of 2000, as amended, does not authorize direct benefits for family members, this funding is intended to allow family members to derive benefits from the services provided, when in the client's best interest. For example, a client enrolled in DVHT-SO-funded services may receive financial assistance to cover childcare-related costs. Though the child may be the direct recipient of services, the enrolled client benefits from being able to use program funding to cover these costs as they enable them to maintain employment and attend case management meetings. DVHT-SO SERVICE REQUIREMENTS Page 8 of 65 Eligible Beneficiaries of Program Services The DVHT-SO Program was authorized by 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(f) to assist U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) who have previously experienced human trafficking, as defined by the TVPA of 2000, as amended. Therefore, non-LPR foreign nationals and individuals who have not previously experienced human trafficking are ineligible for assistance . Under the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, all Native Americans born in the United States (U.S.) and U.S. Territories are U.S. citizens. This includes American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and/or Pacific Islanders. The prime recipient and, if applicable, its subrecipient(s) must implement universal human trafficking screening during intake for all children and youth receiving services across its programs. Eligibility Assessment Prime recipients must have trauma-informed protocols in place to identify individuals who have experienced human trafficking, determine eligibility to enroll clients into the DVHT-SO Program, and refer ineligible individuals for services, in compliance with statutory and administrative requirements prior to the initiation of DVHT-SO Program-funded services. OTIP recognizes that determining eligibility can be a sensitive subject for many potential clients. Individuals who have experienced human trafficking may not have access to identification or citizenship documents, or they may have fraudulent documents provided by the trafficker. Potential clients may not be comfortable disclosing their human trafficking experience, may not know their current citizenship status, or may not know if they are a beneficiary of other federal funding. Prime recipients must include a plan within its service delivery protocol to ensure that all clients enrolled into the DVHT-SO Program meet the eligibility criteria in 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(f) and that they are not enrolled concurrently in other federally funded programs providing similar services. For more information, see Section I. DVHT-SO Administrative Requirements, Service Delivery Protocol. OTIP encourages creative approaches that work for the applicant's community. Plans can include partnering with legal services agencies or other entities that specialize in eligibility or serving clients with alternate funding until they have built enough rapport to verify a potential client's status. Prime recipients or, if applicable, any subrecipient(s) who determine that the potential client is not a U.S. citizen or LPR who has experienced human trafficking must have protocols in place to provide referrals to programs that can address the individual's needs. Comprehensive Case Management Services Under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients must conduct comprehensive case management services throughout the project period that include helping clients navigate systems of care, direct services, and/or community referrals for the following: 1. Culturally responsive and linguistically appropriate services tailored to domestic clients Page 9 of 65 2. Identification, screening, assessment, safety planning, and service planning 3. Advocacy and information about crime victims' rights and services 4. Direct assistance to support unmet basic needs and the well-being of domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking 5. Allowable and reasonable expenses such as food, clothing, transportation and travel assistance, child care, and interpreter services, including Certified Deaf Interpreters 6. Health care including traditional healing, mental health, behavioral health, substance-use treatment, vaccinations, medical, residential treatment, vision, and dental services 7. Emergency, transitional, and long-term housing assistance 8. Employment assistance, vocational training, and job training and placement services, such as those offered through American Job Centers (AJCs) and other employment and training programs funded by the Department of Labor or other federal agencies. Required and optional AJC partner programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA ) include multiple federal agencies. Required AJC partners include WIOA section 166 Indian and Native American Programs, or the U.S. Department of the Interior's Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act of 2017 Program (for more information visit: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/dinap ) 9. Enrolling clients to identify and receive available public benefits, assisting with the application preparation and submission, tracking the status of an application, assisting with collecting required supporting documentation, and assisting with an appeal if benefits are denied 10. Travel to support beneficiary safety and security, access to services, and family reunification intended to support health and well-being 11. Legal advocacy and services related to an individual's human trafficking experience, including explanation of legal rights and protections, cooperation with law enforcement, and assistance with family and civil matters (e.g., protection orders, victims' rights enforcement and compliance efforts, representation in family court, emancipation of minors, expungement or vacatur of criminal records, and name changes) 12. Educational assistance 13. Life skills training, including managing personal finances 14. Assistance with credit reporting protection documentation in accordance with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's final rule to help survivors avoid some of the financial consequences of human trafficking 15. Peer-to-peer support and mentoring Comprehensive case management services should empower clients to identify and achieve personal milestones toward well-being and independence and may include leadership development opportunities. Case management services and activities should be low-barrier and include service plan development, counseling, monitoring, evaluating client progress, and securing and coordinating direct services, including transportation and travel to secure needed services and assistance. DVHT-SO Program prime recipients must have the capacity to deliver all required services to clients directly through their agency and/or through formal partnership(s), which includes referring clients to the appropriate community agency if no such partnership exists. If a client requires services that are beyond the prime recipient's and, if applicable, its subrecipient's Page 10 of 65 capacity, the client must be provided with referrals to services within the community. Under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients must maintain proper documentation of all referrals provided. Prime recipients serving homeless minors who are at-risk for human trafficking may consider partnering with local Family and Youth Services Bureau-funded programs (including Runaway Homeless Youth recipients, Family Violence Prevention and Services recipients, and Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention recipients) to refer applicable clients to services. DVHT-SO Program prime recipients must strive to refer clients to pro bono providers whenever possible. The prime recipient may use DVHT-SO funds to cover service costs related to the client's needs if a client requires services that are within the scope of the DVHT-SO Program but are beyond the prime recipients' capacity and cannot be covered through pro bono providers as long as they are allowable, reasonable, allocable, and commensurate with allowable program activities as noted in the NOFO and the Code of Federal Regulations. Under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients and, if applicable, any subrecipient(s) must conduct client satisfaction surveys to assess the quality of services being provided and to identify areas of program improvement and/or gaps in services. See Section I. DVHT-SO Administrative Requirements, Service Delivery Protocol for more information. Prime recipients are encouraged to develop client satisfaction surveys and other assessment tools through partnerships with colleges and universities, including but not limited to tribal colleges and universities, historically black colleges and universities, and other minority serving institutions recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Financial Assistance for Transitional Costs Clients that are within 8 months of program discharge may receive one-time financial assistance for transitional costs of up to $2,000 to cover transitional expenses, including the following: Housing (e.g., security deposit, first month's rent, relocation, etc.) Education (e.g., tuition, enrollment fees, textbooks, etc.) Employment (e.g., job training, certification courses, purchasing business attire, etc.) Child care (e.g. daycare costs, before/after-care school costs, etc.) Other costs that the client, in collaboration with the case manager, identify as necessary for the client's successful discharge from services. Prime recipients must develop a policy within their service delivery protocol to assess client readiness to receive financial assistance at least 8 months prior to discharge from services that includes, at a minimum, objective criteria for assessing client readiness to receive financial assistance, timing and mechanism for disbursement, and dispute resolution procedures. The policy must be applicable to all clients served under the DVHT-SO Program, including clients served through subrecipient(s), if applicable. It must demonstrate consideration for client agency, be voluntary, provide equal access and available funding level to all clients. Additionally, the plan must include a process that allows clients who re-enroll in services to accept financial assistance within 8 months following their discharge if they did not receive financial assistance of up to $2,000 during any previous enrollment. The client must be enrolled and receiving case management services while receiving the Page 11 of 65 financial assistance of up to $2,000. Payments must be made directly to the third-party (e.g., security deposit paid directly to a landlord, tuition paid directly to an educational institution, child care payment paid directly to a provider, etc.), and not directly to the client. Future expenses outside the enrollment period may not be dispersed. So, for example, if a client has either tuition or housing costs that are longer than the 8 months period and extends beyond their discharge date, these costs may not be charged to the award. Recipients must track financial assistance spending for each client to ensure total financial assistance does not exceed $2,000 and ensure proper documentation is maintained for auditing purposes. A client's decision to not request post-discharge services must not prevent them from re-enrolling in services under the DVHT-SO Program or pursuing financial assistance at a later date. Recipients must use traceable mechanisms for disbursement to include direct payments to vendor, reimbursed receipts, or invoices to ensure accurate record keeping and auditing. The issuance of alternative payment mechanisms (i.e., gift cards or cash) is not permitted. Prime recipients must thoroughly document individual financial assistance plans and spending, including line-item amounts, cost category, nontraditional cost category, mechanisms for disbursements, connection to related goals, receipts, bank records, client identifiers, and relevant dates. Regardless of the number of times a client re-enrolls, clients may access up to $2,000 in financial assistance only once under any federal grant program funded by OTIP, so the prime recipient is responsible for keeping track of whatever balance is remaining from the $2,000. OTIP will review disbursement records for monitoring purposes throughout the project period. Prime recipients must consider the available budget and projected financial assistance needs for each budget period. Prime recipients should not anticipate the availability of supplemental funding to meet this program requirement. Outreach Under the DVHT-SO Program, targeted outreach to domestic individuals developed by prime recipients throughout the project period must be conducted in the identified, geographic region and in venues, markets, and industries where human trafficking is known, or suspected, to occur. OTIP distinguishes between outreach and public awareness. Outreach is direct contact with domestic individuals who may have experienced human trafficking or who are vulnerable or are at a higher risk for human trafficking. Examples include street outreach, targeted online outreach, and human trafficking screening carried out in court diversion programs, detention centers, community organizations, agricultural settings, hospitality industry, restaurants, domestic work settings, foster care, and elder and child care settings. Though screenings may be conducted during outreach events, it is not required as it may not always be feasible or safe to do so. As part of the outreach strategy under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients and, if applicable, any subrecipient(s), must use standardized screening tool(s) that are validated, evidence-based and trauma-informed to identify and evaluate client needs throughout the service relationship. Prime recipients may elect to use one or multiple tools, but all tools must be designed to identify adult and minor victims of sex trafficking and labor trafficking by assessing common indicators of human trafficking. For reference, the National Human Trafficking Hotline (NHTH) webpage includes a list of common indicators for sex trafficking and labor Page 12 of 65 trafficking. Optional outreach and screening tools that may be used in project activities are available on the OTIP website's Resource Library . The ACF programs identified below can promote, coordinate, and make referrals to service delivery systems and training and other resources. NHTH NHTTAC Administration for Native Americans' (ANA) Website Runaway and Homeless Youth Program Family Violence Prevention Services Program Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program Family Violence Prevention & Services Child Welfare Information Gateway U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development Exchange All outreach materials must be submitted to the Federal Project Officer for approval at least 30 days prior to the intended event, regardless of prior approvals through other programs or past HHS, DOJ, or state officials. For more information on prior approval requirements, see Section I., Post-Award Requirements, Public Facing Materials . DVHT-SO ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS Subawards Recipients under this grant program may opt to transfer a portion of substantive programmatic work to other organizations through subaward(s). The prime recipient must maintain a substantive role in the project. ACF defines a substantive role as conducting activities and/or providing services funded under the award that are necessary and integral to the completion of the project. Subrecipient monitoring activities alone, as specified in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.352 , do not constitute a substantive role. Furthermore, ACF does not fund awards where the role of the applicant is primarily to serve as a conduit for passing funds to other organizations, unless that arrangement is authorized by statute. Subrecipient(s) must meet the eligibility requirements identified in the NOFO, Section III.1. Eligible Applicants . Additionally, all subrecipient(s) must obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number assigned by the System for Award Management (SAM), if they do not already have one. Prime recipients are required to check SAM to verify that the subrecipient(s) is/are not debarred, suspended, or ineligible. Please reference the Award Term and Condition on Subawards on the ACF Administrative and National Policy Requirements website for further requirements involving subawards. Service Delivery Protocol Under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients must develop a service delivery protocol. The protocol must include the prime recipients' policies and procedures for eligibility, comprehensive case management, referral, discharge and post-discharge policies, and provisions specific to Page 13 of 65 domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking. Discharge and post-discharge policies must include, at a minimum, the level of client progress required to be discharged from the program, the frequency and duration of optional post-discharge check-ins, and policies for clients who do not want to remain engaged with the service provider post- discharge. Additionally, the protocol must include financial assistance for transitional cost guidelines that comply with the eligibility and oversight requirements outlined in Section I. DVHT-SO Service Requirements, Financial Assistance for Transitional Costs. The protocol must include the standardized, validated, and evidence- and trauma-informed screening tool(s) DVHT-SO Program staff will use to identify individuals who may have experienced human trafficking during outreach or intake. OTIP understands that providers need time to establish trust with individuals who may have experienced human trafficking to facilitate disclosure. Therefore, prime recipients are not required to use the screening tool immediately after establishing the service relationship. The screening tool(s) must be used within 30 days of a client entering the DVHT-SO Program. Note that though a screening tool does not have to be used until 30 days from date of client entry, prime recipients, and if applicable, subrecipient(s) must separately assess the eligibility of a prospective client prior to enrollment as described in Section I. DVHT-SO Service Requirements, Eligible Beneficiaries of Program Services , and Eligibility Assessment. The protocol must also include a 24-hour response plan for handling client emergencies and emergency calls from law enforcement after hours and on weekends. While acceptable plans cannot be limited to hotline services and call-forwarding systems, the response plan must include coordination with NHTH, which maintains a National Referral Directory (Directory) of organizations and programs that serve individuals who have experienced human trafficking. The Directory includes a comprehensive internal resource for limited use by NHTH to respond to calls and an online, public version that includes anti-trafficking agencies that opt into the public version. Prime recipients must coordinate with NHTH to ensure all providers receiving funding are included in the Directory's internal or public version. Please note that providing a link to a non-federal website in this NOFO does not constitute an endorsement by ACF or any of its employees of the sponsors of the website or the information or products presented on the site. ACF cannot attest to the accuracy of information provided by this link or any other linked sites on the website. The service delivery protocol must include the prime recipients' policies to facilitate safe and secure housing options (e.g., emergency, short-term, transitional, and long-term) for individuals who have experienced human trafficking. The protocol must reflect considerations specific to individuals with a criminal record directly resulting from their trafficking experience, as they face additional barriers to accessing housing. The protocol must include policies and procedures to prevent disclosure of confidential, private, or personally identifiable information concerning clients or their family members without informed, written, and reasonably time-limited consent from the person whose information is sought. The protocols must also include the plan for how the prime recipients and, if applicable, any subrecipient(s) will inform clients of the limits to confidentiality prior to disclosures (e.g., mandated reporting requirements, etc.). Prime recipients must ensure compliance with 45 CFR \u00a7 Page 14 of 65 75.303(e) to take reasonable measures to safeguard a client's protected personally identifiable information. The protocol must include the client satisfaction survey of prime recipients and, if applicable, any subrecipient(s) intend to use to assess the quality, and/or gaps, in the services being provided and to identify areas of program improvement as described in Section I. DVHT-SO Service Requirements, Comprehensive Case Management Services . The protocol must be reflective and inclusive of the DVHT-SO's guiding principles as outlined in Section I. DVHT-SO Service Approach, and National CLAS Standards. The protocol must be submitted at the end of the first budget period for review and approval by the Federal Project Officer. See Section I. Post-Award Requirements, Schedule of Deliverables for more information. Faith-Based Organizations ACF is mindful that potential recipients may have religious objections to providing certain kinds of services. ACF is committed to exploring ways for faith-based organizations to partner with ACF and other recipients even if they object to providing specific services on religious grounds. At the same time, ACF is committed to providing the full range of legally permissible services to people who need them and to do so in a timely fashion and in a manner that respects the diverse religious and cultural backgrounds of those we serve. To accomplish these goals with respect to religious objection and required services, OTIP requires that organizations that have a religious objection to providing any DVHT-SO required services must provide an alternative approach to meet their grant obligations. Refer to Section IV.2. The Project Description, Service Approach for more information. The alternative approach must be one that accomplishes the goal of ensuring that clients served under the DVHT-SO Program understand the full range of services available in the program and how to receive referrals for such services, either directly through the DVHT-SO project or partnering organization(s). If an alternative approach is proposed, the alternative approach will be reviewed based upon a determination of the following: a) will ensure timely provision of all services for which the individual is eligible, b) is not burdensome to the client, and c) is operationally feasible for ACF. Capacity Building for Project Staff and Subrecipients Under the DVHT-SO Program, prime recipients must require training on human trafficking for any personnel, including, if applicable, subrecipient staff who interact with individuals who have experienced human trafficking. With the approval of the Federal Project Officer, grant funds may be used to support training for staff, including, if applicable, subrecipient staff when training is unavailable locally or when there is a cost for training participation (e.g., contracting trainers, registration, travel, continuing education units, etc.). Priority should be given to grant- funded staff who have mandated continuing education requirements related to licensure for their anti-trafficking efforts. DVHT-SO Program funds may be used to cover costs associated with continuing education units for the prime recipients' staff and, if applicable, the subrecipient(s). Page 15 of 65 All personnel and, if applicable, subrecipient staff who interact with individuals who have experienced human trafficking must complete at least 10 hours of training in connection with human trafficking each budget period. OTIP reserves the right to verify compliance throughout the project period. Prime recipients must track training hours and topics for their staff and, if applicable, subrecipient staff. Training topics should include the following: Federal definition of severe forms of trafficking in persons Information about human trafficking including types of human trafficking (both sex and labor trafficking) and recruitment and/or retention tactics used by traffickers Indicators that a person may be experiencing human trafficking Safety protocols for those in direct contact with individuals potentially experiencing human trafficking Services and benefits available for domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking Specific considerations for domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking which may include relevant cultural and/or spiritual needs, historical trauma, and cultural violence through the loss of access to lands, territories, natural resources, traditional practices, language, etc., and exclusion from the decision-making and policy frameworks in the nation-states in which they live Intersectionality between race and human trafficking (e.g., the role racial identity and racism play in the risk for human trafficking; process of identification; experience of service delivery; interaction with enforcement systems; including the criminal justice system; access to resources; health disparities/inequities experienced by underserved communities; etc.) Intersection between political status and human trafficking (e.g., the role that criminal jurisdiction and limited enforcement of tribal governments over non-tribal citizens plays in the increased risk for human trafficking, interaction with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, etc.) Intersectionality between sexual orientation, gender identity, and human trafficking (e.g., the role gender identity and expression and exclusion plays in the risk for human trafficking, process of identification, experience of service delivery, interaction with criminal justice, access to resources, health disparities/inequities experienced by 2SLGBTQIA+ community members, etc.) Intersectionality between disability and human trafficking (e.g., the role disability status and exclusion play in the risk for human trafficking, process of identification, experience of service delivery, interaction with the criminal justice system, access to resources, etc.) Intersectionality between human trafficking and forced criminality (e.g., understanding that when an individual is forced to provide labor or service that contributes to an illegal or illicit activity or business operation, they may also be considered a victim of human trafficking) Prime recipients may also receive ongoing, tailored training and technical assistance (T/TA) through NHTTAC with the goal of promoting capacity building through their period of performance. This technical assistance is available across a variety of formats, including coaching/mentoring, conference calls, webinars, and training. Topics will be determined in consultation with prime recipients and may include, but are not limited to, effective strategies around survivor engagement; housing; diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; direct Page 16 of 65 outreach by population; subrecipient monitoring and evaluation; sustainability and succession planning; and collaboration. POST-AWARD REQUIREMENTS Schedule of Deliverables To accomplish program goals in a timely manner, OTIP has established the following post-award requirements. Tasks and timelines will be dependent upon the capacity of the prime recipients to carry out the deliverables post-award. OTIP is allotting a 12-month implementation period for the DVHT-SO prime recipient to facilitate partnerships and onboard new staff. The prime recipient must adhere to the following schedule: 1. Within 5 calendar days from the Notice of Award (NoA), the prime recipients must return the signed cooperative agreement. 2. Within 30 calendar days from the NoA, the prime recipients must have the capacity to provide comprehensive case management services to identify domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking. 3. Within 1 year from the date of NoA, the prime recipient must submit a service delivery protocol specific to domestic individuals. 4. Within 1 year from the date of NoA, the prime recipient is required to develop a disparity impact statement using local data and input to identify populations at highest risk for health, social, economic, or other disparities such as low health literacy. The disparity impact statement will identify social, policy, historical, and other context associated with root causes and drivers of disparities. It will also provide the framework and plan for ongoing action and accountability, such as program improvement, incorporation of National CLAS Standards, monitoring and assessment of the impact of the project on the program's equity goals. HHS resources for the disparity impact statement: Omh.gov: Guidance for Preparing a Disparity Impact Statement Cms.gov: Quality Improvement & Interventions: Disparity Impact Statement Samhsa.gov: Disparity Impact Statement If, during the project period, OTIP and/or recipients are required to adjust program and/or recipient requirements due to a nationally declared emergency, OTIP will exercise maximum flexibility as needed. Requirements may be conducted virtually, or timelines modified in consultation with OTIP. Tools and Resources OTIP has developed tools and resources on human trafficking in the U.S., including NHTTAC- developed resources and Look Beneath the Surface (LBS) campaign materials such as brochures and posters, that may be used in outreach activities. All materials are available for download on the OTIP website's Resource Library . Certain LBS materials, including posters and brochures, may be modified to include an agency's contact information by using commercial off-the-shelf software that includes digital image Page 17 of 65 editing capability. DVHT-SO funds can be used to cover software, and printing and shipping costs of LBS materials if intended to be used as part of DVHT-SO activities. Public Facing Materials The Stevens Amendment requires all HHS grant and cooperative agreement recipients to acknowledge federal funding when publicly communicating projects or programs (including outreach materials) funded through the HHS annual appropriation. For more information on requirements, reference the Administrative and National Policy Requirements on the ACF website. Prime recipients and, if applicable, its subrecipients must comply with the Stevens Amendment. Prime recipients and, if applicable, its subrecipients must submit all public-facing materials used during project activities that are to be counted towards its project objectives for review and approval by the Federal Project Officer. Prime recipients must also submit for review and approval all public-facing materials if program funds will be used to facilitate any portion of the activity (e.g., editing presentation slide decks or staff time spent updating previously developed resources), even if the materials were not created using DVHT-SO Program funds or have been reviewed previously by OTIP or other state or federal grantors. The Federal Project Officer will review for trauma-informed and person-centered content, adherence to the Stevens Amendment, and alignment with general guidelines set by the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons , at a minimum. For more information, see Section I. DVHT-SO Service Requirements, Outreach. Program Performance Indicators OTIP collects information from prime recipients in its Anti-Trafficking Information Management System to measure grant program progress and performance, improve program evaluation, inform policy, assess program outcomes, and build a response to human trafficking that is responsive to the needs of individuals with lived experience. Under the DVHT-SO Program, OTIP will collect information from prime recipients on a quarterly basis. Data collected has been cleared under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and will include nonidentifiable client demographic information, information on the client's trafficking experience, information related to the client's enrollment status, types of services and benefits provided to the client, the kind of outreach conducted, and number of domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking identified through outreach efforts. For more information on OTIP's required reporting requirements and data elements, see Section VI.3. Reporting . During the project period, the Federal Project Officer and the Office of Grants Management's Grant Management Specialist will verify that the information submitted in the prime recipient's reports is accurate and determine compliance with federal guidelines through desk and on-site monitoring. OTIP will notify prime recipients at least 30 days in advance of any scheduled on- site monitoring visit. NOTE: Consistent with the PRA of 1995, 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501-3521, under this NOFO, OTIP will Page 18 of 65 not conduct or sponsor - and a person is not required to respond to - a collection of information covered by such Act unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Federal Evaluation OTIP may fund a formal evaluation of the DVHT-SO Program to evaluate the recipient's implementation strategies, potentially including: Geographic, historical, and cultural factors that impact the planning and development of each project Project's goals and how those goals were selected The characteristics of the project participants How projects develop and maintain partnerships Approaches used to reach and serve/assist victims and survivors The prime recipient must participate in the mandatory evaluation as a condition of receiving the DVHT-SO Program award. If applicable, prime recipients must agree to participate in the mandatory formal evaluation, sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU), and make available program implementation records for grant-funded activities. This includes records of activities conducted by subrecipient(s), if applicable, and program performance data. The study would engage an outside, non-recipient evaluation team and would likely focus on the processes, implementation, progress indicators, and quality improvement of funded activities. The recipient will have an opportunity to meet with the federal evaluation contractor to learn about the project, provide feedback, and sign an MOU prior to the start of the evaluation. Under no circumstances should personally identifiable information, including demographic information, from case management records be disclosed without the client's express, time-limited, permission. Prime recipients must monitor their own performance and, if applicable, that of any subrecipient(s). Prime recipients must dedicate appropriate staff support to evaluation activities, including data collection, data reporting, and coordination with the evaluator. If OTIP does fund a federal evaluation, OTIP will seek approval for information collection related to the federal evaluation through the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, as necessary. OTIP will not request information for the federal evaluation that is subject to PRA until the information collection is approved. NOTE: Consistent with the PRA of 1995, 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501-3521, under this NOFO, OTIP will not conduct or sponsor - and a person is not required to respond to - a collection of information covered by such Act unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Kick-Off and Peer Meetings OTIP will host a grant kick-off meeting either virtually or in Washington, DC, within the first 6 months of the official award date. OTIP will host at least one annual meeting for OTIP prime recipients either virtually or in-person to meet with their Federal Project Officer and OTIP staff, receive technical assistance, share local human trafficking trends, and discuss emerging topics, etc. Both the Project Director and the key staff person responsible for tracking and documenting progress toward project milestones and outcomes must attend the kick-off meeting. The Page 19 of 65 participation of at least one staff member in all subsequent OTIP meetings and NHTTAC- sponsored events will be mandatory throughout the project period. DEFINITIONS AND TERMS For the purposes of this NOFO, these terms will be defined as follows: Comprehensive case management is a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy to ensure that options and services meet an individual's needs and that available resources promote an individual's well-being. Domestic refers to a U.S. citizen or Legal Permanent Resident (LPR). Equity refers to the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals and includes individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. This population includes Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; 2SLGBTQ+ persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Foreign National refers to an individual who is not a U.S citizen or LPR. A Governing Body consists of duly elected or designated representatives, is appointed by duly elected officials, or is selected in accordance with traditional tribal means. The body must have authority to enter into contracts, agreements, and grants on behalf of the organization or individuals who elected, designated, appointed, or selected them. May also be known as the Board of Directors. Historical trauma is the cumulative, multigenerational, and collective experience of emotional and psychological injury in Native American communities and in their descendants. The Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Crisis refers to the national movement to increase awareness of the deaths and disappearances of hundreds of Native American people, including women and girls. According to a 2017 DOJ-led tribal consultation on Human Trafficking (Including Sex Trafficking) of American Indians and Alaska Natives, tribal leaders identified a connection between missing and murdered Native American women and trafficking. The Biden Administration affirmed its commitment to addressing the underlying causes behind the disproportionately high number of missing or murdered Indigenous people, including those who have suffered sexual violence, human trafficking, domestic violence, violent crime, systemic racism, economic disparities, and substance use and addiction. National CLAS Standards provide effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs. Native American means American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaskan Native as defined in 45 CFR \u00a7 1336.10, and Native American Pacific Islanders as defined in section 815 of the Native American Programs Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2992c). Outreach is an organized activity targeting individuals and populations vulnerable to human trafficking (as opposed to professionals or the general public) that provides information about the dangers of human trafficking, risk factors, recruitment strategies, Page 20 of 65 and the protections available with the explicit intent of identifying individuals who have experienced human trafficking. Partner is an individual or an organization that enters a relationship with the prime recipient for the purposes of referral, joint service programming, and information sharing. Partnership(s) established by the prime recipient where there is an exchange of DVHT-SO funds involved for project activities are considered subrecipient(s). Refer to Section I. DVHT-SO Administrative Requirements, Subawards for more information. Performance indicators are measurable values used to evaluate how successful a person or organization is at reaching a target. A person-centered approach promotes safety and well-being while minimizing potential re-traumatization associated with criminal justice and other interventions. This can include providing support through victim advocates and service providers, empowering clients as engaged participants, and providing clients with an opportunity to play a role in seeing their traffickers brought to justice. A person-centered approach is critical for supporting a victim's rights, dignity, autonomy, and self-determination while simultaneously advancing the government's and society's interest in prosecuting traffickers and protecting and assisting clients. Public awareness is information provided to the general public to increase knowledge or understanding of human trafficking. Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are complex, integrated, and overlapping social structures, policies, and economic systems that affect health and quality of life outcomes. SDOH are the conditions in which people live, work, play, and access care. SDOH can also be a major cause of health inequities, particularly when populations do not have access to the same resources. Just promoting healthy choices won't eliminate these and other health disparities. SDOH can be grouped into the following 5 domains: o Economic stability o Education access and quality o Health care access and quality o Neighborhood and built environment o Social and community context Examples of SDOH include, but are not limited to, the following: Safe housing, housing insecurity, transportation access, and neighborhoods Racism, sexism, homophobia, discrimination, ableism, xenophobia/nationalism, and violence Education disparities, job opportunities, unemployment, and income inequality Access to health systems, services, nutritious foods, and physical activity opportunities Polluted air and water Language and literacy skills Social isolation Survivor engagement incorporates lived experiences and expertise into the development and execution of anti-trafficking responses. Meaningful engagement with survivors allows organizations to better serve clients, create and improve programs, identify challenges and opportunities, and achieve agency missions and mandates. As primary participants in the anti-trafficking field, leaders with lived experience offer invaluable Page 21 of 65 insight and expertise, which can validate other survivor's experiences and reactions to traumatic events resulting from a trafficking experience. Traditional healing is identified by the National Institutes of Health, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health as a whole-medical system that encompasses a range of holistic treatments used by Native American and/or Pacific Indigenous healers to address a multitude of acute and chronic conditions or to promote health and well- being. While there are individual tribal differences (e.g., the use of specific healing practices), there are also shared health beliefs and interventional strategies, including a health promotion foundation that embraces bio-psycho-social-spiritual approaches and traditions. Training is the planning, development, delivery, and evaluation of activities designed to achieve specific learning objectives for participants. The learning objectives may be achieved using a variety of instructional strategies such as lecture, group discussion, demonstration role-play, and other methods of group and individual integration. Training may include on-site instruction, classroom training, webinars, online or virtual training, self-directed learning, and workshops. A trauma-informed approach includes an understanding of the physical, social, and emotional impact of trauma on individuals and the professionals who help them. A trauma-informed approach includes person-centered practices. A program, organization, or system that is trauma-informed acknowledges the widespread impacts that traumatic events have on survivors; recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in staff, survivors, and others involved in the anti-trafficking response system; identifies paths for support and healing; and responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, practices, and settings. Like a person-centered approach, a trauma- informed approach prioritizes the client's safety and security and includes safeguarding against policies and practices that may inadvertently re-traumatize clients. Underserved communities include groups that have been historically denied consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment and access to resources required to normalize their condition, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; 2SLGBTQIA+ persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty, lack of access to resources, or inequality. Underserved communities often do not have fair access to safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods; education, job opportunities, and income; and/or other positive Social Determinants of Health that contribute to overall quality of life. A Whole-Family Approach is built on the premise that conditions that affect the family will impact child development, as will the client's direct experiences. Giving children a strong start in life and creating stability for the family requires a focus on the whole family and, in particular, on the well-being of children and on parents as agents of change.

This disqualification applies only to the Award Ceiling listed for the first 12-month budget period for projects with multiple budget periods. If the project and budget period are the same, the disqualification applies to the Award Ceiling listed for the project period. Please see Section III.3. Other, Application Disqualification Factors. Note: For those programs that require matching or cost sharing, recipients will be held accountable for projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by budget period or by project period for fully funded awards, even if the projected commitment exceeds the required amount of match or cost share. A recipient's failure to provide the required matching amount may result in the disallowance of federal funds. For more information on these requirements, see Section III.2. Cost Sharing or Matching. Description of ACF's Anticipated Substantial Involvement Under the Cooperative Agreement Award OTIP is using a cooperative agreement that requires substantial federal involvement on the part of OTIP with the prime recipients. Federal involvement may include the following: Page 23 of 65 Communicating at least quarterly via phone with the Federal Project Officer to discuss project implementation activities and overall program progress. Participating in desk and on-site monitoring of project activities. Participating in NHTTAC-sponsored webinars to discuss human trafficking trends and emerging topics and to receive technical assistance. Obtaining approval from the Federal Project Officer for all non-ACF materials used or created for DVHT-SO Program-related outreach (e.g., discreet pocket cards, hygiene kits, etc.) in adherence with the requirements outlined in Section I. Post-Award Requirements, Public Facing Materials . III. Eligibility Information III.1. Eligible Applicants Eligible entities according to 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(f)(3)(A) are states, Indian tribes, units of local government, and nonprofit, non-governmental victim service organizations. OTIP defines victim service organizations as those that, by nature of their current operations, serve victims of sexual assault, sexual violence, domestic violence, human trafficking, and youth homelessness. Victim service organizations may also include faith-based organizations, non-profit federally qualified health centers, and other non-profit health care facilities that serve or plan to serve victims of human trafficking. Please refer to Section IV.2. The Project Description, Additional Eligibility Documentation for more information on required documentation from victim service organizations. Lack of required documentation from victim service organizations will disqualify the application from review and from award. See Section III.3. Other, OTIP Disqualification Factor . Please note that ACF does not fund concurrent projects, so if an applicant is successful under this NOFO, any successful applications in response to other OTIP NOFOs from the same applicant for the same service delivery area and activities will not be funded. Applications from individuals (including sole proprietorships) and foreign entities are not eligible and will be disqualified from competitive review and funding under this funding opportunity. See Section III.3. Other, Application Disqualification Factors. Faith-based and community organizations that meet the eligibility requirements are eligible to receive awards under this funding opportunity. Faith-based organizations may apply for this award on the same basis as any other organization, as set forth at and, subject to the protections and requirements of 45 CFR Part 87 and 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq., ACF will not, in the selection of recipients, discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, affiliation, or exercise. Reference to Legal Status See Section IV.2. Legal Status of Applicant Entity for documentation required to support eligibility. Funding Restrictions Reference Please see Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions for any limitations on the use of federal funds that could affect the eligibility of an applicant or project. Page 24 of 65 III.2. Cost Sharing or Matching Cost Sharing / Matching Requirement: Yes Recipients are required to meet a non-federal share of the project cost, in accordance with 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(f)(3)(B) Recipients must provide at least 25 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF (federal) share and the non-federal share. The non-federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions, although recipients are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. For example, in order to meet the match requirements, a project requesting $300,000 in ACF (federal) funds must provide a non-federal share of the approved total project cost of at least $ 100,000 , which is 25 percent of total approved project cost of $ 400,000 . For all federal awards , any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all criteria listed in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.306. For awards that require matching by statute , recipients will be held accountable for projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards, even if the projected commitment exceeds the amount required by the statutory match. A recipient's failure to provide the statutorily required matching amount may result in the disallowance of federal funds. Recipients will be required to report these funds in the Federal Financial Reports. For awards that do not require matching or cost sharing by statute , where \"cost sharing\" refers to any situation in which the recipient voluntarily shares in the costs of a project other than as statutorily required matching, recipients will be held accountable for projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards. These include situations in which contributions are voluntarily proposed by a recipient or subrecipient and are accepted by ACF. Non-federal cost sharing will be included in the approved project budget so that the recipient will be held accountable for proposed non-federal cost sharing funds as shown in the Notice of Award (NoA). A recipient's failure to provide voluntary cost sharing of non-federal resources that have been accepted by ACF as part of the approved project costs and that have been shown as part of the approved project budget in the NoA, may result in the disallowance of federal funds. Recipients will be required to report these funds in the Federal Financial Reports. III.3. Other Application Disqualification Factors Applications from individuals (including sole proprietorships) and foreign entities are not eligible and will be disqualified from competitive review and funding under this funding opportunity. Award Ceiling Disqualification Page 25 of 65 Applications that request an award amount that exceeds the Award Ceiling per budget period or per project period (\"per project period\" refers only to fully funded awards), as stated in Section II. Federal Award Information, will be disqualified from competitive review and funding under this funding opportunity. This disqualification applies only to the Award Ceiling listed for the first 12-month budget period for projects with multiple budget periods. If the project and budget period are the same, the disqualification applies to the Award Ceiling listed for the project period.

The letter will be sent after awards have been issued and will specify the reason(s) for removal of page(s). Corrections/Updates to Submitted Applications When applicants make revisions to a previously submitted application, ACF will accept only the last on-time application for pre-review under the Application Disqualification Factors. The Application Disqualification Factors determine the application's acceptance for competitive review. See Section III.3. Other, Application Disqualification Factors and Section IV.2. Application Submission Options . Copies Required Applicants must submit one complete copy of the application package electronically. Applicants submitting electronic applications need not provide additional copies of their application package. Applicants submitting applications in paper format must submit one original and two copies of the complete application, including all SFs and OMB-approved forms. The original copy must have original signatures. Signatures Applicants submitting electronic applications must follow the registration and application Page 29 of 65 submission instructions provided at Grants.gov. The original of a paper format application must include original signatures of the authorized representatives. Accepted Application Format With the exception of the required SFs and OMB-approved forms, all application materials must be formatted so that they are 8 \u00bd\" x 11\" white paper with 1-inch margins all around. If possible, applicants are encouraged to include page numbers for each page within the application. ACF generally does not encourage submission of scanned documents as they tend to have reduced clarity and readability. If documents must be scanned, the font size on any scanned documents must be large enough so that it is readable. Documents must be scanned page-for- page, meaning that applicants may not scan more than one page of a document onto a single page. Pages with blurred text will be removed from the application. PAGE LIMITATIONS AND CONTENT FOR ALL SUBMISSION FORMATS: Project Description With the exceptions of the Standard Forms and OMB-approved forms, the application submission in its entirety (Project Description and Appendices) is limited to 120 pages. The Project Description must include the following: Table of Contents Geographic Location Need for Assistance Objectives Expected Outcomes Approach Project Timeline and Milestones Organizational Capacity Plan for Oversight of Federal Award Funds Program Performance Evaluation Plan Protection of Sensitive and/or Confidential Information Line-Item Budget and Budget Justification Appendices The appendices must include the following: Required documentation from victim service organizations, as referenced in Section III.3. Other, OTIP Disqualification Factor , if applicable Proof of Legal Status (i.e., proof of non-profit status, governing body documentation, prime recipient's Articles of Incorporation, Board Bylaws, etc.) Page 30 of 65 Organizational Capacity (i.e., organizational charts, documentation of experience in the program area, personnel policies, and any other pertinent information the applicant deems relevant) Resumes and/or Project Descriptions for Key Staff and, if applicable, Subrecipient(s) Third-Party Agreements, if applicable ELECTRONIC APPLICATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS Applicants are required to submit their applications electronically unless they have received an exemption that will allow submission in paper format. See Section IV.2. Application Submission Options for information about requesting an exemption . Electronic applications will only be accepted via Grants.gov. ACF will not accept applications submitted via email or via facsimile. Each applicant is required to upload ONLY two electronic files, excluding SFs and OMB- approved forms. File One: Must contain the entire Project Description, and the Budget and Budget Justification (including a line-item budget and a budget narrative). File Two: Must contain all documents required in the Appendices. Adherence to the Two-File Requirement No more than two files will be accepted for the review. Applications with additional files will be amended and files will be removed from the review. SFs and OMB-approved forms will not be considered additional files. Application Upload Requirements ACF strongly recommends that electronic applications be uploaded as Portable Document Files (PDFs). One file must contain the entire Project Description and Budget Justification; the other file must contain all documents required in the Appendices. Details on the content of each of the two files, as well as page limitations, are listed earlier in this section. To adhere to the two-file requirement, applicants may need to convert and/or merge documents together using a PDF converter software. Many recent versions of Microsoft Office include the ability to save documents to the PDF format without need of additional software. Applicants using the Adobe Acrobat Reader software will be able to merge these documents together. ACF recommends merging documents electronically rather than scanning multiple documents into one document manually, as scanned documents may have reduced clarity and readability. Applicants must ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat Reader they are using is compatible with Grants.gov. To verify Adobe software compatibility please go to Grants.gov and click on \"Applicants\" at the top bar menu and select \"Adobe Software Compatibility\", which is listed under \"Applicant Resources.\" The Adobe verification process allows applicants to test their version of the software by opening a test Workspace PDF form. Grants.gov also includes Page 31 of 65 guidance on how to download a supported version of Adobe, as well as troubleshooting instructions for use, if an applicant is unable to open the test form. The Adobe Software Compatibility page located on Grants.gov also provides guidance for applicants on filling out a Workspace PDF form. In addition, it addresses local network and/or computer security settings and the impact this has on use of Adobe software. Required SFs and OMB-approved Forms SFs and OMB-approved forms are uploaded separately at Grants.gov. These forms are submitted separately from the Project Description and Appendices files. See Section IV.2. Required Forms, Assurances, and Certifications for the listing of required SFs, OMB-approved forms, and required assurances and certifications. Naming Application Submission Files Carefully observe the file naming conventions required by Grants.gov. Limit file names to 50 characters (characters and spaces). Please also see https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/submitting-utf-8-special-characters.html . Use only file formats supported by ACF Applicants must submit applications using only the supported file formats listed here. While ACF supports all of the following file formats, we strongly recommend that the two application submission files (Project Description and Appendices) are uploaded as PDFs in order to comply with the two-file upload limitation. Documents in file formats that are not supported by ACF will be removed from the application and will not be used in the competitive review. This may make the application incomplete, and ACF will not make any awards based on an incomplete application. ACF supports the following file formats: Adobe PDF - Portable Document Format (.pdf) Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt) Image Formats (.JPG, .GIF, .TIFF, or .BMP only) Do Not Encrypt or Password-Protect the Electronic Application Files If ACF cannot access submitted electronic files because they are encrypted or password protected, the affected file will be removed from the application and will not be reviewed. This removal may make the application incomplete, and ACF will not make awards based on an incomplete application.

For the Executive Level II salary, please see \"Executive & Senior Level Employee Pay Tables\" under https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/ . The salary limitation reflects an individual's base salary exclusive of fringe benefits, indirect costs and any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of the duties of the applicant organization. This salary limitation also applies to subawards and subcontracts under an ACF grant or cooperative agreement. Provide a budget for the initial budget period only (typically the first 12 months of the project) using the SF-424A and/or SF-424C, as applicable. Provide a budget justification, which includes a budget narrative and a line-item detail, for only the first budget period of the proposed project. The budget narrative should describe how the categorical costs are derived. Discuss the necessity, reasonableness, and allocation of the proposed costs.

Applicants must explain why the participation of the subrecipient is necessary, and why the applicant cannot achieve the objectives without the subrecipient(s)' participation. Applicants must describe how DVHT-SO Program funds will complement and not duplicate existing anti-trafficking efforts and services in the proposed geographic area. If the applicant is receiving other federal funds to implement a human trafficking program, the applicant will include the name of the awarding federal agency, the name of the grant, the project period, the amount they currently receive, and how they will ensure any funds awarded through the DVHT- SO Program will not be used to supplant or augment any other related federal funding.

If the applicant is requesting a rate that is less than what is allowed under the program, the authorized representative of the applicant organization must submit a signed acknowledgement that the applicant is accepting a lower rate than allowed. Choosing to charge a lower rate will not be considered during the objective review or award selection process. 2. Per 45 CFR \u00a7 75.414(f) Indirect (F&A) costs, \"any non-Federal entity [i.e., applicant] that has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, ... may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) which may be used indefinitely. As described in Section 75.403, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as the non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time.\" Justification: This method only applies to applicants that have never received an approved negotiated indirect cost rate from HHS or another cognizant federal agency. Applicants awaiting approval of their indirect cost proposal may request the 10 percent de minimis rate. When the applicant chooses this method, costs included in the indirect cost pool must not be charged as direct costs to the grant. Commitment of Non-Federal Resources Description: Amounts of non-federal resources that will be used to support the project as identified in Block 18 of the SF-424. This line should be used to indicate required and/or voluntary committed cost sharing or matching, if applicable. Page 45 of 65 For all federal awards , any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the criteria listed in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.306. For awards that require matching or cost sharing by statute , recipients will be held accountable for projected commitments of non-federal resources (at or above the statutory requirement) in their application budgets and budget justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards. A recipient's failure to provide the statutorily required matching or cost sharing amount (and any voluntary committed amount in excess) may result in the disallowance of federal funds. Recipients will be required to report these funds in the Federal Financial Reports. For awards that do not require matching or cost sharing by statute , recipients are not expected to provide cost sharing or matching. However, recipients are allowed to voluntarily propose a commitment of non-federal resources. If an applicant decides to voluntarily contribute non-federal resources towards project costs and the costs are accepted by ACF, the non-federal resources will be included in the approved project budget. The applicant will be held accountable for all proposed non-federal resources as shown in the Notice of Award (NoA). A recipient's failure to meet the voluntary amount of non-federal resources that was accepted by ACF as part of the approved project costs and that was identified in the approved budget in the NoA, may result in the disallowance of federal funds. Recipients will be required to report these funds in the Federal Financial Reports. Justification: If an applicant is relying on cost share or match from a third-party, then a firm commitment of these resources (letter(s) or other documentation) is required to be submitted with the application. Detailed budget information must be provided for every funding source identified in Item 18. \"Estimated Funding ($)\" on the SF-424. Applicants are required to fully identify and document in their applications the specific costs or contributions they propose in order to meet a matching requirement. Applicants are also required to provide documentation in their applications on the sources of funding or contribution(s). In-kind contributions must be accompanied by a justification of how the stated valuation was determined. Matching or cost sharing must be documented by budget period (or by project period for fully funded awards). Applications that lack the required supporting documentation will not be disqualified from competitive review; however, it may impact an application's scoring under the evaluation criteria in Section V.1. Criteria of this funding opportunity. Paperwork Reduction Act Disclaimer As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521, the public reporting burden for the Project Description is estimated to average 60 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and reviewing the collection of information. The Project Description information collection is approved under OMB control number 0970-0139, which expires 03/31/2025. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Application Submission Options Page 46 of 65 Electronic Submission via Grants.gov This section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for ACF program applications. Please read the following instructions carefully and completely. Electronic Delivery ACF is participating in the Grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site to find and apply for funding opportunities. ACF applicants are required to submit their applications online through Grants.gov. How to Register and Apply through Grants.gov Read the following instructions about registering to apply for ACF funds. Applicants should read the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information. Organizations must have an active System for Award (SAM) registration which provides a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), and Grants.gov account to apply for grants. Creating a Grants.gov account can be completed online in minutes, but SAM registration may take several weeks. Therefore, an organization's registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact the entities ability to meet required application submission deadlines. Organization applicants can find complete instructions here: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration.html Register with SAM : All organizations (entities) applying online through Grants.gov must register with SAM. Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying through Grants.gov. SAM registration must be renewed annually. For detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration.html Create a Grants.gov Account : The next step in the registration process is to create an account with Grants.gov. Follow the on-screen instructions provided on the registration page. Add a Profile to a Grants.gov Account : A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant). If you work for or consult with multiple organizations, you can have a profile for each organization under one Grants.gov account. In such cases, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access all your grant profiles. To add an organizational profile to your Grants.gov account, enter the UEI for the organization in the UEI field. For detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/add- profile.html EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles: After you register with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, the applicant's request for Grants.gov roles and access is sent to the EBiz POC. The EBiz POC is then expected to log in to Grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the AOR role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit Page 47 of 65 your application online any time after you have been assigned the AOR role. For detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize-roles.html Track Role Status : To track your role request, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track-role-status.html When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization's AOR that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize individuals who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role; this step is often missed and is crucial for valid and timely submissions. How to Submit an Application to ACF via Grants.gov Grants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each NOFO, you can create individual instances of a workspace. For an overview of applying on Grants.gov using Workspaces, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/workspace-overview.html Create a Workspace : Creating a workspace allows you to complete an application online and route it through your organization for review before submitting. Complete a Workspace : Add participants to the workspace to work on the application together, complete all the required forms online or by downloading PDF versions, and check for errors before submission. The Workspace progress bar will display the state of your application process as you apply. As you apply using Workspace, you may click the blue question mark icon near the upper-right corner of each page to access context-sensitive help. Adobe Reader : If you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download individual PDF forms in Workspace. The individual PDF forms can be downloaded and saved to your local device storage, network drive(s), or external drive(s), then accessed through Adobe Reader. NOTE : Visit the Adobe Software Compatibility page on Grants.gov to download the appropriate version of the software at: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe-software-compatibility.html Mandatory Fields in Forms : In the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk and a different background color. These fields are mandatory fields that must be completed to successfully submit your application. Complete SF-424 Fields First : These forms are designed to fill in common required fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and SAM UEI. Once it is completed, the information will transfer to the other forms. Submit a Workspace : An application may be submitted through Workspace by clicking the Sign and Submit button on the Manage Workspace page, under the Forms tab. Grants.gov recommends submitting your application at least 24-48 hours prior to the close date to Page 48 of 65 provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the application submission. Track a Workspace : After successfully submitting a Workspace application, a Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automatically assigned to the application. The number will be listed on the Confirmation page that is generated after submission. Using the tracking number, access the Track My Application page under the Applicants tab or the Details tab in the submitted workspace. For additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/applicant-training.html Grants.gov provides applicants 24/7 support 1-800-518-4726 and email at support@grants.gov . For questions related to the specific funding opportunity, contact the number listed in the application package of the grant you are applying for. If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Center ticket number will assist ACF with tracking and understanding background information on the issue. Timely Receipt Requirements and Proof of Timely Submission All applications must be received by 11:59 pm ET on the due date established for each program. Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The applicant AOR will receive an acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application. Applicant AORs will also receive the official date/stamp and Grants.gov Tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission. When ACF successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov, and acknowledges the download of submission, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the applicant with the AOR role. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receives your application. Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be considered late and will not be considered for funding by ACF. Applicants with slow internet connections should be aware that transmission can take some time before Grants.gov receives your application. Therefore, applicants should allow enough time to prepare and submit the application before the package closing date. Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received submission message in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role. Issues with Federal Systems For any systems issues experienced with Grants.gov or SAM.gov, please refer to ACF's \"Policy for Applicants Experiencing Federal Systems Issues \" document for complete guidance.

Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and System for Award Management (SAM) All applicants must have a UEI and an active registration with SAM (https://www.sam.gov ) prior to applying to a funding opportunity. All applicants are required to maintain an active SAM registration until the application process is complete. If a grant is awarded, the SAM registration must be active throughout the life of the award. Your SAM registration must be renewed every 365 days to keep it active. Plan ahead. Allow at least 10 business days after you submit your registration for it to become active in SAM and at least an additional 24 hours before that registration information is available in other government systems, i.e., Grants.gov. This action should allow you time to resolve any issues that may arise. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in your inability to submit your application through Grants.gov or prevent the award of a grant. Applicants should maintain documentation (with dates) of their efforts to request a UEI, register for, or renew a registration, at SAM. Please see the \"Help\" tab at https://sam.gov/content/help for more information and assistance with this process. HHS requires all entities that plan to apply for, and ultimately receive, federal grant funds from any HHS Agency to: Be registered in SAM prior to submitting an application or plan; Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active award or an application or plan under consideration by an OPDIV; Provide its UEI in each application or plan it submits to the OPDIV; and Page 50 of 65 Ensure any proposed subrecipient(s) have obtained and provided to the recipient their UEI(s) prior to making any subawards (Note: Subrecipients are not required to complete full SAM registration.). ACF is prohibited from making an award until an applicant has complied with these requirements. At the time an award is ready to be made, if the intended recipient has not complied with these requirements, ACF: May determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive an award; and May use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.

Initial ACF Screening Each application will be screened to determine whether it meets any of the disqualification factors described in Section III.3. Other, Application Disqualification Factors . Disqualified applications are considered to be \"non-responsive\" and are excluded from the competitive review process. Applicants will be notified of a disqualification determination by email or by USPS postal mail within 30 federal business days from the closing date of this NOFO. Objective Review and Results Applications competing for financial assistance will be reviewed and evaluated by objective review panels using only the criteria described in Section V.1. Criteria of this funding opportunity. Each panel is composed of experts with knowledge and experience in the area under review. Generally, review panels include three reviewers and one chairperson. Results of the competitive objective review are taken into consideration by ACF in the selection of projects for funding; however, objective review scores and rankings are not binding. Scores and rankings are only one element used in the award decision-making process. If identified in Section I. Program Description , ACF reserves the right to consider preferences to fund organizations serving emerging, unserved, or under-served populations, including those populations located in pockets of poverty. In addition, ACF reserves the right to evaluate applications in the larger context of the overall portfolio by considering geographic distribution of federal funds (e.g., ensuring coverage of states, counties, or service areas) in its pre-award decisions. ACF may elect not to fund applicants with management or financial problems that would indicate an inability to successfully complete the proposed project. In addition, ACF may elect to not allow a prime recipient to subaward if there is any indication that they are unable to properly monitor and manage subrecipients. Applications may be funded in whole or in part. Successful applicants may be funded at an amount lower than that requested.

The NoA will be signed by the Grants Officer and transmitted via email or by GrantSolutions, or the Head Start Enterprise System (HSES), whichever is relevant. Following the finalization of funding decisions, organizations whose applications will not be funded will be notified by letter signed by the cognizant Program Office head. Any other correspondence that announces to a Principal Investigator, or a Project Director, that an application was selected is not an authorization to begin performance.

Project costs that are incurred prior to the receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. Recipients may translate the Federal award and other documents into another language. In the event of inconsistency between any terms and conditions of the Federal award and any translation into another language, the English language meaning will control. Where a significant portion of the recipient's employees who are working on the Federal award are not fluent in English, the recipient must provide the Federal award in English and in the language(s) with which employees are more familiar.
