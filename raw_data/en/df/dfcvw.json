Candida albicans (C. albicans ) is an fungal pathogen, particularly observed in immunocompromised patients. C. albicans accounts for 50 -70% of cases of invasive candidiasis in the majority of clinical settings. Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal drug, has been used to treat fungal infec - tions previously. It has fungistatic activity against C. albicans . Traditional Chinese medicines can be used as complementary medicines to conventional drugs to treat a variety of ailments and diseases. Berberine is a quaternary alkaloid isolated from the traditional Chinese herb, Coptidis Rhizoma , while berber - rubine is isolated from the medicinal plant Berberis vulgaris , but is also readily derived from berberine by pyrolysis. The present study demonstrates the possible complementary use of berberine and berberrubine with terbinafine against C. albicans . The experimental findings assume that the potential application of these alkaloids together with reduced dosage of the standard drug would enhance the resulting antifungal potency.Introduction The incidence of Candida infections has increased in patients who receive immunosuppressive therapy, cancer chemotherapy and transplantation. Among the Candida species, Candida albi - cans (C. albicans ) is responsible for 50 -70% of cases of invasive candidiasis in the majority of clinical settings (1,2). C. albicans , an opportunistic fungal pathogen that normally inhabits the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal and female genital tracts (3), is able to attack the immunocompromised patients (4). When the normal microbial barrier is disrupted, C. albicans can invade the intestinal and female genital mucosal barriers and causes candidiasis and candidemia (5,6). A cross- sectional study has reported that Candida species isolation from the vaginal mucosa was more frequent in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients (29.7%) when compared with uninfected women (14.5%). C. albicans was the most prevalent pathogen isolated in HIV -infected (52.9%) and uninfected women (85.7%) (7). A previous study investigated 128 Candida isolates from South Africa and 126 Cameroonian Candida isolates. Of those, C. albicans was responsible for the highest percentage of them, with 82.8% of South African isolates and 73.0% of the Cameroonian isolates (8). In another study, of the 103 Candida species- infected oral mucosal isolates identi - fied in HIV patients, C. albicans accounted for the majority of Candida species (77.7%) (9). A prospective observational study also examined the occurrence of oral Candida coloniza - tion among cancer patients in China between October 2012 and March 2013. C. albicans was the most common species isolated from patients, accounting for 30.8% in patients with pulmonary cancer (n=78), 33.7% in patients with digestive tract malignant tumor (n=101), and 12.7% in patients with hemato - poietic system tumor (n=79). Cancer patients are a high -risk population for Candida colonization (10). Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) remain a funda - mental role in the treatment of various diseases due to their long history of clinical practice and reliable therapeutic efficacy.

Ch i na BY BERBERINE AND BERBERRUBINE 450 isolated from the traditional Chinese herb, Coptidis Rhizoma (also known as Huanglian), which from the medicinal plant Berberis vulgaris (13), but is also readily derived from berberine by pyrolysis (14). Kim et al (15) studied the antimicrobial activity of berberine, berberrubine, 9 -O-acylberberrubines and 9-O-alkylberberrubines. \u00b5g derivatives against C. albicans , with the MICs ranging from 1 -4 \u00b5g /ml. Park et al (16) reported the antifungal of 13 -(substi - tuted benzyl) berberine and -(4-tertbutylbenzyl) 13 -(4-isopropyl benzyl) berberine derivatives exhibited the strongest antifungal activity against C. albicans (MICs = 4 \u00b5g/ml) when compared with berberine (MIC = 128 \u00b5g /ml). The 13 -(4-tertbutylbenzyl) (MIC >128 \u00b5g /ml). TCMs can be used as complementary medicines to conven - tional drugs for a variety of disease treatments. Our previous study reported the complementary use of corilagin, a gallotannin identified in numerous plants, including Phyllanthus urinaria , with two chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin, in order to lower the working concentration of these two agents and to obtain an increment in the anticancer effect. The IC50 values were ~3-fold reduced for cisplatin and ~4-fold decreased for doxorubicin with the Hep3B hepatoma cells in the presence of corilagin (17). The efficacy of standard antibiotics against bacte - rial strains was improved by the use of plant materials (18 -21). TCMs as a complementary therapy with the standard antifungal drugs against fungal pathogens have emerged as a new choice for the treatment of infectious diseases. The present study utilizes the TCMs, berberine and berberrubine, as complementary agents with the standard antifungal drug, terbinafine, against the most common Candida species, C. albicans , responsible for the increased incidence of fungal infections. Materials and methods Chemical analysis. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker /Varian 500 MHz Fourier transform spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 1H and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded relative to residual protiated solvent; a positive value of the chemical shift denoted a resonance downfield from tetramethylsilane (TMS, internal standard). J-values were in Hz. All the chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purifica - tion. All the reactions were monitored by analytical thin -layer chromatography (TLC) on Merck aluminum -precoated plates of silica gel 60 F254 with detection by spraying with 5% (w/v) dodecamolybdophosphoric acid in ethanol or 5% (w /v) ninhy - drin in ethanol and subsequent heating. Synthesis of natural berberrubine. Natural berberrubine was synthesized according to the reported procedure (22). Berberine chloride (2.01 g, 5.4 mmol) was heated at 190C under reduced pressure for 2 h and the crude product was recrystallized from chloroform and hexane to obtain the title berberrubine in 83% yield as a dark minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). C. albicans was obtained from American Type of Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The MIC values of berberine, berberrubine (kindly provided by Professor K.K.H. Lee) and terbinafine (both from SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) on C. albicans were determined by the broth dilution method. Briefly, different concentrations of berberine, berberrubine and terbinafine were loaded from a starting concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ml containing 1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as the vehicle and they were diluted serially. DMSO (1%) was used as a vehicle control. The fungal samples were subsequently incubated at 35 C for 48 h. The minimum concentrations of berberine, berberrubine and terbinafine, which induced a complete growth inhibition would be recorded as their MIC values (16,23). For the determination of MFC, 10 \u00b5l of the 48 h incubated medium was removed and plated. MFC was recorded at a concentra - tion where no colony of fungal growth was observed. When MFC /MIC <4, the compound or combination would be consid - ered as fungicidal, while when MFC /MIC 4 the compound or combination would be considered as fungistatic. In each case, three independent experiments were conducted and each experiment was carried out in triplicates. Sensitization test. For the sensitization investigation experi (24). Briefly, C. albican cells were seeded at day 0 in the 96well microplate. Terbinafine was added at 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39 and 0.2 \u00b5g /ml, respectively, while berberine and berberrubine were added at 100 \u00b5g/ml together with terbinafine. After 48 h of incubation, MTS (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) /phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as Figure 1. Chemical structure of (A) berberine and (B) berberrubine. A BBIOMEDICAL REPORTS 4: 449-452, 2016 451 electron coupling agent mixed solution was added. Lastly, optical absorbance was determined at 490 nm using a micro - plate reader (Perkin Elmer Victor V) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To determine MIC and MFC values from the sensitization test, no MTS /PMS was added and the experimental procedures were conducted as mentioned before. In each case, three independent experiments were conducted and each experiment was carried out in triplicates. Zone of inhibition study. C. albicans was used to study the effectiveness of berberine alone (100 \u00b5g), berberine (100 \u00b5g) (100 \u00b5g) plus terbinafine (6 \u00b5g) against its growth in culture. C. albicans was diluted with yeast mold broth and plated on the yeast mold agar plate, and the holes were created on the agar using a sterile transfer pipette. For the tested samples, 1% DMSO (as negative control) and 6 \u00b5g terbinafine (as positive control) were placed in the holes of agar. The plates were subsequently incubated at 35 C for 48 h and the inhibition zones (mm, in terms of diameter) of fungi on the agar plates were recorded (23,25,26). Results and Discussion Determination of MIC, MFC and sensitization assay. Terbinafine is an allylamine agent with a broad spectrum of antifungal activity. It interferes with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal inhibition of the fungal enzyme squalene epoxidase. In the in vitro susceptibility tests, terbinafine have been shown to possess primarily fungicidal activity against dermatophytes, moulds and certain dimorphic fungi, but only fungistatic activity against C. albicans (27). The cell death mechanisms of berberine against C. albicans have been fully addressed in the previous studies. They involved the ability to impair mitochondrial function, generation of reactive oxygen species, targeting cell wall integrity pathway and also affecting heat shock transcription factor, HSF1 (28). The MIC and MFC values of terbinafine against C. albicans were determined as 6 and 24 \u00b5g /ml, respectively. As MFC /MIC was equal to 4, it was considered to be fungistatic. For berberine and berberru - bine, their MIC values were >100 \u00b5g /ml. No MFC value was determined. These findings were consistent with the results reported previously (16). However, berberine and berberrubine at 100 \u00b5g /ml could not improve the MFC, and the MFC of terbinafine could significantly potentiate the antifungal activity of terbinafine on albicans by Berberine and at 100 effectively assist the antifungal potential of terbinafine (Fig. 2). Notably, the complementary activity of berebrine with terbinafine was much stronger than that of berberrubine when terbinafine was loaded from 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39 and 0.2 \u00b5g /ml. Therefore, berberine was more in amplifying the antifungal action of terbi - nafine when compared with its analogue, berberrubine. Zone of inhibition study. Previous studies have reported that berberine in combination with fluconazole or miconazole showed a synergistic antifungal activity against C. albicans with larger inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests (29 -31). In order to evaluate the sensitivity of C. albicans to the combination of terbinafine and berberine or berberrubine, agar diffusion assays were conducted to determine their inhibition zones on the agar Figure 2. Sensitization and could assist the antifungal action of the standard antifungal drug, terbinafine. The complementary activity of berebrine with terbinafine was much stronger than that of berberrubine. In each case, three independent experiments were conducted and a mean value was obtained. Each experiment was carried out in triplicates. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation from three independent experiments. Figure 3. Inhibition zone (mm, in terms of mean diameter \u00b1 standard deviation).LAM et al: SENSITIZATION OF C. BY AND BERBERRUBINE 452 plates. Terbinafine alone at 6 \u00b5g possessed certain fungistatic effect against C. albicans (inhibition zone, 14.67\u00b13.06 mm), whereas berberine or berberrubine alone showed small or no level of growth inhibition of the fungi (Fig. 3). The combination of 100 \u00b5g berberine and 6 \u00b5g terbinafine showed an increased inhibition zones in size (inhibition zone, 25.67\u00b12.52 mm) when compared with terbinafine alone. The result may suggest that a synergistic fungistatic activity against C. albicans may occur between the combined drugs even if the MIC and MFC of this combination were not improved. However, the combination of 100 \u00b5g berberrubine and 6 \u00b5g terbinafine did not enhance the fungal sensitivity, with no significant enlargement in size of inhibition zone. No growth inhibition of C. albicans could be found in 1% DMSO (vehicle control). In conclusion, the present study reports the complementary application of berberine and berberrubine with terbinafine against the opportunistic fungal pathogen, C. albicans . A recent study has demonstrated that berebrine can assist flucon - azole to kill fluconazoleresistant C. albicans (32). The present results further indicate the possible sensitization of various pathogenic fungi to other standard drugs by berberine and berberrubine, with the purpose of obtaining an increment in the antifungal potency.
