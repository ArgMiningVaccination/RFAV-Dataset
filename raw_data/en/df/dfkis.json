Yes. However, do not assume you have received all required vaccines as requirements may change and vary from state to state. Massachusetts immunization requirements are very strict. Carefully review your records against the requirements to be certain you submit complete documentation. I can't get every required vaccine in my home country. What should I do? Don't worry. You can get all required vaccines at local pharmacies, such as CVS or Walgreens, in Massachusetts, or you can schedule an appointment at Health Services for most vaccines. Can I waive vaccines? I did not receive standard childhood immunizations. What should I do? We strongly recommend that all students receive immunizations as required for school entrance by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These requirements exist to protect the health of every individual student, our campus community, and protect the public health of our global population. Massachusetts allows exemption from vaccines for only two reasons: medical or religious exemption. Massachusetts does NOT recognize philosophical exemptions to vaccines. Students with valid exemptions must complete a Smith College vaccine exemption waiver by deadline date and prior to registration and orientation. Contact the Schacht Center for questions at [healthservices@smith.edu](mailto:healthservices@smith.edu). Students with further questions about vaccines, or medical or religious vaccine exemptions, are encouraged to review the information below and from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html), and contact the Schacht Center with questions. I can't find my immunization records. What should I do? Call your most recent school or doctor's office and ask if they have your immunizations on file. Check with your state, city or town to see if they have an immunization registry. Send copies to us. Keep a copy for yourself! I can't get Tuberculosis Blood Tests (IGRA Tspot or Quantiferon Gold) in my home country. What should I do? If you arrive in Massachusetts before college orientation, please be in touch with us. We can arrange for you to have testing performed. We can also perform the test here on your first day of orientation. Is there a place near campus I can get vaccines, or otherwise complete my forms? Yes. Northampton has several walk in clinics conveniently located near campus: - CVS Minute Clinic, 366 King Street, Northampton, 413-586-8315 - Cooley Dickinson Urgent Care Clinic, 30 Locust Street, Northampton, 413-582-2330 - OnCall Urgent Care Clinic, 6 Hatfield Street, Northampton, 413-584-7425 - Baystate Urgent Care, 325B King Street, Northampton, 413-387-4197 - MedExpress, 424 Russell Street, Hadley, 413-253-0483 Do I need a TB test?
