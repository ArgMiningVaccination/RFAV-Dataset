This disease was first described in 1920 in association with the ingestion of Senecio tea containing natural toxin pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) ( [2](#B2)). Since then, many cases being induced by PAs-containing herbal medicines or food contaminated with PAs in countries such as South Africa, Afghanistan and Spain ( [3](#B3)- [5](#B5)) have been reported. Currently, the most important and frequent cause of HSOS in Europe and the US is the use of high-dose chemotherapy in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, along with many other factors in the pathogenesis of HSOS, including alcohol, oral contraceptives, and radiation injury Recently, HSOS induced by PAs-containing Gynura segetum (Tusanqi), a traditional herbal medicine used for treating traumatic injury, is increasingly being reported ( [9](#B9)- [11](#B11)). [12](#B12), [13](#B13)). For patients without stem cell transplantation treatment, especially those induced by herbal medicine, the diagnosis is difficult since PAs exposure can be obscure and the clinical presentations usually mimic other liver disorders. For these cases, a detailed history as well as radiologic evaluation can play important roles in diagnosing this disease. To dates, the reports of radiologic features of HSOS, both related and unrelated to herbal medicines, have been limited ( [14](#B14)- [17](#B17)). The aim of this paper is to describe the CT and MRI features of 16 cases of HSOS caused by herbal medicine Gynura segetum. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients [18](#B18)), the inclusion criteria were 1) the patients met the modified Seattle criteria ( [19](#B19)) for HSOS characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly and weight gain due to fluid accumulation, 2) a Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score 5 ( [20](#B20)), and 3) a history of ingestion of Gynura segetum. All patients did not have a liver disease before their intake of Gynura segetum, and they were confirmed not to have viral hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, alcoholic cirrhosis, cholestasis secondary to sepsis, tumour infiltration, or congestive heart disease. Two patients without CT or MR examination were excluded. The remaining 16 cases composed the current study series, including 12 men and 4 women (age range, 22-72 years; mean age, 55.6 years). No patients had received stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy. One patient underwent subsequent liver transplantation after HSOS diagnosis. The interval between Gynura segetum consumption and initial CT or MR examination ranged from 1 month to 6 months (mean, 3.2 months). [21](#B21)), the patients were clinically classified into three groups based on the severity of disease and the outcome: one case being mild, whose disease was clinically obvious, but resolved without treatment; seven cases being moderate, whose symptoms required diuretics or pain medication; eight cases being severe, whose disease required treatment and did not resolve after 100 days' treatment, or led to mortality ( [Table 1](#T1)). Imaging Technique Imaging Analysis [15](#B15)- [17](#B17), [22](#B22)) and our own experience, the following abnormal findings were assessed, i.e., hepatomegaly (> 18 cm; craniocaudally), hepatic vein narrowing, gallbladder wall thickening (> 3 mm), ascites, and patchy enhancement. Because the main right hepatic vein is usually the largest of the three main hepatic veins and the middle and the left ones frequently form a common trunk ( [23](#B23), [24](#B24)), we measured the main right hepatic vein in hepatic venous phase images and defined its diameter < 1.5 mm as hepatic vein narrowing ( [23](#B23)). For the cases with MR images, we analyzed the liver parenchyma signal and recorded the cases showing high intensity surrounding portal vein in T2-weighted image, which have been named \"periportal cuffing\" sign ( [15](#B15)). The final interpretation was reached by consensus between the two radiologists while a third investigator took part in the arbitration when consensus could not be reached. [Fig. 1](#F1)): grade 1 = slight patchy enhancement visible in minority sections, grade 2 = coalescent or diffuse patchy enhancement in majority sections, and grade 3 = diffuse patchy enhancement visible on all sections of the liver. Statistical Analysis RESULTS [Table 1](#T1)summarized the imaging findings during the initial examinations. Ascites and patchy liver enhancement were the two most common radiologic findings in HSOS, both of which were present in all cases (16/16, 100%) ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). In 10 cases, the main right hepatic vein was visible and measured to be less than 1.5 mm. For the remaining 6 cases, the main hepatic veins were unenhanced on sectional imaging, and even difficult to visualize with CT angiogram (n = 1) or MR angiograms (n = 7). [Fig. 2](#F2)). Out of the eight cases who had MRI, heterogeneous intensity and periportal cuffing were detected in four (4/8, 50%) and six cases (6/8, 75%), respectively, on T2-weighted images. [Fig. 3](#F3)). Given the special shape of the enhancement, \"clover sign\" was coined to describe the interesting presentation. [Table 2](#T2)). There was a significant association between the extent of patchy liver enhancement and the clinical severity classification (kappa = 0.565). [Fig. 3](#F3)). [Fig. 3](#F3)). DISCUSSION [11](#B11)). An animal study revealed that sinusoidal endothelial cells are the target of toxic injury related to PAs ( [25](#B25)). Recent studies have proved that several PAs-containing medical herbs can cause HSOS ( [11](#B11)). According to a study performed in the United States in 1990s, 34% of respondents used unconventional therapy and 3% used herbal medicines ( [11](#B11)), which calls out for attention on potential herbal medicine related health problems. In current series, all patients consumed Gynura segetum (Tusanqi), a kind of PAs-containing herbal medicine widely used in China and some Asian countries. Most of these patients used Gynura segetum root soaked in wine to relieve back and leg pain or treat traumatic injury. Literatures on Gynura segetum induced HSOS have been increasingly published recently ( [9](#B9)- [11](#B11)). Contrary to the previous sporadic case reports, our study is based on the first sizable cohort. [11](#B11)). The overall mortality from HSOS varies from 3% to 67% in different series ( [26](#B26), [27](#B27)). Supportive and symptomatic care to maintain intravascular volume and renal perfusion without extravascular fluid accumulation is critical ( [6](#B6)). Successful management of HSOS depends on early intervention; in our experience, the specific imaging presentation usually evokes the diagnosis for radiologist and clinician. [6](#B6)). Then, the part of liver where sinusoidal obstruction or veno-occlusion occurred may show relatively lower enhancement on contrast CT or MRI, which may form the patchy liver enhancement sign. In present study, we found a significant association between radiologic and clinical classification; the extent of abnormal patchy liver enhancement may partly indicate the severity of the disease and help optimize the treatments for patients. [15](#B15)). Main hepatic vein narrowing is another important sign favoring the diagnosis of HSOS. In a previous CT based study, investigators found a significantly smaller right hepatic vein diameter in patients with HSOS compared to patients with graft-versus-host disease. They argued that the right hepatic vein measuring less than 4.5 mm in diameter was highly suggestive of HSOS ( [28](#B28)). van den Bosch and van Hoe ( [15](#B15)), in an imaging case report of two patients with HSOS following stem cell transplantation, described the hepatic vein as narrow but patent. In our study, the right hepatic veins in 10 cases were visualized and measured less than 1.5 mm. For the remaining 6 cases, the hepatic veins were non-measurable in sectional post-contrast images or even multiplanar reformatted images. Given that the primary site of the injury is sinusoidal endothelial cells, the result suggests that these subjects seemed to be the severe cases or in late stage of the disease. [15](#B15)). [29](#B29)) found that HSOS in patients with treated colorectal metastases could be effectively detected on superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced T2-weighted gradient echo images. In a recent study, Shin et al. ( [30](#B30)) reported that gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was highly specific for the diagnosis of HSOS in patients with treated colorectal hepatic metastases. [11](#B11), [15](#B15)). Thus, the imaging changes in HSOS induced by herbal medicine may be equally helpful for favoring diagnosis of stem cell transplantation "}
