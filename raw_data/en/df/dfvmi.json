Materials design Nanomanufacturing Sensors $3 Million Grant Establishes Advanced Nanomanufacturing Cluster for Smart Centers and Materials The Massachusetts Technology Collaborative Research and Development Matching Grant Program awarded a $3 million grant to Northeastern to establish the Advanced Nanomanufacturing Cluster for Smart Sensors and Materials, or CSSM, which comprises research universities and private manufacturing companies. Advanced nanomanufacturing has vast potential to advance connected technologies, known as the internet of things, and revolutionize the sensing industry. This includes potential commercial applications such as high-precision miniature wireless sensors used to monitor premature babies in hospital neonatal units, wearable sensors for health and fitness that tracks biomarkers such as glucose, lactate or other biometrics, and sensors that track water quality. The initiative will leverage Northeastern's innovative Nanoscale Offset Printing System, or NanoOPS, a manufacturing technology pioneered by the College's NSF Center for High-Rate Nanomanufacturing (CHN), led by Ahmed Busnaina, University Distinguished Professor and the William Lincoln Smith Chair in the College of Engineering. NanoOPS can print nanoscale sensors and devices as small as 20 nanometers\u2014more than 10,000 times thinner than a human hair\u2014on a variety of surfaces, and 100 to 1,000 times faster than current inkjet-based electronic and 3-D printing. Part of the new funding will be used to establish infrastructure for printed materials characterization and testing smart sensor prototypes, and to build generation 2 and generation 3 NanoOPS with enhanced capabilities, including the ability to print on any surface. The grant is being matched by nearly $11 million in outside funds through this partnership between academia, industry, and government. NSF CAREER Award for Development of Optical Control Over Magnetic Memory at Unprecedented Speed and Density Assistant Professor Yongmin Liu, jointly appointed in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has received a $500K National Science Foundation CAREER award. He received the award for his research developing new ways to control the magnetic properties of recording media such as hard disk drives in computers to dramatically increase the speed at which data can be stored. Instead of using the traditional magnetic head to activate the magnetic recording materials, Liu will use light\u2014optical laser pulses\u2014combined with metallic nanostructures to generate the necessar y magnetic field to store the data, transforming data storage for the Big Data era. Enterprises that will benefit from this ultrafast nanoscale optical-magnetism approach include web search engines, online retailers, and social media platforms.11 RESEARCH INITIATIVESBIOMACHINE INTEGRATION BioMachine Integration tackles grand challenges that span health, security, and sustainability with engineering solutions to involve an integration of advanced materials, devices and machines with living systems to yield synthetic bio-machine technologies. Molecular to human scale Living sensors Cell technologies Medical robotics Human/machine dynamics Environmental health factors $5M NIH Award for In Vitro Model of the Human Gut Recent research has linked conditions inside the intestine not only to obviously related problems like inflammatory bowel disease\u2014but, more surprisingly, to Alzheimers, depression, heart disease, and other long-term health issues. Professor Rebecca Carrier (PI) and Assistant Professor Abigail Koppes (Co-I), of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern, were awarded a $5 million National Institutes of Health Bioengineering Research Partnership grant to develop an in vitro model of the human gut that can be utilized for laboratory study. This is a collaborative project between Northeastern University, MIT, and Boston Children's Hospital. While the gut microbiome is known to have tremendous impact on human health, these effects are complex and generally not well understood, limiting translation of observed microbiome impact to effective therapies. Currently, studies of the intestinal tract are done using animal subjects, but there are many differences between humans and animals. The in vitro model will be the first to include human tissue, immune cells, and microbes to provide a more accurate view. The approach combines the development of hardware components, culture techniques, model microbial communities, novel biomaterials, and computational modeling frameworks. $1.9M NSF Grant to Build a Tool to Detect Retinopathy of Prematurity in Infants Assistant Professor Stratis Ioannidis, Professor Deniz Erdogmus, and Professor Jennifer Dy of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, in collaboration with the MGH/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center and Oregon Health & Science University, were awarded a $1.9 million National Science Foundation grant to create an \"Assistive Integrative Support Tool for Retinopathy of Prematurity.\" The research team will use machine learning techniques to build an assistive tool to detect retinopathy of prematurity in infants with multimodal clinical data. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood visual loss worldwide, and the social burdens of infancy-acquired blindness are enormous. Early diagnosis is critically important for successful treatment, and can prevent most cases of blindness. The joint NU, MGH and OHSU team will develop a prototype assistive integrative support tool for ROP , comprising image analysis; information fusion of clinical, imaging, and diagnostic data; and generative probabilistic and regression models with associated computationally efficient machine learning algorithms. Rebecca Carrier Abigail Koppes12 RESEARCH INITIATIVES$2.35M NIH Director's New Innovator Award The National Institutes of Health recognized Nikolai Slavov, assistant professor in the Department of Bioengineering, for his groundbreaking research with its Director's New Innovator Award. The five-year, $2.35 million award is part of the NIH Common Fund's High-Risk, High-Reward Research program, which supports highly creative early-career researchers taking out-of-the-box approaches to major challenges in biomedical research. Slavov's work contradicted scientists' decades-long assumption that all ribosomes were the same. Slavov and his colleagues' research findings were published in the journal Cell Reports . The concept of \"specialized ribosomes\"\u2014that not all ribosomes house the same standard 80 core proteins but rather varieties of them\u2014had finally been validated. Before Slavov' s discovery, scientists believed that ribosomes in unperturbed cells had a passive role in the expression of genetic information. A molecule called messenger RNA, or mRNA, picked up protein-assembly instructions\u2014which amino acids to link in a chain and in what order they should link\u2014from genes and delivered them to the ribosome to follow . Slavov's findings, however, indicated that ribosomes not only assembled proteins, they also appeared to regulate that production. The findings could have implications for new directions in fields from cancer therapeutics to regenerative medicine, and the potential applications of the research findings are broad. In tissue engineering, for example, if researchers want to program, for instance, an embryonic stem cell to make a heart cell, they may now have to take into account how to influence the ribosome. If a genetic mutation has led to a core-protein malfunction that contributes to the growth of cancer, researchers may now consider developing drugs that target that ribosomal core protein to restore its function, inhibiting cancer growth. Nikolai Slavov, Assistant Professor of Bioengineering13 RESEARCH INITIATIVESCritical Infrastructure Sustainability and Security will promote the development of fundamental engineering to embed resilience into the design strategies, standards and regulatory frameworks of critical infrastructure systems through predictive understanding of climate and security hazards with geospatial Big Data and computational solutions. It will develop a framework for establishing translational solutions in collaboration with academic partners, industry leaders and startups, as well as national laboratories and federal agencies. Resilient water/energy systems Hazard Identification and risk managementCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUSTAINABILITY AND SECURITY NSF Award to Develop Best Practices for Tide Gate Operations The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently awarded a three-year research grant to Northeastern University to develop best practices for tide gate operations in coastal marshes. Professor Mark Patterson, interdisciplinary faculty between the College of Science (COS) and civil and environmental engineering (CEE), is leading the project with Assistant Professor Loretta A. Fernandez, CEE/COS and Brian Helmuth, affiliated faculty, CEE. \"Wetlands are critical to protection of coastal infrastructure,\" says Patterson. \"Our research will establish engineering best practices to help communities effectively manage tide gate operations and reduce risk of storm surges and fire, while protecting ecosystem health.\" Under the NSF grant, the Northeastern team will work with local Massachusetts communities to investigate three diverse salt marsh environments, including a large urban coastal marsh, a smaller urban marsh and a \"pristine\" marsh that will serve as a control site. Based on its data gathering and modeling\u2014along with input collected in workshops with stakeholders\u2014the team will develop decision-support tools for operators, including a smartphone app to provide guidance on when and how much to open tide gates under various scenarios, and a companion website to serve as a resource for managers, the public, and K-12 school programs. Because the marshes selected for the study are different in size and behavior, the decision support tools will be suitable for use in a variety of locations across the country. As part of the focus on protecting ecosystem health, the study will examine the effects of human-made pollutants. \"Industrial toxins now present in almost all aquatic environments can accumulate and stick to the sediment moving in and out of the marsh, which has an impact on both plant life and fish species\u2014and can potentially affect people when they consume the fish,\" explains Fernandez. Using engineering tools known as \"passive samplers\" will allow for measuring low concentrations of these toxins in the environment and enable researchers to learn more about how tide gate operations affect the transport of toxic chemicals in salt marshes and predict how bioavailable these chemicals are to resident fish species. Collected data will be fed into the smartphone app developed for operators to help manage both nutrient and toxin transport, and decisions to open or close tide gates. Loretta A. Fernandez, Assistant Professor & Mark Patterson, Professor14 RESEARCH INITIATIVES Developing a National Agenda for Research on Offshore Wind Resiliency The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) recently awarded funding to Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) Professor and Chair Jerome Hajjar and CEE Associate Professor Andrew Myers to develop a national research agenda for offshore wind energy infrastructure. A draft agenda will be presented at a workshop hosted by Northeastern University in December 2017.As part of MassCEC's Massachusetts Research Partnership in offshore wind, six institutions\u2014Northeastern, Tufts University, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Lowell and Dartmouth, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\u2014are working collaboratively with government and industry to develop a framework for offshore wind research. \"We're looking at creating research to scale up industry and at workforce development to create opportunities,\" says Hajjar. \"This includes everything from wind turbine towers to supply chain, public policy and regulatory policy.\" Each of the participating universities is hosting a workshop focusing on various aspects of the research agenda, with the final culminating workshop to be hosted by Northeastern in December. The Northeastern team's primary focus is on the structural engineering part of the research agenda, specifically large-scale testing of wind turbine towers. \"We're looking at manufacturing imperfections and how that affects performance of wind turbine towers,\" explains Myers, who is leading testing at Northeastern's structural testing lab in Burlington, Mass. \"We're baselining new methods [of manufacturing], identifying what parts of the manufacturing process could be improved to lead to a better, stronger tower.\" Ultimately, according to Myers, Northeastern's work underscores the benefits of large-scale testing to advance research in developing this new energy industry. \"This is an example of what large-scale testing can do,\" says Myers. \"It demonstrates there is a need for testing\u2014for investment in testing facilities\u2014and how it can support the research agenda.\"15 RESEARCH INITIATIVESENGINEERED CYBER-SOCIAL- PHYSICAL SYSTEMS Research in this area will use engineering solutions to develop the Engineered Resilient Cyber-Social- Physical Systems needed to design, operate, and evolve complex cyber-physical systems upon which people can confidently depend to perform both mundane and safety critical tasks, and that can better withstand, rapidly recover from, and adapt to local, regional, and global disruptions at multiple timescales. Sensing Control Communications/networking Big Data analytics Embedded systems Man-machine interface Northeastern Designated Beyond Traffic Innovation Center The U.S. Department of Transportation designated Northeastern University a Beyond Traffic Innovation Center; one of 18 \"forward thinking and influential institutions\" to lead research aimed at solving transportation challenges such as population growth, climate change, and driverless cars over the next three decades. The Northeastern team will focus specifically on the Northeast, one of 11 megaregions throughout the country, consisting of 11 states and the District of Columbia, and the Atlantic seaboard spanning 450 miles with a host of airports, ports, rail, and urban transportation systems.Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Sara Wadia-Fascetti is leading the Center's efforts with Professors Haris N. Koutsopoulos and Matthias Ruth. The Center will leverage the expertise of a host of faculty across disciplines in areas such as network science, public policy, resilience, and sensors and monitoring systems, as well as work closely with partners in industry, government, and academia. Additionally, the Center will build upon Northeastern's College of Engineering Versatile Onboard Traffic Embedded Roaming Sensors (VOTERS) center, led by Ming Wang, distinguished professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Through research and outreach, the Center will harness Big Data to improve decision- making as it particularly relates to traffic, transit, and related infrastructure systems. The project specifically builds upon and combines Northeastern's research expertise in physical infrastructure and sensing, streamlined services using data analytics, and governance and policy. Sara Wadia-Fascetti Haris N. Koutsopoulos Matthias Ruth In 2016, Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Qi Wang's paper, titled \"Patterns and Limitations of Urban Human Mobility Resilience Under the Influence of Multiple Types of Natural Disaster\" was published in the journal PLoS One , Volume 11, No. 1, e0147299.16 RESEARCH INITIATIVES$2.5M NSF Award for Designing a Framework for Resilient Emergency Health Response The National Science Foundation awarded a $2.5 million Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) Type 2 grant for \"Identification and Control of Uncertain, Highly Interdependent Processes Involving Humans with Applications to Resilient Emergency Health Response,\" to pioneer a new approach to enable communities to withstand and bounce back quickly from hazards. A new paradigm of proactive resiliency through \"prediction, intervention and adaptation,\" is used as opposed to the current reactive cycle of discovery, recovery and redesign. The research also uniquely integrates engineering (electrical, industrial, civil), computer science, and social science strategies for achieving resilience over the short and long term. The multidisciplinary research, according to the NSF, seeks to develop a comprehensive framework for designing and operating resilient communities by modeling them as partially engineered networked cyber-physical-human systems. The goal of the project is to develop a synthesis framework for such systems, capable of guaranteeing minimum levels of performance and rapid recovery of functionality in the face of disruptions. The resulting framework will be tested using a scenario involving four systems critical to maintaining minimum levels of emergency medicine: power, communications, critical goods supply chain, and built environment.

The interdisciplinary research, led by Jacqueline Griffin, assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering, seeks to drive a paradigm shift with regard to infrastructure resiliency and supply chain risk management, accounting for the critical inclusion of realistic human decision-making components with information sharing and bounded rationality. To achieve this, the researchers will develop a unique and transformative multi-agent modeling framework that combines mathematical modeling, realistic human behavior modeling, and game design to more appropriately consider human behavior and dynamics of the underlying physical, information, and social systems in critical infrastructures. Research findings will define new resiliency measures and classifications incorporating a robust characterization of stable systems and agent behavior in undisrupted multilayered networked systems with multiple realistic agent-based models of human decision makers, and contrast these to system performance and agent behaviors after distributed and single extreme events.

A five-year innovative scholarship and mentoring program, S-POWER seeks to increase the number of underrepresented minority, as well as first-generation college transfer students from two- and four-year institutions that do not offer degrees in STEM to institutions that do grant degrees in STEM. It also seeks to address the need for fundamental research and training in energy-related fields in order to prepare a new generation of energy experts. Northeastern is partnering with two historically black colleges and universities\u2014Clark Atlanta University and Hampton University\u2014as well as Mass Bay, Middlesex, and Northern Essex community colleges in Massachusetts. Undergraduates from these institutions will transfer into Northeastern's College of Engineering beginning fall 2017, while graduated students from Hampton University will begin graduate studies this fall. The program will provide scholarships for up to 160 undergraduate and graduate students; participating students will each be eligible for up to $30,000 in direct financial aid. Northeastern will also build a collaborative education, administrative, and mentoring ecosystem that uniquely supports students throughout the transfer process, including helping partner colleges and universities implement S-POWER back at their institutions.The Engineered Water, Sustainability and Health initiative will develop engineered solutions for sustainability and health, focusing on clean water and environmental protection as key grand challenges.ENGINEERED WATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HEALTH $651K Grant from NASA for Surface Water and Ocean Topography Satellite Mission Edward Beighley, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, received a $651K grant from NASA for research supporting the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT will make the first global survey of Earth's surface water, providing understanding of how water bodies change over time.

ROUTES\u2014Research Opportunities for Undergraduates: Training in Environmental Health Sciences\u2014aims to increase the number of minority undergraduates studying the effects of environmental contaminants on people and communities. As part of the program, Berroa had the opportunity to conduct research into a health hazard that affected his family when they lived in the Dominican Republic, and plagues much of the developing world: contaminated drinking water. His ROUTES scholarship paid for a research co-op with Northeastern's PROTECT Center's Project 5, which is developing sustainable electrochemical technologies to clean up contaminated groundwater in Puerto Rico. He worked on the \"Green Remediation by Solar Energy Conversion into Electrolysis in Groundwater\" project. In explaining his experience joining the PROTECT team, Berroa specifically emphasized how much he valued the instruction of one of his co-op mentors, Dr. Ljiljana Rajic. It was \"her persistence and guidance\" that prepared him to present his new-found knowledge at conferences all around the Boston area and even in Puerto Rico.Northeastern Takes Part in $157M NIH Study: Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes Program Northeastern's College of Engineering is participating in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study, called Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program, to investigate the ways that early exposure to a range of environmental factors influence the short- and long-term health of children. The NIH awarded $157 million in its fiscal year 2016 to launch the seven-year initiative. Top research institutions will examine the effects of a variety of environmental factors\u2014from air pollution and chemicals to stress and diet\u2014on the health of children and adolescents. The Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Center and the Center for Research on Early Childhood Exposure and Development in Puerto Rico (CRECE), both led by Akram Alshawabkeh, George E. Snell Professor of Engineering, in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Associate Dean of Engineering for Research at Northeastern, are taking part in the study. PROTECT, which launched in 2010 with funding from the NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), explores the role contaminants such as phthalates play in Puerto Rico's high rate of preterm birth. CRECE, which launched in 2015 with funding from the NIH and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), uses a subset of the children participants born in the PROTECT cohort to evaluate the impact of environmental exposures, including particulate matter and phenols, on children's neurodevelopment. Both centers encompass multi-institution collaboration. ECHO will build on the work PROTECT and CRECE have been carrying out in Puerto Rico. The teams plan on collecting data and biospecimens for 570 pairs of mothers and children who are already in the PROTECT-CRECE cohort and to recruit an additional 1100 pregnant women. Over the seven-year span of the program, PROTECT and CRECE expect to study a total of 1,560 mother-child pairs. Akram Alshawabkeh, George E. Snell Professor of Engineering, and Associate Dean of Research David Berroa, E'18 19 RESEARCH INITIATIVESINTEGRATED MODELING, INFERENCE, AND COMPUTING Integrated Modeling, Inference, and Computing will focus on the advancement of the integration of core areas of engineered modeling approaches, machine learning, and computation to address barriers in smart modeling with applications in bioengineering for health and disease, environmental health monitoring and climate change, and engineering and design of advanced material systems. It will identify testbeds that define broad application areas that demand new developments in our three fundamental core areas to address barriers in smart modeling. Professor Chowdhury Named Presidential Early Career Award Winner Kaushik Chowdhury, associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was named a winner of the White House Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, or PECASE, in 2017. It is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers. Chowdhury was nominated for the honor by the Department of Defense, whose Office for Naval Research is funding his research on the use of intelligent, autonomous radios in wireless communications with a $1 million Director of Research Early Career Grant over the next five years. Chowdhury's radio technology has wireless bidirectional transmitter-receivers that not only detect congestion and interference along the information highway, but also autonomously respond, switching pathways, or \"spectrums,\" for instance, or changing transmission parameters to ferry data quickly and accurately to the appropriate destination. \"I was excited to receive this recognition and at the same time humbled to be counted among some very accomplished colleagues,\" says Chowdhury. \"Receiving the PECASE for my research serves as a reminder that the Department of Defense and the nation rely on wireless communications and networking in advancing our country's technological edge and underscores the responsibility inherent in pursuing this work.\" The goal of Chowdhury's research is to make radios not just intelligent but 'cognitive,' that is, to go beyond recognizing interference to acting on it. Integral to the research is ensuring that each radio can connect to many other radios, establishing a \"distributed network\" so that the radios will be able to discover one another and configure themselves, forming multi-hop forwarding paths. The applications of such networks range from defense operations, in which military forces need to communicate efficiently with one another, to emergency services, where personnel from fire departments, hospitals, and law enforcement must converge, to next-generation consumer networks. Kaushik Chowdhury, Associate Professor 20 RESEARCH INITIATIVES$10M Multi-university, Industry Collaborative DARPA Award The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently awarded a $10 million, four-year research project to Raytheon BBN, Northeastern's College of Engineering, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as part of the Dispersed Computing Program. According to DARPA, the research to advance wireless communication technology will build \"software instantiations of algorithms and protocol stacks that leverage pervasive, physically dispersed computing platforms to boost application and network performance by orders of magnitude.\" Professor Edmund Yeh, of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is leading the effort at Northeastern. As part of this multi-university and industry collaborative award, Northeastern and MIT engineering researchers will develop a set of optimized communication and computation algorithms and protocols to support multiple-sender multiple- receiver applications with highly demanding latency constraints over heterogeneous, congested, and error-prone network environments. BBN will use the algorithms and protocols in software to develop new wireless communication technology solutions to create a new system architecture from the ground up. The technology will enable seamless wireless communication in the field, regardless of channel conditions and computing platforms, thus enabling real-time intelligence for critical decision making. NSF Grant to Advance Large- Scale and Secure Data Mining Assistant Professor Stratis Ioannidis and Interim Chair and Professor Miriam Leeser of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have been awarded a $500K grant from the National Science Foundation to develop a \"Massively Scalable Secure Computation Infrastructure Using FPGAs\" to advance large- scale and secure data mining. Every day, the collection of behavioral data takes place on a massive scale, from clinical trials performed by medical and scientific experts, to shopping conduct and economic trends by retail sales corporations. While mining this data can offer tremendous societal benefits resulting from sharing data among researchers and practitioners, it also gives rise to significant personal privacy concerns\u2014an Engineering Grand Challenge facing society today. Ioannidis and Leeser's research seeks to not only guarantee the safety of the personal data collected, but also to speed up the process by which it is encrypted. \"There are solutions to safeguard personal information, including behavioral data, through a technique called Secure Function Evaluation (SFE); the end user can access the output of a computation performed on the data, but not the original records,\" said Ioannidis. \"The problem with SFE is that it is computationally intensive; computations performed securely can be up to 700,000 times slower, which is prohibitive for large datasets.\" Leeser and Ioannidis propose a solution to this slow-down in the form of field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which are specialized hardware that accelerate the SFE application. \"By using FPGAs, we can work to apply SFE over large and changing data using parallel computing practically in real-time, while still preserving personal privacy,\" said Leeser. \"This has worldwide applications throughout industries, as well as toward the whole notion of the importance of protecting one's data, from medical records to geolocation. If there is no chance that an individual's personal data can be compromised, then we as a society are much more likely to become comfortable with prudent data collection. This can work for the betterment of everything from homeland security to the curing of diseases,\" explained Leeser. Edmund Yeh, Professor Miriam Leeser Stratis Ioannidis 21 RESEARCH INITIATIVESSECURITY, SENSING AND SURVEILLANCE Security, Sensing and Surveillance Systems will focus on providing engineering solutions to outstanding mission-critical challenges in areas of surveillance, reconnaissance, imaging, and detection enabled by innovative advances in next-generation radar, sonar, video, optical/IR and communication platforms.

Resilient infrastructure Cybersecurity Transportation security NSF CAREER Award to Advance Security Monitoring Jose Martinez-Lorenzo, assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering, jointly appointed in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, of Northeastern University's College of Engineering, was recently awarded a $500K National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award for his work developing a method for \"4D mm-Wave Compressive Sensing and Imaging at One Thousand Volumetric Frames per Second.\" Millimeter-wave sensing and imaging systems are generally used for a wide range of applications, such as security monitoring to detect potential threats at the airport and biological imaging for wound diagnosis and healing. The four-dimensional millimeter-wave imaging system can operate in quick-changing scenarios. One of the main applications of this system is finding security threats hidden under clothing, inside backpacks, or in public spaces, such as sports arenas. The system can scan multiple people within 26 cubic meters and produce 1000 3D image frames per second, far surpassing existing millimeter-wave sensing and imaging systems. Martinez-Lorenzo also collaborates with College of Engineering (COE) Distinguished Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Carey Rappaport through the support provided by the Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats (ALERT) research center at Northeastern, which is a multi-university, interdisciplinary Department of Homeland Security center of excellence led by Robert D. Black Professor, COE Distinguished Professor Michael Silevitch of electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern.

Jose Martinez-Lorenzo, Assistant Professor 22 RESEARCH INITIATIVESJung and Kar to Develop Rapid/Early Radiation Detection Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) Professor Yung Joon Jung (principal investigator), and Associate Professor Swastik Kar (co-principal investigator) of the Department of Physics, have been awarded a research grant from the National Science Foundation to develop rapid/early radiation detection. According to the NSF, the research will translate a novel nanotechnology-based charged-particle (ion) detection method for a range of radioactivity and nuclear radiation sensing and monitoring applications, resulting in the development of prototype radiation detectors that will be ultrasensitive with significantly reduced size, weight, cost and power -consumption compared to current technologies. While Jung and Kar were developing an ion sensor using carbon nanotubes, they discovered it was extremely sensitive to iron particles and so they began to explore the ion sensor's viability in detecting radiation for potential consumer and government applications. Their efforts and the support of an NSF I-Corps grant led to a startup that is currently being formed, called Guardion, with the goal to commercialize the technology with applications in three markets, including: At-home radon detection for consumers Personal radiation dosimeters for employees at high risk of exposure, such as in hospitals and nuclear power plants Homeland security through large-scale deployment in the event of a nuclear emergency Guardion, founded by Jung, Kar and mechanical and industrial engineering alumnus Dan Esposito, E'08, was selected as a 2017 MassChallenge Finalist.

NSF I-Corps Grant for Continuous Operation of Consumer Devices Kaushik Chowhury, associate professor, electrical and computer engineering, was awarded an NSF I-Corps grant for \"Software- Defined Distributed Wireless Charging.\" The research will facilitate the continuous operation of consumer devices as well as enable uninterrupted safety-critical applications such as elderly care, and patient and structural health monitoring. According to the NSF, the research defines a new network architecture that is capable of distributed wireless RF-based charging by combining both hardware and software platforms. The technology enables an exponential increase in wireless charging rates due to constructive interference and real-time adaptation of energy signals using minimal receiver feedback. A software-defined distributed energy beamforming plane is leveraged to ensure continuous feedback, which is used for selecting various parameters at the energy transmitters that give high charging rates. The technology also assesses energy needs over the network and is able to schedule energy broadcasts proactively. Another benefit of this research project is its potential to improve the quality of life in society by eliminating concerns of frequent charging of low-power electronic devices. Also, by enabling wireless charging of small form factor sensors, the expenses and environmental concerns associated with battery-replacements are mitigated. Tommaso Melodia, Associate ProfessorEMERGING RESEARCH TOPICS26$1.2M NSF Award to Protect Against Side-Channel Attacks Professor Yunsi Fei, electrical and computer engineering, is leading a $1.2M three-year National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace award, titled \"Automating Countermeasures and Security Evaluation Against Software Side-Channel Attacks.\" Fei and her interdisciplinary research team are building an automation framework, and associated software tools, metrics, and methodologies for information leakage analysis, multi-level countermeasure application, and formal security evaluation against software side-channel attacks. The research project addresses the threat to various cryptographic implementations that do not feature dedicated protection, as well as overcomes the labor-intensive, application-specific, and security vulnerability limitations of current manually implemented countermeasures. According to the NSF, the automated framework approach unifies two most common side-channel attacks, power analysis and cache-based timing attack, into one framework. It defines new metrics of information leakage and uses them to automatically identify possible leakage of a given cryptosystem at an early stage with no implementation details. The conventional compilation process is extended along the new dimension of optimizing for security, to generate side-channel resilient code and ensure its secure execution at run-time. Side-channel security is guaranteed to be at a certain confidence level with formal methods. With certain level of side-channel security guaranteed, the framework will enable security system architects and software developers to build verifiable security into a broad range of applications, including Internet-of-Things where pervasive embedded systems on the network edges can be easily captured by an adversary to inflict security breaches.Novel Research on Ultra Compact Antennas Published in Nature Communications The next generation of antennas could be up to 100 times smaller than current compact antennas if fabricated using a novel design approach developed by Nian Xiang Sun, professor of electrical and computer engineering. The technology could have potential applications for portable wireless communications systems, including wearable electronics, smartphones, bio- implantable and bio-injectable antennas, and the of paper, entitled \"Acoustically Actuated Ultra- compact NEMS Magnetoelectric Antennas,\" was recently published in Nature Communications . Traditional antennas are rigid metal structures that are sized to be resonant with a specific wavelength of radiation, which puts limits on miniaturization. The new antenna is a membrane that is resonant not with a specific wavelength, but instead a specific frequency, which allows for a vast reduction in the physical size of the antenna. The membrane is composed of a thin film magnetoelectric material that changes its magnetization as it vibrates, coupling the acoustic vibration with both transmitting and receiving radiation. The membrane resonant frequency can be controlled by different geometric designs, and the technology has been demonstrated with two different designs spanning the UHF and VHF radio frequencies. The new antennas perform better than similarly sized traditional antennas, and they are completely passive requiring simple electronics and no battery.

Building out the research infrastructure of the university, this past spring the university opened the new 220,000 square foot Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex that provides state-of-the art laboratories in engineering and science. This year the department launches a new BS in Environmental Engineering, with plans for it to be ABET accredited for our first graduates. This degree program reflects our significant growth and expansion of scope in environmental engineering and water resources engineering and includes several new courses. Last year we also launched two new graduate degrees, including an MS in Environmental Engineering (MSEnvE) and an MS in Engineering and Public Policy (MSEPP) with two concentrations, including Energy and Environment, and Infrastructure Resilience. These degrees focus on topics of significant national need, with the MSEnvE integrating environmental engineering and science with public health, water sustainability, and water-energy-nexus, and the MSEPP degree providing students with the core skills needed to address engineering solutions while recognizing the impact of public policy and societal constraints on these solutions. The department continues to expand its research presence across all fields, and is currently leading the PROTECT Center, funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health, and the CRECE Center, funded by NIEHS and the Environmental Protection Agency, to study the relationship between environmental contamination and preterm birth. Our scholars strive to use today's discovery and research to make tomorrow happen. You can see some highlights of our civil and environmental engineering faculty members at northeastern.edu/tomorrow.

SilevitchFACULTY BY RESEARCH AREAS39MECHANICAL AND INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERINGDEPARTMENT CHAIR MESSAGE The Department of Mechanial and Industrial Engineering has been on the rise through strategic hiring. As the department rises, a conducive environment has provided a platform for people to work hard and work happily. The addition of 20 new tenured/tenure-track faculty members over four years, with no attrition to other universities, has propelled eight research clusters in the department toward excellence. Supporting the fast rise is the growing financial resource. The department has started large-scale collaborations with major industrial companies including General Electric, Raytheon, and Northrop, while continuing the strong working relationship with federal and state agencies. The annual research award has gone up by 35% over four years. In parallel with the tenured/tenure-track faculty hires, the addition of nine teaching faculty members over four years has enabled educational excellence to advance even further. Undergraduate admissions has become ever more competitive, and the average SAT has reached 1450. The graduate student population has more than doubled over the same period. Some of our recent doctoral and post-doctoral graduates have started their tenure-track careers at Arizona State University, Mississippi State University, North Carolina State University, and University of Central Florida, to name a few. People are the center of focus at this department. We work hard and work happily, and take ownership of the department. As an example, Emeritus Professor and former Department Chair John W. Cipolla has given the department $100K to establish the John and Katharine Cipolla Graduate Student Support Fund. Strategic hiring, people focus, and preservation of a conducive environment have enabled people to work hard and work happily, and thereby work productively. Productive people naturally bring successes. Rising awareness of our successes is also a trend we note and appreciate. According to the US News and World Report , our mechanical engineering graduate program moved up 18 places to No. 39 in four years, while our industrial engineering graduate program has moved up four places to No. 32 during the same period. This momentum will continue through strategic growth. I invite alums and other stakeholders to join us in propelling this department even further, and also invite all to consider this department for your education or for research and development projects. I look forward to hearing from you! Hanchen Huang Donald W.
