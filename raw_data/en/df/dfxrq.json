TCM practices most heavily in energetics and pairing the energy with the animal as well as ailment. TCM focuses on healing the root causes of disease in addition to treating symptoms. Chinese medicine encompasses [ nutrition, acupuncture, herbal medicine, mind-body exercise, and Asian bodywork.](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/205224/file-42973079-pdf/docs/tcm_nutrition.pdf) Most researchers agree that the formation and development of TCM follows a different process from that of modern science. Foods are classified according to their attributes and the way it affects the balance of yin and yang energy in the body. Yin has to do with coolness, the moon, night, darkness, rest, sleep, and femininity. While yang has is associated with warmth (inflammation), sun, day, movement, activity, and masculinity. The relationship between yin and yang is rooted in each other and needed to have an optimal balance for healing and regular healthy function. If you're familiar with this sign: you see that yin and yang are in perfect balance and also have aspects of the opposite within each other. Eating foods that compliment one's energetics assists the body in finding harmony and unity and allows the qi, the vital life source, to bind life balance to the universe. Hot & Warm Energy Hot and warming foods move energy upwards and outwards from the core....warming the body from the inside out. They increase blood flow and circulation. Hot & warming foods move energy upwards and outwards. This energy is particularly great at improving circulation and nourishes the energy (qi, also known as the energy of everything) of the organs. Some signs that a dog has warm or hot energy are... - Seeks cool environments - Red skin & eyes - Panting at rest - Unquenchable thirst - Prone to irritation of the skin - Food sensitivities - Dry skin - Generally restless - Tips of ears are warm to touch when at rest - Suffer from allergies - Anxiety What Foods Have A Warming Energetic? - Chicken - Venison - Lamb - Mutton - Green Lipped Mussels - Goat - Kangaroo - Trout - Ostrich - Cinnamon - Turmeric - Peppercorns - Calendula - Garlic - Milk Thistle - Parsley - St. John's Worth - Oats - Sorghum - Sweet Potatoes - Ginger - Fennel - Rosemary - Soy Beans This is not a full list of all the warm and hot foods but this will give you an idea of what foods do. Did you know... that hot dogs are becoming more and more common with increased toxins, vaccines, and more! Hot & warming foods match best to cold/neutral to aid in bringing energy forces back to balance... see how all the energy ties together? Neutral Energy Neutral energy can reduce the harshness of highly cold or hot foods. It is also great for maintaining balance in the body as well! Neutral energetics is a great all-around addition for any energy type as they will not push an imbalance further out of balance. Neutral energetic beings are found to be uncommon these days but some signs that you or your dog have neutral energy are even temperament, very adaptable, and generally do not show signs of hotness or coldness. If a dog with neutral energetic show signs of imbalance (i.e allergies, yeast, slow digestion, etc) adding foods with the opposite energy (TCM Nutrition Therapy) may help keep the animal in the neutral state. But, if they are already in balance, they may benefit from eating a diet comprised of more neutral energetic foods such as beef and salmon. Another way of feeding a neutral energetic is feeding the dog on a seasonal basis which plays opposite to the weather. For example, feeding mainly hot/warm foods in the winter and cooling/neutral in the summer. What Foods Have A Neutral Energetic? - Beef - Quail - Tripe - Bison - Herring - Salmon - Mackeral - Tuna - Carrots - Cabbage - Green Beans - Pumpkin - Potatoes - Shiitake Mushrooms - Papaya - Raspberry - Pineapple - Pomegranate - Cheese - Raw Cow Milk - Goldenseal - Slippery Elm - Yarrow - Olive Leaf Cool Energy The cooling energetic moves the body's energy downwards. Cooling energy nourishes the yin and is most suitable for those suffering from excess and heat according to TCM. This means cool foods are best suited for warm or hot spirited animals. The classification of cooling energy generally comes from less motion. For example, a chicken will hold more heat (movement) than a lamb and a lamb will hold more than a cow. Land animals are usually classified as warming from their dry environment while water animals are mostly cooling. Animals with cooling energies generally are always seeking heat, which means they love to be bundled up! They also can be timid and a bit shy and become sluggish in the cooler months. What Are Some Foods That Have A Cooling Energetic? - Rabbit - Duck - Duck Eggs - Pollock - White Fish - Clams - Octopus - Broccoli - Celery - Mung Beans - Kelp - Spirulina - Dandelion Leaf - Peppermint - Wheatgrass - Buckwheat - Millet - Barley - Wheat - Watermelon - Strawberries - Salt *Not all foods on this list are suitable for feeding. This is just a compiled list of foods with a cooling energetic. How Do I Know If My Dog Is A Cool Energy? Nutrition and especially energetics are not a \"one-size fits all\" approach But, there are a few general signs that an animal is cool energy such as... - Constantly seeking warmth (sunbathing, loves to be covered in blankets, etc.) - Sluggishness in cold weather - Runny nose There is so much more to TCM and energetics thatn what I covered above! This was just a very broad introductary to dip your toe into the world of TCM. I now encourage you to go do your own indepente research over thsi fascinating topic! One of the most important things to take away from energetics is that everything is connected. Hot energy could not live without cold energy and vise versa. Mind, body, spirit, nutrition, and more are all intertwined more deeply than we can ever imagine which puts into perspective how much more we have to learn about "}
