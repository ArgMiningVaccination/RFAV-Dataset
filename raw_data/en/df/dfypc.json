At Sabino Recovery we believe that full recovery can only happen when we help our residents attend to every aspect of what it means to be human - body, mind, and spirit - a \"whole being\" approach. Our program is specifically designed to help individuals find their inner strength and purpose, and reconnect with their bodies and their health so they no longer have to depend on alcohol or drugs to function. Most importantly, we work with each individual to literally rewire the brain, resulting in new and healthy neural pathways which retrains the brain and allows for lasting recovery. \"Whole Being\" Program In addition to the clinical and psychotherapeutic modalities that we offer, our holistic addiction treatment program includes a general lifestyle reboot. This includes: - Wholefoods philosophy - Health assessment that utilizes lab testing with interpretation - Tools to address the underlying issues that contributed to substance use - Treatments such as massage and acupuncture that balance the nervous system - Opportunities for daily exercise - Connection and fun with others Naturopathic Approach Sabino Recovery utilizes both naturopathic medicine and allopathic, or Western medicine. Using nutraceuticals assists residents in healing without the use of pharmaceutical drugs. In addition, we also employ allopathic providers of psychiatric and psychological services. The two medicinal philosophies are not in conflict; but rather, work closely together to provide residents the maximum benefits of medical care. Naturopathic medicine has a lot to offer a person that is recovering from a recent addiction. Intrinsically, naturopathic medicine isn't a one size fits all model. Therefore, it is customized to what the individual needs. For instance, a person's predominant struggle may be with anxiety, insomnia or low energy. Another person may have all of these issues. The practitioner toolbox consists of specialized testing, herbal treatments, amino acid supplementation, vitamin support, and homeopathic remedies. For example: A person that is being tapered off of benzodiazepines may benefit from the supplementation of nutraceuticals that support the levels of GABA. A drug like Xanax stimulates the attachment of the neurotransmitter GABA to a GABA receptor. This is what is responsible for the anti-anxiety effect. The medication only works while it is being taken and is highly addictive. Once discontinued after regular use, people can experience anxiety like a tidal wave. Nutraceuticals that may assist with this include Valerian, Kava Kava, and the amino acid GABA. Precision Prescribing Trauma and addiction take a tremendous toll on the body. Returning your body to an optimal state of functioning requires a combination of laboratory testing and assessments, nutritional supplementation, and ongoing treatment of your current medical conditions. At Sabino Recovery we incorporate naturopathic medical practices with traditional allopathic, or Western medical approaches to providing the best opportunity for you to embrace health in your recovery. What happens in the body is connected to the mind. One cannot be engaged without the other. The Sabino Way includes naturopathic treatments and interventions, healthy food, movement and a return to fun activities. Everything is designed to not only address current symptoms but also to help the body and mind return to an optimal state of functioning. For those that are suffering from addiction, we offer a truly holistic approach to addiction treatment. Someone that has been using alcohol may benefit from extra liver support. The extent to which someone was using alcohol would determine the degree to which the liver's functioning is compromised. Often, people will have elevated liver enzymes that reflect damage of liver cells. Cirrhosis of the liver is a result of severe damage. Herbs like Milk Thistle, Burdock, and Dandelion Root enhance liver function and can help with the repair of liver damage. Nutraceuticals like choline and N-Acetyl cysteine are helpful too. People that have been using opiates may feel blunted after the discontinued use of these drugs. Mood support may include 5 Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). This is an amino acid that is a precursor to the neurotransmitter Serotonin. The neurotransmitter Dopamine is involved in the brain's reward pathways. Dopamine levels may be supported by the addition of DL-Phenylalanine. Another way to induce the body's own production of these neurotransmitters is via exercise and play. Integrative Therapies Integrative therapies are not adjunct treatment at Sabino Recovery; each is a critical part of the clinical program. Both the quantity and variety of integrative offerings allow for more individualization of the treatment plan as well as additional support for resident healing. Some examples of our Integrative offerings are: - EMDR - Equine Therapy - Time with Horses and Horse care - Massage - Acupuncture - Somatic Experiencing\u00ae - Outdoor and Adventure Therapy - Art Therapy - Yoga - Craniosacral therapy - Reiki Healthy, Delicious Food What we feed our body, feeds our soul. When we enter the world one of the first truths that we experience is the nourishment and comfort of food. It is also one of the first ways in which we experience being cared for and loved by another. With that in mind, our Chef creates healthy, satisfying comfort food from scratch using only fresh ingredients. He and his team take pride in the important part they play in each resident's recovery. In recovery, nutrition is important. Those suffering from the effects of trauma and addiction often suffer from poor nutrition by either not eating enough throughout the day or by eating foods that are nutrient poor. Unhealthy eating can exacerbate the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and healthy sleep, all of which can also put one at risk of continued substance abuse.
