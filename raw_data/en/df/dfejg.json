If the first test is positive, it indicates that the individual is infected with TB. A chest X-ray and valuation is necessary. If the individual is asymptomatic and the chest X-ray indicates no active disease, the individual can enter patient care areas. ii) Visit 2, Day 7 A second skin test is applied on individuals whose first test was negative at 7 days. iii) Visit 3, Day 9 or 10 The second test is read. A positive test 2nd test indicates TB infection in the distant past. The individual is referred for a chest X-ray and evaluation by a physician. An asymptomatic individual, whose chest X-ray indicates no active disease may enter patient care areas. The majority of significant PPD skin test reactions will remain \"positive\" for 7 days after R e t u r n t o T o p C R I T I C A L R E Q U I R E M E N T S F A Q P a g e 6 o f 9 application. Those that have diminished or disappeared by day 7 will be boosted back to positive by the 2nd skin test. Reducing the number of visits from 4 to 3 will not reduce the sensitivity of the two-step test. c) The Four Visit Approach i) Visit 1, Day 1 The PPD antigen is applied under the skin. ii) Visit 2, Day 3 The PPD test is read. If the first test is positive, it indicates that the individual is infected with TB. A chest X-ray and evaluation is necessary. If the individual is asymptomatic and the chest X-ray indicates no active disease, the individual can enter patient care areas. iii) Visit 3, Day 7 A second PPD skin test is applied to those individual in whom the PPD skin test is negative. iv) Visit 4, Day 9 The second test is read. A positive test 2nd test indicates TB infection in the distant past. The individual is referred for a chest X-ray and evaluation by a physician. An asymptomatic individual whose chest X-ray indicates no active disease may enter patient care areas. 43) What TB documentation should be submitted when I am updating my critical requirements? If you have not had a TB screening within the past 12 months, a two-step test MUST be completed for the skin test option. a) If you are within 12 months of your last TB screening, you will only need to submit: i) Documentation of a one-step TB skin test; o r ii) Documentation of a QuantiFERON- Gold \u00ae blood test; or iii) As a positive PPD responder, a TB questionnaire, completed by you and your health care provider or employee health. 44) I am a positive TB responder; how do I prove absence of tuberculosis?

Some states have additional requirements (i.e. fingerprinting) so be sure to carefully plan out your clinical placements for the academic year to reduce costs associated with multiple background checks. For instance, if you will complete clinical in Kentucky and Ohio, complete the Ohio background check instead of the general package. a) Traditional and Accelerated BSN degree students : Your clinical rotations will cycle through agencies that require background checks and drug screening throughout your tenure in the BSN program . Hence, a national & state fingerprint-based background check, healthcare sanctions check, and urine drug screening will be performed upon matriculation into the program. Subsequent retesting for the state level background check, healthcare sanctions and urine drug screening will be required each year thereafter no later than 8 weeks prior to the start of the academic year. b) RN to BSN Educational Mobility Program, Campus Based Graduate Program and Ohio Residents in the Distance Learning Graduate Program will complete a national & state fingerprint-based background check, healthcare sanctions check, and urine drug screening upon matriculation into the program. Subsequent retesting will be determined by site specific requirements. c) Out of State Residents in Distance Learning Programs will complete a national or state specific background check (dependent upon state of residency), healthcare sanctions check and urine drug screening upon matriculation into the program. Subsequent retesting will be determined by site specific requirements. d) For more information concerning background checks, please visit the CoN Student Body Blackboard organization on blackboard. 58) What drug screening needs to be completed?
