Allergic sensitivity of most people is believed to be caused by two common vaccine ingredients namely Gelatine or egg protein. The increasing number of administrations of vaccines is always associated with increased adverse reactions. In some cases, it can become serious and even fatal. In Ayurveda, Satmya is the concept where an accustomed food, medicine, or regimen will be favorable to the body and the opposite called Asatmya can cause adverse reactions. Dr. Gupta's IAFA provides safe and effective Ayurvedic treatment for allergies caused by vaccine administration. IAFA has an effective treatment protocol for various allergic reactions. Signs and Symptoms of Vaccine Allergy Adverse reactions caused by vaccine allergy can be either immediate or late and can be local. Immediate Reactions Immediate allergic reactions to vaccines are usually rare. Adverse reactions generally start within minutes after the administration of vaccination. The main symptoms include: - Skin manifestations like urticaria, swelling, itching, etc. - Respiratory manifestations like cough, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, etc. - Reduction in blood pressure - General weakness - Loss of consciousness. Mostly, testing of allergies can confirm the vaccine allergy. In general, most patients allergic to one vaccine can be given other vaccinations without problems. Late Reactions When symptoms appear some hours or days after receiving the vaccination, it is improbable to be a true vaccine allergy. Local Reactions Occasionally vaccines can result in local reactions that arise in a few hours after the administration or even the next day. The site of administration can become red, inflamed, and painful. The reaction can last several days. These do not typically represent an acute allergic reaction. Vaccines with a booster like DT (diphtheria, tetanus) are more often allied with such reactions.
