The greatest improvements were associated with higher intensity resistance and aerobic (combined) exercise over longer intervention durations. People with cancer may experience fewer benefits. This Study Summary was published on October 4, 2022. Background Energy and fatigue are intimately tied to health and quality of life. They can be influenced by emotion, cognition, and behavior, such as exercise. Drug treatments for fatigue are inconsistently effective, and while studies suggest that physical activity can be an effective non-drug treatment option, not all studies show clear positive effects. This may be attributed to a lack of a placebo group, the inclusion of mostly older adults with chronic medical conditions, and the combination of energy and fatigue into one single effect/outcome in existing studies. The study This meta-analysis involved 81 randomized controlled trials that included a total of 7,050 participants (average age of 49 years; 69% women, 31% men). The studies evaluated self-reported measures of energy, fatigue, or vitality (a composite construct of the perception of both energy and fatigue) before and after starting an exercise training routine. The routines included at least two bouts of exercise per week across more than three weeks. Control conditions involved active (e.g., balance training, stretching) or inactive (e.g., nontreatment, usual care) intervention. The researchers conducted a multivariate analysis that considered the potential effects of several moderating variables, including exercise (e.g., type, frequency, duration) and participant characteristics (e.g., age, adherence, fitness level, health status). The results Regular exercise produced a small decrease in fatigue, a small-to-medium increase in energy levels, and a moderate increase in vitality. Moderator analysis suggested that greater improvements resulted from the following: - Higher exercise intensities (for all outcomes) - A combination of resistance and aerobic exercises (for energy and vitality) - Longer durations of total exercise time and intervention period (for fatigue) The analysis also suggested that participant health status can moderate the effect of regular exercise on vitality, such that people with cancer may benefit less than other populations. People with multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia were suggested to be the most appropriate groups to benefit from an exercise intervention. The type of control condition was not a significant moderator. Most studies had a moderate risk of bias due to missing information and lack of transparency. No studies had a high risk of bias. Publication bias (i.e., publication of studies with 'positive results') was found for energy and vitality, but not fatigue. Note The constructs of fatigue, energy levels, and vitality, were measured using self-reported questionnaires, such as the Profile of Mood States for vigor and fatigue or the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 for vitality. Some factors that may have influenced the outcomes of interest, such as sleep and diet quality, adherence to the intervention, and changes in fitness, were not monitored. The decreased benefit suggested for people with cancer should be considered carefully because there were several differences in specific cancer type, progression, and stage of treatment. In addition, the results may not apply to regularly active, athletic people. The big picture A 2006 meta-analysis of 70 studies reported a small-to-medium effect of exercise on combined energy and fatigue. The results of that meta-analysis also suggested that exercise is the most effective treatment for improving fatigue, energy and vitality, above cognitive behavioral therapy or medication. [[3]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-3) However, there is reason to believe that other factors, such as psychological state and sleep quality, may contribute to exercise intervention for improvements in fatigue, energy, and vitality. Two network meta-analyses from 2021, covered in previous Examine Study Summaries, evaluated the best exercise type for quality of life and the best interventions for fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis. The studies reported that coordination and balance training, and aerobic and mind-body exercises produced the greatest improvements in [quality of life](https://examine.com/summaries/study/dG4ML1/), while balance exercises and cognitive behavioral therapy were the best interventions for [fatigue](https://examine.com/summaries/study/1rNmx1/). A 2021 meta-analysis reported that regular exercise had a moderate effect on fatigue (17 studies) and a small effect on sleep quality (12 studies) in people with fibromyalgia. Meditative exercises were the most effective for sleep. [[4]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-4) This makes sense because sleep plays an important role in recovery from exercise, [[5]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-5) and sleep disturbance or loss can decrease energy levels and the threshold at which stress is perceived. That is, the same stressor can feel more fatiguing after a bad night's sleep compared to after a good night's sleep. The psychological aspect of perception is important when measuring domains of fatigue and energy, not only because they are generally measured by self-report, but also because they may be mediated by sleep quality and its relationship with the threshold of stress perception. It has been suggested that the frequency of feelings of energy and fatigue may be more memorable than the intensity of those feelings. [[6]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-6) Thus, if someone is sleep deprived, they will likely be more receptive to stressors and this will increase the frequency and awareness of their feelings of energy and fatigue, which will likely be negative because they are sleep deprived. This is also where vitality may come into play. Vitality has been suggested to internalize a greater overall sense of psychological perception for vigor, and to span a longer timespan than energy and/or fatigue, which tend to refer to more immediate feelings. [[6]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-6) [[7]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-7) [[8]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-8) A study on vitality from 2016 even suggests there are negative associations with societal costs and positive associations with social, economic, and community participation. [[9]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-9) Regular, structured exercise may contribute beyond the act of physical exertion, especially among chronically ill and older people who may feel isolated because of their condition or age. [[10]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-10) [[11]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-11) This is speculative, however. In general, vitality can be difficult to define and thus different from other similar measures, such as well-being and quality of life. [[12]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-12) The physiological mechanisms by which regular exercise may improve fatigue, energy, and vitality are just beginning to be understood. [[13]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-13) [[14]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-14) Some studies suggest that fatigue-reducing exercise is associated with changes in immune, inflammatory, neurotrophic factor, and neurotransmitter signaling, [[15]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-15) [[16]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-16) [[17]](/research-feed/study/1rrLE1/#ref-17) but between all these factors, plus the psychological and lifestyle factors discussed above, there is plenty to unpack in this intriguing relationship.
