After seeing numerous doctors, all telling me that there was \"nothing wrong\" with me and that my symptoms were \"interesting\" I decided to seek alternative methods to heal myself, and not medicate unnecessarily. What I liked most about the office, was their compassion and their understanding of the root of my problems. They did not give me a quick band-aid solution. They reviewed my case and set out a plan for me to heal. I stuck to their plan and within a few of months I woke up one day and had forgotten that I had an issue before. The problem was solved, the pain was gone. The stresses in life will never go away, so, I still visit them for maintenance. I'm always greeted with genuine warmth and compassion and provided the highest standard of care. If ever I am in great pain, they always squeeze me in (unlike my primary care physician whom I have to contact months in advance). My only con, is that I wish I had found them years ago. "}
