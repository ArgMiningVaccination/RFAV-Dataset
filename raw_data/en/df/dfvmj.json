Because organs are invisible inside the human body, the goal of the first generation of medical devices is to visualize invisible things. For example, the lung nodule positioning and three-dimensional visualization technology can take internal slice images one by one through medical devices. As a result, the \"invisible\" human organs can \"show their original shape\", and even build a holographic digital human, providing a reference for surgical planning. The ultimate goal of Metaverse is to provide data basis for comprehensively improving human health by monitoring higher-level vital signs indicators such as human microorganism, nutrition and psychology, thus finding biological targets for health intervention.

[Data analytics for Public Health Care](/jbhi/data-analytics-for-public-health-care/) Submission Deadline: 28 Feb, 2021 Data analytics for Public Health Care has been a pressing challenge for years. Public Health Care organizations must be able to manage, analyze, and interpret data in order to identify the best ways to deliver high quality care. There are a wide range of tools for data analytics in health care, with clinical and operational applications to help organizations capture health data for advancing medical care. Health care data is collected from a variety of systems and devices, such as online patient portals, electronic medical records and health tracking devices. As a result, data exists in different formats, from clinical notes to medical images and at times, the data is unstructured. Data governance covers master data management, which ties master data in a single and reliable source of data to be used for care improvement and patient safety. Data analytics refers to analysis of the data in some way using quantitative and qualitative techniques to be able to explore for trends and patterns in the data. Health data analysts should have the advanced knowledge \"to acquire, manage, analyze, interpret, and transform data into accurate, consistent, and timely information\". This special issue aims to consolidate recent advances in data analytics for public health care, research in theory and applications. Pilot studies in analytics-enabled healthcare are especially welcome.

IoMT can help monitor, inform and notify not only care-givers, but provide healthcare providers with actual data to identify issues before they become critical or to allow for earlier invention. While IoMT offers enormous benefits, the ubiquitously connected devices also pose new challenges. On the one hand, there has been a great improvement in cyberinfrastructure in the era of Industry 4.0, which enables high-frequency long term observational medical data being collected with the help of IoMT. How to convert these data into relevant critical insights that can then be used to provide better care poses a great challenge. On the other hand, although IoMT applications can run well on exiting wireless communication technology, i.e., 4G LTE, there will be others in the future that will require single-digit milliseconds latency and massive bandwidth such as telesurgery. To tackle these challenges, integration AI and 5G into IoMT may achieve an elegant breakthrough in terms of seamless interoperability, low cost, high speed, and low latency, and increased efficiency.
