Your body needs protein to help build and repair muscle, skin, and other body tissues. Protein also helps fight infection, balance body fluids, and carry oxygen through your body. When you have a wound that's healing, think of food as medicine. Eat a balanced diet with enough calories and plenty of protein. How much protein you normally need each day depends mostly on your weight and how active you are. You may need to eat more protein to help a wound heal. Your health care provider or dietitian can advise you on the right amount of protein you need. What are high-protein foods? High-protein foods include lean meat, poultry, and fish. A serving of these foods is about 3 ounces. That's about the size and thickness of a deck of cards. Protein isn't just found in meat. You can also get plenty of protein from eggs, dairy and soy products, beans, nuts, and seeds. Dietitians of Canada recommend that adults, who have chronic wounds like pressure sores, should have 1.25-1.5 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight. | | Food | | Serving size | | Protein (g) | | Meats | | Beef, ground, extra lean | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 23 | | Pork loin, lean centre cut bone-in chop | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 20 | | Fish | | Salmon, coho, wild | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 17.5 | | Tilapia | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 19.5 | | Tuna, light, canned in oil, drained | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 22 | | Poultry | | Chicken, breast, roasted | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 23 | | Turkey, breast, roasted | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 24 | | Turkey, ground | | 2\u00bd ounces (75 g) | | 21 | | Eggs and Dairy | | Cheese, cheddar | | 1 oz (50 g) | | 11.5 | | Cheese, cottage, 2% milk fat | | 1 cup (250 mL) | | 25 | | Egg, whole | | 1 large | | 6 | | Milk, skim, 1% or 2% milk fat | | 1 cup (250 mL) | | 8.5 | | Yogurt, fruit, low-fat | | \u00be cup (175 mL) | | 7 | | Beans and Soy Products | | Baked beans with pork, canned | | \u00be cup (175 mL) | | 10 | | Black beans, canned | | \u00be cup (175 mL) | | 11.5 | | Soy beverage, original and vanilla | | 1 cup (250 mL) | | 6.5 | | Tofu | | \u00be cup (175 mL) | | 12 | | Nuts and Seeds | | Almonds, dry roasted | | \u00bc cup (60 mL) | | 7 | | Peanuts, dry roasted | | \u00bc cup (60 mL) | | 9 | | Peanut butter, smooth | | 2 Tbsp (30 mL) | | 7 | | Sunflower seeds, dry roasted | | \u00bc cup (60 mL) | | 6.5 | | Wheat germ, toasted | | \u00bc cup (60 mL) | | 9 What are some tips for getting more protein?
