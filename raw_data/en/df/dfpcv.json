Gestational diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder during pregnancy with health consequences for both lives during and after pregnancy. Studies found that many pregnant women turn to complementary and alternative medicine forhealth maintenance or symptom relief, such as herbal medicine and acupuncture from traditional Chinese medicine. With thegrowing popularity of traditional Chinese medicine, we conducted a systemic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embasedatabases on research studies that investigated traditional Chinese medicine during pregnancy. The resultant hits were further searched in relation to all diabetes mellitus. In total, we found three major herbal medicine/herbal products that were associated with glycemic control in gestational diabetes, including Zuo Gui Wan, red raspberry leaves, and Orthosiphon stamineus. Wefurther reviewed them and their relatives in relation to type 2 diabetes mellitus and found more evidence of metabolic bene ts. None of the herbal medicine and products examined reported toxicity in the experimental models. Overall, treatments ofgestational diabetes by western or alternative interventions are grossly understudied. It is critical to have a standardized protocol when evaluating e cacy of herbal medicine and produce quality results for women and their health-care providers to make informed treatment decisions. 1. Introduction Pregnancy is a unique period during a female 's life character- ized by a series of physiological and metabolic changes. The maternal metabolism starts out with early anabolic accumu- lation of adipose tissue and progresses to late-stage catabolicrelease to accommodate feto-placental needs from organo-genesis to fetal maturation and growth [1]. In the last trimes-ter, anti-insulin hormones, growth factors, and cytokinesreleased by the placenta produce an insulin resistance-likestate, which is further exacerbated for those with excessweight, increased maternal age, polycystic ovarian syndrome,and family history of diabetes [2, 3]. Health issues that ariseduring this period put both the mother and the fetus atgreater risk of complications during and after pregnancy. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most com- mon metabolic complication for pregnant women, whichpositively correlates with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)later in life [4]. In 2017, about 1 in 7 births is a ected by GDM globally [5]. The prevalence of GDM is especially highamong the Asian population [6]. In China, the most updatedresearch found that on average, 14.8% of women developGDM, and the risk increases signi cantly older overweight/obese women (30.3%) [7]. of GDM posts heavy strain on the health-care sys-tem and calls for immediate action. GDM is often diagnosed between 24- and 28-week gestation (second or third trimester of pregnancy) and shares many pathological similarities withT2DM. Glucose is the primary fuel for the fetus and placenta.Under GDM, maternal insulin resistance increases the flux of glucose to the fetal circulation and contributes to increasedfetal glucose uptake and growth [8]. During delivery, themother may experience more respiratory distress, birth inju-ries, and cardiac abnormalities as well as preterm delivery.Babies born to GDM mothers are prone to congenital abnor-malities such as macrosomia. While GDM often goes awayHindawi Journal of Diabetes Research Volume 2019, Article ID 9182595, 6 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/9182595after delivery, both the GDM mother and baby are now at an increased risk of developing T2DM later in life. Currenttreatments for GDM include diet, lifestyle intervention, andantihyperglycemic medications, and insulin is prescribedwhen the aforementioned fail to control blood glucose. Infact, insulin is one of the most commonly used prescriptionmedications reported in pregnant women between 15 and44 years of age [9]. It has been found that GDM women oninsulin have progressive increments in insulin dependence as pregnancy advances [10]. Concerns still remain about the long-term safety of such treatment for the mother andchild due to lack of quality research. A meta-analysis foundpoorly reported results and potential bias from randomizedtrials comparing treatments for GDM [11]. On the otherhand, about half of pregnant women visit complementaryand alternative medicine practitioner for pregnancy-relatedhealth conditions [12]. Women who visit their general prac-titioners and midwives more frequently are also more likelyto visit acupuncturists for conditions such as gestational dia-betes [12]. They are reportedly motivated by factors such as asense of self-determination, pursue of natural and safe child- birth and a deeply personal and positive therapeutic experi- ence [13]. Yet, there are extremely little research on bothmainstream and alternative GDM treatments, which severelylimits the ability for women and their health-care providersto make informed treatment decisions. It is also importantto note that the placenta becomes thinner as gestation pro-gresses and is permeable to certain drugs; and, the fetal liverhas limited capacity to metabolize them [14]. One study sug-gests that metformin, the most prescribed antidiabetic drug,is weakly toxic towards embryonic stem cells, and shouldbe prescribed with caution to pregnant women [15]. There-fore, it is absolutely critical to understand drug metabolism in adults as well as fetuses when treating GDM. 2. Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a popular naturo- pathic medicine that advocates the balance of two opposingyet complementary forces: Yin and Yang, and the mainte-nance of Qi (the natural flow of energy). This branch of med- icine presents a di erent point of view in understanding human physiology based on historical precedence and cumu-lative observations, which dates back to more than two mil- lennia ago. TCM puts emphasis on modulating the body 's own resistance against disorders and produces highly indi- vidualized treatment plan according to syndrome di erentia- tion. TCM practitioners long ago have referred to diabetesmellitus as the Xiao-Ke diseases (wasting and thirst) anddescribed its pathogenesis as the de ciency of Yin and stag- nation of Qi, which lead to excess heat and dryness. Symp- toms recorded in The Yellow Emperor 's Classic of Internal Medicine described diabetes mellitus as \"three excess \"and \"one loss, \"which correspond to excess in thirst, hunger and urination, and loss in weight [16]. The major organs a ected are the lung, spleen, and kidney; therefore, TCM treatmentfor diabetes mellitus centers on ways to tonify Yin andresolve heat and dryness in these organs. According toTCM, pregnancy is the union of Yin and Yang, where Yinrepresents rest, accumulation, and storage, while Yang isrequired during birth. The spleen is considered the originof fetal growth and development, and the kidneys storeessence that nourishes the fetus [17]. Both organs are impli-cated in GDM. Among the modern methods of TCM, herbal medicine is the more commonly accepted practice, and it is utilizedthroughout human history in many parts of the world. It isestimated that more than 80% of the world 's population rely on herbal medicinal products as a source of primary health-care [18]. Herbal medicine in TCM is prescribed as a care-fully selected formula of plant products, including leaves,stems, flowers, roots, and seeds, each with many active com- ponents. Nowadays, the scope of herbal medicine hasextended to include minerals and animal products. The goalis to maximize therapeutic e ects and minimize toxicity. Decoction or steeping in ceramic containers is the most com-mon form of dose preparation, which evenly draws out thetherapeutic constituents of the herbs. Though TCM, herbalmedicine prescriptions rely heavily on experience and obser-vations and research e orts have been put in to unveil the pharmacological underpinnings. A prime example is demon-strated by the discovery of artemisinin from a Chinese herbalmedicine compound, sweet wormwood ( Artemisia annua ) by the 2015 Nobel Prize winner, Youyou Tu. A Chinese phar-macologist in training, Tu 's discovery is the perfect synthesis of historical treatises of Chinese herbs and modern scienti c analysis and clinical approach. Although TCM has enormous potential, philosophical and cultural di erences and a lack of consistent and rigorous evidence-based studies still result in a general lack of accep-tance by the western medical community. Multiple studieson the safety of Chinese herbal medicine during pregnancy was also inconclusive due to poor experimental strati cations [19-21]. In this review, we aim to identify available studies that speci cally focus on herbal medicine treatment of GDM. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases using di er- ent combinations of keywords, including gestational diabe-tes, traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine,antidiabetic, and hyperglycemia. The resultant hits were thenfurther searched in relation to diabetes mellitus in general.With the growing popularity of complementary and alterna-tive medicine worldwide, it is necessary to review and revisefuture approaches. 2.1. Zuo Gui Wan (Zuo Gui Pill). Zuo Gui Wan is a Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644 A.D.) formula used to nourish Yin and tonify the kidney. The tablet form consists of a pro-prietary blend of 8 ingredients listed in Table 1. In astreptozotocin-induced rodent model of GDM, Zuo GuiWan treatment reduced fasting blood glucose, body weight,total cholesterol, and serum insulin level of mice fed on highfat and sugar diet [22]. Furthermore, the same group foundthat when the o spring of Zuo Gui Wan-treated GDM mice were fed a high fat and sugar diet, they were protected againsthigh levels of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, totalcholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein [23]. These resultssuggest a cross-generational e ect of Zuo Gui Wan on2 Journal of Diabetes ResearchGDM mother and o spring through an unknown mecha- nism. A recent study found direct bene ts of Zuo Gui Wan to fetal development and metabolism under high glucose stress when it was supplemented to cultured blastocysts[24]. Another study showed that Zuo Gui Wan facilitatedribosomal and mitochondrial functions in two-cell mouse embryonic cells during sugar metabolism, thus protecting them against cell death induced by glucose loading [25]. Arelated compound, Zuogui Jiangtang Jieyu Fang e ect [26, 27]. Other than its antidiabetic property, Zuo Gui Wan is implicated in a wide range of disordersin reproduction [28, 29], bone metabolism [30-33], theimmune system [34], and others that arise from the underly-ing diagnostic pattern according to TCM. Given its dual ben-ets for both the mother and fetus, Zuo Gui Wan may be a good therapeutic alternative or an augmentation to westernmedicine for GDM patients. 2.2. Rubus Idaeus (Red Raspberry Leaf). Rubus idaeus belongs to the Rosaceae family, which is a diverse group of flowering plants that are used by many traditional medicine practi- tioners [34]. In one case study, researchers examined the con-sumption of red raspberry leaf tea by a pregnant woman withGDM and revealed properties of glycemic control of the herb[35]. This GDM patient experienced hypoglycemia after con-sumption of two servings of raspberry leaf tea for 3 days andresulted in a reduction in insulin requirements. The causalrelationship was further supported by the patient 's self- withdrawal and reintroduction of the herb. Metabolic examsand fetal surveillance revealed no abnormalities. While this isolated study sets precedence for Rubus idaeus in lowering blood glucose in humans, other identi ed bene ts of the plant may help indirectly reduce GDM occurrence and severity. Chemical pro ling of Rubus idaeus found the highest totalphenolic and flavonoid contents in the leaves, which exhibit antioxidant activities and inhibit digestive enzymes, -glucosi- dase, producing fruit in diabetic (db/db) mice reduced proin flammatory plasma interleukin 6 and may pro- tect against diabetes-induced oxidative stress [37]. Other members of the same genus (listed in Table 2) also have documented hypoglycemic e ect. For example, in rats fed a standard diet, Rubus fruticosus extract increased lipoly- sis of adipose tissue and enhanced insulin sensitivity, whichwas more pronounced in females [38]. In diabetic ratsinduced by alloxan or eects [39, 40]. The acute toxicity test found the lethal dose 50% (oral) for the aqueous extracts to be 8.1 g/kg, whichmakes the plant safe for consumption. However, severalother studies could not nd any glycemic properties of Rubus fruticosus using in vitro glucose absorption model and in dia- betic mice [41, 42]. Preparation of the medicinal plant andthe duration of treatment may have contributed to theseinconsistencies. The Rubus plant documented in TCM isRubus chingii , which functions to tonify the kidneys and pre- serve Qi. Ellagitannins from the unripe fruits of methanolic extract of Rubus chingii fruits was found to have enhanced inhibitory activities against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a nega-tive regulator of leptin and insulin signaling pathways[44]. On the other hand, the methanolic extract of Rubus grandifolius exhibits strong inhibition of glucosidases and prevents protein glycation with no cytotoxicity towards cul-tured cells [45]. A clinical study also supported the in vivobenets of a North American relative, Rubus occidentalis , predi- abetic patients [46].Table 1: The medicinal constituents of Zuo Gui Wan.

Orthosiphon stamineus. Orthosiphon stamineus is com- monly known as the cat whisker and is the main ingredient of Java tea. In addition to its diuretic e ect, a recent review also praised the cytotoxic, diabetic rats, admin-istration of Orthosiphon stamineus stimulated glucose- induced insulin secretion, which translated to an increase inghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1, and an overall incubated with insulin release [48]. Urine metabolomics of dia- betic rats treated with aqueous extract of Orthosiphon sta- mineus showed better regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and lipid and amino acidmetabolism another study, plasma glucose dose-dependent manner in both normal anddiabetic rats [50]. The highest dose had comparable e ect as the T2DM medication, glyburide. Plasma analysis revealedreduced triglyceride and elevated HDL-cholesterol concen- tration in the extract-treated diabetic rats, indicating an improved lipid pro le [50]. Another chloroform extract from the plant also displayed antidiabetic e ect through extrapan- creatic mechanisms [51]. A developmental toxicity study wasconducted on Orthosiphon stamineus ; out of the 4 doses (250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day) tested, there was no clinicalsigns of maternal toxicity, weight gain, and prenatal growthretardation. The highest dose did increase anogenital dis-tance due to possible androgenic e ect [52]. 3. Concluding Remarks In this review, we sample the web for TCM and herbalmedicine speci cally aimed at treating GDM. Zuo Gui Wan, red raspberry tea, and Orthosiphon stamineus dis- played promising e ect in lowering glucose and alleviating the associated pathophysiology of GDM with minimum tox-icity to the mother and fetus. These ndings hold certain inspiration and clinical signi cance for the research and treatment of GDM. There are other herbal formulae used inChinese clinics that aim to resolve speci c pathology in GDM such as Qi de ciency and weakness in the spleen and stomach or as adjunctive therapy to insulin. For instance, Qiwei Baizhu powder has demonstrated e ectiveness against GDM of spleen de ciency type and decreased postprandial blood glucose [53]. Huang Qi (Astragalus), another com- monly used TCM herb, has shown to reduce blood lipidsand enhance the antioxidative activity in conjunction withinsulin treatment [54]. Further experimental studies wouldhelp strengthen these observations. In general, treatmentsfor GDM by mainstream or alternative interventions aregrossly understudied. Given the biggest concern for pregnantmothers is the safety of therapies, there has been no data onthe long-term risk assessment of various antiglycemic formu- lations and strengths in human pregnancy. Comparison of the eectiveness between insulin and other interventions was also inconclusive due to poorly reported evidence [55].As TCM gains global popularity and new medicinal productsare constantly introduced into the market, public health con-cerns surrounding their safety are also increasingly recog-nized. While few complications have been reported fromthe use of herbal products as many constituents are regularlyconsumed, the holistic approach of herbal formula may causepossible interference with existing prescription or unknownand unwanted side e ects with serious consequences. A few reviews have attempted to quantify the bene ts of other TCM practices such as acupuncture and Qi Gong on diabe- tes. A randomized trial that looked at pregnancy outcomes of women with or without acupuncture treatment duringtheir IVF treatment did not nd any signi cant di erence between occurrence of gestational diabetes and hypertensivedisorder, or any of the parameter measured [56]. In a recentreview examining the safety and e ectiveness of acupuncture for T2DM, reviewers again did not nd convincing evidence but indicated that acupuncture may be recommended topatients as a supplementary treatment [57]. Another reviewfound that practice of Qi Gong produced an overall positiveoutlook on T2DM, but there was a large variation in stylesand de nitions of qigong of the studies reviewed [58]. In con- clusion, the lack of knowledge and inconsistent data are thebiggest hurdles in understanding the e cacy of TCM in a variety of disorders. Overall, it is hard to conclude a de nitive benet of TCM practice for GDM per se based on lack of direct studies. Conflicts of Interest All authors declare no con flict of interest. References [1] K.
