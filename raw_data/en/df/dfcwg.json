CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014 IIIEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014 III This time of year always initiates some degree of self-reflection regarding the year gone by. Needless to say, time has flown by once again in 2014. I am fortunate to be blessed with a wonderful cast of characters in both my personal and professional life, and am forever grateful to each of those individuals. Numerous undertakings and objectives were accomplished by AAEP this year in large part due to the multitude of dedicated AAEP member volunteers and the entire staff of the AAEP. The commitment and service of AAEP member volunteers is one of the many things that make me incredibly proud to be a member of this organization. To all of the AAEP volunteer members in 2014: Thank you! It became quite evident in my travels this past year that the AAEP is, unequivocally, the most trusted and respected voice regarding issues pertaining to equine health and welfare. In addition, many equine industry stakeholders view the AAEP as the primary resource on issues pertaining to equine veterinary medicine. A few examples:We are the accepted resource for the AVMA regarding any equine-related issues. AAEP successfully worked with the AVMA this year on several legislative actions, including the Prevent All Soring Tactics Act and passage of the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act. In June, several AAEP officers attended the American Horse Council's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., where, in addition to presenting on the program, we visited with many senators and representatives on behalf of the horse and equine veterinary medicine. Many rela-tionships have been developed over the years, and some new relationships were forged this year. Our voice in Washington is not lost in the noise. The National Equine Health Plan, an industry-funded disease outbreak monitoring system and an AAEP initiative, is scheduled to launch in 2015. This accomplish-ment is certain to advance the monitoring of disease outbreaks, thereby benefitting our patients and our clients. Many of the details of the program were discussed at the British Equine Veterinary Association meeting, and recently I visited with a member of the executive committee of the Federation of European Equine Veterinary Associations who is extremely interested in implementing a similar monitoring system in Europe. AAEP representatives attended numerous industry-spon- sored stakeholder conferences and meetings this year. Many industry stakeholders view the AAEP as their primary resource in all matters pertaining to equine welfare and equine veterinary medicine, and our volunteer members are continually invited ambassadors. Furthermore, regardless of discipline, many AAEP volunteers serve on numerous industry committees on behalf of the AAEP and, more importantly, the horse. In racing, AAEP has been actively involved on numerous fronts. The AAEP Racing Committee was instrumental in developing and modifying the National Uniform Medication Program, and we continue to be actively engaged in this endeavor. We are currently working with the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium to help develop language concerning the ethical use of legitimate compounded medication at the racetrack. The RMTC is composed of many AAEP members whose representation and voice is respected by the industry. AAEP members also are invited guests at the annual Jockey Club Round Table Conference, whereby our members have an additional voice and representation in the racing industry. These are only a fraction of the objectives and accomplish- ments of AAEP this year. Moving forward, as an associa-tion, we must continue to raise the standard in equine veterinary medicine for the benefit of our patients, our clients and the equine industry. We must continue to focus on providing state-of-the-art CE for our members. We must continue to promote and practice the highest ethical standards and collegiality if we are to remain a trusted and respected resource on behalf of the horse. We must improve the image of the veterinarian in order to be considered as the expert on equine health and welfare. We must perform these tasks not only individually but collec-tively, simply because it is the right thing to do, and it is what is best for the horse. In closing, it has been a tremendous honor and a privilege to serve as your president this year. I am forever indebted to my family, friends, the AAEP staff and all of our member volunteers for their commitment and dedication on behalf of the AAEP. Furthermore, I am genuinely thankful and appreciative to the members of my practice who have endured sacrifice so that I may serve on behalf of the AAEP. I wish each and every one of you continued happiness and success in the future. Rest assured, you are all a part of a tremendous group and an incredible family\u2014the AAEP. From the President's Desk: Strengthening our leadership for the horse and profession by Jeff Blea, DVM Dr. Jeff BleaIV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014 Some of the more difficult and conten- tious ethical seas to navigate in equine practice involve the various conflicts of interest and competing interests that equine practitioners regularly encounter. For example, the ethical charge \"put the horse first\" may sometimes come into conflict with an owner or trainer's desire to win a championship or race. In such cases, the ethical concerns on the part of the veterinarian about the potential for increased chance of injury for horse and rider may not be shared by other parties. The underlying basis for such conflicts is usually self- interest; that is, whether a person acts in a way that is personally beneficial above all other considerations. A dominant view in psychology and in much of Western thought is that human beings always act from self-inter- est. However that is true, then it becomes difficult to even discuss ethics because ethics assumes that everyone else's interests must be taken into account. Fundamentally, attempts to eliminate or reduce the influence of self-inter-est are the distinguishing feature of a true profession that sets it apart from other occupations. 1 Indeed, professions that are perceived as highly ethical and acting mostly in the interest of others, such as nursing, medicine, or teaching, routinely rate high in surveys of professional esteem; professions with a low perception of their ethical conduct that are perceived as being in it for themselves, such as politicians, car salespeople, or attorneys, routinely are rated unfavorably in such surveys. 2 Most conflicts arise between what is in the self-interest of the veterinarian, what is best for the horse or what is in the self-interest of other parties in the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. Whatever else veterinary medicine may be, it is also a business by which veterinarians support themselves and their families. One cannot practice veterinary medicine if one cannot also make a living doing it. Arrangements in equine practice commonly have the potential to put the veterinarian's primary ethical interest in promoting the best interests of the horse at odds with his or her own financial self-inter-est. A single-minded interest in the bottom line\u2014the financial measure by which a business is generally deemed successful\u2014runs the risk of the veterinarian's financial needs or desires being put above obligations to the horse, the horse owner or society. However, business success is not\u2014or at least should not be\u2014the sole arbiter of success in a veterinary practice. Financial success is no more the purpose of a veterinary business than getting enough to eat is the purpose of life. While eating is necessary to live, one might hope that the living itself presents greater challenges, opportuni-ties and rewards beyond simply finding enough to eat; furthermore, eating to excess simply isn't healthy. In some instances, potential conflicts of interest are almost inherent in veterinary practice. For example, unlike physicians, most veterinarians dispense medications to their clients on behalf of the horse. While the potential for a conflict of interest in such circumstances certainly exists, it is not necessarily unethical as long as one keeps the needs of the horse foremost. The American Medical Association Code of Ethics notes that \"Physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices provided such dispensing primarily benefits the patients.\" 3 The fact is that there are times when acting ethically may carry a cost. While doing the right thing and acting fairly and ethically is at the foundation of building a profession-al reputation, there are also times when telling the truth or refusing to perform a procedure may result in the loss of the client and may not be in a veterinarian's immediate financial self-interest. If it were easy to be ethical, there would be no need for discussions on ethics. Ultimately, however, ethical conduct helps provide the clearest path to resolving the various conflicts and competing interests in equine practice. While acting ethically may not always be in the best interest of the bottom line, it is always in the best interest of the veterinary professional, the reputation of the individual and the veterinary profession as a whole.

Twenty-six percent of horse owners use a non-veterinarian for equine dental care, according to AAEP market research. Why? Some owners perceive lay dentists who have attended an equine dentistry certification course as being a specialist, thus more qualified to care for their horse's mouth. Others say their primary equine veterinarian does not offer dental care and they must look elsewhere for this service.Equine dentistry is an integral branch of professional equine veterinary practice. A licensed veterinarian is the most educated, accountable and trained individual to provide equine dental care.If your clients do not use your practice for equine dental care, it is likely because of one of three reasons:1. A lay provider has positioned himself or herself as a more qualified provider of care; 2. Your practice does not currently offer this service and your clients must find other providers; or3. You offer dental services but your clients don't know it. Each scenario requires a different solution. If you desire to grow your dental practice, we can offer assistance through client education, training and communication. Visit touch.aaep.org for a variety of resources to help you promote dental services to your clients.

They were worried that clients would seek to become friends with them on Facebook. We solved this problem by creating a Facebook page for each of our veterinarians, which is set up just like any other business page. Now when our veterinarians comment, they are doing so from their business page. It looks more profes-sional and provides a barrier from their personal page. Facebook \"To Do\" For You: Have your Facebook administrator create a Facebook page for each of your veterinarians. Title the page simply with the name of the veterinarian and their veterinary credential (DVM or VMD).Social Media Practice Tip: Separate professional and personal lives with Facebook pages for veterinarians By Mike Pownall, DVMFor more information, visit www.aaep.org.The AAEP offers year-round opportunities to broaden your professional circle and expand your clinical knowledge in practice areas most important to you.

SmartPak.com/ColiCareDVMHighlights of recent clinically relevant papers Airborne particles and tracheal mucus In this recent article, Melissa Millerick-May and colleagues in the USA examine the association between tracheal mucusand exposure to airborne particulates at an AmericanThoroughbred racetrack . Personal monitors which detected the particle concentrations in horses' breathing zones were used todetermine if there was an association between an individual'sexposure to airborne particles and tracheal mucusaccumulation. The benefits of using personal monitors ratherthan fixed environmental monitors are that the particlesdispersed as a result of the horse's activity will be reflected inthe breathing zone, but may not be increased in the regionof the monitor. A total of 53 cases and 60 controls were used inthe study, with controls matched on the presence or absenceof clinically significant tracheal mucus. Endoscopicexamination and tracheal lavage was performed and eachhorse also had an average of 17.5 h of recording time ofbreathing zone particle concentration. Airborne particleexposure was found to be significantly higher in casescompared with controls. The absolute neutrophil counts fromtracheal lavage fluid were significantly higher in casescompared with controls. The neutrophil count was found tobe significantly associated with the concentration of airparticles. Tracheal mucus is significantly associated with the airborne particulates within an individual horse's breathing zone,therefore efforts to reduce tracheal mucus should focus on anindividual's particle exposure. Horse-owners' understanding of equine colic In this recent article, Claire Scantlebury and colleagues at theUniversity of Liverpool, UK, investigated horse-owners'understanding and desision making in response to colic . Horse-owners/carers play an important role in identifying colic and calling for veterinary intervention. Understandingowners' thoughts and reactions relating to colic could helpveterinary surgeons when giving advice about colic which, inturn, could improve colic outcomes. In this study in-depth data was obtained from interviews with 15 owners. A theoretical conceptual model wasdeveloped and described how horse-owners recognised,assessed and responded to colic. and see', 'lay response to colic weremoderated by owners' experience of colic and interpretationof the severity of colic signs. A postal questionnaire gathereddata from 673 horse-owners from the North-West of the UK. Themajority of respondents were female. Cluster analysis revealed5 meaningful groups of horse-owners based upon assessmentof questionnaire items on the human-horse relationship. Thesegroups included 2 professional and 3 amateur ownertypologies. Differences in the responses to some questionnaireitems were found between the identified groups. The owner responses in this study describe lay understanding and management of colic amonghorseowners from the North-West of the UK. This informationmay help to tailor existing programmes designed to educateowners about colic management strategies, and may inform veterinarians' interactions with horse-owners. Bacterial meningitis after sinus surgery In this case series, Fabienne Bach and colleagues in Europereport meningoencephalitis as a complication after paranasalsinus surgery in 5 horses . Medical records of 5 horses that developed neurological signs after sinus surgery were reviewed to identify potential riskfactors, cause(s), or common pathways for infection. Theunderlying diseases in these horses were primary andsecondary sinusitis caused by apical dental infection, sinus cystor masses in the ethmoturbinate region. All horses were treatedusing conventional surgical approaches and aftercareincluding repeated sinus lavage. Despite antimicrobialtherapy, 4 horses had undulating pyrexia post operatively. Allhorses developed neurological signs which eventually becameunresponsive to treatment. Suppurative meningoencephalitiswas diagnosed macro- and/or microscopically at post mortem examination in all horses. The authors concluded that meningitisis a rare but fatal complication after sinus surgery in horses. Masses in equine third eyelids In this retrospective case series Nicole Scherrer and colleaguesin the USA aimed to determine the histological findingsassociated with masses in the nictitating membranes (thirdeyelids) of horses and to identify prognostic factors associatedwith recurrence and the outcome . Medical records of horses with partial or complete excision of a third eyelid and submission for histological evaluation overa 14-year period were reviewed. Follow-up information for atleast one year after surgery was available for the 50 horseschosen for inclusion in this study. Case details and treatmentinformation was obtained from the medical records andhistopathology reports were examined to determine surgicalmargins and vascular invasion. Data were analysed todetermine the association between recurrence and type ofexcision (partial or complete), surgical margins, vascularinvasion, and use of chemotherapy, also the associationbetween partial excision of a third eyelid prior to referral andoutcome. Squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant tumour type of the third eyelid. There was recurrence in 20% of horsesat a mean of 2.25 years and median of 1.5 years after excision.Partial excision prior to referral was associated with outcome.In horses with masses in a third eyelid, recurrence and mortalityrates were high, which suggested that long-term monitoring isimportant for all patients in which partial or complete thirdeyelid excision is performed. Primary assessment of equine colic In this study, Kyra Jennings and colleagues at the University ofNottingham, UK, describe the presentation, diagnosticapproach and treatment at the primary assessment of 120horses with large colon impactions . One hundred and twenty horses with a diagnosis of primary large colon impaction and positive findings on rectalexamination at primary assessment over a 12-month period617 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014were included in this study. Data including history, signalment,clinical and diagnostic findings, treatment on primaryassessment and final case outcome were collected fromveterinary practitioners. Case outcomes were categorised into3 groups: simple medical (resolved with single treatment),complicated medical (resolved with multiple medicaltreatments) and critical (required surgery, were subjected toeuthanasia or died) and this data was analysed to comparebetween different outcome categories. Over half of cases were categorised as simple medical, with more than one-third complicated medical, and 9% ascritical. Most cases occurred during the winter. A recentchange in management was reported in 59% of cases, 43%were not ridden and 12.5% had a recent or currentmusculoskeletal injury. Mean heart rate was 43 beats/min(range 26-88) and most cases showed mild signs of pain andreduced gut sounds. Heart rate was significantly increasedand gut sounds significantly decreased in critical comparedwith simple medical cases. Fifty different treatmentcombinations were used, with NSAIDs and oral fluids beingadministered most often. The authors concluded that large colon impactions typically presented with mild signs of colic, with heart rate andgut sounds the most useful parameters to distinguish betweensimple and critical cases at the primary assessment. Thefindings of seasonal incidence and associated managementfactors in this study are consistent with other studies. Veterinarypractitioners currently use a wide range of different treatmentcombinations for large colon impactions. Gene expression in laminitis In this recently published study, Britta Leise and colleagues inthe USA used laser capture microdissection to assess equinelamellar basal epithelial cell signalling in the early stages oflaminitis . Laser capture microdissection allows specific cells to be dissected from a tissue sample under microscopic guidance.This study utilised this technology to allow a highly purifiedpopulation of laminar basal epithelial cells to be collectedfrom lamellar biopsies in a carbohydrate (CHO) inducedlaminitis model. Eight horses were subjected to carbohydrateoverload to induce laminitis. Lamellar biopsies were taken fromthe left forefoot prior to administration of carbohydrates, to actas a control group. Further lamellar biopsies were taken fromthe other feet at the onset of fever (or 24 h post CHOadministration) and the onset of Obel grade 1 lameness (or 48 h post CHO administration). Laser capture microdissectionwas then used to isolate laminar basal epithelial cells, RNAsequencing and profiling then allowed the difference inlamellar gene expression profiles to be compared before,during and after the onset of laminitis. Forty genes wereexpressed differently (22 up-regulated, 18 down-regulated) atthe time of development of laminitis, compared with before.At the time of development of Obel grade 1 lameness 107genes were expressed differently, compared with before CHO administration. Genes related to the inflammatory responseand extracellular matrix regulation were significantly altered atthe time of laminitis development, and onset of clinical signs. Altered gene expression in lamellar basal epithelial cells during the development and onset of laminitis shows that thiscell is an active participant in the structural failure of lamellaeduring clinical laminitis. Headshaking after paranasal sinus surgery William Gilsenan and colleagues the USA have recentlyreported headshaking and presumptive trigeminal neuritis as apotential complication after paranasal sinus surgery in horses . In this retrospective case series, the authors reviewed the medical records of 5 horses that had developed headshakingwithin 45 days of paranasal sinus surgery. Resolution occurred after treatment in 2 of these horses and one horse was subjected to euthanasia because clinicalsigns associated with headshaking could not be controlled.Headshaking persisted in the other 2 horses but was eitheradequately controlled with analgesics or was consideredinfrequent and transient enough to not warrant therapeuticintervention. Only 2 of 5 horses returned to full work afterdevelopment of headshaking. The authors concluded that headshaking associated with presumptive trigeminal neuritis is a possible career-ending orfatal complication of paranasal sinus surgery in horses. S.

Higgins Loomis Basin Equine Medical Center; andVM: Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of V eterinary Medicine, University of California Davis, California, miniature horse gelding was evaluated for signs of colic and decreased faecal production. Initial clinicalpathology showed severe hypoproteinaemia with an albuminconcentration <10 g/l. Abdominal ultrasound identified multiple loops of small intestine with significantly increasedwall thickness. Diagnosis of equine proliferative enteropathywas based on clinical and laboratory findings, as well as apositive faecal polymerase chain reaction and the clinical and Introduction Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) Gebhart 2000). Intracytoplasmic infection leads to expansion and elongation of intestinal cryptcells, an increase in the percentage of mitotic cells, and ilealhyperplasia. However, the microbe can affect other parts ofthe small intestine and infection of the large intestine as hasbeen described in pigs (Lawson and Gebhart 2000; Smith andLawson 2001; Jensen et al . 2006). Depressed immune function has also been described with infection in pigs (MacIntyre et al . 2003). Malabsorption occurs secondary to the abnormal brushborder, and the microorganism is shed in the faeces wheninfected epithelial cells pass through the intestinal lumen(Lawson and Gebhart 2000; Smith and Lawson 2001). Equine proliferative enteropathy has been reported since 1982 as sporadic, isolated cases in young horses in the USA,Canada, South Africa, Europe, Japan and Australia, primarilyin weanling foals aged up to 13 months McClintock 2008; Shimizu et al . 2010). This report documents a case of EPE in a mature miniature horse gelding. Clinical signs associated withEPE infection have not been previously reported in horses ofthis age. Case history A 75 kg, 3.5-year-old miniature horse gelding presented to theLoomis Basin Equine Medical Center with a history of lethargy,partial anorexia, decreased faecal production, and mild signsof colic of approximately 5 days' duration. The horse hadreceived annual vaccinations for tetanus, West Nile virus,rabies, eastern and western encephalitis, and bi-annualvaccination for influenza/rhinopneumonitis. He wasdewormed every other month most recently with pyrantel pamoate (13.2 mg/kg bwt)approximately 1 month prior to presentation. geldingreceived 3 doses of flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg bwt) per os at 24 h intervals on the farm administered by the farmmanager prior to presentation, with the most recent dose12 h prior to presentation. There was little improvement inclinical signs. At the time of presentation, the gelding waspassing faeces infrequently (1-2 piles/day), but of normalconsistency. Clinical findings Physical examination revealed a lethargic, but responsivehorse, with an overall unthrifty appearance and dull hair coat.Heart rate was 60 beats/min, respiratory rate was 16breaths/min and rectal temperature was 35.5\u00b0C. Mucousmembranes were pink and tacky, with a abdominal distension was noted. Distalextremities were cool to the touch. Blood work at admission revealed several abnormalities. Venous blood gas analysis revealed a severe metabolicacidosis 7.2. A serum chemistry profile revealed increased creatine kinase (849 u/l) and blood urea nitrogen (410 mg/l),and decreased total calcium (77 mg/l). A severehypoproteinaemia (total protein concentration of 21 g/l) withan albumin of <10 g/l was noted. Although triglycerides were not measured, a low lipaemic index was found on a serumchemistry analysis and gross lipaemia was not present in theblood samples. A complete blood count showed was increased at 51.4%. A urinalysis from a free catch sample revealed urine specific gravity of 1.024. The sample however was obtained72 h after presentation and after initiation of intravenous fluidtherapy. Abdominal ultrasonography performed at admissionrevealed several diffusely thickened loops of fluid filled smallintestines (intestinal wall thickness measured >4.0 mm). Abdominal radiographs were unremarkable. A faecal flotation test was negative. Faecal samples were negative forSalmonella and Neorickettsia risticii on VETERINARY EDUCATION December 2014Faecal PCR analysis for L. intracellularis was positive. A positive serum antibody titre ( >1:240) to L. monolayer antigen assay. Faecal and serum samples were obtained from 14 other horses on the farm, including the 7 in direct contact with thehorse described in this report. Nine of these horses had a serumtitre/H113501:60 and 4 had a titre >1:240. Serum total protein was measured in 14 horses on the farm, with a range of 55-71 g/land a median of 62.5 g/l. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) forL. intracellularis was performed on faecal samples from 3 horses on the farm that had a negative titre, with negativeresults on PCR as well . Based on the clinical signs, marked panhypoproteinaemia, abdominal ultrasound findings, faecal PCR and serologyresults, a presumptive diagnosis of EPE was made. Treatment/outcome Initial treatment consisted of intravenous fluid therapy (acombination of crystalloid and colloid bwt) were administered in addition toa (sterile 1% dextrose,40 mEq/l potassium chloride, and 140 mEq/l of 1.25 ml/kg bwt/h. Concentrations ofelectrolytes in the intravenous fluids were days of hospitalisation as the metabolic acidosis wasgradually gelding developed a persistenthypoglycaemia during hospitalisation (with glucoseconcentration as low as 2.3 mmol/l), and partial parenteralnutrition (PPN) was administered. The initial PPN solutioncontained 50% dextrose and 10% amino acids of equalvolumes. Rate of administration was gradually increased overa 24 h period, beginning with a rate of 0.25 ml/kg bwt/h andpeaking at 1 ml/kg bwt/h. As the gelding's ability to regulateglucose improved, the rate of PPN administration was taperedover 18 h and discontinued prior to discharge from thehospital. Additional treatments included antimicrobial therapy (oxytetracycline gastroprotection (omeprazole4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) due to anorexia and nonsteroidal administration. A 10 mg/kg bwt dose of fenbendazole as dexamethasone sodium were administered prior to identificationofL. intracellularis . A single dose of vitamin B complex (2.5 ml i.m.) was also administered. The gelding received a total of 8 doses of oxytetracycline (4 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h). After the first 3 doses, the horse wasswitched to doxycycline (10 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h). After 48 h of doxycycline, the oxytetracyline was resumed (4 mg/kgbwt i.v. q. 24 h) due to a marked decrease in appetite whilethe patient was receiving the doxycycline. Due to thenephrotoxic effects of oxytetracycline, serum creatinineconcentration was monitored during hospitalisation andremained within the normal range. Although the gelding did not display overt signs of colic during hospitalisation, a decrease in faecal output was noted.On the third and fifth days of hospitalisation, a nasogastrictube was passed, and water and mineral oil wereadministered, resulting in improved faecal output. During thistime, increased rectal temperatures up to 39.4\u00b0C were noted over a 24 h period, but resolved without a change in treatmentregimen. Unlike many horses with L. intracellularis described in the literature, the gelding did not develop diarrhoea duringhospitalisation (Frank Frazer 2008; Wong et al . 2009). After initial fluid resuscitation, the horse developed a moderate amount ofventral oedema, which has been previously reportedsecondary to infection with L. intracellularis , as well as other protein losing enteropathies al . 2000; Sampieri et al . 2006; Frazer 2008). The gelding's appetite, comfort, and attitude gradually improved, and the horse was discharged following 10 days ofhospitalisation with the recommendation of continuedadministration of omeprazole (4 mg/kg bwt, per os q. 24 h) for 7 days and flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) for 3 days. It was also recommended to schedule anappointment 3-5 days following discharge to re-evaluateclinical pathologic data, specifically the serum total proteinconcentration. At the time of discharge, the gelding's totalprotein concentration had increased to 38 g/l. On follow-up 9months after discharge, the gelding was reported to havereturned to his previous activity level. Discussion Previous cases of EPE have been reported in horses agedbetween 3 and 8 months (Lavoie et al . . 2009; Shimizu et al . 2010). Although the disease has previously not been reported in adult horses, mature horses from affectedbreeding farms have been found to be seropositive (Pusterlaet al . 2009a). The gelding described in this case report is unique as the horse is older than any of the other reportedcases. Therefore, EPE should be considered as a differentialdiagnosis in adult horses with history and clinical signs, as wellas laboratory values consistent with EPE. The source of L. intracellularis infection in this horse is undetermined. Lawsonia intracellularis is believed to be transmitted through ingestion of feed or water contaminated by faecesinfected by the microorganism (Lawson and Gebhart 2000;Lavoie and Drolet 2007). The gelding in this case report washoused with 7 miniature horses (including 6 mature horses andone weanling) for the several months preceding presentationto the veterinary hospital. No other horses on the farm havedisplayed clinical signs consistent with L. intracellularis since that time. Subsequent faecal samples from the horse in thiscase report have been PCR negative. The miniature horsefarm was connected to a pig and cattle farm on the adjacentproperty by a small pond. Although geographically variable,up to 93.7% of pig farms are endemic for L. intracellularis , but it is unknown whether this is the case for the neighbouring farm(Stege et al . 2000; Marsteller et al . 2003). It is unknown what factors predisposed a mature horse to develop clinical signs ofL. intracellularis in this case. Unfortunately, the immune function was not further tested in this case. Fever has been identified as a clinical feature of horses with Lawsonia infection in other studies (Lavoie et al . 2000; Bihr 2003; Frazer 2008). Secondary infections (pneumonia, intestinalparasitism) have been described in these studies and may bethe source of the fevers. The fever present in the horsedescribed in this report may have been due to a secondary \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd620 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014infection that was not identified but that resolved with treatment. Although an oral glucose absorption test was not performed on the gelding in this case report, it has beenreported in foals with L. intracellularis (Wong et al . 2009). While receiving enteral nutrition as well as intravenous dextrosesolution during hospitalisation, the patient's glucosedecreased to as low as 2.3 mmol/l. PPN was instituted, and thepatient remained on decreasing amounts of PPN until the timeof discharge. The profound hypoproteinaemia seen in this case and characteristic of EPE can be attributed to inflammationleading to malabsorption and increased capillarypermeability, resulting in loss of protein into the intestinal lumen(Feary and Hassel 2006; Smith 2009). EPE is characterised bysignificant proliferation of epithelium in the villous atrophy 2001). The severe metabolic derangements notedat presentation can be explained by the likely chronicity of thegastrointestinal disease process (Feary and Hassel 2006). It is stillunclear why specific individuals develop clinical diseaseassociated with EPE, while others are seropositive or faecalshedders with no overt clinical signs. Previous reports of EPEhave been in young horses, most often recently stressed byweaning (Frank et al . 1998; Lavoie . 2007; Frazer 2008). The miniature horse gelding in this case report had encountered no changes inmanagement, overt illness, or 'stressful events' over the 6month period preceding presentation. Studies are currentlybeing performed to develop an L. intracellularis vaccine in order to protect susceptible animals (Pusterla et al . 2009b). Future research to determine whether a genetic predispositionto development of disease exists may be informative. In conclusion, L. intracellularis infection should be included as a differential diagnosis in mature horses with protein losingenteropathy of small intestinal origin.

In the ensuing 18 years, there were only 3 additionalreports of EPE, all of which were from the USA. These cases hadall been fatal even when intensive therapy was administered.In 2000, the first outbreak of EPE was reported in a herd ofhorses in Quebec, Canada and effective antimicrobialtherapy was described (Lavoie et al . 2000). Since then, it has emerged as a common disease of foals worldwide. A PubMedsearch identified more than 40 publications related to EPEsince 2000, including 23 publications alone from 2010 to 2014. Equine proliferative enteropathy obligate intracellular bacterium growing in vitro only in specific cell lines. Infection by this bacterium is most prevalent in pigs, but a wide range ofanimal species, including wildlife and nonhuman primates,may also be affected. To date, the disease has not beenshown to occur in man, and is therefore not considered as azoonosis. Equine proliferative enteropathy is characterised as a protein-losing enteropathy associated with variableclinical signs including growth retardation, lethargy,subcutaneous oedema, fever, colic and diarrhoea, mainly infoals aged 4-7 months. Subclinical infections also occur.Faecal-oral transmission has been demonstrated in foals(Vannucci et al . 2012; Sampieri et al . 2013), as in other species. While the disease was initially believed to be transmitted tofoals from pigs, it is now recognised that wildlife is more likely tobe implicated. Furthermore, recent genotypic andtransmission studies suggest that L. intracellulari s isolated from foals is more similar to strains found in rabbits and other nonpigspecies than to pigs (Vannucci et al . 2012, 2013; Sampieri et al . 2013). Once present in the herd, infected foals probablyamplify and transmit the infection while mares may act aschronic reservoirs, but this remains to be proven. Diagnosis of EPE is based on the presence of the clinical signs described above in a weanling foal in combinationwith increased thickness of the small intestinal wall onultrasonographic examination, and hypoproteinaemia.Positive serology and PCR analysis of the faeces is supportiveof the diagnosis. The exclusion of other common conditions offoals that may be associated with these unspecific findings isalso important. At necropsy, thickening of the jejunal or ileal mucosa creating an irregular and corrugated appearance ischaracteristic. Histological examination reveals severehyperplasia of the crypt epithelium of the small intestine withthe presence of curved, intracellular bacteria in the apicalcytoplasm of these enterocytes. A definitive diagnosis requiresdemonstration of the presence of the bacteria employingsilver stains or, ideally, immunostaining techniques. This is clearlynot practical in a live foal as it requires a full-thickness smallintestinal biopsy performed during laparotomy. Duodenal biopsies are unlikely to be diagnostic, as this rostral section ofthe small intestine is rarely affected. Erythromycin alone or combined with rifampin was the first treatment reported to the efficaciousness at controllingthe disease (Lavoie et al . 2000). Tetracycline (Sampieri et al . 2006) was also subsequently reported to be effective. Whiletheir relative potency has not been evaluated, mostuncomplicated cases will survive the infection if treated withthese antimicrobials. Given the localisation of the lesions, theoral route of administration is most likely to achieve the highestdrug concentrations within the small intestinal mucosa, and isthe preferred route of administration. Death may occur after a few days of onset of clinical signs, although a chronic presentation is more common with EPE.Severe necrotising enteritis leading to rapid death has alsorecently been reported (Page et al . 2012; Arroyo et al . 2013). This presentation resembles porcine haemorrhagic enteritis, anacute form of the disease. Whether this severe syndrome iscaused by a different bacterial strain, or by yet unidentifiedpredisposing factors is unknown. Also, as only one of thereported cases of necrotising enteritis had been treated witherythromycin, it would be of interest to determine the efficacyof this drug in these cases. Recently, the intrarectaladministration of a commercial live porcine vaccine wasshown to be safe (Nogradi et al . 2012) and to offer protection against a challenge with virulent L. intracellularis (Pusterla et al . 2012). Vaccination should be considered in a herd where theinfection is endemic, although the extralabel use of thevaccine should be taken into account when considering thisapproach. One of the key questions related to EPE is whether mature horses also develop the disease. A 26-month-oldThoroughbred colt has been reported to be affected withboth L. intracellularis and Rhodococcus equi infections (Shimizu et al . 2010). The concurrent infection by R. equi suggests that the colt was immunodeficient as this bacteriararely causes infections in this age group. In this issue of thejournal, a 3.5-year-old miniature horse gelding with EPE isdescribed. This horse has no apparent concurrent diseasesuggesting immunosuppression, and is, to my knowledge, theoldest reported equine case (Mayer et al . 2014). Should EPE then be included in the differential diagnosis of adult horses with protein losing enteropathy and be treatedaccordingly? These 2 cases indicate that the condition is notlimited to weanlings and yearlings, and that young adults maybe affected. How frequent the condition is and whether olderhorses would also be affected remain to be determined. Untilthen, more common causes of protein-losing enteropathyshould first be investigated and ruled out. The diagnosis of EPEis also difficult to confirm, as surgically obtained full-thicknessintestinal biopsies are rarely indicated because of its invasive622 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014nature, and positive serology would not be diagnostic as adult horses are routinely exposed to L. intracellularis without clinical evidence of infection (Pusterla et al . 2009). However, more is to come, as we are only beginning to understand EPE and itsimpact on the equine industry. Author's declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

A slowly expanding, firm, nonpainful masswas noted at the left temporomandibular joint. Radiographicexamination revealed extensive osteoarthritic changes of thisjoint. Due to the age and debilitated condition of the horse,along with financial constraints on the owner's behalf, thedecision was made to perform a mandibular condylectomy asa standing procedure using sedation and local and regionalanaesthesia techniques. The mare tolerated the procedurevery well and post operatively improved significantly. Introduction Disorders of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of horses arerelatively uncommon and are caused by acute injury orchronic wear and tear of the joint secondary to dental disease(Baker 2002). The majority of reports of horses with a disorder ofa TMJ describe osteoarthritis of the TMJ caused by infection(Patterson et al . 1989; Carmalt and 2005; Nagy and Simhofer 2006; Barnett et al . 2014) but other reports describe horses with nonseptic osteoarthritis of the TMJ (Hurtig et al . 1984; May 1996). Reported treatments of horses with septic ornonseptic osteoarthritis of the TMJ range from conservativetreatment, such as deposition of an anti-inflammatory orantimicrobial medication into the TMJ or minimally invasivearthroscopic treatment of the TMJ, to the more radicalmandibular condylectomy, with or without meniscectomy,depending on the severity of disease present. Althougharthroscopy is the preferred surgical approach for treatment ofhorses with disease of the TMJ because it is the least invasive,access to all regions of the TMJ is poor, and for horses withwidespread disruption of the architecture of the TMJ,treatment via arthroscopy may not be feasible. Mandibular condylectomy in the horse was described by Barber et al . (1985) and has since been used to treat horses for severe osteoarthritis of the TMJ (Patterson et al . 1989; Carmalt and Wilson 2005; Nagy and Simhofer et al . 2014). Reports of mandibular condylectomy in the horse describeperforming the procedure with the horse anaesthetised(Barber et al . 1985; Patterson et al and Nagy and Simhofer 2006; Barnett et al . 2014). The risks associated with anaesthesia of the horse are welldocumented and these risks are increased in aged anddebilitated horses (Johnston et al . 2002). By performing mandibular condylectomy with the horse standing, risks fromgeneral anaesthesia are eliminated and the expense to the owner is reduced. The aim of this article is to report mandibularcondylectomy performed while the horse was standing totreat an aged, debilitated horse for extensive osteoarthritis ofthe left TMJ. Case history A 24-year-old Irish Sport Horse mare was presented to theUniversity College of Dublin's Veterinary Hospital (UCDVH)because, during the past year, she had developed weight loss,quidding and an inability or reluctance to open her mouth.The mare had been treated for severe periodontal diseaseduring the previous 3 years by the referring veterinarian andduring this time, 9 cheek teeth (306, 307, 308, 406, 407, 408, 409,410 and 411) were extracted. The mare had developed aslowly enlarging hard swelling in the region of the left TMJ 9months prior to presentation. The mare had been fed a softdiet due to the extensive loss of cheek teeth, but despitethis modified diet, her condition deteriorated. The ownerwas unable to recall any incident of trauma to the mare.Prior to presentation, the mare had been administeredphenylbutazone (Equipalazone 1; 2.2 mg/kg bwt per os ) for 2 weeks to determine to what degree pain was contributing toher difficulty eating. The owner noted no improvement ineating during this time. Clinical findings The mare was dull and in poor body condition (score 2/9)(Henneke et al . 1983) and a large, firm swelling was present in the region of the left TMJ, along with severe atrophy ofthe left masseter muscle, giving the face an asymmetricalappearance ( Fig 1 ). The mare showed no signs of discomfort when the mass was firmly palpated. The mare's oral cavitycould not be examined because she became distressed whenan attempt was made to open her mouth beyond 2-3 cm.Results of serum biochemical analyses and a complete bloodcount were within normal limits. Radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations Examination of a dorsoventral radiographic projection of thehorse's skull revealed extensive modelling of leftmandibular condyle and mandibular fossa of extensive new boneformation, irregular, margins areas ofsclerosis and diffuse osteolysis ( Fig 2 ). The joint space was not624 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014visible during the ultrasonographic examination of the left TMJ due to extensive formation of new bone. Diagnosis Results of physical, radiographic and ultrasonographicexaminations indicated that the mare had severeosteoarthritis of the left TMJ and was missing 9 cheek teeth.Degeneration of the left TMJ and the severe dental diseasewere assumed to be related but we were unable to determineif the severe dental disease was responsible for the severeosteoarthritis of the TMJ or if the severe osteoarthritis of the TMJwas responsible for the severe dental disease. Treatment Mandibular condylectomy was recommended to restoremobility to the mandible. Performing the procedure withthe mare standing was recommended because the mare's poor body condition and age increased the risks ofcomplications from general anaesthesia (Johnston et al . 2002). Surgical procedure The mare rate of infusion of 0.01% detomidinehydrochloride. Analgesia of the region was obtained and mandibular nerves usingmepivacaine by (2011). Mepivacaine was also instilled subcutaneously atthe proposed site of incision. Condylectomy was performed using an approach similar to that described by Barber et al . (1985). A 6-7 cm cutaneous incision, centred over the left TMJ, was made. The incision wascurved to extend ventrally just caudal to the mandibularcondyle. Underlying fascia was dissected and reflectedventrally, using Metzenbaum scissors, to expose the jointcapsule, which was partially obscured by the new bone. Thejoint was exposed by removing a portion of the new boneusing an osteotome. A small volume of grossly normal synovialfluid flowed from the joint when the joint capsule was incised.The condyle, because of its large size, was divided into multiplefragments for removal, using an osteotome and mallet and anoscillating saw. Haemorrhage during the procedure wasslight and ligation or electrocoagulation of vessels was notnecessary. After the condyle was excised, a ronguer was used to smooth the cut edge of the mandible. The joint capsuleand subcutaneous tissue were closed separately using 2-0poliglecaprone 25 suture (Monocryl) 5placed in a simple- continuous was apposed using 0polypropylene suture (Prolene) 5placed in a simple interrupted Fig 1: Preoperative photographs showing swelling surrounding theregion of the left TMJ. This swellingwas bony and did not cause signs ofdiscomfort CT C Fig 2: Preoperative dorsoventral radiograph. Caudal is to the top remodelling of the mandibular condyle andmandibular fossa of the left temporal bone with sclerotic anddiffuse osteolytic areas is seen, along with extensive periarticularnew bone formation and irregular, indistinct articular joint margins.T = temporal bone , C EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014pattern. Gauze swabs held in place with an elastic adhesivebandage were maintained over the incision for 48 h. Post operative care The mare was able to comfortably open her mouth to 9 cmimmediately after surgery. An oral examination confirmed thatthe 306, 307, 308, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410 and 411 were missing.No further dental abnormalities were discovered at this time.Antibiotic therapy was continued for 5 days. Phenylbutazone 4 was administered at a tapering dose for 5 days and thendiscontinued. The sutured incision healed by first intention. Aseroma observed at the surgical site at 3 days post operativelydisappeared by Day 5 without treatment. The mare had anexcellent appetite and good masticatory movements andhad gained 10 kg by the time it was discharged 8 days aftersurgery. Although the quidding had not resolved completely, ithad decreased in frequency. Outcome When examined at our hospital 4 months after surgery, themare had gained 90 kg with a body condition score of 5/9(Henneke et al . 1983). The mare's demeanour had improved markedly and she was able to open her mouth to 12 cm.Intermittent quidding was still noted when eating hay. Whenexamined one year after surgery, the mare had maintainedthe weight it had reached by 4 months. A subjectiveimprovement in masseter muscle development was notedand the mare was still able to open her mouth to 12 cm.Repeat radiographic examination showed that a smoothpseudocondyle had formed at the site of the excised condyle(Fig 3 ). Discussion Removing the condyle with the mare standing eliminated therisks and expense associated with general anaesthesia whileallowing good access to the TMJ. The incidence of mortality ofhorses undergoing general anaesthesia has been previouslyreported to be 1% (Johnston et al . 2002) and old and debilitated horses have been reported to be at greater risk ofanaesthetic complications than are young horses and horsesin good body condition (Johnston et al . 2002). The mare in this report was 24-years-old and in poor body condition (score,2/9) (Henneke et al . 1983). The procedure was performed with the mare standing with the understanding by the owner that ifcomplications were encountered during the procedure, themare would be anaesthetised for the procedure to becompleted. Many surgical procedures of the equine head can be performed with the horse standing and tolerance of horses tosurgical procedures of the head is well documented (Ford1991; Schumacher et al . 2000). Performing surgery of the head of horses while the horse is standing seems to cause lesshaemorrhage than when the same procedures are performedwith the horse anaesthetised and recumbent (Schumacheret al . 2000). We observed that haemorrhage from the surgical site seemed to be less than that which we have observedwhen mandibular condylectomy is performed with the horse inlateral recumbency. Adequate desensitisation of the site of surgery is necessary to perform surgery with the horse standing. Sensory innervationof the region of the temporomandibular joint in thehorse is provided by branches of both the maxillary(zygomaticotemporal and zygomaticofacial) and the mandibular (auriculotemporal) nerves (Godhinho and Getty1975). Analgesia of the TMJ of the horse this wasprovided by anaesthetising the ipsilateral maxillary andmandibular nerves (Moyer et al . 2011) and the skin at the site of incision was desensitised with local anaesthetic solutioninstilled subcutaneously. This combination of local analgesia provided excellent local analgesiathroughout the procedure. Mandibular condylectomy was first described by Barber et al . (1985) and has since been used to treat horses for severe septic or nonseptic osteoarthritis of the TMJ (Carmalt andWilson 2005; Nagy 2006; Barnett . 2014). An arthroscopic approach to the TMJ has been described by Mayet al . (2001) and has been used successfully to treat horses for acute, septic osteoarthritis of the TMJ (Carmalt and Wilson2005). Arthroscopic access to the TMJ however,and after substantial bony modelling changes have occurredwithin the joint, restoration of normal mandibular movementby this approach is unlikely (May et al . 2001). The TMJ of the horse in this report had undergone extensive bony modelling,leading to obliteration of the joint space and partial ankylosisof the joint, making condylectomy necessary to improvemastication. Post operative complications associated with mandibular condylectomy are well documented in other species andinclude ankylosis of the TMJ (Miyamoto et al Fig 3: Post operative, caudo-dorsal 60\u00b0 rostro-ventral oblique view, obtained one year post surgery, showing formation of a smoothmandibular pseudocondyle. Both the temporal bone andmandibular condyle exhibit smooth surfaces and no evidence ofankylosis is seen. Block arrow = temporal bone, Arrowhead =mandibular \u00a9 2014 December 2014et al . 2007). Preservation of the meniscus has been shown to help prevent post surgical ankylosis (Li et al . 2006). The horse in this report had such severe disease of the TMJ thatmeniscal tissue was not identified. Authors of 2 case reportsdescribing the outcome of horses that underwent unilateralcondylectomy and meniscectomy reported that the horsesdeveloped a pseudocondyle, which was observed on CTimages obtained at 4 or 8 months after surgery (Nagy andSimhofer 2006; Barnett et al . 2014). The mare in our report developed a round regrowth of the mandibular condyle,which we considered to be a pseudocondyle, observed onradiographic images of the skull obtained one year aftersurgery. Disease of the TMJ of horses is rarely diagnosed and the problem most frequently reported is infection of the jointresulting from trauma (Schumacher 2006). Early disease maybe overlooked due to the nonspecific clinical signs (Carmaltand Wilson 2005) and is difficult to diagnose with conventionalimaging techniques so cases are usually only diagnosed whenchronic changes have occurred (Moll and May 2002).Osteoarthritis of the TMJ has also been reported to occursecondary to long-standing dental disease (Baker 2002;Schumacher 2006) but there is limited evidence that thepresence of dental malocclusions is correlated toinflammation of the TMJ (Carmalt 2014). The mare in this reporthad been treated for dental malocclusion for 3 years and 9cheek teeth had been extracted to ameliorate difficultmastication. We were unable to determine if different dentalmanagement could have affected the progression of thedisease because the mare was presented to our hospital onlywhen mastication had become so difficult that the mare'smouth could no longer be opened to allow its dentition to beassessed. The insidious onset of the swelling in the left TMJregion had been overlooked because the dentalmalocclusion was perceived to be the cause of the mare'sdifficulty with mastication. Although mandibular condylectomy did not fully resolve the mare's quidding, it did decrease its frequency. Failure ofthe horse to completely cease quidding was considered to bedue to the loss of mandibular cheek teeth although postoperative pain could not be definitively ruled out. Computed tomography is best method for evaluating the TMJ of horses (Moll and May 2002). Computed tomographyhas been shown to provide far better diagnostic evaluation ofthe TMJ of horses than does standard radiography in the earlystages of osteoarthritis of the TMJ (Moll and May 2002). In acase report by Nagy and Simhofer (2006), radiographicexamination of the skull of a horse with disease of a TMJrevealed no obvious abnormalities of the TMJ, whereas CTrevealed multiple osseous changes, including roughening ofthe articular surface and multiple osseous fragmentsassociated with the temporal bone. Various novelradiographic projections of the TMJ have been described thatprovide images more diagnostic than conventionalradiographic projections (Ebling et 2009; tomographic images and otherradiographic projections of the TMJ of the mare in our reportwere not acquired because of monetary constraints and theincreased risk of general anaesthesia required to performthe CT imaging at our facility. Given the severity of theradiographic changes seen on a DV radiographic projection(Fig 2), more diagnostic imaging would have been unlikely toalter the treatment plan.This case report describes mandibular condylectomy performed with the horse sedated which, to our knowledge,has not been previously reported. By providing local andregional analgesia, condylectomy can be performed with thehorse standing, thereby avoiding the risks associated withgeneral anaesthesia of the old or debilitated horse.

J. F. Hawkins Department of V eterinary Clinical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. Corresponding author email: hawkinsj@purdue.edu Keywords: horse; mandible; joint; surgery; osteoarthritis The case report in this issue by Sanders et al . (2014) illustrates multiple issues related to the surgical management ofosteoarthritis (OA) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) andthe role of standing surgery for veterinary surgeons. Disease ofthe equine TMJ has been rarely reported and is limited to avariety of case reports (Carmalt and Wilson 2005; Nagy andSimhofer 2006; Barnett et al . 2014; Carmalt 2014). Most veterinarians will see a limited number of these cases in theircareer and lack of experience can lead to indecision,misdiagnosis and present challenges as to how to managethese cases. The case detailed here with severe OA of the TMJ was straightforward to diagnose because of the clinical signs ofpalpable, firm enlargement of the TMJ and inability of thehorse to open its mouth. The diagnosis was confirmed withradiography, although others have documented difficulties inimaging of the TMJ Townsend et al . 2009). It has also been previously reported that horses with normal skull radiographs may have advanced OAof the joint. Multiple authors have documented the role ofcomputed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of manyabnormalities et al 2008; Porter and Werpy 2014). However, CT is not available to all practitioners and must usually beperformed under general anaesthesia, with the exception ofsome institutions that can perform standing CT skullexaminations (Porter and Werpy 2014). Although useful in theconfirmation of TMJ disease, CT is not always required. Thecase report by Sanders et al . (2014) did not utilise CT as radiography confirmed the diagnosis. In addition,ultrasonography can be useful in the evaluation of the TMJand is readily available to most equine practitioners (Welleret al . 1999a,b; Rodriquez et Ultrasonography the evaluator to diagnose effusion of the joint, boneproliferation at the joint margins and may allow for theidentification of intra-articular masses or disruption of themeniscus. In the absence of diagnostic imaging, intra-articularanaesthesia of the TMJ can be performed to confirm OA orother intra-articular pathology. Horses with pain related tothe TMJ will improve following intra-articular anaesthesia.Anatomical landmarks for the TMJ can be used butultrasonography can aid in successful insertion of the needleinto the joint. Synovial fluid can be aspirated from the effusedjoint and samples collected for microbial culture and cytologyif sepsis of the TMJ is suspected. In addition, all horses withsuspected TMJ disease should have an oral examinationperformed to rule out dental abnormalities which cancontribute to the development of TMJ OA. For obvious reasonsdental abnormalities should be corrected along withtreatment of OA within the TMJ.Management of TMJ disease can be conservative or surgical. Conservative management of TMJ disease focuseson correction of dental abnormalities. Conservativemanagement should be reserved for mild cases of TMJ OA asdiagnosed via clinical signs, radiography or of the TMJ nonresponsive toconservative management be considered formandibular (Barber et al . 1985; Nagy Barnett et al . 2014). Mandibular condylectomy has been performed for treatment of severe OA or septic arthritis of the TMJ. Allreported cases of TMJ disorders treated with mandibularcondylectomy, with the exception of the current case report,have been performed with the horse anaesthetised.Mandibular condylectomy involves a small curvilinear incisionover the affected TMJ. The surgeon should be careful to avoidthe transverse facial artery and vein and auriculo-temporalnerve. Following exposure of the mandibular condyle, it isremoved with a combination of bone rongeurs and anoscillating bone saw (Barber et al . 1985). Removal of the meniscus is optional. The end result of mandibularcondylectomy is the formation of a pseudoarthrosis whichallows for improved range of motion of the TMJ anddecreased articular pain. The primary reason for performing the procedure under general anaesthesia is to avoid patient movement anddiscomfort during the surgical procedure and improvevisualisation and surgical exposure of the TMJ. Along with therisks of general anaesthesia come the accompanying risks ofrecovery. These risks were especially apparent for the horsedescribed in this case report which was severely debilitatedsecondary to advanced OA of the TMJ. The poor bodycondition and age of the horse certainly increased the horse'srisk for anaesthetic complications. The author certainly has noissue with attempting mandibular condylectomy with thehorse standing. Based on the results of the horse described inthis case report, the standing mandibular condylectomy wasan unqualified success. Disadvantages of performing any surgical procedure standing include patient movement, iatrogenic damage tosurrounding structures (e.g. eye, nerves, blood vessels),adverse patient reactions secondary to inadequate localanaesthesia, extra personnel to provide patient restraint andextra procedure time. In general, a competent surgeon canperform any given surgical procedure quicker with the patientanaesthetised when compared to the time it takes to restrainthe horse, surgical preparation, local anaesthesia,organisation of manpower, repeated administration of 629 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014sedatives and allowing for extra patient movement during theprocedure. The simpler the surgical procedure, the quicker theprocedure can be performed and the better it is for the horseand everyone else involved in the procedure. So the primaryquestion the surgeon must ask is, is the ability to perform aprocedure standing worth it when compared to generalanaesthesia? What factors must be considered whencontemplating standing surgical procedures? Standing surgical procedures are being performed with increasing frequency in private and equine referral practice.In addition to surgery of the head, a variety of othersurgical procedures are performed with the horse standingincluding obviously eliminates the need for general anaesthesia,anaesthetic recovery and allows the horse to be dischargedas an outpatient. Standing surgery decreases the risk of injuryfor the horse and decreases the cost of treatment for owners.For obvious reasons, horse owners are most interested in lowercost and most prefer to pursue standing surgery for thatreason. Because of these advantages, owners are nowrequesting standing surgery in lieu of general anaesthesia.Veterinarians must be aware of what procedures can beperformed safely with the horse standing and which ones arenot practical or are unsafe. Many of these procedures wouldnot be possible except for improvements in the use ofinjectable standing chemical restraint and local anaesthetictechniques. Prior to starting any standing surgical procedure an organised plan of action should be developed. Thisshould include an anaesthetic and surgical plan. Sedationand anaesthesia is discussed below. All supplies andinstrumentation required to complete the procedure shouldbe made ready ahead of time. If diagnostic imaging will berequired either during or after the procedure, the necessarypersonnel should be informed and prepared for the task. Thegoal of organisation is to minimise procedure time and patientmorbidity associated with a lengthy surgical time. The case report by Sanders et al . (2014) illustrates several key elements of successfully performing a standing surgicalprocedure in the horse including an experienced surgeon,standing chemical restraint, local nerve blocks and directinstillation of local anaesthetic at the surgical site. The key tothe successful completion of any standing procedure isrestraint. For obvious reasons, a horse not tractable enough totolerate these preparatory procedures should be stronglyconsidered for general anaesthesia. The author does not feelthat the veterinarian should perform the surgical procedurestanding if the safety of the handler, surgeon or horse is at risk.Common sense should be used when selecting a suitablecandidate for standing surgery and my preference is to givethe horse 'the benefit of the doubt' and at least attemptsedation of the horse to evaluate its responsiveness tosedation. Some horses are initially difficult to handle beforesedation but become willing patients once sedated withappropriate agents. If required, horses can be premedicatedwith intramuscular detomidine hydrochloride (10-15 mg). Ifavailable, this author prefers to place the horse in stocks. Thislimits side to side and forwards and back movement. Mosthorses are comfortable in stocks once they are inside of themalthough the hardest part is getting them in. This can be aidedwith manual encouragement, sedation and blindfolding.Horses should be restrained by at least one person and not left unattended. Once in the stocks, the horse is sedatedintravenously. My preference is a combination of detomidinehydrochloride (5-10 mg) and butorphanol tartrate (5-10 mg).The author has found this drug combination of sedatives toprovide acceptable levels of sedation for 20-30 min,depending on the stimulation applied to the horse. If repeatedsedation is anticipated, an intravenous jugular catheter shouldbe placed. Injectable sedation can be repeated as neededto complete the procedure. Some veterinarians prefer acontinuous rate infusion of detomidine and butorphanol butthe author has not found this to be necessary and prefers bolusinjections of sedatives (Vigani and Garcia-Pereira 2014). The next step is local anaesthesia of the surgery site. This can be accomplished by a variety of techniques. Lower limbprocedures can be performed with regional nerve blocks orregional intravenous perfusion with lidocaine or mepivacaine.Obviously an understanding of regional anatomy is required toperform these blocks. This is particularly important for localanaesthesia of the head, where regional nerve blocks can bechallenging secondary to anatomical features of the skull(Staszyk et al . 2008; Bardell et al . 2010). Intravenous regional perfusion involves injection of the palmar digital vein,cephalic or saphenous vein. Palmar digital vein injectioninvolves the injection of a minimum of 20 ml of localanaesthetic. Injection of the cephalic or saphenous veinrequires a larger volume of anaesthetic (40-60 ml). Areas notamenable to regional nerve blocks or regional limb perfusionare managed with local anaesthetic injection. The volumeof anaesthetic depends on the proposed size of thesurgical incision. For hindlimb procedures, local and 0.9% saline added as needed toreach the desired volume. Typically, 12-25 ml of total volume isrequired. The higher the volume, the more forward epiduralanaesthesia is provided. For example, this is a useful techniqueto help desensitise the flank for flank laparotomy orlaparoscopy. Advantages of standing surgical procedures involving the head include ready access to both sides of the head,decreased haemorrhage and minimal fear of surgical incisiondisruption possible when the horse is recovered from generalanaesthesia (Barakzai and Dixon 2014). The final decision forwhether or not the procedure can be completed standing isup to the surgeon. Factors involved in this decision include thesurgeon's level of experience with the procedure and whetheror not it can be successfully completed without undue stress tothe horse. Some procedures can be completed with aminimum of experience (e.g. laceration repair and small massremoval) and others require extensive experience (e.g.osteoplastic bone flaps, removal of ethmoid haematomasand cheek tooth removal). Therefore, the author has foundthat teaching opportunities are limited when the procedure isperformed standing as in most instances the procedure shouldbe performed as quickly as possible by the most experiencedsurgeon to minimise the number of times sedation isadministered, keep costs down and ensure successfulcompletion of the procedure. If teaching is a primaryobjective, general anaesthesia would be more amenable tothe accomplishment of teaching goals. Once the surgical procedure has been completed, the horse is allowed to recover from i.v. sedation and is discharged \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd 630 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014to the care of the owner. If it is not possible to complete the surgery with the horse standing then general anaesthesia maybe required. If this is remotely a possibility this should bediscussed with the owner prior to starting the standingprocedure. In general, aftercare will be the same whether ornot the procedure was performed standing or under generalanaesthesia. In summary, severe OA of the TMJ is a rare occurrence but when it is diagnosed it can be successfully managed withmandibular condylectomy performed with the horse standing.Standing surgical procedures in the horse are here to stay andshould be offered, by an experienced surgeon, when itprovides a better alternative to the same procedureperformed under general anaesthesia.

G. Liu*, H. X. Wu, D. Y. Wang, F. Zhang and D. Song Institute of Traditional Chinese V eterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, China; andShanghai with integrated traditional Chinese and western veterinary medicine Summary In April 2011, horses at Nanjing Racecourse were accidentallyoverdosed with ivermectin deworming powder, mixed into thefeed. After 3 days of medication, most of the horses ate feedonly and reduced their hay intake significantly. On Days 5-6, 3Mestizo horses showed discomfort, no appetite, sweating,abdominal enlargement, restlessness, whinnying, pawing theground and no defaecation. Of the other horses, 4 showedabnormal sweating. Toxic atony of the large intestine wasdiagnosed. During the initial treatment process, only glucosesaline injection was used to strengthen cardiac function andsustain the balance of body fluid. It was given in an enemawith liquid paraffin, or drenched with magnesium sulfate andliquid paraffin. However, these treatments failed to cure thehorses. One of the most seriously affected horses died the nextmorning. Then, analgin was injected i.m. and vitamin B 1was injected immediately into bilateral Guanyuanshu acupoints.At the same time, a decoction of decocted and thenthe decoction was fed mixed into the feed, at the dosage of200-300 g per horse, s.i.d., for 3-5 days. One horse died beforethe integrated treatment but all others horses recovered. Twoadditional cases were cured with similar treatment. Introduction Intestinal constipation, also known as intestinal impaction, is acommon disease in the horse (Wang 2004). It is caused byhypofunction of stomach and intestine, causing stagnation offaeces in a certain part of the intestine. Typical signs includeabdominal pain, reflected by frequent rising and lying down,due to intestinal obstruction. In 2011, the authors successfullytreated 3 typical cases with integrated traditional Chinese andwestern veterinary medicine. For materials and methods, andresults see Supplementary items 1-4. Clinical cases Case 1 , April 2011 At a racecourse in Nanjing , 14 horses, 9 of them mature weregiven ivermectin deworming powder mixed in feed, 1 g/time,b.i.d. for 3 consecutive days. After 3 days of medication, thehorses began to show decreasing intake of forage and eatingconcentrates only. On Days 5 and 6, 3 Mestizo horses, one afteranother, showed cessation of defaecation, anorexia,abdominal enlargement, sweating, restlessness, whinnying,pawing the ground, kicking the belly and rolling. Neostigmine injected 3 times by handler had no significant effect. Clinicalfindings for the 3 sick horses were: horses defaecation, red discoloration of the oral mucosa,obvious halitosis and significant abdominal enlargement.Auscultation indicated faint small intestinal sounds but no largeintestinal sounds. The horses were sensitive to abdominalpalpation and showed pain. Rectal examination showed thatthe rectal wall was tight and dry, with a small amount of hardfaecal masses in the anterior of the pelvis. Toxic intestinalconstipation (impaction) was diagnosed. Of the other horses, 4showed abnormal sweating. Because it was very late at night,there were only liquid paraffin and magnesium sulfate and asmall amount of conventional drugs available at theracecourse. A 1-2 l dose of liquid paraffin and 500 g ofmagnesium sulfate diluted in water to 8% solution were givenorally to the sick horses. Also, warm saline plus liquid paraffinwere infused into the rectum twice. Then, the following therapywas prescribed: 30 ml of 30% analgin and 20 ml of vitamin B 1 injection were given by i.m. injection, 4-8 l of 5% glucose andsodium chloride injection, 20-30 ml of vitamin C injection and100-250 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate injection were given i.v.The horses were walked fo r 1 h after the treatment. On the second morning, the 3 sick horses had not improved and one died. Post mortem examination showed a small accumulation of oily material in the stomach. The colonwas filled with a large amount of dry faeces. Faeces in thefront part of the colon were covered with a little oily material.So, the horse was suffering from intestinal constipation. Thehind part of the small intestine was filled with a large amount ofhard dry faecal masses, covered with oily material. Therefore,for the other sick horses, 30 ml of vitamin B 1was injected into Guanyuanshu acupoints bilaterally. A decoction seed 20-40 g, plus3-5 l water. This was given orally as warm decotion to the sickhorses. At the same time, the above drugs (analgin, vitamin B1,glucose saline, vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate) wereinjected once more. The horses were walked for an hour afterinjection. About 4-6 h after treatment, the sick horses began todrink a large amount of water, and then began to lift tails, passflatus and void faecal masses, and loose faeces and showgood spirit and audible intestinal sounds. They began to eatforage, and signs of abdominal pain disappeared gradually.632 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014The handler was asked to stop feeding the horses for a day, ensure sufficient intake of water and to walk the horses. Theyrecovered. Also, the whole group of the horses was fed Liquorice root, 200-300 g/horse, decocted in water and mixed in feed s.i.d.,for 5 days. After this treatment, the remaining 4 horses withabnormal sweating gradually returned to normal. Case 2 , May 2011 This was a 13-year-old racehorse at a Nanjing racecourse. Two days before disease onset, intake of feed and waterdecreased, followed by cessation of defaecation, with oliguriaand yellow urine, anorexia, gradual abdominal enlargement,sweating, anxiety, paddling hooves and rolling on the ground.Two injections of neostigmine by the handlers gave nosignificant improvement. Clinical findings were: bodytemperature 38.8\u00b0C, pulse 42 beats/min, respiratory rate 17breaths/min. It had noticeable abdominal enlargement, nodefaecation and urination for a day, red discoloration of theoral mucosa, and depression. Auscultation revealed nocolonic sounds. The lower right abdominal area was verysensitive to palpation and showed a painful response. Rectalexamination revealed that there were no significant faecesand the intestinal cavity was tight and dry. Intestinalobstruction was diagnosed. Immediately, 2 l of liquid paraffinwas given orally, and a warm saline enema was given twice.Then, the following treatments were prescribed: 30 ml of 30%analgin i.m., 8 l of 5% glucose and sodium chloride, 30 ml of10% vitamin C injection solution and 250 ml of 5% sodiumbicarbonate injection were given i.v. At the same time, 30 mlof vitamin B 1was injected into bilateral Guanyuanshu acupoints. A Anemarrhena root 50 Mirabilite 300 BitterOrange 40 g, Costus root 50 g, Areca seed 40 g, in 3 l of water,was given orally immediately while still warm. After treatment,the horse was walked for an hour. About 6 h after treatment,the horse began to drink a great amount of water. Then, itbegan to lift its tail, pass flatus, void faecal masses and loosefaeces, and began to eat forage. Signs of abdominal paingradually disappeared and the horse recovered. Case 3 , May 2011 This was a 1.5-month-old foal in good body condition in Yizheng, Jiangsu Province, PRC. Several days earlier, the foalwas eating forage and feed. The night before treatment, itshowed an absence of defaecation, poor spirit, refusal to suckmilk, frequent turning its head back to see its abdomen,restlessness, frequent rising and lying down, frequenthoof-paddling, oliguria with yellow urine, and abdominalenlargement, slightly significant on the right side. Clinicalfindings were: body temperature 38.9\u00b0C, pulse rate 72beats/min, respiratory rate breaths/min. It showedabdominal enlargement, an absence of defaecation andurination for a day, red discoloration of the oral mucosa, drymouth and depression. Auscultation indicated faint sounds ofthe small intestine and no sounds of the large intestine. Theright abdominal area above and below the stifle was verysensitive to palpation and showed painful response. Intestinalobstruction was diagnosed. Immediately, 10 ml of vitamin B 1 was injected into Guanyuanshu acupoints bilaterally, and10 ml of 30% analgin was injected i.m.; 3 l of 5% glucose andsaline, together with 10 ml of 10% vitamin C was injected i.v. Atthe same time, a decoction of Chinese herbs was made from Rhubarb 30 g, Dwarf Lilyturf tuber 20 g, Mirabilite 150 g,Officinal Magnolia bark root 20 g, Areca seed10 g, Figwort root 20 g in 1.5 l of water. The decoction wasgiven orally while still warm. Circa 3 h after treatment, the foalbegan to drink water, void loose faeces and suck milk. Theabdominal pain disappeared gradually, and the foalrecovered. Discussion Depending on the clinical signs and root cause of the diseaseand its urgency, the treatment principle in treating acutedisease is to relieve the secondary symptoms first. In chronicdisease, one also must relieve the underlying cause. In equineconstipation, abdominal pain usually is severe, causingrestlessness. It is easy to examine and treat such cases. Oneshould relieve pain before treating the constipation. Analgesiaby injection of analgin is useful. Guanyuanshu is an equine acupoint, located in the depression caudal to the last rib, about 12 cm to the dorsalmidline, bilaterally (Liu and Xu 2002). It is used in traditionalChinese veterinary acupuncture to treat impaction of theintestines and enteritis and abdominal pain, etc. It can beneedled to a depth of 1-3 cm. However, acupuncture byinjection of western drugs or Chinese herbal extracts intoacupoints is also effective and was the method used in thesehorses. In treating equine constipation, neostigmine should be used cautiously because it can cause intestinal cramps,making it difficult to discharge the faecal masses. Use ofi.v. rehydration therapy and cardiac therapy, even incombination with oral administration of salt laxative,sometimes fail. The use of traditional Chinese medicine to relax(purge) the bowels, nourish Yin and moisten the intestines andstimulate peristalsis of the intestines often can achieve rapideffects. In clinical practice, the main recipe is Mu Bin Xiao Huang Powder (China Veterinary Pharmacopoeia). It is also necessary to modify this recipe, adding or subtracting someingredients in accordance with the clinical differentiation. A decoction of Costus root-Areca reed-Rhubarb-Mirabilite powder (CARMP) was used in these horses. The results of an experiment on the effect of CARMP injection in rabbits on recovery from experimental intestinalintussusception indicated that CARMP increased peristalsisand significantly shortened recovery time from intestinalintussusceptions. The effect was due to a direct effect on theintestinal canal or on intestinal blood circulation. The clinicaleffect of CARMP in the horses probably was due to increasedperistalsis (see Supporting items). In treating equine constipation, frequent enemas are useful, especially for constipation of the large intestine. It ispreferable to use 0.9% saline because isotonic solution not onlysoftens the faeces to promote discharge of the faecal massesbut also helps with rehydration. Soapy water can stimulate theintestinal mucosa and cause straining, so that the water isdifficult to retain in the intestine, reducing the efficacy of theenema. Also, one must be gentle when giving an enema: therectal tube used must be soft and its introduced end must besmooth and lubricated. Before use, a small amount of liquidparaffin can be smeared on the outside surface to preventinjury of the intestinal mucosa. Before inserting a hand or probein the rectum, the operator should cut and file his/her nails. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd633 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014When the rectum of the horse contracts, it is strictly prohibitedfor the operator to move his/her hand forwards with force. Constipated horses must be cared for by a specially assigned person. Walking the horse on a lead-rope is helpful,but horses must not be allowed to roll on the ground. After theconstipation is relieved, omit the first 1-2 feeds. Then, regularfeeding can be resumed gradually and adequate drinkingwater must be ensured.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert)CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS.WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinica l signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the tot al dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone ma y be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

Rogers Lucan, Dublin, Ireland. Corresponding author email: philrogers@eircom.net Introduction In China, animal diseases are treated using western medicines or surgery alone, traditional Chinese herbal medicine alone,acupuncture alone or various combinations thereof.Combination of western and oriental medicine is calledintegrative medicine. In many cases, this gives better and/orfaster results than western or oriental methods on their own. The following notes on basic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, and on the formula and herbs mentioned by Liuet al . (2014), are presented for western-trained colleagues who may not be familiar with TCM theory and its use of herbalmedicine or acupuncture as effective therapies. The terminology used in this commentary is based mainly on that in Wiseman and Ye (1998). The principles of building herbalformulas are based mainly on Chen et al . (2012). Details on the nature, actions and uses of each of the herbs mentioned arebased mainly on Jiao (2003) and online sources. Herbal medicine in TCM In TCM, the term Medicinal herbs seldom are used singly. They arecombined in highly complex formulas. These formulas usuallycontain 4-20 or more individual herbs, carefully chosen toaddress the Ben-Root (basic cause) and Biao-Branch (clinicalmanifestations) of the Symptom-Pattern shown by theindividual patients. Herbal toxicity Some TCM herbs are toxic if used at high doses in their crudeform. Examples (Croton processing and incorporation into formulas is a highlyspecialised area, designed not only to standardisebatch-to-batch quality, but also to lessen the toxicity of suchherbs. Despite expert processing, some herbs still pose a risk of toxicity if used alone. However, when used in a balancedformula, and at correct dose rates, those herbs pose minimalrisk of toxicity. Contrary to claims made by some westernresearchers, TCM herbal formulas manufactured to GMPstandards, and prescribed by qualified TCM physicians/herbalists, have a reported incidence of toxicity and adversereactions that is miniscule when compared with the risk fromwestern allopathic drugs per million doses prescribed bywestern physicians. However, self-diagnosis and self-prescribing, or prescribing by improperly trained quacks,carries a much higher risk of toxicity and adverse effects whether western drugs or TCM formulas are used. TCM theory Traditional Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture havemany concepts foreign to western thinking. Diseases areclassified according to the 8 principles (hot-cold,external-internal, yin-yang and deficient-excess). affect factors include: External (exogenous) factors (including climatic factors, lifestyle factors, dietary factors, trauma and poisoning);Internal (endogenous) factors (including constitutionalgenetic factors and emotional factors). Each formula has 4 precise classes of herbs: (1) Jun (Chief); (2) Chen (Deputy); (3) Zuo (Helper); and (4) Shi (Envoy; Table 1 ) (Liu et al . [2014] used Mu Bin Xiao Huang San as the main herbal formula in their paper. Table 2 summarises the details of the formula and Table 3 summarises details of individual herbs listed by Liu et al . [2014]). Each formula includes one or more herbs from each of those 4 classes. The Helper and Envoy herbs have specialfunctions to neutralise toxins and/or the harsher effects otherherbs in the formula. In that respect, Gancao-Liquorice,Shengjiang-Fresh Ginger and Dazao-Jujube Date arevery useful (and widely used) to detoxify other herbs in aformula. Each herb is categorised also on 3 specific characteristics: nature, taste and organ-channel relationships: (1) Five natures of herbs [hot, warm, even, cool and cold]. Hot Chilli peppers, prepared Aconite root and dried Ginger are classed as hot herbs. Hot herbs inducesweat. They are used to warm the interior, release theexterior ('sweat out' the 'pathogenic factor') and expelcold to diseases'.Senna leaf, Gypsum and Watermelon fruit are classedas cold herbs. They are used to cool the body, coolblood, clear heat etc. to treat 'hot' diseases. (2) Five tastes of herbs [bitter, sweet, acrid, salty and sour] These are the 5 cardinal tastes. They correspond with the 5 element phases and their related organs: Fire(HT-SI and December 2014(KI-BL) and wood (LV-GB), respectively. In TCM theory, each cardinal taste influences its corresponding organ.For example,Bitter herbs tonify the fire organs HT-SI and PC-SJ;Sweet herbs tonify the earth organs SP-ST;Acrid herbs tonify the metal organs LU-LI;Salty herbs tonify the water organs KI-BL;Sour herbs tonify the wood organs LV-GB. In addition, there are 3 subtastes: bland, aromatic fragrant and astringent dry. These have special functions in TCM. (3) Herb-organ-channel relationships In TCM theory, the 12 main internal organs are coupled inyin-yang pairs. For example: HT is the yin partner of SI within the fire element; ST is the yang partner of SP within the earth elementetc., as above. Each of the 12 organs has a channel (aka meridian) system, a complex system of deep and superficial branches.The deep branches run in the body interior and connect theorgan with its coupled organ (yin-yang partner) and withrelated deep internal structures. Connecting branches leave the deep branches to connect the related organs with theirsuperficial branches. These are the 12 main channels ofacupuncture. They run in the surface of the body, under theskin. They connect the surface with the interior. Each of the 12 main channels has acupoints on the surface. Internal pathology reflects on the surface, especiallyat the related acupoints. Conversely, activated acupoints canbe used to influence both surface and internal pathology, viasuperficial and deep channel pathways, and via theperipheral and central nervous system. Western codes for organs and their channels are: BL = bladder; GB = gallbladder; HT = = = lung; = ST = stomach. Herbs used in TCM are classified by their channel preferences. For example: Aster root homes to LU Cinnamon twig homes to all 12 channels, especially HT; LU; SJM Frankincense homes to HT; LV; SPTABLE 1: Four ranks of herbal ingredients in the hierarchy of a formula (1) Jun / Junyao Chief, Monarch, Ruler, King, Emperor, Principal herbAddresses the main pathological issue.

Teixeira and G. de La Penha Chiacchio Fernandes V eterinary Clinics Department, State obstruction of the small intestine by anomalousmesenteric bands is an uncommon cause of colic in horses.The most commonly reported bands are mesodiverticularbands that are embryological remnants of the vitelline arteries.Despite the congenital nature of the anomaly, a wide agerange of horses can be affected. This report describes a caseof small intestinal strangulating obstruction caused by anunusual, anomalous congenital band attached to theileocaecal fold in a yearling colt. Information including casebackground, history, clinical, laboratory, surgical andpathological findings is described. Introduction Strangulating obstruction of the small intestine is an importantcause of colic in horses. Different pathological conditions havebeen described associated with strangulating obstructionsincluding anomalous bands (Mair and Edwards 2003; Freeman2012). In horses, the most common type of noninflammatoryintrabdominal band with potential to cause intestinalstrangulating obstruction is the mesodiverticular band.Mesodiverticular bands may also be found in mature horseswithout causing any problem (Edwards 2004). The proposedmechanism by which a mesodiverticular band can causestrangulating obstruction is through an associated rent in itsmesentery whereby loops of small intestine may becomeentrapped and eventually incarcerated (McIlwraith andRobertson 1998). This report describes a case of small intestinalstrangulating obstruction in a yearling colt caused by ananomalous mesenteric band attached to the ileocaecal foldwith no association with a mesenteric rent. Details Case history A 12-month-old, 280 kg, Quarter Horse colt was referred to theState University at Londrina, Veterinary Teaching Hospital(Londrina, Paran\u00e1, Brazil) for evaluation of a colic episode witha duration of approximately 8 h. According to the referringveterinarian, signs of abdominal pain were characterised byrestlessness, sweating, recumbency, rolling and abdominaldistension. Physical examination revealed increased heart andrespiratory rates, absence of intestinal sounds, cold extremities,dehydration, dry and congested mucous membranes,capillary refill time 3 s, and foul oral smell. Nasogastricintubation yielde d 2 l foul smelling reflux. Partial relief of the abdominal pain was achieved after i.v. treatment with flunixinmeglumine ml/kg Ivermectin and praziquantel(Equimax 4; 200 g/kg bwt) had been administered orally to the horse the day prior to presentation. Clinical examination On presentation, the yearling was depressed, showingintermittent signs of abdominal pain (i.e. pawing, restlessness,attempts to lie down). Skin abrasions were noticed around theeyes. Physical examination revealed heart rate of 120beats/min, respiratory rate of 80 breaths/min and rectaltemperature of 38.2\u00b0C. Mucous membranes were congestedwith a line around the teeth. Capillary refill time was 3-4 sand peripheral pulse was weak. Auscultation of the abdomen,which was not distended, revealed decreased intestinalsounds. Nasogastric intubation yielded a small amount of gaswith acidic odour and no net reflux. Rectal examinationrevealed distended loops of the small intestine, which wereconfirmed by transabdominal ultrasonography. Preliminaryblood work revealed hyperfibrinogenaemia (6.0 g/l).Peritoneal fluid analysis revealed a serosanguinous, cloudyfluid with elevated protein (82 g/l), red blood cells \u00d710 9/l), mmol/l; 1.76 g/l). Based on the history and clinicalfindings a tentative diagnosis of small intestinal strangulatingobstruction was made. Surgery An i.v. catheter was placed and infusion of lactated Ringer'ssolution 3was initiated. Abdominal discomfort was controlled with xylazine (Sedomin5; 0.4 mg/kg bwt i.v.). The owner was informed about the horse's clinical condition and a decisionwas made to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy.Prophylactic antibiotics using positioned cm ventral midline celiotomy, surgical exploration ofthe abdomen revealed a large amount of serosanguinousperitoneal fluid and several loops of distended small intestine.A red-black coloured segment of nonmotile and oedematoussmall intestine along with its haemorrhagic mesentery ( Fig 1 )640 \u00a9 2014 / AE / December Performance\u00ae A Von A Time ChampionJake NRCHA World Champion and Million Dollar Rider, Platinum Performance\u00ae Client since 2006 Jake Telford is a sponsored endorsee and actual client.JakeTelford NRCHA World Championd and Dollar Client\u00ae sincet 2006This is my horse 800-553-2400 www.

Careful manipulation of the compromised and adjacent intestinalsegments resulted in complete reduction of the strangulationand better exposure of the anomalous cord-like structure(Fig 3 ). A total of 2.4 m of small intestine comprising the aboral portion of the jejunum and approximately 90% of ileum wasseverely damaged. The cord-like structure consisted of bandof mesenteric tissue originating from the mesenteric root andblended distal ileum ( Fig 3 ). Due to the guarded prognosis for recovery and financial constraints, the yearling was subjectedto euthanasia upon owner consent. Post mortem findings On necropsy, the band was a flat, red fibrous structure of approximately 30 cm in length originating at the mesentericroot and attaching to the ileocaecal fold of the distal ileum. At the mesenteric root, the band originated as a wide-basestructure that tapered off toward its middle aspect andwidened again before attaching to the ileocaecal fold. Anabnormal space limited by the band, the distal ileum, theunderlying and the ( Fig 4 ). Careful palpation of the band failed to reveal an isolated tubular or longitudinal tissue thickness thatcould resemble the shape of a vessel (artery). However,several small blood vessels could be observed throughout itssurface. A clear demarcation between the viable andnonviable segments indicating the site of strangulation couldbe observed on the distal ileum. Discussion Strangulating obstruction of the small intestine attributed toanomalous congenital bands is an uncommon cause of colic Fig 1: Strangulated segment of distal jejunum and associated mesentery. Fig 2: Site of strangulation by the anomalous band (arrow). Fig 3: Release of the strangulated bowel and identification of theabnormal band (arrow) attached to the ileocaecal fold(arrowhead). Fig 4: Post mortem macroscopic appearance of the anomalous band (right forceps) attached to the root of the mesentery and tothe ileocaecal fold (left forceps). A space between the band andthe underlying mesentery is identified (right forceps). \u00a9 2014 EDUCATION et al . 2003; Wefel et al . 2011). A retrospective study of 224 horses with small intestinalstrangulating obstruction showed that mesodiverticular bandsaccounted for only 1.33% (3/224) of the cases, whereasstrangulation caused by other types of bands termed 'fibrousbands' accounted for 3.57% (8/224) of the cases (Van DenBoom and Van Der Velden 2001). Recently, data compiledfrom different studies showing the role of small intestinaldiseases as causes of colic in horses have shown a prevalenceof mesenteric bands ranging from 1.1 to 4.6% when all types ofcolic were considered and from 4.4 to 13.4% when just smallintestinal cases of colic were considered (Freeman 2012). In man, congenital anomalous bands (e.g. mesodiverticular bands) are a well-recognised cause ofintestinal obstruction in infancy and childhood with a higherprevalence in boys (Rutherford and Akers et al . 1992). In horses, a mesodiverticular band usually presents itself as a triangular-shaped fold of mesenteric tissue that extends fromone side of the mesentery to the antimesenteric surface of thedistal jejunum or ileum. The third side of the triangular-shapedfold is a free edge of tissue that forms the entrance (hiatus) ofa pocket, whereby segments of small intestine can becomeentrapped and eventually incarcerated in the blind sac(Wefel et al . 2011) or when the band is associated with a mesenteric rent (Freeman et al . 1979; Brown et al . 2007). Alternatively, a mesodiverticular band may appear attachedto the apex of a Meckel's diverticulum (Johnson andVerhagen 1977; Sprinkle et al . 1984). The anomalous band reported here differs from the usual presentation of a mesodiverticular band in several respects.While the commonly reported origin of a mesodiverticularband is at the mid-ventral aspect of the distal jejunum or ileummesentery ( Table 1 ), this band originated at the mesenteric root. Furthermore, it blended with the ileocaecal fold at thedistal ileum, even though the ileocaecal fold also attaches tothe antimesenteric surface of the ileum. The band had 2 freeedges without forming any pocket with the adjacentmesentery, where loops of small intestine could becomeentrapped. Rather, the band formed an internal hernia space whereby the distal jejunum and ileum, which are thecommonly reported involved segments ( Table 1 ), probably herniated and became entangled around the band. Thesecharacteristics share great similarities with a mesodiverticularband originating as a remnant of the left vitelline artery ( Fig 5 ). During the first stages of the equine embryonic development the yolk sac, which is the primitive source ofnutrients to the embryo, is attached to the midgut through theyolk stalk or vitelline duct known as omphalomesenteric duct (Brown et al . 2007). The blood supply to the vitelline duct and the yolk sac isprovided by 2 vitelline arteries, one on each side of the vitellineduct (i.e. left and right), which at this point, are the mainbranches of the primitive aorta. As the embryo grows, the yolksac, the vitelline duct, the left vitelline artery and the distalsegment of the right vitelline artery atrophy, whereas theproximal segment of the right vitelline artery becomes thecranial mesenteric artery (Freeman et al . 1979; De Bosschere al . 1999; Loh et al . 2007) ( Fig 5 ). Incomplete regression of these yolk sac-related structures, either isolated or in combination, may result in differentcongenital abnormalities and has been reported in manyspecies (Koch et al . 1978; De Bosschere et al . 1999; Brown et al . 2007; Campbell 2011). More specifically, failure of regression ofeither the distal segment of the right vitelline artery or thewhole left vitelline artery and Akers 1966; Freeman et 1979) whereas incomplete regression of the vitelline duct maycreate an intestinal fistula, a vitelloumbilical diverticulum. An intestinal fistula or umbilical fistula isa patent communication between the intestine and theexternal umbilicus (Noden and DeLahunta 1985) whereas thevitelloumbilical band is a band of fibrous tissue connectingeither the small intestine or the apex of Meckel'sdiverticulum the as a tubular blind-end structure at the antimesenteric border of the aboraljejunum or ileum, which can cause strangulating obstruction TABLE 1: Reported cases of anomalous congenital intestinal bands in horses Case Age/sex Breed Bowel incarcerated Location of the band Length of the band Reference 1 7 years/M Pinto Jejunum and ileum Distal jejunum Standardbred Jejunum and ileum Jejunum, 150 cm proximal to caecumSimilar to Case 1 3 8 years/F Arabian Jejunum and ileum Jejunum, 150 cm proximal Case 4* 40 days/M Standardbred None Jejunum, cm mesentery De - and proximal - Jejunum and ileum jejunum .

Intestinal obstruction caused by congenital anomalous bands other than remnants of the vitelline circulation - termedperitoneal bands - has been reported in the human literature(Akgur et al . 1992; Oelhafen et al . 2012). The persistence of primitive mesenteries as a result of a developmentalabnormality or intestinal malrotation might be the cause ofsuch aberrant peritoneal bands (Oelhafen et al . 2012). To the author's knowledge, descriptions of neither peritoneal bandsnor intestinal obstructions caused by them have beenreported in horses. In man, a higher prevalence of mesodiverticular bands has been described in boys (Rutherford Johnsonand Verhagen 1977; Akgur et al . 1992). Although the gender of the horses were not reported in Abutarbush et al . (2003), it seems that a higher prevalence of mesodiverticular bandsmay also occur in male horses as observed in this case. Despite the congenital nature of mesodiverticular bands, a wide age range of horses can be affected ( Table 1 ). Based on the age of the colt when the colic signs were detected, thelack of any previous history of abdominal trauma (e.g. surgery)and the macroscopic characteristics of the band (i.e. origin,insertion, smoothness, colour, shape and presence of bloodvessels) the congenital nature of the band is highly likely. Histopathological examination of a mesodiverticular band may reveal a membranous structure consisting of loose fineconnective and adipose tissue, covered on its exposedsurfaces by a mesothelial lining (Abutarbush et al . 2003). In addition, the tissue may contain arterial vessels with theirlumens filled with blood and the vascular adventitiasurrounded by small amount of connective tissue (DeBosschere et al . 1999). Although histopathology was not performed in this case, the gross anatomopathologicalfindings (i.e. size, origin and insertion) strongly suggest that thisanomalous congenital band may be a true remnant of the leftvitelline artery. Occasionally, mesodiverticular bands can be found at surgery or necropsy as an incidental finding (Freeman et al . 1979; Noden and DeLahunta 1985; Southwood 2008). In a caseseries of 17 horses in which mesodiverticular bands where encountered during colic surgery, only 5 horses (29.4%) hadlesions associated with the bands (Edwards 2004). In suchcircumstances, the clinical significance of the defect resideson the fact that it only predisposes the horse to further colicepisodes, thus raising a surgical dilemma as to whether theband should be resected or not (Hillyer 2004). Based on theminimal complications and expenses to the owner associatedwith resection and a possible fatal outcome in case a futureintestinal strangulation occurs, the bands should be resected(Southwood 2008). This report describes a case of small intestinal strangulating obstruction caused by an anomalous congenital band in ayearling colt. The unusual features of the band highlight therange of presentation inherent to congenital intestinalanomalies. Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

THERE'S A BUZZ IN THE BARN. ARE YOU LISTENING? Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID), formerly known as Equine Cushing's Disease, can go under diagnosed. Its clinical signs, which may include laminitis, delayed coat shedding, regional adiposity, lethargy and decreased athletic performance, are often overlooked or attributed to other ailments1. Use Prascend\u00ae (pergolide mesylate) with regular check-ups to treat PPID and help keep the chatter down. VISIT PRASCEND.COM TO LEARN MORENADA 141-331, Approved by FDA Prascend\u00ae (pergolide mesylate) Tablets, 1 mg Dopamine receptor agonist for oral use in horses onlyCaution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.Description: Prascend Tablets are rectangular light red colored, half-scored tablets containing 1 mg pergolide, as pergolide mesylate. Pergolide mesylate is a synthetic ergot derivative and is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. The chemical name of pergolide mesylate is 8f-[(Methylthio) methylj]-6-propylergoline monomethanesulfonate. The chemical structure is: Indication: For the control of clinical signs associated with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (Equine Cushing's Disease) in horses. Dosage and Administration: Administer orally at a starting dose of 2 mcg/kg once daily. Dosage may be adjusted to effect, not to exceed 4 mcg/kg daily. It has been reported that pergolide tablets may cause eye irritation, an irritating smell, or headache when Prascend Tablets are split or crushed. Prascend Tablets should not be crushed due to the potential for increased human exposure and care should be taken to minimize exposure when splitting tablets. The tablets are scored and the calculated dosage should be provided to the nearest one-half tablet increment (see Table 1). Table 1 Dosing Table Body weightDosage 2 mcg/kg 4 mcg/kg 136 - 340 kg (300 - 749 lb)0.5 tablet 1 tablet 341 - 567 kg (750 - 1,249 lb)1 tablet 2 tablets 568 - 795 kg (1,250 - 1,749 lb)1.5 tablets 3 tablets 796 - 1,022 kg (1,750 - 2,249 lb)2 tablets 4 tablets Dosing should be titrated according to individual response to therapy to achieve the lowest effective dose. Dose titration is based on improvement in clinical signs associated with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) and/or improvement or normalization of endocrine tests (for example, dexamethasone suppression test or endogenous ACTH test). If signs of dose intolerance develop, the dose should be decreased by half for 3 to 5 days and then titrated back up in 2 mcg/kg increments every 2 weeks until the desired effect is achieved. Contraindications: Prascend is contraindicated in horses with hypersensitivity to pergolide mesylate or other ergot derivatives.Warnings: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. Prascend should not be administered by persons who have had adverse reactions to ergotamine or other ergot derivatives. Pregnant or lactating women should wear gloves when administering this product. It has been reported that pergolide tablets may cause eye irritation, an irritating smell, or headache when Prascend Tablets are split or crushed. Prascend Tablets should not be crushed due to the potential for increased human exposure and care should be taken to minimize exposure when splitting tablets. Consult a physician in case of accidental ingestion by humans. Precautions: Treatment with Prascend may cause inappetance. The use of Prascend in breeding, pregnant, or lactating horses has not been evaluated. The effects of pergolide mesylate on breeding, pregnant, or lactating horses are not known; however, the pharmacologic action of pergolide mesylate suggests that it may interfere with reproductive functions such as lactation. Prascend is approximately 90% associated with plasma proteins. Use caution if administering Prascend with other drugs that affect protein binding. Dopamine antagonists, such as neuroleptics (phenothiazines, domperidone) or metoclopramide, ordinarily should not be administered concurrently with Prascend (a dopamine agonist) since these agents may diminish the effectiveness of Prascend. Adverse Reactions: A total of 122 horses treated with Prascend Tablets for six months were included in a eld study safety analysis. Table 2 Summary of the most common adverse reactions (N=122) Clinical sign # Cases Cases (%) Decreased appetite 40 32.8 Lameness 22 18.0 Diarrhea/Loose stool 12 9.8Colic 11 9.0Laminitis* 10 8.2Heart murmur 10 8.2 Death 8 6.6 Tooth disorder 8 6.6Skin abscess 7 5.7Musculoskeletal pain 6 4.9Behavior change 6 4.9 *Three new cases and 7 pre-existing, recurring cases Inappetance or decreased appetite occurred at one or more meals in 40 of 122 horses treated with Prascend. At the baseline evaluation 1.6% of owners reported a history of inappetance or decreased appetite as compared to the 32.8% of horses that experienced inappetance or decreased appetite during the study. Most cases of inappetance were transient and occurred during the rst month of treatment; however, some horses experienced sporadic inappetance throughout the study. Two horses required a temporary reduction in dose due to inappetance during the rst month of the study. Both horses returned to their original dose within 30 days. Weight loss occurred in more than half of the horses in this study; however, weight loss that was considered abnormal was only reported in 11 horses. Lethargy was reported in 9.8% of horses during the study, and was not reported in any horses at the baseline evaluation. Behavioral changes were noted in 6 horses including aggression, kicking, agitation, nervous behavior and increased activity. One horse required a temporary reduction in dose due to energetic behavior during the rst month of the study. Eight horses died or were euthanized during the study due to worsening of pre-existing conditions (laminitis, dental disease, septic tenosynovitis) or colic (strangulating lipomas, large colon volvulus). One mare was inadvertently enrolled in the study while pregnant and experienced dystocia resulting in the death of the foal.

Clinical Pharmacology: Pergolide mesylate is a synthetic ergot derivative and is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. As with other dopamine agonists, pergolide inhibits the release of prolactin which suggests that it may interfere with lactation. In horses with PPID, pergolide is believed to exert its therapeutic effect by stimulating dopamine receptors, and has been shown to decrease the plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), and other pro-opiomelanocortin peptides. 1 Pharmacokinetic information in the horse is based on a study using single oral doses of 10 mcg/kg in six healthy mares between 3 and 17 years of age. 2 Pergolide was rapidly absorbed; the mean maximum concentration (Cmax) was 4.05\u00b12.02 ng/mL with the median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) being 0.415 hours. The area under the curve (AUC) was 14.08\u00b17.46 hr\u00b7ng/mL. The mean half life (T1/2) was 5.86\u00b13.42 hours; the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 1204 mL/kg/hr; and the mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 3082\u00b11354 mL/kg. Effectiveness: An open-label, historical control, eld study evaluated the effectiveness of Prascend for the control of clinical signs of PPID. A total of 122 horses with PPID were enrolled in the study, 113 of which were included in effectiveness evaluations. The success of each horse was based on results of endocrinology testing (dexamethasone suppression test or endogenous ACTH test) and/or improvement in clinical signs related to PPID (hirsutism, hyperhidrosis, polyuria/polydypsia, abnormal fat distribution, and/or muscle-wasting) on the Day 180 evaluation. Based on endocrine testing and investigators' clinical assessment scores, 86 (76.1%) of the 113 evaluable cases were treatment successes.Table 3 Proportion of Treatment Successes on Day 180 bound: one-sided 95% condence diagnosed with PPID based on the presence of hirsutism and an abnormal pre-study endocrine test result. All horses were treated with 2 mcg/kg Prascend (to the nearest one-half tablet) orally once daily for the rst three months. If the endocrine test result on Day 90 was normal or adequately improved, the horse continued on the same dose through Day 180. If the endocrine test result on Day 90 was abnormal, the dose increased to 4 mcg/kg given once daily through Day 180. Forty-seven (41.6%) of the 113 horses included in the effectiveness database required a dose increase at Day 90. Improvement was noted in scores for all clinical sign categories and in mean results for endocrine tests. Table 4 Percent of Animals with Improvement in Clinical Signs Relative to Baseline Scores Clinical wasting 36.3% 46.0% Table 5 Endocrine test results (mean values) Test # Animals Baseline Day 90 Day 180 cortisol concentration Animal Safety: In a six month target animal safety study healthy adult horses received Prascend administered orally, once daily, at doses of either 0 mcg/kg, 4 mcg/kg, 6 mcg/kg, or 8 mcg/kg (0X, 1X, 1.5X, or 2X the maximum recommended dose). There were eight healthy horses (four males and four females) in each treatment group. Doses were prepared by dissolving tablets in approximately 10 mL of a 50% sugar water solution. Prascend treated groups had lower mean heart rates and higher mean temperatures than the control group. Horses in all treatment groups had minimum heart rates within the normal range and maximum temperatures below 101.5\u00b0F. One 1.5X horse experienced a mild episode of spasmodic colic on Day 3 that resolved after treatment with flunixin meglumine. Mean red blood cell counts and hemoglobin values were lower in Prascend treated groups as compared to the control group. Other hematology parameters including hematocrit, white blood cells, absolute neutrophils, and absolute lymphocytes exhibited mild, transient decreases as compared to the control group. The hematology parameters generally decreased over the rst 30 to 60 days after treatment initiation and then returned to values similar to pre-treatment levels. No treatment related alterations were identied on histopathology evaluation of bone marrow. Storage: Store below 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F).

Hassel Department of Clinical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, USA. Corresponding author email: dhassel@colostate.edu The vitelline circulation is important in early embryonic development to provide the rapidly growing embryo withnourishment from the yolk sac. As the placenta takes overas the source of nutrition, the vitelline circulation regresses(Arey 1965; Freeman et al . al 1984). Persistence of vitelline vascular structures results in thepresence of fibrous bands in the abdominal cavity thatmay result in strangulation of small intestine. Relateddevelopmental structures implicated in small intestinalincarcerations include mesodiverticular bands ( 1 report by Dearo et al . in this issue describes an anomalous wide band arising from the ileocaecal band and extending tothe root of the mesentery, suspected to be a persistentremnant of the left vitelline artery (Dearo et al . 2014). The authors go on to describe a review of cases in the literature forwhich anomalous congenital intestinal bands have beenreported, highlighting the different potential presentationsinherent to congenital intestinal anomalous bands. As the description of these persistent embryonic structures can be confusing, Table 1 attempts to clarify the origin of each of these structures including a definition with sites of origin andinsertion within the abdominal cavity. The clinical presentation for horses presenting with strangulating obstructions from anomalous congenital bands issimilar to that of any small intestinal strangulating lesion, withthe exception that those with congenital bands have atendency to be younger in age. However, this case reporthighlights several reports of middle-aged horses withstrangulations from congenital bands (Freeman et al . 1979; Robert et al . 2008), suggesting that they may be more prevalent than reported. Some horses may be asymptomatictheir entire lives with a congenital band present (Edwards2004). Incidental fibrous bands are recognised with somefrequency in the abdomen during exploratory celiotomy thatappear to arise from deep within the mesentery. More oftenthan not, these have not caused a problem and are simply Fig 1: Intraoperative image of a mesodiverticular band of the ileum found incidentally during ventral midline celiotomy. Imagecourtesy of J. Nieto. TABLE 1: Persistent embryonic structures with their definitions and locations that may be incidental findings during ventral midline celiotomy or a source of strangulation obstruction Structure Definition Meckel's diverticulum A full-thickness diverticulum of the antimesenteric surface of the aboral jejunum or ileum that is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct that provided communicationbetween the yolk sac and embryonic gut (Sadler 1984). May be associated with avitelloumbilical band. Vitelloumbilical band A fibrous band originating from the apex of a Meckel's diverticulum that extends to the umbilicus as a result of incomplete regression of the vitelline duct (Hooper 1989). Mesodiverticular band Remnant of a left vitelline artery that has the appearance of mesentery wrapped around the distal jejunum or proximal ileum extending from the adjacent mesentery to theantimesenteric surface of the small intestine, forming a triangular pocket ( Fig 1 ). Persistent vitelline artery Remnant of a left or right vitelline artery that attaches to ileal mesentery and may form a mesodiverticular band (left) or may extend to the umbilicus, the root of the mesentery, orbe free floating in the abdomen (De Bosschere et al . 1999a). Persistent vitelline vein Remnant of the left vitelline vein that provided communication from the yolk sac and the sinus venosus and persists as the portal vein. May extend from the umbilicus to the intestine (nearcaecum) to the portal vein. One case reported in a foal (De Bosschere et al . 1999b). Fibrous bands Aberrant bands identified at surgery. May originate from persistent vitelline structures or omentum (Oelhafen et al / AE 2014ligated and transected without further exploration of theirorigin. Mesodiverticular bands found incidentally aremanaged by simple transection of the mesentery to the levelof the ileal serosa to eliminate the 'pouch' that occasionally isimplicated in strangulation obstruction of the small intestinethat results from either rents that develop within the pouch thatincarcerate bowel or volvulus that arises from shortening of themesentery at the point of attachment (Freeman 2012).Meckel's diverticulum is a very uncommon finding duringexploratory celiotomy and is more likely to be associated withpathology such as impaction with or without secondaryrupture or strangulation obstruction most commonly fromvolvulus of the segment. In one report of 15,000 equinenecropsies performed, only 5 Meckel's diverticuli wereidentified and were responsible for the death of the animal inall 5 cases (Sprinkle et al . 1984). Regardless of the form of the congenital anomaly, in all cases, resection of the segment ofbowel affected by pathology is indicated. If the proximity ofthe lesion extends toward the terminal ileum, ajejunocaecostomy is appropriate, but if viable distal jejunum orileum is present, an end-to-end jejunojejunostomy orjejunoileostomy is the treatment of choice. Special care shouldbe taken when handling bowel and mesentery of the juvenilehorse, as it is more prone to digital trauma as well as adhesionformation.

Cou\u00ebtil* College of V eterinary Medicine, V eterinary Clinical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. email: couetill@purdue.edu Keywords: horse; respiratory disease; heaves; evidence-based medicine Summary The purpose of this article is to review available scientific reports on recurrent airway obstruction and inflammatoryairway disease treatment efficacy. Critical evaluation of thequality and limitations of the evidence provided shouldprovide equine practitioners with the tools to apply the latestscientific data to the management of individual clinical cases.While a large body of clinical research supports the efficacy oflow-dust environmental management and corticosteroidadministration in the treatment of recurrent airway obstruction,limited clinical trials exist to evaluate the treatment ofinflammatory airway disease. Introduction The strength of evidence provided by any clinical reportdepends on the strength of the study design and its success inminimising the effect of bias upon study results. Randomisedcontrolled trials with blinding of the investigator to treatmentassignments are regarded as the highest quality of evidence(Williamson and Davis 2007; Guyatt et al . 2008a,b). However, specificity of case definition along with objectivity, accuracy,precision and clinical relevance of outcome measures alsoimpact the quality of evidence (Guyatt et al . 2008a). Furthermore, in veterinary medical research, universityteaching herds composed of animals with stable, orconsistently inducible disease in the case of recurrent airwayobstruction (RAO), are most frequently used. Investigationsbased upon only these biased populations are likely to provideinflated estimates of treatment effects compared to thoseobserved in a more general population with spontaneouslyoccurring disease. Although often necessitated by ethical andfinancial constraints, observational studies generally providelower quality evidence. Associations are established ratherthan causation, but the strength of evidence provided byobservational studies can be strengthened by demonstrationof a dose response (Guyatt et al . 2008a). Furthermore, taken together, multiple trials or observational studies thatdemonstrate the same effect provide excellent evidence ofefficacy. In this review, the Grading of RecommendationsAssessment, Development and Evaluation system (Guyattet al . 2008a,b) has been adapted to assess the currently available scientific reports on RAO and inflammatory airwaydisease (IAD) treatments. Methods Electronic databases, including PubMed, CAB Abstracts andGoogle Scholar, and reference lists were searched betweenJanuary and March 2014. The following search criteria wereused: 'horse AND lung AND disease' OR 'horse AND recurrentAND airway AND obstruction' OR 'horse AND airway ANDinflammation.' Full reports in peer-reviewed journals wereincluded in the analysis if they evaluated the effect ofenvironmental or pharmaceutical intervention in horses withRAO or IAD. Reports were excluded if case definition was notprovided or if only in vitro or ex vivo data were presented. Studies including natural and induced disease were included.Sixty-eight studies (57 RAO, 11 IAD) out of 594 references wereevaluated for efficacy according to the criteria in Table 1 .N o studies evaluating treatment efficacy in summer pasture-associated RAO were identified. Study grades weredecreased if one or more of the following conditions occurred:case definition was not rigorously defined; lack ofrandomisation or nonblinding of investigators increased riskof bias; statistical analysis was inappropriate or insufficient;or outcome measures were imprecise or entirely subjective.Study grades were increased when dose effect wasdemonstrated. Tables 1 and 2summarise the strategy for assigning quality of evidence and strength ofrecommendation. TABLE 1: Criteria for judging quality of evidence Study designQuality of evidence Comments Large-scale controlled trials Excellent High confidence in the study conclusions. Randomised controlled trials considered the highest quality. Objective, clinically relevant outcomesassessed. Small controlled trials Good Confidence in study conclusions is limited by study population size and/or selection. Noncontrolled trials Moderate Confidence in study conclusions weakened by possibility that effects are due to time or placebo effects. Observational studies Low Studies are limited to providing evidence of association or change in risk. Very large effect or demonstration of a dose response strengthens the evidence.647 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014When data were available, absolute changes in clinical score, maximum change in transpulmonary pressures ( PLmax) and relative proportion of polymorphonuclear PMN) inbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were calculated bysubtracting post treatment values from pretreatment values.Percent improvement was calculated by dividing the changein the parameter by the pretreatment value. Recurrent airway obstruction Recurrent airway obstruction, commonly known as heaves,and IAD are the most common chronic inflammatory airwaydiseases of horses. Recurrent airway obstruction typicallyaffects mature horses, causing dyspnoea, cough, markedneutrophilic pulmonary inflammation, tracheal mucusaccumulation and peripheral airway obstruction in responseto organic dust exposure (Robinson and Chairperson 2001;Pirie 2013). During periods of disease exacerbation,characteristic derangements in lung mechanics occur,including increased P Lmax (>15 cm H 2O), increased lung resistance (R L) and decreased dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) (Tesarowski et al . 1996; Robinson >25% of total nucleated cells). Additionally, scoring systems have been developed toquantify clinical signs of airway obstruction based uponabdominal effort, nostril flare and additional respiratoryexamination findings rate and thoracic auscultation(Tesarowski et al . 1996; Rush et al . 1998b; Robinson et al . 2000) are frequently used to monitor treatment effects. Such scoringsystems allow quantification of the outcome most of interest tothe equine clinician: the degree of clinical improvement. Management of RAO can be broadly categorised into environmental control methods and medical therapy usingglucocorticoids and bronchodilators. Pharmaceuticaltherapies can be further divided into systemic administration oraerosol delivery. Should environmental management methods aimed at reducing dust exposure be used in thetreatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In order to relieve clinical signs, airway obstruction andinflammation, RAO-susceptible horses should be maintainedunder low dust conditions, either by keeping horses at pasture with dietary supplementation in the form of complete pelletedfeed or instituting in-stall environmental modifications ( strong recommendation/high quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places a high value on the avoidance of disease exacerbation and less importance on the potentialdifficulty and economic burden of access to pasture andexclusive use of pelleted feed. Environmental modificationprovides the most consistent improvement in airwayinflammation of any therapeutic intervention. Evidence alsosupports decreasing dust exposure in the stall by using low-dustbedding and removing hay from the diet when pasturemanagement is not possible. While in-stall dust levels areimpacted by the environment in neighbouring stalls (Clementsand Pirie 2007), removing hay and using low-dust bedding inone stall can effectively improve lung function andinflammation (Jackson et al . 2000). However, the degree of improvement in lung function and inflammation may be lessthan that seen with pasture turnout. Supplementary item 1 summarises these findings. Should systemic glucocorticoids be used for the treatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In horses with exacerbations of RAO, systemic glucocorticoids should be used to relieve clinical signs, airway obstruction andinflammation. Treatment with glucocorticoids withoutdecreasing dust exposure will result in recurrence of clinicalsigns within 3 days of treatment cessation (Rush et al . 1998b) and may not improve airway inflammation (Lavoie et al . 2002; Robinson et al . 2002, 2009; Gerber et al . 2011); therefore administration should be accompanied by environmentalmodification ( strong recommendation/high quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places a high value on the alleviation of disease exacerbation and less importance on the potentialadverse events of systemic glucocorticoids use. Use ofthese drugs must be weighed against the risks ofhyperglycaemia, polydipsia, polyuria, muscle wasting, laminitisTABLE 2: Interpretation of recommendations Recommendation Implication for clinician Implication for horse owner Strong Efficacy of treatment or intervention is supported by high-quality research and anticipated benefitsoutweigh risks of adverse events. The treatment isindicated for most clinical cases.There is a high degree of confidence that the treatment or intervention will provide significantbenefit to the horse. Conditional Efficacy of treatment or intervention is supported by high-quality research and anticipated benefitsoutweigh risks of adverse events, but moreefficacious or cost-effective treatment may exist.The treatment is indicated for select clinicalcases.There is a high degree of confidence that the treatment or intervention will provide benefit tothe horse but may not be suitable or necessary inall cases. Weak Efficacy of treatment or intervention is supported by scant or low-quality evidence or substantial risk ofadverse event exists. The treatment must beconsidered on a case-by-case basis, and theclinician must counsel each owner on thelikelihood of benefit and any accompanying risks.There is significant doubt that the treatment or intervention will provide significant benefit to thehorse. Substantial risk of adverse events may exist. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd648 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014and adrenocortical suppression. Although no clinical trial in RAO-affected horses has reported any clinical side effects ofcorticosteroid administration, i.v. (Rush et al . 1998c; Picandet et . 1993), and oral prednisolone (Leclere et al . 2010) were associated with significantly reduced serum cortisolconcentration, but normal response to adrenocorticotropichormone stimulation was retained. Due to poor absorption,oral administration of prednisone provides no therapeuticbenefit in the horse (Peroni et al . 2002). Supplementary item 2 summarises the findings. Should inhaled glucocorticoids be used for thetreatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In horses with exacerbations of RAO, inhaled corticosteroids can be used to relieve clinical signs, airway obstruction andinflammation. Inhaled glucocorticoids are not indicated as arescue medication. Administration should be accompaniedby environmental management changes. Inhaled fluticasoneand beclomethasone are theoretically equipotent whendelivered using a hydrofluoroalkanes Hawkins 2013) ( conditional recommendation/high quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places an equal value on the alleviation of disease exacerbation and the need for special equipmentfor drug delivery. Use of these drugs must be weighed againstthe risks of hyperglycaemia, inhalation can potentiallydecrease the risk of unwanted side effects due to lowertherapeutic doses and decreased systemic absorption.Treatment with beclomethasone resulted in significantlyreduced serum cortisol concentrations, but normaladrenocortical responsiveness to adrenocorticotropichormone was maintained (Rush et al . 1998c). No evidence of adrenocorticotropic suppression was found after 4 weeks ofinhaled fluticasone (Couetil et al . 2005). A stratified controlled clinical safety trial failed to detect any differences in immunefunction between untreated RAO-susceptible horses andthose treated with fluticasone inhalation for 11 months atdoses between 2000 g and 3000 g b.i.d. and untreated horses, and no adverse events were noted (Dauvillier et al . 2011). Supplementary item 3 summarises the findings. Should systemic bronchodilators be used for thetreatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In horses with exacerbations of RAO, systemic bronchodilators such as the anticholinergic agent or the loop diuretic furosemide can be used toaugment the relief of airway obstruction. Due to their rapidonset of action, these drugs are suitable for rescue therapyduring acute RAO exacerbations. Additionally, clinical andfunctional responses to bronchodilators can documentreversibility of airway obstruction to confirm the diagnosis of RAO ( conditional recommendation/high quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places a high value on the immediate alleviation of disease exacerbation. The main utility ofsystemic bronchodilators is to relieve bronchospasm.Prolonged use without addressing the inflammatorycomponent of RAO exacerbation is not recommended.Clenbuterol is the only Food and Drug Administrationapproved bronchodilator, but published research evidenceregarding efficacy is equivocal. Chronic administration ofclenbuterol has been associated with excessive sweating,muscle tremors, and nervousness or agitation (Erichsen et al . 1994), as well as decreased aerobic performance (Kearnsand Mckeever 2002) and decreased response to therapy(Read et al . 2012). The use of clenbuterol as the sole therapy to treat RAO exacerbation without environmentalmodification and/or corticosteroid administration is notrecommended. Supplementary item 4 summarises the studies that evaluate efficacy of systemic bronchodilators in thetreatment of RAO. a) b) Fig 1: a) AeroHippus aerosol delivery device. / AE / December 2014Should inhaled bronchodilators be used for the treatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In horses with exacerbations of RAO, inhaled bronchodilatorscan be used to Aerosolised deliveryof bronchodilators aerosolised corticosteroids (Rush et al . 1999). As with systemic bronchodilators, these drugs are suitable forrescue therapy during acute RAO exacerbations. Additionally,clinical and functional responses to bronchodilators candocument reversibility of airway obstruction to confirm thediagnosis of RAO ( conditional recommendation/high quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places an equal value on thealleviation of disease exacerbation and the need for specialequipment for drug delivery. The main utility of systemicbronchodilators is to relieve bronchospasm. Prolonged usewithout treatment of the inflammatory component of RAOexacerbation is not recommended. Supplementary item 5 summarises the findings. Should phosphodiesterase inhibitors be used for the treatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In horses with exacerbations of RAO, the phosphodiesteraseinhibitor pentoxifylline can be used to provide bronchodilation(conditional recommendation/high quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places a high value on the immediatealleviation of disease exacerbation. As pentoxifylline providesbronchodilation but does not significantly reduce BALFneutrophilia, use without treating the inflammatorycomponent of RAO exacerbation is not recommended.However, it may supplement treatment in clinical cases inwhich adequate environmental management is not possible.Summaries of the studies evaluating phosphodiesteraseinhibitors are included in Supplementary item 6 . Should leukotriene receptor antagonists be used for the treatment of RAO? Overall recommendation There is no evidence to support the use of leukotriene receptorantagonists in horses with RAO. The studies evaluatingleukotriene receptor antagonist therapies are summarised inSupplementary item 6 . Should sodium cromoglycate be used for the treatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In RAO-susceptible horses, pretreatment with sodiumcromoglycate might lessen the severity of airway obstruction ifa lapse in antigen avoidance is anticipated. Comments Randomised controlled trials that evaluate the efficacy ofsodium cromoglycate in preventing worsening clinical scoreand BALF neutrophilia are needed. Summary of the available research is included in Supplementary item 6 . What complementary and alternative treatments are recommended in the treatment of RAO? Overall recommendation In horses with exacerbations of RAO and in RAO-susceptible horses, alternative therapies may augment but shouldnot replace the preceding strong recommendations.Supplementary item 6 summarises the available research into alternative treatments. Should antioxidants be used for the treatment of RAO? Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are available toevaluate the usefulness of antioxidant supplementation inhorses with RAO, and there is no evidence to support its use totreat RAO. Should herbal products be used for the treatment of RAO? Herbal products might be useful to supplement treatment of RAO exacerbations ( weak recommendation/moderate quality evidence ). Three trials have evaluated herbal products in the treatment of RAO and provide moderate quality ofevidence to suggest a beneficial effect on lung function butno effect on clinical signs or BALF cytology. Further studies withrandomised controlled study design using appropriateplacebo are needed to evaluate effect of treatment uponclinical score and BALF cytology. Should immunotherapy be used for the treatment of RAO? Immunomodulation via induction of antigen tolerance or pulmonary immune stimulation have been investigated butprovide very low quality of evidence of efficacy. Futureresearch should be directed to confirm and identify allergenictriggers more specifically. Should acupuncture be used for the treatment of RAO? One RCT has evaluated the usefulness of acupuncture in horses with RAO, and there is no evidence to support its use. Should hyper-hydration be used for the treatment of RAO? There is no evidence to support the use of hyperhydration in the treatment of RAO. In fact, healthy control horses displayedreduced arterial partial oxygen pressure (Jean et al . 2004). Should omega-3 fatty acid feed supplementation be used for the treatment of RAO? Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can be used to alleviate airway inflammation in horses with RAO ( weak recommendation/low quality evidence ). RCTs with appropriate placebo controls and blinding of investigators areneeded to evaluate treatment effect upon clinical signs,airway function and BALF cytology before supplementation ofthe diet with omega-3 fatty acids can be recommended. Table 3 summarises the available treatments for RAO that are supported by high quality research. Antigen avoidance byenvironmental modification provides the most comprehensive \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd650 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014improvement in clinical signs, lung function and airway inflammation and should form the basis of therapy in any RAOcase. In instances of RAO exacerbation, improvement canbe hastened most effectively and rapidly with the i.v.administration of dexamethasone alone or in conjunction withbronchodilators. Inflammatory airway disease In contrast to RAO, clinical signs associated with IAD tend to besubtle. Horses appear normal at rest or exhibit an intermittentcough. Diagnosis requires demonstration of increased BALFtotal nucleated cell count, increased proportions ofneutrophils, mast cells or eosinophils in BALF in the face ofimpaired lung function, poor cough orincreased tracheal mucus accumulations (Couetil et al . 2007). Routine lung function parameters typically remain withinnormal limits, and further diagnostic tools such as forcedexpiratory manoeuvres (Couetil et al . 2001) or histamine provocation tests (Hare and Viel 1998) may be necessary toconfirm derangement in lung physiology. Clinical scoringstrategies are not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate horseswith IAD from healthy horses. Therefore, diagnosis of IAD andresponse to treatment is most commonly judged by BALFcytology or endoscopic assessment of tracheal mucusaccumulation ( Fig 2 ). The pathogenesis and triggers of IAD are not as well characterised as those in RAO, and phenotypicvariation in IAD can be substantial (Couetil et al . 2007). Collectively, the uncertainties in diagnosis, measures oftreatment response, pathogenesis, stability of disease,variation in phenotype and lack of consistent experimentalinduction protocols hinder the type of randomised, controlledclinical studies that are available to direct treatment of RAO.Should environmental management be used for the treatment of IAD? Overall recommendation Implementation of low-dust management should be used to minimise the risk of IAD and to treat existing IAD ( strong recommendation/moderate quality evidence ). Comments This recommendation places a high value on the avoidance of airway inflammation and less importance on the burden ofminimising exposure and the moderate quality of researchevidence. Supplementary item 7 summarises the evidence that supports the implementation of low-dust management. Should immunomodulators be used in the treatment of IAD? Overall recommendation Immunomodulation by administration of interferon- or sodium cromoglycate might improve airway inflammation in horseswith neutrophilic and mastocytic IAD, respectively, ifenvironmental modifications are unsuccessful ( conditional recommendation/good quality evidence ).Supplementary item 8 summarises the evidence supporting the use of immunomodulators in horses with IAD. Should clenbuterol be used in the treatment of IAD? Overall recommendation Available evidence supports the recommendation that clenbuterol should not be used as monotherapy in the routine Grade 0: No mucus; tracheal et al.

Should antimicrobials be used in the treatmentof IAD? Overall recommendation Insufficient evidence exists to evaluate the use of antimicrobials in the routine treatment of IAD. Comments This recommendation places relatively lower value on the riskof subclinical respiratory infection and higher value on theavoidance of antimicrobial associated adverse events such asenteritis or residue violations. The role of bacterial infection inIAD pathogenesis has not been established (Couetil et al . 2007), but antimicrobial use is widespread (Weese and Sabino2005). Tracheal inflammation has been associated with therecovery of increased bacterial numbers in tracheal lavagefluid (Wood et al . 1993, 2005a,b; Chapman et al . 2000), but the clinical relevance and impact upon performance of trachealinflammation is uncertain (Holcombe et al . 2006; Couetil et al . 2007). Extremely limited evidence exists to support the routineuse of antimicrobials in the treatment of subclinical airwayinflammation. A retrospective analysis of endoscopy datacollected at a single racing yard reported that airwayinflammation resolved following a single course of antibiotictreatment in 2-year-olds, (Ramzan et al . 2008). However, no data were presented on the rate of resolution in horses not treated withantibiotics or even the proportion of horses with airwayinflammation treated. A case-control study comparing poorlyperforming Thoroughbreds to a small sample of successfullyracing horses demonstrated significantly greater bacterialburden and proportion of neutrophils in the BALF of poorlyperforming horses. In the horses for which follow-up wasavailable, 90% with diagnosis of infection returned successfullyto racing after antimicrobial therapy (Fogarty and Buckley1991). However, 2/3 of the horses diagnosed with infectionwere lost to follow-up, so antimicrobial treatment success mayhave been as low as 30%. Despite the high rate of treatmentsuccess reported in these 2 reports, the strength of theevidence is insufficient to recommend routine use ofantimicrobials to treat IAD. Environmental modification to minimise dust exposure in the management of IAD is supported by the most experimentaldata. Many other treatment strategies evaluated inRAO-susceptible horses have been empirically applied toclinical cases of IAD in the absence of specific evidence todirect management of these cases. Well-designed, controlledtrials using clinical and performance outcomes are needed toprovide equine clinicians with the tools to weigh the relativemerits and safety of these treatments.

Carmalt Department of Clinical Sciences, College of V eterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, USA; andWestern College of V eterinary Medicine, equine incisor and canine teeth is a vital part of equine dentistry. Although dental pathology involving theincisor and canine teeth is less common, the practitionershould be prepared to diagnose conditions and develop atreatment plan. Depending on the pathology revealed via oralexamination and intraoral radiographs, the treatment planmay include either simple (nonsurgical) or surgical extractionof an incisor or canine tooth. Technique and instrumentationrefinement over the last 20 years has led to more preciseextraction procedures with reduced secondary trauma tohealthy tissues. As a result, incisor and canine extractionprocedures are more predictable in execution and quality,with minimal complications. Introduction Oral and dental pathology leading to the extraction of equineincisors and canines is less common than in premolar andmolar teeth, but when necessary, consideration of regionaland dental anatomy, diagnostic imaging, instrumentation,and extraction technique is important to achieve a successfuloutcome. Research into the structure, function, pathology andtreatment of equine incisor and canine teeth is slowlyexpanding. Over the last 20 years, the extraction ofsignificantly mobile or periodontally compromised incisors andcanines has not changed greatly. Conversely, surgicalextraction techniques have evolved as a broaderunderstanding of the applicability of general dental andsurgical principles to the equid oral cavity has been accepted.Advances in diagnostic imaging, oral examination techniquesand instrumentation have contributed to a more refined andfocused approach to extraction with the overall goal ofminimising adjacent and regional trauma as well as improvingpost operative healing. The rostral position of the incisor and canine teeth results in improved owner recognition of pathology and easierexamination, imaging and treatment by the veterinarian.Once a diagnosis is reached, the goals of achieving comfortand function should be paramount when creating atreatment plan. When developing a thoughtful treatmentplan, the veterinarian must critically evaluate the diagnosis,mastication mechanics, future demands on the oral cavity,progression of pathology, animal comfort and ownercompliance. The final outcome of any extraction, whether itbe simple elevation of an aged, mobile tooth or surgicalextraction of all incisors due to tooth resorption, should be theimproved ability to prehend food and perform required tasksin as painless and efficient manner as possible.Anatomical considerations The dental conformation and the structure of surrounding andsupporting regional anatomy needs to be considered forselection of the most appropriate extraction approach,placement and usage of instrumentation, as well as theavoidance of unnecessary adjacent tissue damage. Incisorsand canine teeth have a single root. Incisors are radicular,hypsodont teeth with long reserve crowns, 7-10 cm, that eruptcontinually throughout the life of the horse (Dixon and du Toit2011). The interproximal bone between the incisors on themaxilla and mandible is relatively thin. The thin bone allowsfor consideration of nonsurgical extraction techniques, asthe periodontal ligament (PDL) space can deform toaccommodate instrumentation. The length of equine incisorteeth is described in detail by Schrock et al . (2013a) and is summarised as follows: the length of the incisors increases forthe first 2-4 years post eruption and remains relatively constantto a tooth age of 13-15 years post eruption despite continualwear. Maxillary second incisors are longer than third and firstincisors that are similar in length, and mandibular third incisorsare significantly longer than the first and second incisors. Theshape of the incisor changes down the length of the tooth ascan be witnessed by observing the clinical crown at variousages. From the occlusal surface to the apex, an incisor shapeshifts from oval (broader on the labial/palatal/lingual dentalfacets) to trapezoid to triangular to oval (broader on themesial/distal dental facets) (Klugh 2010a). Therefore, olderincisors are straight and conical while younger incisors can becurved often with an additional twist around the long axis ofthe tooth (Schrock et al . 2013a). Shallow indentations on the mesial and distal surfaces of the apical portion of the toothcan be present (Schrock et al . 2013a) and may act to increase surface area for retention in ageing teeth. The continualeruption and resulting reorientation in the clinical crown of thetooth should be compensated for during dental elevation andsurgical removal of bone. The thinning and twisting of theapical portion of the tooth can complicate extraction;therefore, practitioners should always take post extractionradiographs to ensure complete extraction of a tooth. The periodontium anchors the tooth via both hard and soft tissue structures to the skull; the periodontium is comprised ofgingiva, cementum, periodontal ligament and bone.The PDL is a highly specialised collagen fibre structure,intertwined by blood vessels and nerves that are anchored tocementum and alveolar bone effectively suspending thetooth within the confines of the alveolus. Fatiguing theperiodontal ligament is at the heart of each extraction;therefore, understanding the structural components of theperiodontal ligament and the anatomy of the tooth is vital to657 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014performing an extraction. An in-depth series of studiespublished by Schrock et al . (2013a,b,c) and 2 (Staszyk and Gasse 2005; Staszyk et al . 2006) have shed new light on the understanding of the equine incisor PDL andthey are essential reading for those with an advanced interestin the subject. In short, the strength of the PDL in the middleand apical portion of the tooth increases with age tocompensate for the loss of surface area attachment (Staszyket al . 2006). Attachment at the gingival level remains constant with age and is comprised of primarily densely packedcollagen fascicles embedded deeply in cementum oralveolar bone as an interwoven meshwork or aligned in to10 possible directions connecting gingiva, alveolar bone andcementum (Staszyk et al . 2006). Consequently, the PDL attachment at the level of the gingiva is designed to withstanda great amount of force from a variety of directions no matterthe age of the horse. Sharp dissection is employed duringextraction to cut the tough, complex network of gingivalattachment, and knowledge of tooth age and periodontalligament structure/strength in the apical and middle portion ofthe tooth is used to determine extraction approach andinstrument selection. The canine teeth are less complex than the incisors and cheek teeth as they do not continually undergo attrition anderuption, but their formidable size and surrounding bone makethem an extraction challenge. Canine teeth behave more likebrachydont rather than hypsodont teeth. The surface area forPDL attachment does not change for canine teeth, butinstead remains constant throughout the lifetime of the animal.Extrapolation of PDL conformation from incisor teeth (Staszyket al . 2006) may be incorrect, but similar arrangements of the PDL at the gingival level of the tooth should be expected. Dueto the longevity of the tooth within a relatively unchangingalveolus, it may be that the PDL structure of the canine tooth ismore similar to that of an older than younger horse. Theaverage length of a canine tooth from crown tip to apex is5-7 cm and only one-quarter to one-third of this is clinicalcrown (Dixon and du Toit 2011). The tooth is relatively oval inshape, broader on the labial and lingual/palatal surface, andthe narrower mesial and distal aspects of the toothaccommodate dental elevators well. Regional bone encasingthe canine is significant; it is comprised of both cancellous andthick cortical bone. Therefore, the PDL space does not deformreadily to accommodate instrumentation and a surgicalapproach to extraction is usually necessary unless there issignificant pathological loss of the periodontium. The maxillarycanine tooth is located in the rostral third of theincisor-premolar interdental space or diastema ( Fig 1 ). The root runs in the caudodorsal direction and remains at a consistent,relatively shallow depth within the maxilla. In contrast, themandibular canine tooth is positioned further rostrally, closer tothe lateral incisor. The interproximal bone between the distallateral incisor and mesial canine tooth is thin, and damage tothis bone should be consciously avoided during extraction ifpossible. The mandibular canine root is directed caudally in aslight ventrolingual direction sometimes with a labial or lingualcurve at the apex; the increasing mandibular depth of the rootand the potential apical curve needs to be considered duringsurgical extraction. Major vessels and nerves in the region of the rostral maxilla and mandible can (in most cases) be avoided duringextraction. The mental foramen containing the mental nerveand artery is located just caudoventral to the apex of themandibular canine tooth, and can be easily palpated and protected during surgical extraction of the canine tooth.Complicated surgical extraction of severely pathologicalmaxillary and mandibular incisors may necessitate regionalanatomical dissection well beyond the mucogingival these cases, branches of the inferior labial (mandibular) andthe incisive (maxilla) arteries may . 2009; Ashdown et al . 2011). These arteries can be ligated if necessary, but preservation of the major regional vascularsupply improves vitality of surgical flaps and healing. Inconditions with chronic, active inflammation and infection,active bleeding within the alveolus and surrounding bone mayreduce visibility of the surgical site. Attempts at ligating orcauterising these inflammatory, infrabony vessels only worsensthe bleeding; therefore, haemostasis should be achieved byplacement of a substance (Bone Wax) 1into the bony aperture that harbours the vessel. Indications Maxillofacial and dental abnormalities leading to regionalinfection, chronic pain and partial/complete loss of functionnecessitate extraction. Sometimes interceptive, orpreventative, treatment plans necessitate the extraction of anotherwise periodontally and endodontically sound tooth tomaintain future comfort, function, and health within the oralcavity (e.g. horses with crowded and malpositioned incisors;Fig 2 ). Incisor disorders were recognised relatively infrequently with only 11% of horses presenting to a referral equineveterinary dental practice showing signs of pathology;however, when incisor pathology was recognised, 75% ofhorses had multiple teeth affected (Dixon et al . 1999). Pathology associated with the canine teeth was rare,occurring in 1.25% of referred dental cases in the Dixon et al . (1999) study. Equine incisor and canine teeth are prone totrauma due to their rostral location in the mouth; traumaticinjuries can include dental fracture, supporting bone fracture,avulsion, and excessive abrasion due to behavioural orenvironmental conditions. Differing types of dental fracturehave been previously described (Earley and Rawlinson 2013).Acute, complicated incisor fracture with or without supportingbony fracture was the most commonly identified incisorabnormality recognised by Dixon et al . (1999). Treatment of Fig 1: Placement of the maxillary and mandibular canine teeth. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd658 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014traumatised teeth and regional bone will depend heavily on presentation, radiographic findings, duration of pathology,age of the horse/tooth and owner preference. Pathology necessitating an in-depth oral examination and intraoral and neoplasia. Not all conditions will requiretreatment, and many can be managed with dental therapiesother than extraction. Extraction should be utilised whenretention of the tooth/teeth will perpetuate disease, extensiveand unrecoverable loss of the periodontium exists, toothelimination is the most efficient way to relieve pain, and/orowners are disinterested in other forms of therapy. Dentalextraction is contraindicated if the origin of the pathology orthe pathological tooth/teeth cannot be convincinglyidentified through diagnostic techniques, the systemic healthof the patient is jeopardised by the procedure, and/or theimmune system and wound healing pathways are severelycompromised. Overall, each tooth needs to be considered asa patient, and the pros and cons of extraction weighed priorto a procedure. Diagnostic evaluation Evaluation of dental conditions should always be kept inperspective, with the systemic health of the horse beingparamount. A thorough history and physical examination withappropriate bloodwork should be performed together with adetailed oral examination. Sedation, restraint and headsupport are necessary to perform a detailed oral examination.Oral examination begins with observation and assessment ofextraoral maxillofacial anatomy and progresses into the oralcavity. Pain located in the rostral aspect of the oral cavity canbe detected by observing an animal's ability toprehend/grasp food, response to biting and/or manipulationof the lips, and sensitivity to placement of the oral speculum.Oral examination techniques have been described in detail (Easley and Tremaine 2011; Menzies 2013). Examination ofincisors and canine teeth with a bright light, dental explorer,and periodontal probe will reveal clinically visible pathology. Intraoral radiographs of pathological structures identified on examination should be obtained to determine the health ofunderlying dental and surrounding hard and soft tissuestructures. Intraoral radiographs are preferred whenevaluating incisor and canine teeth due to reducedsuperimposition resulting in improved resolution andrepeatability of the dental structures and regional anatomy(Fig 3 ). Baratt (2013) provides an excellent summary of acquisition of intraoral incisal and canine radiographsincluding examples of optimal views. Radiographs are criticalfor appropriate treatment planning and execution of preciseextraction techniques. Radiographs confirm the tooth to beextracted, evaluate the health of regional hard and softtissues, determine the extent of dental pathology, appraise Fig 2: Persistent deciduous incisors and malpositioned adult incisors (black arrows) in a draft horse. Extraction of the persistentdeciduous incisors was recommended to provide space for theadult incisors to move into a more normal position. a) b) Fig 3: Mandibular incisor and canine intraoral ventrodorsal (a) and oblique ventrodorsal (b) with bisecting angle technique captureimages of all incisors.

Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis A discussion regarding incisor and canine extraction would notbe complete without mention of odontoclastic toothresorption and hypercementosis EOTRH affecting both the incisors and canineteeth of horses typically older than 15 years (Staszyk et al . 2008a). EOTRH is characterised by internal and externalresorption of dental structure sometimes associated withexcessive production of cementum on the exterior of thetooth. As the disease progresses, the pulp, periodontalligament and alveolar bone become inflamed and infectedleading to reduced structural support for the teeth,degradation of gingiva, increased incisor angle, fistulaformation, tooth fracture and pain ( Fig 4 ). It has been suggested that periodontal inflammation resulting fromincreasing masticatory forces with age might be an initiatingtrigger for tooth resorption (Staszyk et al . 2008a). Depending on an animal's inflammatory response and individual toothreaction, the balance between resorption and cementaldeposition can differ, resulting in the varying degrees ofseverity and prevalence of tooth resorption andhypercementosis that are observed both within and betweenaffected cases (Sch\u00e4tzle et al . 2005). Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis is typically considered a painful disease. Paincan manifest as a disinterest in treats, sensitivity to biting, headshaking, ptyalism, resistance to turning during work, shynessabout the head, periodic inappetence, weight loss, anddecreased use of incisors for grasping and grazing. Somehighly trained horses or horses in earlier stages of the diseasemay show no apparent signs of discomfort. The oralexamination can be quite challenging because horses areresistant to manipulation of the lips and pressure on affectedteeth. Placement and opening of an oral speculum can elicitalert and possibly dangerous behaviour even under heavysedation. Oral examination findings can include enlarged b)a) c) d) Fig 4: Maxillary (a) and mandibular (b) photos of a horse severely affected by equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis. Note the severe gingival recession, draining fistulous tracks, bulbous expansion of the reserve crown and roots, andregional inflammation. Radiographs of the maxilla (c) and mandible (d) demonstrate both resorption and cemental thickening. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd660 EQUINE VETERINARY / AE / December 2014mandibular lymph nodes, decreased incisor angle not appropriate for age, prominent alveolar juga, dentalpapillae, gingival enlargement dental resorption ( Fig 5 ). Resorptive lesions in older horses can be found under excessivecalculus deposition on the mandibular (more common) andmaxillary to properly formulate a treatmentplan. It is not uncommon to see radiographic evidence of avariety of disease stages ranging from normal to severethroughout the incisors and canines within the alveolitis, osteitis, tooth extensive crown and root aredetectable on radiographs, extraction is recommended.Moderate to severe cases of EOTRH require extraction of theaffected incisor and canine teeth to alleviate infection andpain caused by this disease. The extraction method willdepend on the nature and severity of the pathologyassociated with the tooth/teeth. Simple incisor extraction canbe accomplished in mild to moderately affected teeth byelevation and avulsion (Tremaine and Schumacher 2011). Incases of multiple incisor and canine tooth extraction withsevere EOTRH, a surgical approach is necessary to allow forcomplete removal of dental material, visualisation of toothand diseased structures, debridement, and closure. Althoughextraction of multiple or all incisors may seem extreme, thelack of alternative treatments to permanently resolve thesevere dental associated inflammation and infection andthe chronic severe pain warrants the procedure. Owners willneed extensive presurgical counselling regarding the surgery,post operative care, nutrition, possible complications, andanticipated outcome. It is also highly recommended thathorses requiring extraction of all incisors be referred to aveterinary dentist or surgeon experienced in this procedure asretrieval of all infected dental material and extraction ofseverely resorbed teeth can be technically challenging. Instrumentation Incisor and canine extractions require a combination of basicsurgical tools and specialised dental equipment. A basicsurgical pack with scalpel, forceps, Metzenbaum and Mayoscissors, and a needle driver is always good to have on handas even planned simple extractions may require incisions,freshening of tissue edges, and site closure ( Fig 6 ). Simple extractions involve the use of dental elevators and extractionforceps. Dental elevators have a sharp tip that cut PDLattachments and seat within the PDL space; PDL luxation isachieved through primarily slow, steady through the instrument. The curvature of the dentalelevator tip should mimic the curve of the PDL space, andinstrument tip size should be selected to match the contourand size of the tooth to be elevated. Dental elevators aredesigned to work in the PDL space. The instrument is notdesigned to remove alveolar or surrounding bone, andinappropriate usage of the instrument can result inunnecessary damage to surrounding tissue. There are a myriadof dental elevators and extraction forceps on the market, andselection of these instruments depends heavily on surgeonpreference, hand size, and the tooth to be extracted. Having a variety of elevators and forceps available enables thesurgeon to find the best instrument for the extraction aspathology can alter the normal contours and placement ofteeth. Elevators and forceps used to extract incisor and wolf a) b) c) Fig 5: Images from a 12-year-old Thoroughbred gelding (a, b) with early equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis.Note the age or labial Severe gingival recessionand loss of the interdental papillae 2014 / / December 2014teeth (Incisor and Wolf Tooth Elevator Set)2can be employed in addition to winged dental elevators size 6-8 mm (WingedDental Elevators) 3. Incisor, wolf tooth or bone holding forceps (Lane Bone Forceps with Ratchet, 33 cm)4can all be used to remove the tooth from the alveolus. Bone holding forcepshave been found to be particularly useful for grasping incisorssolidly to allow for application of extrusion and rotational force.Care must be used to avoid using excessive amounts of force,particularly with extraction forceps, as fracture of the tooth orsurrounding regional bone can occur. Extraction forceps arebest utilised after significant disruption to the PDL has occurred. Additional instruments are available for loosening teeth (Fig 7 ). Dental luxators may theoretically be used either in conjunction with dental elevators or alone. Dental luxatorshave the advantage of a sharper, thinner working tip that ismore malleable than a dental elevator; these instrumentsprimarily cut the PDL and rely little on rotational force toachieve PDL disruption. Unfortunately, the more malleableand delicate construction of these tools limits their functionalityand longevity in the equid. Osteotomes are another instrumentdescribed for the use of PDL breakdown (Rucker and Wilson2009). Osteotomes are thin, flat, sharp and semi-rigidinstruments that are double-bevelled and advanced with lighttapping from a mallet. Osteotomes rely on cutting andwedging to break down the supporting structures of the tooth.Small osteotomes can be placed into the PDL space, but dueto their shape, they are unable to continually trace the path ofthe PDL as the tooth shape changes. As a result, osteotomeswill break down the PDL, alveolar bone, and potentiallyadjacent or interproximal bone. A surgical approach is highlyrecommended with this instrument to avoid unintendedtrauma to surrounding soft tissues and/or adjacent teeth.Osteotomes can work quite well for multiple extractions ordifficult, surgical extraction where ankylosis of the PDL hasoccurred. Small osteotomes, 4 or 6 mm, are best forperforming work that is more precise. Many manufacturershave advanced chisels and gouges as an option forextraction, and it is common in equine dental catalogues tofind chisels and gouges labelled as dental elevators. It isimportant for a practitioner to be able to discern theseinstruments from the true periodontal dental elevatorsdiscussed above. Chisels and gouges are single-bevelled andcan be flat or curved and are very sharp and rigid in nature.They are highly effective at breaking down soft, dental and bony tissue, and will cause ample regional destruction anddebris when used for extraction. Therefore, their use is notadvocated to perform a more precise extraction withreduced trauma to adjacent, healthy tissue. Other necessary equipment for simple extraction includes the following. Bone curettes, bone files and smalldouble-action rongeurs to debride debris from alveoli andsmooth jagged bone margins post extraction. Sterile saline or0.12% chlorhexidine is useful to flush the alveolus and surgicalsite prior to formation of the final blood clot. Surgical extractions entail the use of more specialised equipment.

Bone removal will require the useof a drill or osteotome. A pneumatic surgical drill, high-speedwater-cooled dental drill (iM3 Dental Unit) 7, or an electric low-speed high-torque dental drill can be employed toremove bone. All drills require some form of water irrigationduring use to prevent thermal injury to healthy tissue. In thepast, bone removal has been performed mostly with anosteotome or chisel and mallet or bone rongeurs. The drilldramatically increases the practitioner's ability to removebone precisely, avoid damage to adjacent tooth and bone,respond to extraction complications (reserve crown or rootfracture), and handle cases that are more challenging in anexacting manner. Each drill type will have its own specific burs.Carbide cutting burs (8 flutes) 4 mm, 6 mm and 8 mm indiameter work well for equine bone removal. In cases wheremultiple neighbouring incisors are to be extracted, small, fineosteotomes can be used with a mallet to remove bone. Finally,suture material should be a short duration absorbingmonofilament such as 2-0 poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl) 8on a reverse cutting needle. Some horses have developed labialulcers due to the use of stiff monofilament; therefore, the option of using 2-0 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl)8on a reverse cutting needle may be considered although it is braided and lessoptimal for use in the oral cavity. Extraction techniques Advances in canine and incisor extraction techniques haveincluded concurrent improvements in patient managementduring the procedure, the surgical approach and theequipment used. There are a handful of publicationsregarding these techniques published over the last 10 years(Baratt and Galloway 2007; Rucker and Schumacher and Earley2013), and all demonstrate advances over simple(nonsurgical) elevation for allincisor and canine teeth performed mostly with a dental elevator, chisel/gouge,extraction forceps and brute force that resulted in significantuncontrolled, collateral damage of adjacent healthy tissues. Prior to starting any extraction, the horse needs to be properly restrained and sedated. A complete oral Fig 8: Incising gingival attachments for simple extraction. Fig 9: Beginning dental elevation.

Fig 11: Once the tooth has been significantly loosened, extractionforceps or Lane's bone holding forceps (as seen in image) are usedto apply extrusion and light rotational forces to the \u00a9 2014 2014examination, intraoral radiographs and all necessary occlusaladjustments should be performed before extraction, so theoral speculum will not need to be placed on the surgical sitepost operatively. Flushing of the extraction site and surroundingtissue with antimicrobial rinse to remove major debris anddecrease bacterial populations prior to extraction produces acleaner working site with decreased contamination.Intraoperative and/or post operative radiographs arerecommended for every extraction procedure to ensure noremaining dental material exists and to providedocumentation of the procedure and lack of adjacent hardtissue damage. Preoperative use of antibiotics and/or anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug will vary depending onindividual case presentations and clinician preference.Practitioners should ensure patients are current on tetanusvaccination. Sedation and regional anaesthesia Extraction procedures can be performed standing or undergeneral anaesthesia depending on the patient's demeanour,the procedure to be performed, the surgical facilities, and thesurgeon's preference. Standing sedation mitigates the risksassociated with general anaesthesia, but general anaesthesiaensures a motionless horse with less time devoted toanaesthetic adjustments. Both simple and surgical extractions(including the extraction of all incisor teeth) can be performedstanding with a constant rate infusion of detomidine(Dormosedan) 9with the addition of an opioid and regional/local nerve blocks. Techniques for multimodal paincontrol and constant rate infusions for prolonged surgicalprocedures ( >1 h) have been well 2004; Goodrich 2009; Valverde 2010; Clutton . 2008b; Doherty and Schumacher 2011; Rawlinson 2011). In some horses, especially those with EOTRH,additional local nerve blocks (regional soft tissue perfusion,periodontal and infrabony) may be necessary to provideacceptable surgical site anaesthesia. Incisor: simple (nonsurgical) extraction Extraction of persistent deciduous and singular incisors (not involving EOTRH) attachments gingival PDL fibresare sharply dissected with either a scalpel blade (No. 11 or 15works best) or sharp dental elevator or luxators ( Fig 8 ). The instrument tip is vertically placed in the gingival sulcus thenangled 10-15 degrees into the tooth to ensure engagementwithin the PDL space and avoid deflection into surroundingalveolar bone. The instrument is advanced up to 1 cmcircumferentially although sharp dissection of the maxillarypalatal and mandibular labial aspects of teeth may bechallenging and sometimes not performed. Once the gingivalattachments are disrupted, advancement of a sharp dentalelevator into the periodontal ligament space will start tobreakdown the PDL ( Fig 9 ). When a point of purchase is achieved, the elevator is rotated in a controlled manner andheld in place for 10-20 s after which it is advanced slightlyfurther and pressure re-applied. Constant application of acontrolled force is superior to 'wiggling' the tooth as the PDL isdesigned to withstand short bursts of masticatory forces butnot long, slow, constant pressure. The mesial and distal aspectsof the teeth provide the best access upon initiation ofelevation. Once the tooth develops slight mobility, theelevator can be worked around the palatolingual and labialaspects ( Fig 10 ). Elevators should remain engaged on the tooth surface within the PDL space to avoid necessarydamage to adjacent bone. The size and conformation of thedental elevator used to elevate an incisor may change as theconformation and size of the reserve crown and root altersdeeper in the alveolus. With time, the PDL starts to fatigue andthe tooth becomes increasingly mobile. Extraction forceps canbe used at this point to apply continued alternating clockwiseand anticlockwise rotation down the long axis of the tooth(Fig 11 ). Extrusion force is continually applied with the rotation of the forceps until the tooth is extracted. Once the tooth isremoved, the alveolus is debrided, flushed, and bone marginssmoothed ( Fig 12 ). The site is either left open or partially closed in a cruciate pattern with resorbable suture to help maintainthe blood clot ( Fig 13 ). Some practitioners may elect to pack the open alveolus with gauze, but this may dislodge or prevent Fig 12: Debridement of the alveolus. Fig 13: The alveolus is left open to heal by second intention in this case because raising a flap to close primarily would risk theperiodontal health of surrounding teeth. Gel form has beentemporarily placed in the alveolus to control haemorrhage andencourage blood clot formation. \u00a9 2014 Ltd664 EDUCATION / AE / December 2014a) b) c)d) e) f) Fig 14: Steps to the surgical extraction of 3 maxillary incisors in a cadaveric specimen to improve visualisation of anatomy. A mucogingival flap is created (a) and a periosteal elevator is used to separate the soft tissue from the bone (b). The flap is elevated to just past themucogingival junction (c) and the mucosal periosteum is transected at the base of the flap to allow advancement and tension freeclosure (d). A drill is used to remove 60-80% of the labial alveolar bone (e), and the teeth are elevated from the alveolus (f). Extractionforceps are used to remove the tooth once it is loose (g), and the alveolus is debrided and flushed. A diamond bur on a high-speed drillor bone rongeurs are used to smooth the bone margins (h). The flap is positioned to ensure coverage of the surgical site in a tension freemanner (i), and sutured in a simple interrupted pattern (j). \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd665 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014the development of an alveolar blood clot, which is vital toproper and expeditious alveolar healing. Incisor: surgical extraction In cases of periodontally healthy singular incisors, multipleincisors and incisors with EOTRH, a surgical approach allows forimproved visualisation, reduced accidental damage tohealthy teeth and tissue, meticulous debridement of diseasedtissue and dental remnants, and primary closure ( Fig 14a-j ). A surgical approach is also recommended for extractions wherereserve crowns and roots have been fractured due to traumaor resorption. A surgical approach to incisor extraction involves the creation of a labial mucogingival periosteal flap to revealunderlying tooth and bone. The overall structure of the flap istrapezoid with the base being larger than the gingival margin,and upon closure, the flap should be tension free withsupported suture lines. Flap creation is dependent on thetooth/teeth being extracted, but usually entails the creation ofa mesial and distal releasing incision extending the length ofthe attached gingiva to just beyond the mucogingivaljunction. Care is taken when extending the incision beyondthe mucogingival junction to avoid important regional bloodvessels that will nourish the flap for healing. Releasing incisionsare made apical to occlusal in a singular stroke using firmpressure to cut through the periosteum. Gingival attachmentscan be either sharply dissected as previously described or cutcleanly from the occlusal aspect of the flap with either a scalloped or linear incision a few millimetres apical to thegingival sulcus. The flap is elevated off the bone by working theperiosteal elevator between bone and periosteum. Initiationof flap elevation should begin in the mucosa as it is easier toplace the periosteal elevator in the correct plane of dissectionunder the periosteum. Elevation should continue along thereleasing incision in an occlusal direction until an entire edgeof the flap is released; the periosteal elevator is then redirectedparallel to the occlusal incision and advanced under thegingiva and mucosa until the flap is completely free.Description of a singular gingival releasing incision down thelong axis of the tooth has been described (Klugh 2010b); thistechnique is not recommended, as it is does not allow foroptimal visualisation of bone and ensures that the closure willbe unsupported, jeopardising rapid healing. Once the bone is exposed, roughly 60-80% of labial bone overlying the reserve crown and root is removed with a drillmaking sure to extend bone removal to the mesial and distalperiodontal ligament space. If multiple teeth are to beextracted, interproximal bone may also be removed with thedrill to allow for easier dental elevation. Efficient use of anosteotome to remove the labial bone has been described(Rucker and Wilson 2009), but the drill will provide for work thatis more precise. Removing labial bone allows for easier accessto the PDL space for instrument placement and decreases PDLattachments allowing for a cleaner and quicker extraction. g) i) h) j) Fig 14: Continued. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd666 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014Once the bone is removed, dental elevation and extraction are performed as previously described. After extraction, thesurgical site is debrided and flushed, bone margins smoothed,and wound edges freshened. Intraoperative radiographs arerecommended at this point to ensure all dental material hasbeen removed. Prior to closure, the inflexible, mucosalperiosteum is incised along the base of flap to allow forincreased advancement of the flap. Gentle, blunt dissectionwith Metzenbaum scissors of underlying muscle at the base ofthe flap may be necessary to obtain a tension free closure. Themucogingival flap can be partially or completely closed depending on the nature of the extraction and pathology.Primary closure is optimal and should be sought. Absorbablesutures are placed in a simple interrupted pattern with roughly4-5 mm spacing. Canine extraction A surgical extraction approach is necessary for removal ofcanine teeth due to the length of the reserve crown and rootsituated within a sometimes curved alveolus ( Fig 15 ). A a) b) c)d) g) h) i)e) f) Fig 15: Steps to extraction of the maxillary canine tooth in a cadaveric specimen to improve visualisation. The mucogingival flap is created (a) cutting apical to coronal through the periosteum in one stroke (b). The flap is elevated starting in the mucosa (c) to ease placementof elevator under the periosteum. The periosteal elevator is then directed coronally to release one full edge of the flap (d) and redirectedto elevate along the mucogingival junction (e) until the entire flap is released (f). The periosteum underlying the mucosa is transectedalong the base of the flap (g). The labial bone is removed with a drill (h), and the tooth is elevated (i). When loose, extraction forceps areused to remove tooth from alveolus (j), and sharp bone margins are smoothed with a round diamond bur or ronguers (k). The site isdebrided (l) and flushed (m). Margins are freshened with scissors (n), and the wound is closed in a simple interrupted pattern (o). \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd667 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / 2014mucogingival flap with mesial and distal releasing incisions willneed to be raised to expose the underlying labial bone. Flapdesign is similar to that previously discussed. The flap designshould be trapezoidal in nature with a wide base and extendthrough the gingiva and into the mucosa transecting theperiosteum in one stroke always cutting apical to occlusal toavoid slipping of the blade into the mucosa. mesial releasing incision should extend 2-3 cmtowards from the mesial aspect of the tooth. Themaxillary distal releasing incision runs directly caudal from thedistal aspect of the tooth for 1-2 cm and is then directed in adistoapical direction for another 2-3 cm. The mandibularmesial releasing incision is made in the interproximal spacebetween the canine and the distal distal releasing incision runs directly caudalfrom the distal aspect of the tooth for 3-4 cm only due to thelingual direction of the tooth within the mandible ( Fig 16a-c ). The flap is elevated initially in the mucosal to gingival direction,and once a full edge of the flap has been released, isundermined mesial to distal. With the bone exposed, 60-80%of the labial alveolar bone plate is removed with a drill toallow for dental elevation. Care should be taken to ensure theentire labial bone plate is removed from the most mesial tothe most distal aspect of the tooth. Any overhanging orincompletely removed labial bone, will drastically reduce theease of dental elevation. When the tooth is exposed, a dentalelevator is used to fatigue the periodontal ligament and thetooth is removed with extraction forceps. All bone marginsshould be smoothed, the periosteum released, wound marginsfreshened, and the alveolus debrided and flushed clearof debris. Radiographs prior to closure are recommendedto ensure the removal of all dental material. The flap issutured closed in a simple interrupted pattern as previouslydescribed.Sometimes, severely resorbed teeth make complete extraction particularly challenging, and there has beendiscussion within the dental community as to whether clinicalcrown amputation is acceptable. There is no studydocumenting the long-term success of this procedure inhorses; however, in cats with severe tooth resorption, crownamputation is acceptable and successful if no periodontalligament or regional bone pathology or infection is visible onradiographs (DuPont 2002). Whether horses are similar to catsin this manner is unknown. EOTRH as described by Staszyk et al . (2008b) has various degrees andinfection, bulbous hypercementosis, and inflammatory tissue.Leaving inflamed and infected dental material and/or bonebehind would be most likely to perpetuate post operativeregional inflammation and infection. The practitioner and theowner should carefully weigh the pros and cons of thisapproach if resorption is severe enough for this procedure tobe considered. Surgical extraction of teeth may sound simple, but experience demonstrates how challenging this procedurecan be, especially when first learning all the stepsinvolved. Extensive surgical extractions, especially thoseinvolving EOTRH, can be complicated and frustratingfor experienced veterinary dentists, and a practitionershould evaluate his ability to perform this procedure(training, experience, instrumentation, etc.) beforeattempting it. Case referral may be in the best interest of thepatient. Post surgical care Post operative pain medication and antibiotics may beindicated depending on the extent of the extractiontechnique. The animal is withheld from food and water untilcompletely recovered from sedation. Post operative feeding j) n) l) k) o)m) Fig 15: Continued. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd668 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014regimens may vary at different facilities, but the main focus is to ensure gastrointestinal motility post extended sedation orgeneral anaesthesia. One option for a post operative dietaryregimen is to feed a pellet or bran mash for 12 h as soft soakedhay is reintroduced over 24 h. Once faeces is produced, asofter, less stemmy hay is recommended for the extent of thehealing period for incisor extractions. Grazing for short periodsis acceptable. Canine tooth extraction requires no alterationto the diet after the first 24 h. Owners are instructed to gentlyirrigate the extraction sites twice daily until healed with warmwater to remove food and environmental debris thatbecomes entrapped in alveoli and suture. Dehiscence iscommon with surgical extraction sites (with little long-termclinical significance) and owners should closely monitor extraction sites for signs of continued healing. Horses with severe EOTRH display surprisingly little discomfort after extraction of all incisors. Post operative pain iscontrolled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicationand an antibiotic is given to treat and prevent infection for7-10 days. An evaluation of 22 horses undergoing partial orcomplete extraction demonstrated low morbidity postoperatively (Baratt 2011). The most severe complicationencountered was a case of sensitivity during eating for thepost operative period (one week) that resolved withadministration of phenylbutazone. Horses with no incisors areable to eat hay, and many owners and veterinarians reportthat these horses can graze by grasping forage with the lipsand pulling. Although it is impressive that these horses cangraze, the owners will need to monitor the horse's bodycondition to develop an appropriate nutritional plan as it maybe challenging for some horses to maintain themselves onpasture alone. Therefore, owners will need to be aware thatsupplementation with hay, hay stretchers, dengi, senior feed orsimilar may be necessary. Once healed, horses will be able toreturn to full work, and many owners report improveddisposition and increased energy. Complications Mucogingival flaps in the incisor and canine region of thehorse are notorious for dehiscence and Wilson and Earley 2013) ( Fig 17 ). The underlying reason is not known, although the time devoted tomastication, frenulum attachment, gravity, tongue action anddevitalisation of the flap during creation may all play a role.Dehiscence, if present, usually occurs 3-7 days postoperatively when granulation tissue, partial primary closureand wound contraction have already started to occur at thesurgical margin. Sutures involved with the dehiscence areremoved, and the owner is instructed to flush debris from thewound daily with warm water until complete healing hasoccurred by second intention (usually 2-5 weeks; Fig 18 ). The removal of all or most of the incisors may lead to extrusion of the tongue beyond the labial margin when thehorse is at rest or relaxed; however, the degree of extrusionvaries between horses. Tongue protrusion can be a problem a) b) c) Fig 16: Mandibular mucogingival flap creation with releasing incisions in the interproximal space between the canine andlateral incisor and along the distal aspect of the canine (a and b).Labial bone is removed following the path of the tooth and bothreleasing incisions are clearly visible (c). Fig 17: Dehiscence of VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / December 2014for horses in show where this is considered a violation, buthorses appear to suffer no physical or mental distress as a resultof this complication ( Fig 19 ). Incomplete extraction and continued infection is the most likely complication resulting from this procedure especially inteeth affected by EOTRH. Heavy handed extractiontechniques or the use of lateral, side-to-side, forces can easilyresult in the fracture of the reserve crown and roots. Teethweakened by pathology or with ankylotic PDLs can also lead to fracture even with the most refined extraction techniques.Retained dental fragments can be isolated and extractedwith further bone removal via the drill and small dentalelevators. If fragments are small enough, sharp bone curettesor Simms curettes can be used for removal (Rucker and Wilson2009). If performed correctly, complications associated with heavy bleeding, fracture, adjacent tooth trauma andinappetence post operatively should not be encountered. Conclusion In conclusion, extraction of equine incisor and canine teethcan be rewarding for both the horse and practitioner whenperformed in a manner that utilises the advances in extractiontechniques and instrumentation.

Brief Summary: See package insert for full prescribing information. Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Description TILDREN is a sterile powder. Each vial of TILDREN contains 500 mg of tiludronic acid (as tiludronate disodium) and 250 mg mannitol USP (excipient). Indication TILDREN is indicated for the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. Contraindications Do not use in horses with known hypersensitivity to tiludronate disodium or to mannitol. Do not use in horses with impaired renal function or with a history of renal disease. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Warnings Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. NSAIDs should not be used concurrently with TILDREN. Concurrent use of NSAIDs with TILDREN may increase the risk of renal toxicity and acute renal failure. Appropriate wash-out periods should be observed between NSAID and TILDREN administration, and BUN and creatinine should be monitored. If treatment for discomfort is required after TILDREN administration, a non-NSAID treatment should be used. Human Warnings Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. Precautions Approximately 30-45% of horses administered TILDREN will demonstrate transient signs consistent with abdominal pain (colic). Hand-walking the horse may improve or resolve the colic signs in many cases. If a horse requires medical therapy, non-NSAID treatments should be administered due to the risk for renal toxicity. Avoid NSAID use. TILDREN should be administered slowly and evenly over 90 minutes to minimize the risk of adverse reactions. Horses should be well hydrated prior to administration of TILDREN due to the potential nephrotoxic effects of TILDREN. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution, and if administered, renal function should be monitored. Caution should be used when administering TILDREN to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), hypocalcemia, etc.) and conditions which may be exacerbated by hypocalcemia (e.g. cardiac disease). TILDREN should be used with caution in horses receiving concurrent administration of other drugs that may reduce serum calcium (such as tetracyclines) or whose toxicity may exacerbate a reduction in serum calcium (such as aminoglycosides). Horses with HYPP (heterozygous or homozygous) may be at an increased risk for adverse reactions, including colic signs, hyperkalemic episodes, and death. The safe use of TILDREN has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of TILDREN has not been evaluated in pregnant or lactating mares, or in breeding horses. Increased bone fragility has been observed in laboratory animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair microdamage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld efcacy and safety studies were clinical signs consistent with abdominal discomfort or colic. Other reported signs were frequent urination, muscle fasciculations, polyuria with or without polydipsia, and inappetance/anorexia.
