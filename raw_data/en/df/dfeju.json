Tylenol linked to autism? I found several reputable studies online that find a correlation between Tylenol and regressive autism. To me that could make sense in the case of some parents swearing vaccines caused their child's autism. What if it was the Tylenol given before and/or after and not the vaccine? Obviously I am now freaking out because my baby had her 8 week shots yesterday and the pediatrician said she could have her \"safe\" dose of Tylenol every 4 hours if needed. I had given it to her 3 times over the last 24 hours and now never will again unless I absolutely have to. Anybody have some thoughts or experiences with this they'd like to share? Or maybe just reassure me that one of your children had Tylenol as a baby without further issues? Here are the links to the journal articles by the way if anyone is interested: [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0300060517693423](//journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0300060517693423) [http://archive.foundationalmedicinereview.com/publications/14/4/364.pdf](//archive.foundationalmedicinereview.com/publications/14/4/364.pdf) [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Tylenol+linked+to+autism%3F) Not wanting to start a huge debate here.. but it makes me so mad that doctors suggest giving meds after shots. The purpose of shots is for your baby to develop an immunity to them. When babies develop LOW grade fevers from the shots it is their bodies way of immune response. Lowering the fever can make them less effective. Don't get me wrong.. there are definitely times for meds and my son had them plenty. But really make sure they need them after shots! No need to medicate for a low grade fever. tylenol is also a pain reliever. shots hurt. its not just to reduce fever from shots but to help with the area the shot was given! just an fyi not to get so angry with Drs suggestions. I have not had an issue. I have 5 children. my oldest will be 18 this yr and my newest is 2 mo. I did not read the articles but to ease your mind my children are all fine and healthy. Our ped always says to never give Tylenol unless baby is in pain or not sleeping well and visibly uncomfortable. We never really used Tylenol with my first (maybe once or twice when teething but we normally stuck with homeopathic remedies) and haven't yet used Tylenol with our three month old. Honestly though there's a link from everything to everything now a days so I'm sure your baby is totally fine!! I do think it's safer to give Tylenol than run a high fever esp with little ones but we've just never dealt with high fevers needing it. I only looked at one of the links. The one which associates Tylenol and the MMR vaccine. To link an increase in Autism to administering Tylenol after the MMR vaccine seems bizarre. A lot of parents give their kids Tylenol while teething. Yet MMR vaccine just occurs twice. I think you'd have to look at the actual scientific study to draw a conclusion from it. The association between the two seems far fetched If this was the case then more than half the population of kids would have autism! Don't know the point of this. The next thing will be that breastmilk causes autism... You never know which bodies can tolerate which synthetic substances, so my policy is don't risk it if it can be avoided. The sad truth is that autism is becoming more common. I can attest to that simply as a school teacher and having more frequent occurrences in my classroom over the years. I will not be giving my daughter Tylenol. There are other means by which to sooth and calm her: a walk in fresh air, a refreshing bath, snuggles, breastmilk, etc. it's becoming more common. There's tons of studies on it and I see it first hand. No need for insults either. I'm entitled to my view poiny If you are anything like me, it's hard to know if you should even respond to comments like the one left for you. So today I will just acknowledge that your comment was clear and you are allowed to have that opinion, from your own experiences! It was clear you weren't referring the amount of kids who have \"autism\" written on your roll call. (Not saying that is a thing, haha.) You were referencing experiences you have had in the classroom. That's how I feel about it. it's not becoming \"more common\", it's being more accurately diagnosed. Correlating Tylenol with Autism is ridiculous - you may as well correlate the sun coming up to it as well. The children had autism before they took the Tylenol - they were born with it. Stop with the foolish fear-mongering. I'm sure your baby is fine.. you did what you thought was best. I didn't read the articles but try not to stress too much about it. They're are always saying different things cause different things. We're all trying our best. I'm sure you baby will be healthy. You're doing good mama xoxo So I read the abstract and findings of the first study. I can't see where they say there is a correlation. They said there could be, which warrants further study. Absolutely nothing to freak out about. Please ignore the fear-mongering reply. That was so unnecessary. Hyper vigilance is real for moms and you were just processing the newest concern you had. You get to decide how concerning this article is to you and by sharing it so do we. Obviously you can see not everyone is as concerned as you were initially. Maybe that will bring comfort. Or maybe you are still as concerned and you will avoid Tylenol. Either way, a mom forum is a great place to work through that - regardless of some people who would prefer you not do so.
