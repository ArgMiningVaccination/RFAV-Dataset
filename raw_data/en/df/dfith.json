After the initial infection, the viral DNA can remain dormant for years in the cytoplasm of the host neuronal cell. The virus can be reactivated to cause herpes zoster (zoster or shingles) in adults. Herpes zoster causes skin rashes distinct from those produced during the primary infection. The rashes are accompanied by severe pain and may lead to more severe conditions such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), also known as human 3 (HHV-3), is a member of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. VZV is an enveloped virus with a double-stranded DNA genome of about 125,000 nucleotides. The genome of VZV is enclosed by an icosahedral nucleocapsid. A viral tegument (epidermis), located in the space between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope, is a construct consisting of virally-encoded proteins and enzymes. The viral envelope is derived from host cell membranes and contains virally-encoded glycoproteins. The VZV genome encodes seventy (70) or more open reading frames (ORFs), nine (9) of which encode glycoproteins (gE, gI, gB, gH, gK, gN, gL, gC, and gM) that are presumed to function at different stages in the viral replication cycle. Glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for viral replication (Mallory et al. (1997) J. Virol. 71: 8279-8288) and Mo et al. (2002) Virology 304: 176-186), and is the most abundant glycoprotein found in infected cells as well as in mature virions (Grose, 2002, The predominant varicella-zoster virus gE and gI glycoprotein complex, In Structure-function relationships of human pathogenic viruses, Holzenburg and Bogner (eds.), Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, N.Y.). Glycoprotein I (gI) forms a complex with gE in infected cells, thereby promoting endocytosis of both glycoproteins, which are then delivered to the trans-Golgi where the final viral envelope is obtained (Olson and Grose (1998) J. Virol. 72: 1542-1551). Glycoprotein B (gB), which is thought to play an important role in viral entry, has an epitope for a virus neutralizing antibody and is the second most glycoprotein on the surface (Arvin (1996) Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 9: 361-381). Glycoprotein H (gH) is thought to have a fusion function that promotes cell-to-cell spread of the virus. Currently, live attenuated vaccines, which are commonly used to prevent chickenpox or herpes zoster, have several disadvantages. First, there is some evidence that the immunity against VZV infection decreases with time and the effect of the vaccine disappears (Chaves et al. (2007) N. Engl. J. Med. 356: 1121-1129). Thus, the subjects vaccinated with the vaccine may remain susceptible to herpes zoster, which is a more severe condition caused by VZV. In addition, attenuated live vaccines are manufactured using live viruses with weakened pathogenicity, so that vaccination subjects may become susceptible to chickenpox or herpes zoster due to vaccination. In fact, there are several cases of herpes zoster reported to have been caused by the virus strain used in the vaccine (Matsubara et al. (1995) Acta Paediatr Jpn 37: 648-50; et al. (1989) J Infect Dis. 160: 535-7). In addition, due to the live attenuated virus present in the vaccine, the use of the vaccine may be limited for subjects whose immune function is decreased. In order to increase the effect of preventing herpes zoster which re-emerges along the neuronal cells after the dormancy of the virus, it is important to significantly enhance the activation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to VZV antigen rather than the activation of humoral immunity thereto. For this, it is important to increase Th1/Th2 ratio by promoting the activation of Th1 among Th1 and Th2, which are T cells (helper T cells). Therefore, there is a need to develop new herpes zoster vaccine compositions that can selectively increase the cell mediated immune response without having the disadvantages of live attenuated vaccines.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Technical Problem The object of the present invention is to provide a vaccine composition having a high safety and an excellent effect of preventing herpes zoster, which selectively increases the cell mediated immune response without having the disadvantages of live attenuated vaccines.Solution to Problem 1.

The vaccine composition of the present invention greatly increases the production of IgG2c as compared to the production of IgG1. The vaccine composition of the present invention has no possibility of infecting subject with herpes zoster due to vaccination. The vaccine composition of the present invention can be administered even to subjects whose immune function is decreased. The vaccine composition of the present invention has a long-lasting preventive effect. The present invention relates to a herpes zoster vaccine composition, which comprises glycoprotein E of varicella-zoster virus, a glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, and a metabolisable oil, and has a high safety and an excellent effect of preventing herpes zoster by selectively increasing the cell mediated immune response without having the disadvantages of live attenuated vaccines. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The vaccine composition of the present invention comprises glycoprotein E of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant of the following Formula 1, and a metabolisable oil: wherein, R1, R3, R5 and R2 and R4 are each independently C8-C10 alkyl. The vaccine composition of the present invention comprises glycoprotein E (gE) of VZV. Glycoprotein E (gE) in the present invention means glycoprotein E of VZV or an immunogenic derivative thereof. The immunogenic derivative in the present invention may be the one wherein a part of glycoprotein E is modified. For example, it may be the one wherein a part of glycoprotein E is cut, one or more amino acids of glycoprotein E are replaced by another amino acids, one or more amino acids of glycoprotein E are removed, one or more amino acids are added to glycoprotein E, or one or more amino acids of glycoprotein E are chemically modified. For example, glycoprotein E of the present invention may be represented by the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. The vaccine composition of the present invention comprises a glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant of the following Formula 1 and a metabolisable oil: wherein, R1, R3, R5 and R2 and R4 are each independently C8-C10 alkyl. For example, R2 and may be C8 alkyl, C9 alkyl, or C10 alkyl. According to a more specific example, R2 and R4 may be C9 alkyl or C10 alkyl. For example, R2 and R4 may be C9 alkyl. The term \"metabolisable oil\" as used herein means an oil whose structure is modified by metabolism, and includes vegetable oils, fish oils, animal oils, and synthetic oils, which have no biotoxicity and may undergo structural changes upon metabolic progression. According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the metabolisable oil of the present invention is squalene. Squalene is a hydrocarbon of triterpene backbone having 30 carbons. A variety of squalenes commonly known in the art to be used as metabolisable oils or emulsions may be used, for example, squalene from shark liver oil. An exemplary composition of squalene is described in Fox C B et al. (2013) Vaccine 31 (49): 5848-55. In order to increase the effect of preventing herpes zoster, it is important to significantly enhance the activation of cell mediated immunity (CMI) to VZV antigens while minimizing the activation of humoral immunity thereto. High levels of Th2-specific cytokines favor induction of a humoral immune response to the provided antigen, while high levels of Th1-specific cytokines tend to prefer induction of cell mediated immune response (CMI) to the provided antigen. Thus, the more Th1-specific cytokines are generated than the Th2-specific cytokine, the higher the degree of activation of the cell mediated immune response becomes than that of the humoral immune response. Also, the greater the number of cells simultaneously producing two or more cytokines out of IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2, the higher the degree of activation of the cell mediated immune response. In addition, as the degree of activation of the cell mediated immune response becomes higher than that of the humoral immune response, the production of IgG2c antibody is greatly increased as compared to that of IgG1 antibody. The vaccine composition of the present invention can greatly increase the degree of activation of the cell mediated immune response rather than that of the humoral immune response in the body of a subject. For example, the vaccine composition of the present invention can significantly increase the production of Th1-specific cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and (IL-2)) as compared to the production Th2-specific cytokines (e.g., interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and the like), in the body of a subject. Also, for example, the vaccine composition of the present invention is capable of greatly increasing the number of cells simultaneously producing two or more cytokines out of IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 than the number of cells producing only one cytokine out of the above cytokines, among activated Th1 cells. In addition, for example, the vaccine composition of the present invention can greatly increase the production of gE-specific IgG antibodies in the body of a subject and, especially, can greatly increase the production of gE-specific IgG2c antibodies as compared to that of gE-specific IgG1 antibodies. The vaccine composition of the present invention may contain 5 g to 100 g of glycoprotein E in a single dose. For example, it may contain 5 g to 80 g, specifically 5 g to 70 g, more specifically 5 g to 60 g, and most specifically 5 g to 50 g of glycoprotein E in a single dose. The vaccine composition of the present invention may contain 7.5 g to 20 g, specifically 9 g to 18 g, more specifically, 9 g to 16 g, and most specifically 10 g to 15 g of the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant in a single dose. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the vaccine composition of the present invention may contain 13 g to 17 g of the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant in a single dose. When the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant is included in the above range, the cell mediated immune response can be selectively maximized. The vaccine composition of the present invention may contain 1 to 7% (v/v), more specifically 1 to 5% (v v), and most specifically 1 to 4% (v/v) of the metabolisable oil in a single dose. In addition to glycoprotein E, the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, and the metabolisable oil, the vaccine composition of the present invention may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, and the like. For example, the vaccine composition of the present invention may contain physiological saline or PBS (phosphate buffered saline). The vaccine composition of the present invention can be formulated and packaged in various forms. According to one embodiment, the first vial containing glycoprotein E but not comprising the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant and the metabolisable oil, and the second vial containing the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant and the metabolisable oil but not comprising glycoprotein E may be separately packaged, and mixed prior to use (bedside mixing). According to another embodiment, a vaccine composition comprising all of glycoprotein E, the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant and the metabolic oil may be packaged in a vial, a syringe (prefilled syringe), or the like.MODE FOR THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to experimental examples.

After 28 days from the LAV priming (Day 0), various VZV vaccine compositions with or without VZV protein immunogen or adjuvant were administered by intramuscular injection to perform secondary immunization. In order to measure the humoral immune response to VZV, blood samples were taken once at the LAV priming point, and 28 days and 42 days thereafter (Day 0, Day 28 and Day 42), respectively, and leukocytes were collected from spleen samples 42 days after the LAV priming (Day 42) to measure CMI (cell-mediated immune response) against VZV. The experimental design for primary immunization (LAV priming), secondary immunization (Immunization), and immune response measurement is summarized as shown in Table 1 below. In Table 1 below, gE refers to VZV glycoprotein E of SEQ ID NO: 1, LAV refers to live attenuated virus, SLA refers to the glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant of Formula 1 wherein R2 and R4 are C9 alkyl, and SE refers to squalene. SLA and squalene were obtained from the Infectious Disease Research Institute (Seattle, US) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), respectively. Alum hydroxide Class B CpG oligonucleotide-Murine TLR9 ligand. In addition, the days of immunization, blood sample collection, and spleen sample collection were calculated from Day 0 as the day of LAV priming. After performing the primary immunization and the secondary immunization, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) was carried out for measuring VZV antigen-specific IgG titer. A recombinant gE protein or VZV antigen (1 g/mL) was coated onto an ELISA plate and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The ELISA plate was washed three times and blocking was carried out with PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) solution containing 2% BSA (Bovine serum albumin) for 1 hour. After washing the ELISA plate, diluted serum samples were added thereto and incubated added thereto and incubated for 1 hour. After the final incubation, the ELISA plate was washed and the HRP reaction was induced by the addition of TMB (3, 3, 5, 5-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate. The HRP reaction was stopped by adding ELISA stop solution and optical density (OD) was measured using a spectrometer at a wavelength of 450 nm.Experimental Example 2-2: Method for Measuring VZV Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay (ELISPOT Assay) After performing the primary secondary immunization, mouse IFN- ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assay was immune response (CMI).

Seven and cytokine detection beads were reacted together for 2 hours, the beads were washed, and the amounts of cytokines in the supernatant were determined.Experimental Example 2-4: Method for Determining the Distribution of Cytokine-Secreting Cells (ICS Assay) After performing the primary immunization and the secondary immunization, the secretion of Th1-specific cytokines was measured by confirm the antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response. Leukocytes collected from mice were stimulated overnight with gE protein and, at this time, GolgiStop (BFA)/GolgiPlug (monensin) was also added to prevent cytokines in the cells from being secreted to the outside. After washing the stimulated leukocytes, the cell surface of leukocytes was labeled with antibodies (7-AAD, CD3-FITC, CD4-V500) to identify T cells. After the completion of the reaction, the leukocytes were washed, permeabilized, and subjected to a reaction with antibodies (TNF--PE, IFN--APC, IL-2-V450) which can be bound to cytokines to confirm the presence of cytokines in the cells. After the reaction, the leukocytes were washed and fixed, and the distribution of the cells secreting cytokines by the antigen stimulation was analyzed.Experimental Example 2-5: Method for Determining IFN- Cytokine Secreted by gE Antigen Stimulation (IFN- ELISA) After performing the primary immunization and the secondary immunization, IFN- ELISA assay was carried out to determine the secretion amount of IFN-, a typical effector cytokine secreted by T cells by antigen stimulation. Leukocytes collected from mice were stimulated with gE protein or gE overlapping peptide for 3 days and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant, which was then analyzed with a mouse IFN- ELISA kit. IFN- capture antibody (4 g/mL) was coated onto an ELISA plate and incubated overnight at room temperature. The ELISA plate was washed three times and blocking was carried out with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour. After washing the ELISA plate, the supernatant obtained by stimulating leukocytes was added thereto and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After washing the ELISA plate, biotinylated mouse IFN- detection antibody (400 ng/mL) was added thereto and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After washing, streptavidin-HRP was added thereto and incubated again for 20 minutes. After the incubation, the ELISA plate was washed and reacted with a substrate solution at room temperature for 20 minutes.
