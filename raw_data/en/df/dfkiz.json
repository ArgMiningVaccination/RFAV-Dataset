Introduction Breast cancer is the most common type of nonskin malig- nancy among women worldwide. It has been reported thatthe incidence and mortality of breast cancer have increased during the last two decades [ 1-3]. Based on 2006-2010 statistics,thenumberofdeathsintheUnitedStateswas22.6 per 100,000 women per year. It is predicted that estimated 232,670newcasesofbreastcancerand40,000breastcancer-related deaths will occur among women in 2014 worldwide[4]. It has been shown that the progression of primary and secondarytumorsintounlimitedproliferationhasavitalrole in pathogenesis of breast cancer. Breast cancer progression variessignificantlyindifferentcasesduetothefactthattumor malignancies differ in molecular characteristics, prognosis, and invasiveness [ 5]. Early diagnosis of breast cancer usingcurrent methods of early detection allows for more effective treatment of breast cancer. Mammography as the most reli-ableoptionremainsthefirstscreeningtestforearlydetectionof breast cancer [ 6,7]. Although many treatment methods are currently established including surgery, radiotherapy, biological therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy, these therapies are less effective and recurrence is still anissue in breast cancer patients due to side effects, toxicityof drugs in normal cells, and aggressive behaviour of thetumors [8-11] .I ns p i t eo fm a n yi m p r o v e m e n t si nt h eu s eo f hormonal and adjuvant cytotoxic therapies for breast cancerpatients, there has been no considerable reduction in them o r t a l i t yo fb r e a s tc a n c e rt o d a y[ 5]. The treatment success rate remains unsatisfactory, thus it is essential to find other adjuvantmethodsforbreastcancertherapy.Complementary andalternativemedicine(CAM)asoneofthemajoraspects Hindawi Publishing Corporation BioMed Research International Volume 2014, Article ID 785479, 15 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/7854792 BioMedResearchInternational of cancer therapy has been developed in the last few years in order to alleviate the side effects of drugs and relievet h ep a i ni nb r e a s tc a n c e rp a t i e n t s[ 12]. Several studies have been carried out to observe the effects of CAM in breastcancer patients. CAM may be valuable for optimizing theconventional therapy [ 13,14]. Medicinal plants can be used in combination with conventional medicine as a supportive therapy to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). IthasbeenshownthattheuseofsometypesofCAMinbreastcancer patients has dramatically increased and is gaining inpopularity[ 15-17]. 2. Mistletoe As an anthroposophical medicine, mistletoe is one of the most important herbal drugs and is potentially effective againstcancer[ 18].Usingmistletoeextractforcancertherapy especially breast cancer is recommended due to its minimalside effects and the fact that these side effects are not lifethreatening. A few cases of allergic reactions have beenreported [ 19]. Rudolf Steiner, founder of anthroposophy medicalmethod,introducedmistletoeextractintooncologyas an unconventional means of therapy for cancer in 1920[20]. 2.1. Mistletoe Active Compounds. M i s t l e t o ei sa ne v e r g r e e n semiparasitic shrub ( Figure1)f r o mt h eV i s c a c e a e( L o r a n - thaceae) family with various types which can grow on thebranches of different deciduous trees like tea, apple, pine,mango, lime, larch, pear, oak, and some other plants [ 21, 22]. Worldwide, approximately 1500 species of mistletoe have been identified [ 22]. As depicted in Figures 2and3 various kinds of mistletoe have been selected by researchersto study their anticancer effect. Mistletoe contains differenttypes of The chemical compositionofmistletoevariesdependingonthetechniquesof extract preparation, season and time of harvesting, com-mercial producer, stage of growth of the plant, location,and species of host tree [ 30,31]. Lectins (ML-I, ML-II, and ML-III) are the main constituents of mistletoe which areresponsibleforitsantitumorandimmunomodulatoryeffects[32-34]. Today, most researchers have focused their studies o nm i s t l e t o el e c t i n s ,p a r t i c u l a r l ym i s t l e t o el e c t i nI( M L - I). The mistletoe lectins are glycoproteins belonging to the ribosome inactivating proteins family type II. They consistof an A-chain of 254 amino acids (MW 28.480kDa) and of amino acids toeachotherbyadisulphidebridge[ 35]. The anticancer hololectin. Cytotoxic A-chain inhibits the elongationstepofproteinbiosynthesisbycatalysinghydrolysisoftheN-glycosidic bond at adenine-4324 in the 28S RNA of the 60Ss u b u n i to fr i b o s o m e s ,r e s u l t i n gi na p o p t o s i so rn e c r o s i sc e l ldeath [36,37]. The immunomodulatory activity of mistletoe Figure1:Mistletoeonhosttree. lectin is to B-chain manifested by enhancing the secretion of cytokines and the activity of natural killer cells[38,39]. Significant increases of natural killer and helper T- c e l l st h a ta r eg e n e r a l l yb e l i e v e dt ob ei n v o l v e di na n t i t u m o ractivity have been observed in 20 mammary carcinomapatientswhoreceivedML-1bysubcutaneousinjections[ 40]. In a recent study by Maletzki et al. in 2013 [ 41], it has been stated that there is high resemblance between the 3D structureofmistletoelectinandtheshigatoxinfrom Shigella dysenteriae , which represents the bacterial origin of this protein. This finding justifies the significant immunogenic-ity of mistletoe lectin. Moreover, the researchers suggestedcombining mistletoe lectin with other forms of recognitionreceptor ligand substances to enhance the immune and Lyu in 2012 [ 42] .Th e i rr e s u l t ss h o w e dm o d e r a t et o negligible protective ability of VCA to various mutagens inS. typhimurium to bind cytokinins with high affinity. Their findingssuggested possible relation of this protein to the groupofphytohormone-(cytokinin)-bindingproteins.StauderandKreuser reviewed the preclinical studies and clinical trialsin terms of mistletoe lectins (ML-I) in cancer populations.They reported immunostimulating and cytotoxic effects ofmistletoeextractinnumerouspreclinicalexperiments.More-over, they suggested that more high quality, well plannedrandomized clinical trials are needed to verify the effect ofm i s t l e t o eM LIo nt h ei m p r o v e m e n to fH R Q o Li nc a n c e r patients [ 44] .A p a r tf r o mt h em i s t l e t o el e c t i n s ,v i s c o t o x i n s are the most important substances of mistletoe. Visco-toxins are polypeptides consisting of 46 amino acids andthree disulphide bridges. It is well known that they haveimmunogenic effects [ 45,46]. In addition to viscotoxin and lectins, mistletoe contains other types of peptides known asKuttan's peptides. It shows some immunostimulatory andcytotoxiceffectsagainsttumorcells[ 47].Viscum album (VA) is the European type of mistletoe which has been widelystudied by researchers. Numerous preparations of this plantfrom different host trees like apple, pine, oak, and othershave been used. Many mistletoe extract preparations therapy for the treatment of cancer [ 48]. While numerous studies concerning V. album have been reported, few investigation of V. cruciatum have been carried out. As recommendedbyLevetal.in2011[ 49],targetingresearchon thisplantwouldbebeneficialincancercare. 3. Preclinical Studies 3.1. In Vitro Studies. Several preclinical studies and in vitro experimentshaveinvestigatedtheanticancereffectofmistle- toe extract and its active compounds in breast cancer and predominantlyreportedtheirantitumorandcytotoxiceffects incancercelllines( Table 1).Theyallagreeonthispointthat mistletoeextractsexhibitsubstantialcytotoxiceffects coloratum areknownasKoreanmistletoes which belong to Loranthaceae family and have been used as a traditional medicine in Korea. It has been shown that isolatedtriterpenoidsandtriterpenoidsaponinof Viscumliq- uidambaricolum represent cytotoxic activity towards MCF7 assay [ 51]. African researchers studied the antibreast ofCameroonian mistletoe using MB-MDA 435 cell line. Theirfindingsdemonstratedsignificantreductionofbreastcancercellviabilityaftermistletoetreatment[ 52]. In another study, IranianresearchersinvestigatedthecytotoxiceffectofIranianm i s t l e t o eo nb r e a s tc a n c e rc e l ll i n eM C F 7u s i n gM TTa s s a y .They found the mistletoe plants growing on hornbeam tree (Carpinus betulus ) effective against breast cancer MCF7.Mistletoeplantjuiceorhydroalcoholicextractshowedthehighestcytotoxicactivityoncancercellline[ 53]. The cytotoxic activity of Dendrophthoe falcata known a sI n d i a nm i s t l e t o eo nM C F 7c e l ll i n eu s i n gM T T ,S R B , and brine shrimp lethality bioassays was studied by Indian researchers. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibitedafter treatment with ethanolic and aqueous extracts of D. falcata.Aqueousextractrepresentedhighercytotoxicactivity [54].InexperimentsusingAmericanmistletoe,investigators isolated four novel small proteins, phoratoxins or ligatoxins from acetic acid extract of California an in vitrofluorometric microculture cytotoxic assay. The isolated proteins exhibited cytotoxicity towards various cell lines. TumorcellstreatedwithphoratoxinCexertedhigheractivity. The activity of phoratoxin C was evaluated on the primary culture of human tumor cell from patients. Phoratoxin Cshowed remarkable toxicity against the solid tumor frombreast carcinoma [ 55]. In a further study, the anticancer effects of other types of American mistletoe, Phoradendron serotinum , on proliferation P. serotinum exertedcytotoxicactivity onMCF7cellline[ 56]. Most of the studies focusing on mistletoe as a candidate complementarydrugforcancertherapyhavebeenperformedby European scientists, especially researchers in Germany who carried out their preclinical and clinical experiments using different commercial and standardized products extract with a defined content of bioactive mistletoe lectin on various human tumor cell lines and xenografts has been reported by Burger et al. [ 63]. In his study, the antiproliferative activitywascomparedtoclassicalanticanceragentsandhigh cytotoxic activities were observed in human cancer cells. None of the tested tumor cell lines showed increased rateof proliferation. Antitumor profiles of mistletoe were found to be similar to doxorubicin which is an anticancer agent. Furtherin vitrostudies conducted by Burger et al. in 2003 [64] recorded no stimulation of MCF-7 cell proliferation using mistletoe extract with a defined content of bioactivemistletoe lectin. The effects of different Helixor mistletoeextracts including Helixor P, Helixor A, and Helixor M onproliferation and growth stimulation of 38 human cancer cell lines have been studied by Kelter et al. [ 57]. They used m i s t l e t o el e c t i nIa l o n gw i t ha d r i a m y c i na n di n t e r l e u k i n6 (IL6) as reference compounds and carried out their studies using various human breast cancer cell lines. They found that different Helixor extracts have cytotoxic activity ontumor cells and also suggested that no growth stimulation ofhumancancercelllinesoccurred.Astudywasperformed by Maier and Fiebig in 2002 to investigate the antitumorand antimetastatic activity of aqueous mistletoe extract in apanelof16humantumorcelllines[ 58].Theyconcludedfrom their work that all Iscador mistletoe extracts used in their in vitroexperimentshowednotumorproliferationandgrowth stimulation in cancer cells. They also observed that IscadorBioMedResearchInternational 5 MspezialandIscadorQUspezialthatcontainhighamounts of lectin of MFM-223, KPL-1 cell lines withIscador M, Iscador Q, and Abnobaviscum Fraxini-2 resulted in the of proliferation of cancer cells. Abnobavis- cumFraxini-2 exertedstronggrowthinhibitoryeffectsagainst MFM-223. In 2006, Beuth et al.

The tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF ) w a su s e da sar e f e r e n c ec o m p o u n df o r in vitrocytotoxic tests. Their work demonstrated a dose-dependent antitumoractivity of all tested mistletoe extracts against BT474 cells.Standardized mistletoe significantly represented more cyto-toxicitycomparedtoTNF.Inaddition,dramaticreduction o ft u m o rw e i g h ta sw e l la sad e c r e a s e dc e l lp r o l i f e r a t i o nr a t ewasreportedintheir invivostudy.InfurtherstudiesbyHugo etal.in2007[ 61],HER2celllinewereusedasmodelcelllines for malignant EGFR/c-erb B-2 double positive contains high amount of mistletoe lectin, can inhibitthe epidermal growth factor proliferation of human breastcancer cell line. Moreover, their results recommended V. Albumextracts as an antitumor drug, especially for breast cancer therapy. The cytotoxic activity of different V. album preparations on breast cancer cell lines using calorimetricassay was studied by Eggenschwiler et al. in 2007 [ 62]. They comparedtheanticancereffectsofVAP-M,VAP-Qu,VAP-P, VAP-A, and purified mistletoe lectin. It was shown in their work that each of the VA preparations caused inhibition ofcelllinesproliferationbutthattheextentofgrowthinhibitiondifferedaccordingtothetypesofpreparationsandcelllines.TheirresultsprovidedirectevidenceofantitumorpropertiesofdifferentIscadorpreparationsagainstvariousbreastcancercell lines. They also found new possibilities to investigatethe therapeutic potential of VAP-A in breast cancer therapycaused by the existence of cytotoxic substances other than mistletoelectin.Fromthepreclinicalinvestigationsdiscussed above, it is evident that various mistletoe extracts from different origins are capable of inducing apoptosis and celldeath in human breast cancer cell lines. Most of the in vitro andpreclinicalstudieshaverevealedthatmistletoemightbe agoodcandidatefordevelopmentofananticancerdrug[ 50- 62]. 3.2. In Vivo Studies. In addition to preclinical in vitro investigations, many in vivoexperiments using different animal models have been conducted by researchers. Thecytotoxic and antitumor activity of mistletoe, especially theEuropean mistletoe, against a variety of rats and mice hasbeen demonstrated in most of the investigations. Reductioni nt h et u m o rs i z ea n dg r o w t hh a sb e e nr e p o r t e di ns o m eo fthe studies [ 60,67].V. album extract has been applied by subcutaneousinjectioninmostreportedstudiesonEuropeanmistletoe;however,otheradministrationroutessuchasoral,intramuscular,intrapleural,intraperitoneal,andintratumoralon relevant site have been described in the experiments[60,66,67].

In 2006, Beuth et [ 60] demonstrated the dose-dependent antitumor activity Intheirin vivoexperiment, ME-A and ME-M were applied to the breast carcinoma model intratumorally. As compared to the control group, tumor treated with Iscador showed anoticeable reduction in cell growth and proliferation withdecreaseintumorweightaswellasincreaseincellapoptosis.In contrast, no significant antitumor and cytotoxic activitywas observed with subcutaneously injected to thethree chemosensitive transplantation tumor models involv-ing 214 rats and 93 mice [ 66].In vivoinvestigations of the abilityofmistletoeextracttoimprovetumorsurvivalinduceapoptosis and necrosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferationin animal models that have yielded inconsistent results.However, some research works showed decrease in the rateofcellproliferationandimprovementintumorsurvival. 4. Clinical Studies Most of the breast cancer patients especially women inEurope using adjuvant medicine in addition to chemother-apy, nevertheless, show evidence of its efficacy on HRQoLand survival of these patients is still a controversial topic ofdiscussion. The majority of researchers employed a combi-nation of V. album extracttherapyandconventionaltherapy in the treatment of breast cancer patients after surgery andradiotherapy. Improvement in HRQoL, positive influence inremissionrate,andreductionofsideeffectswereobservedinmost studies carried out on patients who received mistletoeextractinadditiontochemotherapy[ 68-75].Lifesatisfaction (LS) and HRQoL are two main important factors whichare needed to be taken into consideration for treatmentof breast cancer patients. Systematic reviews and clinicalreports of various single arm cohort and case series studiesonmistletoetherapyhaveappearedinthemedicalliteraturesince 1970. Overall, there is evidence that mistletoe ther-apy may enhance the survival rate, improve HRQoL, anddiminish the side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancerpatients as concluded in many systematic reviews [ 76-87]. Researchers mainly tested the effectiveness of mistletoe onH R Q o L ,s u r v i v a lt i m e ,t u m o rb e h a v i o u r ,a n ds i d ee ff e c t sof chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with breastcancer.Incontrast,applicationofmistletoeextractadditional toconventionaltherapyshowsweakandinconsistentresults on survival time of the other types of cancer patients.Tables2and3present a summary of the clinical trials and systematic reviews on the benefits of mistletoe therapy inbreast cancer patients performed during the last decade. Amulticentre three-arm study on 643 women with operatedbreastcancerwascarriedoutbyGutschetal.in1988[ 88].The patients were divided into 3 therapeutic groups. The follow-upgroupinvolved274patients,while192femalepatientsweretreatedwithHelixorandtheremaining177patientsreceivedchemotherapy. Compared to the untreated control group,bettersurvivalrateswereobservedinthetwotreatmentarms.Some weak evidence 89], with 46 advanced breast cancerpatientsshowedthatEurixormayhavepositiveeffectsonHRQoLduringpalliativechemotherapy.Inanothersmall2-armrandomizedclinicaltrial,Borrelliin2001[ 90]assessed HRQoL and tumor response in women with metastaticb r e a s tc a n c e r .O v e r a l l ,3 0b r e a s tc a n c e rp a t i e n t sw e r er a n -domlyassignedtoreceiveeithermistletoeextractorplacebo.Mistletoe extracts were administered subcutaneously. The researchers assessed HRQoL with Spitzer's QLI. The authorstatedspecialbenefitsinthemeasurementofHRQoLaswellas an influence in tumor response in breast cancer patientstreated with mistletoe extract. In 2001, Grossarth-Maticeket al.

The survival times of thepatient group treated with Iscador were superior to thoseof the control group. The authors found sufficient evidenceto recommend the use of Iscador for treatment of cancer inbreast cancer patients with or without axillary metastases.In 2002, Kr \u00a8oz et al. [92] reported some benefits of mistletoe therapy in survival and tumor reduction in women withmetastasized breast cancer. They applied combined intra-,peritumoral, and subcutaneous abnoba-Viscum(r) with con- comitant pamitron acid to breast cancer patients. Improve-ment in HRQoL was observed in 80-year-old women whoreceivedthemistletoetherapysubcutaneously. A multicentric retrolective cohort study was designed by Schumacher et al. in 2003 [ 93], to investigate the effect of lectin-standardized mistletoe extract on HRQoL in 1248breast cancer patients. 689 patients who were subjected tofinal analysis received standard conventional therapy andwere divided into two groups: a therapy group including219 patients with additional complementary therapy and acontrol group with 470 patients who received no additionalcomplementary treatment. An assessment of relapse-free treatmentandHRQoLwascarriedoutafterfollow-uptimes of 284 and 285 days for the treatment and control groups,respectively. Data analysis of the patients in therapy groupsshowed improvement in HRQoL, prolongation of relapseintervals, and reduction of side effects caused by tumordestructivetherapies.Enhancement in survival time and improvement in HRQoLwereassessedinpharmacoepidemiological,retrolec-tive cohort study with Iscador by Bock et al. in 2004 [ 68]. Outofatotalof1442patientswithprimarynonmetastasizedbreastcarcinoma,710patientsweregivenmistletoetreatmentand 732 patients were considered as the control group. Sat-isfactory HRQoL and significantly less adverse reactions tothe adjuvant oncology treatments were observed in patientswho received mistletoe therapy. An approval randomizedprospective clinical trial was performed by Piao et al. in2004 [69] ,f o rC h i n e s ep e o p l e .At o t a lo f6 8b r e a s tc a n c e r patientsprovidedwithstandardconventionaltherapieswereenrolled into this study. Helixor A was administered sub-cutaneously to patients of the treatment group, while thecontrol group received Lentinan intramuscularly. HRQoLwas measured by approval questionnaire including tradi-tional Chinese medicine (TCM) and functional living index(FLIC). Analysis of the results demonstrated that mistletoecomplementary therapy could improve HRQoL and reducestandard therapy adverse reactions. Another randomized,double blind, multicentre, and placebo controlled clinicaltrial was done by Semiglasov et al. in 2004 [ 94]. A total of 272 women with operable breast cancer were selected from 9 centres in Russia, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. All breastcancerpatientsreceivingchemotherapy(cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil) were randomized to placebo orstandardised mistletoe PS76A2 groups. The ofthis study compared different doses of mistletoe extract8 BioMedResearchInternational preparation with a placebo treatment. Their results revealed that PS76A2 is effective in HRQoL improvement in breastcancerpatientsreceivingadjuvantchemotherapy. Further investigation was done by Semiglazov et al. in 2006 [ 70]. They carried out a prospective, multicentre, a n dd o u b l eb l i n ds t u d yw i t hs i m i l a rt r i a lp r o t o c o li no r d e r to confirm their own previous findings with PS76A2. The outcomeshowedthatPS76A2ledtosignificantimprovementin HRQoL in female subjects with breast cancer duringchemotherapy and follow-up without chemotherapy. Asmentioned above, Semiglasov obtained similar results fromclinical studies they carried out in 2004 and 2006. On theother hand, results obtained from a double blind study ofAuerbach et al. in 2005 [ 95] ,o ne a r l yb r e a s tc a n c e rp a t i e n t s receivingradiochemotherapyshowednosignificanteffectofHelixor A adjuvant therapy on HRQoL. In a matched pairdesignclinicaltrialincluding84pairsofnonrandomizedand38 pairs of randomized breast cancer patients in 2006, theeffect of Iscador on self-regulation and survival time wasstudiedbyGrossarth-MaticekandZiegler[ 96].Asignificant benefit of long-term Iscador therapy with respect to meansurvival time and improvement in the self-regulation wasreported in patients who received Iscador. In a multicentricandcomparativeclinicaltrialbyBeuthetal.in2008[ 71],the study population was drawn from 741 women with primarybreast cancer whoparticipatedinanepidemiologicalcohortstudy on the influence of complementary Helixor treatmentonHRQoL.Amongthestudygroup,167patientsweretreatedw i t hH e l i x o ra n do t h e r5 1 4p a t i e n t sr e m a i n e da st h ec o n t r o lgroup. Safety and efficacy were set as the endpoints in this clinical investigation. Significant reduction in the persistent symptoms of disease and treatment, as well as improvementinHRQoL,wasseenduringaftercareinpatientswhoreceivedmistletoe extract. B \u00a8ussing et al. in 2008 [ 72]p e r f o r m e da clinical study in which Iscador M Spezial was administeredintravenouslyto65breastcancerpatients.Thetolerabilityofintravenously applied V. album was good at concentrations between 1 and 8mg. Analysis of all patients' results inthe treatment group showed a significant positive impacton chemotherapy side effects such as nausea, constipation,stomatitis, and pain. Nevertheless, no significant effect onHRQoLimprovementwasobservedintreatmentgroup. Another clinical trial spezial therapy showed fewer sideeffects to the conventional therapy.

HRQoL and fatigue as the outcomes were assessed byEORTC-QLQ-C30.Theresearchfindingsdemonstratedatendency to reduction of neutropenia and improvement ofHRQoLinbreastcancerpatientstreatedwithIMSadditionalto CAF. According to the author's comment, limited samplesize was the drawback of this study and further studies with largesamplesizewereneededtoprovetheresults. Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is the most common unre- lieved symptom and side effect of chemotherapy, radio-therapy, and biotherapy which impairs HRQoL of patientssignificantlyandextensivelymorethanothersymptoms.The impact of Iscador M on CRF was studied on a 36-year- old patient with a 10-year history of recurrent breast cancer.Dose-dependent benefit in decreasing fatigue was observedduringtwoandhalfyearsoftreatmentwithmistletoeextracts[98]. A report of an observational multicentre study was published by Eisenbraun et al .in 2011 [74], including 270 patients with breast cancer of stages I-III. The study inves-tigated the effectiveness of abnoba-Viscum M on HRQoL.The researchers measured effectiveness and tolerability ofmistletoetherapyadditionaltochemotherapyunderthecon-ditionsofdailypractice.Thisnoninterventionalclinicaltrialshowed improvement in HRQoL. In a further study, Tr \u00a8oger in2011[99]investigatedtheconnectionbetweenneutropenia and HRQoL in 95 breast cancer patients. A trend towardneutropenia reduction and better HRQoL was observed inthe group who received Iscador M spezial in addition tochemotherapy. These obtained results were similar to theirpreviousfindingsmentionedearlier[ 73].Werneretal.in2011 [100] conducted a multicenter, controlled, and retrolective studyenrolling3376patientsdiagnosedwithvarioustypesofcancerincludingbreastcancer.Theyevaluatedthetherapeu-tic and tolerance of Iscador P, Qut, and M appliedin addition to palliative conventional therapy in patients.All types of Iscador were found to be effective.

The effects of cytotoxic lectins isolated from Korean mistletoe(KML-C)onproliferationandapoptosisofvarioushuman and murine tumor cells were investigated by Yoonandfellowresearchersin1999[ 103].Acomparativestudyon biologicalandchemicalpropertiesofKML-CandlectinfromEuropeanmistletoe(EML-1)wascarriedout.Theyobservedthat the cytotoxic activity of KML-C against different was stronger than that of EML-1. The induction ofapoptosis characterized by morphological changes of apop-toticnucleiandDNAfragmentationwerereportedintumorcells incubated with KML-C. Their findings showed that addition of Zn 2+significantly blocks apoptosis inducing activityofKML-Cinadose-dependentpattern.Theseresults and a consequent apoptosis induction.In2006,Harmsmaandcoworkers[ 104]examined the effects of different concentrations of Iscador M and IscadorQonninevarioushumantumorcelllineswithregard to induction of apoptosis and mechanism of action. Thedata showed that Iscador caused early cell cycle regressionfollowed by induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependentmanner in breast cancer cell line. Moreover, results repre-sented that Iscador Q induces apoptosis via by Ramaekersetal.in2007[ preparations can induce inhibition and tumor cellregression. They observed concentration-dependent inhibi-tionincellcyclemachinery,particularlycompleteinhibitionofS-phaseprogressioninMCF7breastcancercellline.Cyto- static effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner. In addi-tion, they investigated the mechanism of antimetastatic andanticancer activity of Iscador at molecular and cellular level.In order to detect apoptotic pathways involved in Iscadorinduced programmed cell death, the cells were stained for several proapoptotic related components. Immunostaining for proapoptotic specific proteins in Iscador Q treated cells,indicated involvement of the mitochondrial route, whereasIscador M treated cells revealed involvement of both moreeffectivein theinductionof necrosisdue via activation of death pathways, possiblythrough activation of caspase 8 and subsequently activationof other cascade of caspases process and by lossofmitochondrialpotentialwhich,inturn,releasecytochromeCintocytosolandactivatecaspase9 . 5.2.ImmuneSystemModulation. Numerousscientificstudies haveconfirmedthatmistletoeextractsarecapableofboosting the immune system which can enhance tumor destruction or shrinkage [ 105-119]. Several research studies have been conducted in order to acquire a better insight into themechanism of action of mistletoe extracts on the immunesystemasitremainselusive.Controlledbicentricclinicaltrialusing105breastcancerpatientswascarriedoutbyB \u00a8ussingin 2006[105].Minimizedimmunesuppressionwasobservedin patientswhoreceivedIscadorMspezialintravenously.InaninvestigationofimmunomodulatoryeffectsofIscador,Hajtoin 1986 [106] evaluated various immunological parameters in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients. Six hoursafter a single intravenous application of VA-E, lymphocyteswere observed. Beuth et al. in 1992 [ 107]i n v e s t i g a t e dt h e immunomodulatory capacity of galactoside-specific lectinf r o mm i s t l e t o ei n1 0b r e a s tc a n c e rp a t i e n t sw h oh a db e e nprovided with conventional therapy. They analyzed thebehavior of various lymphocyte subsets, NK cells, and thelevel of expression of activation marker after subcutaneousadministration of the optimal doses of ML-1 in patients. SubcutaneousinjectionofML-1resultedinhighpronounced releaseoflymphocytesubsetsinthebloodofmanypatients.Enhanced counts of pan T cells, NK cells, and T helper cellsinvolvedinantitumorimmunitywerereportedinmostofthepatients.Furthermore,using invitroassay,itwasrevealedthat exposureofhumanlymphocytetovariousconcentrationsofML-1inducedanenhancedexpressionofHLA-DQantigensand IL-2 receptors. Further studies have been carried out byBeuth et al. [ 108,109], examining the immunomodulatory activity of ML-1 in patients with mammary carcinoma. Anincreasedconcentrationofacutephaseproteinsandofcom-plementfactorC3andenhancedexpressionofIL2receptorson lymphatic cells were observed during immunotherapy of10 BioMedResearchInternational cancer patients with different concentrations of ML-1. It has been established that there is a correlation between HRQoLandresponsesofthecellularparametersofimmunesystemincancerpatients.HeinyandBeuthin1994[ 110]demonstrated significant correlation between improved HRQoL and theincreased level of plasma beta-endorphin in breast cancer patients.RegularsubcutaneousadministrationofML-1in36 breastcancerpatientssignificantlyenhancedtheplasmalevelof beta-endorphin and the in vitrocytokine release. Heiny et al. in 1998 [ 111] studied the correlation between cellular parameters of immune system and neuroendocrine systemin breast cancer patients. Increased activity of peripheralblood natural killer (NK) cells and T-lymphocytes as wellas enhanced-endorphin plasma levels were reported after mi s tlet oelectinth era p y .Th emi s tlet oelectin so b ta in edfr o mKorean or European mistletoe were investigated for theirmodulation of tumor cell sensitivity toward TNF by Pae et al. in 2000 [ 112]. They found that mistletoe lectin increases MCF-7 cell sensitivity to TNF induced apoptosis. Protein synthesis inhibition is perhaps the mechanism by whichlectins amplify the effect of TNF .I nap i l o ts t u d yi n 2000,Kovacs [ 113] demonstrated that V. album extract as an immunomodulator could result in improved cell mediatedimmunity. The study was undertaken to assess the effecto fV At h e r a p yo nt h es e r u ml e v e la n dc y t o k i n e sp r o d u c -tion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in women withbreast cancer. Serum level measurement of immunologicalparameters revealed that patients who received VA therapyshowed a significant increase in Th1 cytokines like IL-2 andIFN gamma. In addition, treatment with VA leads to an enhancementintheserumlevelofIL-12.ThelevelofIL-4and th en u m be ro fN Kc e ll sa n dT - i n d u c e rc e ll sw e r en o tal t e r edduringsubcutaneousinjectionofVAE.

The research findingsdemonstrated that Iscador M is able to prevent suppressionof granulocyte burst activity triggered by surgical stress inbreast cancer patients. In addition, the level of C-reactiveproteins was not altered in the treatment group. In 2007,B\u00a8ussingetal.[ 115]hypothesizedthatrapidescalationofhigh VA-Econcentrationmayimpairthefunctionofcompetenceof T lymphocytes in cancer patients. The course of T-cellfunctionwasstablein36breastcancerpatientswhoreceivedmoderatemeanconcentrationsofVA-E,whileotherpatientsshowedadeclineinthestimulatedT-cellfunction.Afurtherobservational study was undertaken by B \u00a8ussing et al. in 2008 [116], designed like their previous trial. They evaluated t h eH R Q o La n dc o u r s eo fp e r i p h e r a ll y m p h o c y t es u b s e t in cancer patients. They concluded from their work that the induction of moderate local reactions can be associatedwith better HRQoL and T-cell function. In a study in 2006,Heinzerlingetal.[ 117]investigatedtheimmunologicaleffects o ft h e r a p yc o u r s ew i t hI s c a d o rQ us p e z i a la n de v a l u a t e dthe mechanism responsible for clinical observations of side effects disappearance in a group of cancer patients. TheyindicatedthatmistletoetherapyactivatedinnateimmuneviaCD14whichismediatedbytheactivationofmonocytes.Fur-thermore,long-termIscadortherapyinducedaTh1responseto mistletoe. The specific Th1 response was associated with strong bystander activation resulting in the induction of memoryT-cellthatmightmediate invivoanti-infectiousand anticancer activity. In a 4-case series study in 2009, Gardin[118] conducted a small trial on the effectiveness of Quercus therapyonimmunestimulationforcancerpatientswhohadimmune impairment including a 44-year-old woman withbreast cancer. Improvements in many humoral and cellularparameters were observed in patients who received 20mgVAextractbysubcutaneousadministrationtwiceaweek.TheresultsconfirmedthatVAhastheabilitytoimprovehumoraland cellular immune responses in cancer patients. Son etal. in 2010 [ 119] provided evidence that Helixor exhibited immunostimulatory effects in breast cancer patients. Theyexamined the immunological effects of VAE after surgeryfollowedbystandardconventionaltherapyin20patientswithstageorprimary breast cancer. The test group received VAE by subcutaneous injection. Measurements of variouscytokines were performed using ELISA system. Analysisof the results showed that concentration of IL-6 and IFN-gamma in peripheral blood remarkably increased in thetest group after VAE therapy. Hagens et al. in 2011 [ 120] investigatedtheinfluenceofIscadorPonexpressionofT-cellreceptor-zeta chains of T- and NK cells in 48 patients withearly and advanced breast cancer. The finding revealed no consistentchangeintheexpressionofzeta-chainsonCD4+, CD8+lymphocytes,andNKcellsinpatientswhounderwentmistletoetherapy. Collecting and combining the results from most of the studiesprovideagreatdealofevidenceclearlydemonstratingthat mistletoe from various origins, particularly Europeanmistletoe, is able to enhance humoral and cellular immuneresponses in breast cancer patients receiving VAE treatmentprovidedbythesubcutaneousroute. 6. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This paper summarises the in vitro,in vivo, and clinical types of evidence available about antibreast cancer efficacyof mistletoe. Currently, mistletoe, especially V. album,h a s attracted special interest due to its vital role as a leading remedyincancertherapy.Thecytotoxicefficacyofmistletoe extracts against cancer cells has been evaluated in numer-ous evidence based researches as well as in vitroandin vivolaboratory experiments, and mainly positive antitumor activitieshavebeenreported.Laboratorystudiesindicatethatthe cytotoxic properties cell apoptosis inducing activityof mistletoe depend on its biologically active substanceswhich may be different in various geographical regionsand host trees. The majority of the included clinical trialssuggestedabeneficialeffectwithgoodevidencewithrespecttosurvival,HRQoL,positiveremissionrate,andreductionofchemotherapy causing side effects for breast cancer patientstreatedwithmistletoeextracts.However,someoftheclinicalBioMedResearchInternational 11 studies do not seem to be reliable enough due to the minor weakness of studies. It is well established that mechanismsunderlyingtheanticanceractivityofmistletoeinvolvedapop-tosis and immunomodulation/stimulation of proinflamma-tory cytokines which point to an improved balance of theinnateimmunesystem.Moreover,bothimmunomodulatory andapoptosis/cytotoxicactivitiesofmistletoemaycontribute t ot h ep o s i t i v eo u t c o m ea n dc l i n i c a lb e n e fi ti nb r e a s tc a n c e rpatients. Future preclinical studies are needed to investigate an accurate mechanism of antitumor activity of mistletoe oncancer cell lines. Heterogeneity of tested animal models andthe sample size frequently give rise to inconsistent findings.In order to obtain reliable results, dosage standardization isrequired. Application of standardized and optimized mistle-toemaybehelpfulinprolongingsurvivaltimeandincreasingHRQoL. Subcutaneous application of mistletoe extracts tobreastcancerpatientsmightbeassociatedwithimmunolog-ical side effects on the skin. Taking into consideration thesubcutaneousadministrationsideeffects,oraladministrationof mistletoe preparations with apparent lack of adversereactions might be a promising adjuvant alternative therapyfor breast cancer patients. Further qualitative clinical trialse v a l u a t i n gt h ee ff e c to fm i s t l e t o eo nb r e a s tc a n c e rp a t i e n t smustaddresssafetyparameters,standarddosage,andappro-priate endpoint measures.
