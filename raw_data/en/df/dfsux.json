The purpose of this Executive Officer (EO) Notice (Administration of the Publicly Funded COVI D-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility), the EO Notice: Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Billing, and the accompanying Questions and Answers (Qs & As) documents, are to set out the terms and conditions for a participating pharmacy's submission of claims for payment (claims) for administering injectable COVID-19 vaccines to eligible individuals. Each document is a ministry policy that pharmacy operators must comply with under section 3.2 of the Health Network System (HNS) Subscription Agreement for Pharmacy Operators. Participating pharmacies must comply with all of the terms and conditions set out in the EO Notices and Qs & As. It is a condition of participating that participating pharmacies offer first, second and third or booster doses to all eligible groups, provided that there is sufficient supply of the vaccines. The two (2) EO Notices and the accompanying Qs & As documents are not intended to desc ribe a pharmacy operator's obligations in respect of administering injectable COVID-19 vaccines under applicable legislation, other agreements with the Province of Ontario, or policies of the Ontario College of Pharmacists (OCP). Pharmacy operators with questions about their legal obligations outside of the HNS Subscription Agreement should refer to the applicable legislation, other agreement, or OCP policy as appropriate. This EO Notice (Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Phar macies - Eligibility) replaces the previous EO notice on the same topic respecting the administration of publicly funded COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario pharmacies that was effective September 26 th, 2022. Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacy eligibility In order to be eligible to submit claims for administering a publicly funded COVID- 19 vaccine, a pharmacy operator (also referred to in this document as a \"participating pharmacy\") must be selected to participate by the ministry and meet the following requirements: Have a valid HNS Subscription Agreement with the ministry Have a valid agreement1 with the ministry respecting COVID -19 vaccine administration and the use of the Provincial COVID -19 vaccine solution (the \"COVID - 19 Vaccine Agreement\"); and Enrolled in the current U niversal Influenza Immunizati on Program (UIIP)2.* 1 A valid agreement is in respect of a particular pharmacy operator operating at a specific pharmacy location. Where a pharmacy is sold, or where a pharmacy operator relocates, a new COVID-19 Vaccine Agreement is required to reflect the new pharmacy operator or location. 2 Enrollment in the UIIP is in respect of a particular pharmacy operator operating at a specific pharmacy location. Where a pharmacy is sold, or where a pharmacy operator relocates, new enrollment in the UIIP is required to reflect the new pharmacy operator or location. *Due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and to increase access to vaccination services to as many eligible individuals as possible, as of January 13, 2022, the ministry opened enrollment in the COVID -19 vaccination program to pharmacies that are not enrolled in the current UIIP on an exceptional and temporary basis. Pharmacies that are interested in administering publicly funded COVID -19 vaccines but not currently enrolled in the current UIIP should email the ministry at: O PDPIn foBox@ontario.ca with their store name, addres s and ON Provider #. In addition to having a valid HNS Subscription Agreement and a valid COVID -19 Vaccine Agreement, such pharmacies will be required to pass an inspection by their local public health unit (PHU) , including a cold chain inspection, and comply with all storage and handling guidelines for vaccines. Please note that conducting inspections will be at the sole discretion of the local PHUs and their resources and timelines. This eligibility criteria may be updated from time to time. Please r efer to the ministry websit e for the most recent version of this notice. Patient eligibility The following rules apply to the interpretation of the eligibility criteria in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 below for any vaccine dose. -2 -Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division An individual is eligible to receive a publicly funded COVID -19 vaccine if they live, work, or study in Ontario or they are visiting Ontario from another province / territory or another country, and if they meet the applicable eligibility criteria in the tables below . For all vaccine doses, when eligibility is define d by age, individuals must be the respective age of eligibility on the day of the vaccine administration. Individuals who received a COVID -19 vaccine outside of Ontario or Canada who contact th eir local Public Health Unit will have their COVID- 19 vaccine history verified and uploaded into the COVAX ON system. Depending on how many doses and which vaccines were previously administered (please refer to the COVID-1 9 Vaccine Guidance located on the ministry's website ), pharmacies may administer an additional dose of an monovalent mRNA vacci ne or a bivalent mRNA vaccine if applicable, if required to complete the vaccine series or as a booster . Residents of long- term care homes, residents of retirement homes, and elderly persons li ving in other congregate settings (e.g. assisted- living facilities, naturally occurring congregate retirement settings/seniors apartment buildings, congregate settings for people with developmental disabilities, mental health and addictions issues, etc.) who meet the eligibility criteria in the tables below are only eligible to receive a pharmacy -administered vaccine dose when pharmacy staff administer the dose at the long- term care home, retirement home or other congregate setting. Staff, support workers, essential caregivers, volunteers and contractors who are working at the long- term care home, retirement h ome or other congregate settings are also eligible for pharmacy -administered vaccine doses either at the pharmacy or when the pharmacy staff visit the home / congregate setting, provided that they meet the applicable eligibility criteria in the tables below. Pharmacies must coordinate any vaccine administration at a long- term care home, retirement home or congregate setting with the local public health unit and the proprietor of the home/setting. Individuals attending Pharmacy Mobile Clinics are subject to the eligibility requirements set out bel ow where applicable. For more information refer to Pharmacy Qs+As Question 48. Informed consent is required to administer any COVID -19 vaccine to an eligible individual. For a primary series 1. NACI preferentially recommends receipt of monovalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccines (i.e ., Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna) to complete the primary series for all individuals 6 months and older , without contraindications to the vaccine. Please note that all individuals 6 months to 4 years who receive Pfizer -BioNTech (3 mcg) must receive 3 doses to complete their primary series. 2. Novavax may be offered to individuals in the authorized age group (18 years and older ) without contraindications to the vaccine who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine. -3 -Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division 3. Janssen may be offered to individuals who are 18 years and older without contr aindications to the vaccine only when all other authorized COVID -19 vaccines are contraindicated. The Province has a limited supply of Nuvaxovidand viral vector vaccines. Pharmacies should w ork with their public health unit to determine how eligible individuals (as defined below) can receive these vaccines3. 3 For more information on COVID -19 vaccines refer to ministry guidance: COVID -19 Vaccine Guidance The recommended interval between doses in the primary series is 2 months (56 days). Based on advice from the Ontario Immunization Advisory Committee (OIAC) , and in alig nment with NACI , the Ministry of Health has issued a preferential recommendation for the use of m onovalent Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine for individuals 5- 29 years of age if receiving a primary series dose, or 5 - 17 years of age if receiving a booster dose. This recommendation stems from an observed increase in the number of reports in Ontario of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Moderna relative to Pfizer - BioNTech in children, adolescents and young adults, particularly among males. Although risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with the Moderna (50 mcg) vaccine in children 6 to 11 years of age is unknown, with a primary series in adolescents and young adults the rare risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with Moderna (100 mcg) was higher than with Pf izer-BioNTech (30 mcg). There is no preferred product for individuals 6 months to 4 years of age. See COVID- 19 Vacc ine Guidance for more details on administering to special populations . The use of monovalent Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (10 mcg) is preferred to the monovale nt Moderna (25 mcg) for those 5 years of age. However, per NACI, monovalent Moderna (25 mcg) may be offered to children who are 5 years of age as an alternative to the monovalent Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (10 mcg), with informed consent and discussion of risks and benefits with the child's healthcare provider.
