Everything we craft has one thing in common: it's guaranteed to be toxic-free. If we wouldn't put something in our bodies, we won't put it on yours. Olea Herbals was born from the belief that for every toxic substance, there's a gentler alternative. Our founder, a Nutritionist with training in clinical herbalism, Olivia, always trusted that Mother Nature knew what she was doing. As we benefit from centuries-old herbs and botanicals provided by the Earth, we partner with those who protect it. We source all of our herbs, butters, and oils from organic farms. In doing so, we can ensure optimal nutritional potency and zero pesticides. "}
