The amount of unsafe and toxic toys that are on the market is incredible. While these toys may be cheaper and more readily available, it is important to keep these dangerous toys away from babies because babies put things in their mouth and can be harmed very easily by the chemicals and toxins found in toys that do not adhere to strict safety regulations. Do not get discouraged, though. There are many [non-toxic materials that baby toys](http://blessourlittles.com/17-must-have-non-toxic-baby-toys/) can be made from, so your little one can still have plenty of toys to play with. When buying toys for your baby, look for the following non-toxic materials: - Unfinished wood - Wood with non-toxic or clear finishes made from beeswax or food grade oils - Solid wood instead of engineered wood - Products made from bamboo - Sustainably produced hardwood - Non-toxic glues (mainly non-formaldehyde-based) - All-natural, untreated fibers - 100% organic cloth - cotton, wool, felt - Hemp-made products - Solvent-free, lead-free, water-based paints - 100% natural rubber - Biodegradable ink and soy ink, non-toxic dyes, mineral and organic color pigments - Recycled paper Many parents that are worried about toxins and chemicals entering their babies' bodies will steer clear of plastic toys entirely. However, there are some safe plastic options that you can purchase. - Look for plastic that is labeled as PVC-free, phthalate-free, and BPA free. - Toys made with plastics # 2, 4, and 5 are significantly safer than other plastics. - Plastic #2 is high-density polyethylene. - Plastic #4 is low-density polyethylene. - Plastic #5 is polypropylene. This is a food-safe plastic. What is Toxic in Toys? By knowing which non-toxic materials to look for, this will help you buy the safest toys possible for your baby is important. However, knowing which materials in toys are toxic is equally as important. For instance, if your baby is gifted a toy, you should know exactly what to look for in order to tell if the toy is safe for your child. The following chart describes the [common toxic materials](https://www.peurobaby.com/pages/non-toxic-materials) found in toys. | | Toxic Material | | Description and Dangers | | Bisphenol A (BPA) | | -This chemical is found in many plastics on the market, even toys. -It mimics the hormone estrogen which can lead to an increase in estrogen, which causes issues with organ and brain development. -It can cause early puberty, neurological issues, depression, obesity, and more. | | Phthalates | | -This is a chemical derived from phthalic acid that is used to increase the flexibility of plastics and vinyl. -They disrupt the endocrine system, which can interrupt brain and nervous system development, the development and function of the reproductive system, metabolism, and blood sugar. -They can cause early puberty, genital defects, behavioral issues, obesity, and more. | | PVC/Vinyl | | -Polyvinyl chloride, known as vinyl or PVC, contains a large amount of phthalate which makes it very dangerous. -It can cause everything that phthalates can cause plus issues like asthma and is linked to cancer. -It is incredibly bad for the environment. | | Flame Retardants | | -Older flame retardants were made of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) - these are now banned, but older products will contain them. -Chlorinated tris (TDCPP) and Firemaster 550 are used as flame retardants currently. -Exposure to flame retardants at a young age can cause delayed development of motor skills, learning disabilities, and issues with memory and behavior. | | Polyurethane Foam | | -Polyurethane foam is a very soft and flexible material that is typically found in baby mattresses and changing pads. -The danger of polyurethane foam is in its off-gasses, which include formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and more harmful chemicals. -The material is almost always treated with flame retardants because it is very flammable, increasing its toxicity. -It is linked to an increased chance of SIDS and cancer. | | Formaldehyde and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) | | -Volatile organic compounds turn into harmful gases that can be breathed in at room temperature. -Some common VOCs are formaldehyde, chlorine, bromine, sulfur, and nitrogen. -They can cause respiratory issues, nausea, and asthma attacks. | | Lead and other Heavy Metals | | -Common heavy metals found in toys include lead, antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and selenium. -Heavy metals can harm brain development, impact different organs, delay motor skills, and cause behavioral issues. In Conclusion... There are many hidden dangers found in children's toys. Older children are not often harmed by these toxins and chemicals, but babies are different. They are constantly putting toys in their mouth. This allows the harmful materials to be absorbed into the bloodstream through the tongue, putting babies in much more danger. It is important to know what your baby's toys are made of. This will help to prevent any damage to their little bodies now or in the future. While it is tempting to go for cheaper toys, it is much wiser to buy a smaller number of safe, non-toxic toys even if they are pricier. You'll thank yourself in the long run.
