Last year, we talked about CHARTING COURSE and announced a strategic planning process that would guide our work over the next ve years. This year, we have a plan and we are proud to report that our FUTURE is taking shape. What will be different? In our aggressive pursuit of EXCELLENCE, we will deploy traditional strengths in innovative ways. We will focus our energies and resources on FOUR GRAND CHALLENGES, areas where our unique expertise can do the most good in the world. We will create and disseminate knowledge, and INTEGRATE IT ACROSS DISCIPLINES bringing the power of science, the aesthetic of art, and the insight of history to bear as only we can. We will embrace 21st-century tools to extend our reach and OPEN DOORS. We will apply our great resources to enliven education. We will PRESERVE THE COLLECTIONS that represent our heritage and the world's treasure. We wil l partner with individuals, institutions, and nations whose interests and PASSION match our PRIORITIES so we can effec t lasting change. The stories that follow represent just a few of the ways we are turning our VISION into reality. JOIN US on the journey. T ogether, we can make a re al difference. SECRETARY G. WA YNE CLOUGH FOUR GRAND CHALLENGES IN THE DECADE AHEAD, THE SMITHSONIAN WILL FOCUS OUR GREAT RESOURCES ON FOUR MAJOR CHALLENGES THAT SPEAK TO OUR STRENGTHS AND ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FACING THE NATION AND THE WORLD.INSPIRING GENERATIONS THROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND DISCOVERY: A VISION FOR THE FUTURE 3 2UNLOCKING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE Understand the fundamental nature of the cosmos, exploring our solar system, meteorites, the Earth's geological past and present, and the paleontological record of our planet. UNDERSTANDING AND SUSTAINING A BIODIVERSE PLANET Signicantly advance our knowledge and understanding of life on Earth, respond to environmental change, and sustain human well-being. VALUING WORLD CULTURES Build bridges of mutual respect, and present the diversity of world cultures and the joy of creativity with accuracy, insight, and reverence. UNDERSTANDING THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE Explore what it means to be American \u2014 our history, ideals, and indomitable, innovative spirit \u2014 and how individual experiences strengthen the whole, then share our story with the world. ACROSS MUSEUMS AND DISCIPLINES, THE SMITHSONIAN HAS EMBRACED FIVE INITIATIVES THAT WILL INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE, ENHANCE EDUCATION, AND SHARE OUR TREASURES GLOBALLY. FIVE INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITIES INSPIRING GENERATIONS THROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND DISCOVERY: A VISION FOR THE FUTURE 4 5BROADENING ACCESS Purpose the latest tools and technology to exponentially broaden the world's access to Smithsonian resources and improve the visitor experience for those who come in person. REVITALIZING EDUCATION Enhance American education by creating a dynamic, centralized approach to formal and informal learning that leverages our resources and rewards inventive thinking. CROSSING BOUNDARIES Marshal Smithsonian resources across disciplines and strengthen relationships with our external partners to bring more expertise to bear on society's most complex challenges. STRENGTHENING COLLECTIONS Enhance the preservation of our vast and irreplaceable collections \u2014 fundamental to our work and the work of countless scholars and scientists \u2014 to ensure their availability for future generations. ENABLING MISSION THROUGH ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE Create a culture that is entrepreneur - ial, innova tive, and transparent; improve communications with our audiences, partners, and funders; support our dedicated workforce; and ensure nancial strength. 6 7BEFORE WE CAN SUSTAIN the biodiversity of our planet, we must rst understand it. This challenge is taking on a new urgency in the face of accelerating environmental change. The Smithsonian has the breadth of collections and expertise to help endangered species survive and eventually flourish. GLOBAL TIGER INITIATIVE our biological resources, and the very tness of our global ecosystem, are diminished every time a species goes extinct. The loss of a top predator especially wreaks havoc throughout the food chain. Such is the case with the sleek and powerful tiger, on the verge of extinction in the wild. only about 3,500 tigers remain in their natural habitats. A century ago, their numbers exceeded 100,000. The Smithsonian's national Zoo has joined The world Bank as a founding partner in the global Tiger initiative, an interna - tional alliance of governments, agencies, and private-sector organizations that have united to save wild tigers from india to Southeast Asia to russia. illegal poaching and killing, along with habitat loss, are the driving forces behind the tigers' disappearance. development and deforestation have placed people in close proximity to tigers, resulting in tigers being killed at an alarming rate. Smithsonian conservationists are leading an effort funded by The world Bank to tackle this problem. one strategy focuses on training managers in the world's tiger reserves on conservation and monitoring techniques. Another strategy communicates the tangible advantages of saving the tigers to senior policy - makers , and enlists their cooperation in cracking down on illegal trafcking of tiger body parts. \"The Smithsonian is at the center of a global conservation network that connects people working to save tigers to knowledge, experts , and most important, to each other. We are training the next generation of conservation leaders, while governments and non-governmental organiza - tions will form ongoing relation - ships to police illegal poaching and trafcking. The World Bank has become the global convener; they have the resources and the commitment to change practice in all the countries in the Tiger Range.\" STEVEN L. MONFORT,dirECTor, SMiThSoniAn ConSErvATion Biology inSTiTUTE, nATionAl ZoologiCAl PArk \"Tigers are moving fast toward the brink of extinction. Not only does their situation require urgent intervention, but they are a symbol for broader issues around eroding biodiversity and ecosystem manage - ment. We have built an amazing partnership with the Smithsonian, and they are helping to connect global knowledge to local practice. Working together, we will increase the skill level of practitioners in the eld and attract the attention of decision makers to the plight of the tiger.\" KESHAV VARMA,ProgrAM dirECTor, gloBAl TigEr iniTiATivE, ThE world BAnk To lEArn MorE ABoUT SAving TigErS in ThE wild viSiT: gloBAl TigEriniTiATivE.org UNDERSTANDING AND SUSTAINING A BIODIVERSE PLANET \u00f8 SAVING TIGERS IN THE WILD 8 9\"To tell the story of how the universe began and where it is headed, we have to look through many observational windows at once. This requires new tools and substantial resources, much of them spent in the experimental phase where it is hard to nd funding.

We often fund early-stage work, too early for some federal agencies that require more data up front. The Smithsonian's project was very appealing; what they propose requires new approaches, and therefore risk. Part of our culture is to take smart risks because major leaps forward in science won't happen without them. What we learn from this work has the potential to impact astrophysical research all over the world. And we believe the Smithsonian scientists are the best qualied in the world to try it.\" VICKI L. CHANDLER , ChiEF ProgrAM oFFiCEr, SCiEnCE, gordon And BETTy MoorE FoUndATion ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY is rapidly shedding light on the mysteries of space. Yet the sophis- ticated instruments that increase our understanding only fuel our fascination, giving rise to deeper questions. To unlock the mysteries of the universe, the Smithsonian has set forth an ambitious plan of integrated research that will address big questions about the history and evolution of the cosmos, from our own solar system to the earliest stars and galaxies. FASTER, FARTHER, SHARPER, STRONGER: THE NEXT GENERATION OF X-RAY TELESCOPES Piercing the vast darkness of space requires powerful tools that can detect even the faintest energy from stars, celestial objects, and events in distant reaches of the uni - verse. The Smithsonian Astrophysical observatory has already engineered some of the world's most advanced instrumentation. now, its scientists are at work on the next generation of X-ray telescopes that will broaden our understanding of the universe. with a generous grant from the gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Smithsonian astrophysicists are developing novel X-ray optics and inte - grating them with new detector technologies to give us more accurate images. The next generation of X-ray telescopes will be more reliable, capture images faster, and survive better in space. Their resolution also will be better than current instruments. A collecting area expanded by a factor of ten will let us see more and see it more clearly. This enhanced telescope will help us discover how galaxies form and interact and help us answer essential questions about the origins of the cosmos. UNLOCKING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE SHARPENING X-RAY VISION 10 11 WHAT DOES IT MEAN to be an American? In a nation that is rapidly diversifying, the Smithsonian is exploring events and concepts that unite us as a people while honoring our varied backgrounds. As stewards of the national collections and interpreters of the American experience, we are continually expanding our physical and online presence to present America's art, history, and culture in fresh new ways. POSTAL COLLECTIONS TELL A VISUAL HISTORY Strange to think that an object as small as a postage stamp can tell a story as expansive as America's, but at the Smithsonian's national Postal Museum, stamps regularly transport visitors on journeys across geography and history. Since the debut of American postage stamps in 1847, their engraved images have served as a visual history of the United States, featuring our founding fathers, national parks, famous artists, and leaders in the ght for civil rights. Stamps commemorate our history and document our achievements. They also get personal, delivering congratu - lations and condolences and conveying news between the home front and the front lines in every conflict since the Civil war. The national Postal Museum collection holds more than six million stamps, postal documents, and objects, yet limited exhibition space allows the display of only a small fraction. now, a signicant gift from stamp collector william h. gross will allow the museum to proceed with a new 12,000-square-foot gallery, featuring the latest in conservation technology and adding space for exhibition, education, and a welcome center. when it opens in 2012, this gallery will offer a new window on the American experience. \"Postage stamps provide a unique perspective on American history and culture. Stamps and mail are lenses through which we can view America's diversity and also connect to the world. Bill Gross's support for a new gallery and his loan of three very famous objects will let us show - case more of our collections and get a wider audience excited about stamps \u2014 and through them, our nation's history.\" CHERYL R. GANZ,ChiEF CUrATor oF PhilATEl y , nATionAl PoSTAl MUSEUM \"The American public deserves the best home possible to display its history, and in this case, it is history as told through stamps. By adding gallery space, the Smithsonian can give its wonderful collection a greater presence. Every stamp tells a part of America's story, as do the various postmarks and routings. And by loaning three very rare postal objects such as the Inverted Jenny block, I hope we can attract a broader audience and get visitors interested in collecting or just learning more about history.\" WILLIAM H. GROSS in addition to his generous support of the new gallery named in his honor, william h. gross is loaning three philatelic treasures. 1. JUl y 2, 1847 EnvEloPE wiTh FirST U.S. STAMP iSSUE on July 1, 1847, the rst stamps ever produced by the U.S. government were issued to the general public. on one envelope is a pair of the ten- cent stamps, used on July 2, 1847. T o date, this example remains the earliest known use of a United States postage stamp, making it the most famous, and valuable, example in existence. 2. 1860 Pony EXPrESS lETTEr rECovErEd AFTEr AMEriCAn indiAn EnCoUnTEr American indians in nevada disrupted the delivery of this Pony Express service letter. The Pony Express rider was over - taken, but the pony escaped with the letter pouch. The pouch was later recovered on the open plains, and the letters in it were forwarded to their destination in 1862. This example, the only known surviving piece of mail, is marked \"recovered from a mail stolen by the indians in 1860.\" 3. 1918 24-CEnT \"invErTEd JEnny\" Air PoST BloCk oF FoUr one of the most iconic and recognizable stamp errors ever discovered is the 1918 24-cent \"inverted Jenny\" air post stamp. in 1918, the Post ofce issued its rst air mail postage stamp to pro - mote the newly established air mail service. A special 24-cent stamp was prepared, depicting the \"Curtiss Jenny\" biplane. one sheet of 100 stamps was discovered with all of the stamps within the sheet having had the biplane printed upside down.

Today, we have the technology to share our treasures more fully with scientists, educators, students, and families anywhere in the world. OBJECTS COME TO LIFE over the next decade, we will digitize thousands more of our objects, and the information that supports them, and make them available online. digitization will make our collections available anytime, anywhere. it will dramatically extend the length of our reach and help increase access to objects too fragile to travel. objects will come to life as we incorporate sound and movement, and the ability to tag items with additional information will deepen understanding. For the rst time in our history, we will be able to connect items across collections, giving students and scholars alike a more complete view of our holdings. PRESERVE FRAGILE OBJECTS HELP PEOPLE HEAR AND SEE HISTORY SPEED SCHOLARSHIP ENLIVEN EDUCATION CONNECT ITEMS ACROSS THE SMITHSONIAN DEEPEN THE MUSEUM EXPERIENCE 14 15 TO SUSTAIN A LEGACY of innovation, America must deepen the competencies of its students in science and math and increase their understanding of the physical world. To forge better citizens, we must understand who we are and what it means to be an American. And to nurture cultural innovation and creativity, we must encourage people to produce art and literature. The Smithsonian is applying its resources to re-energize education in America, inspiring tomorrow's knowledge- seekers today. Nothing we do will make a bigger difference to our collective future. SPARKING INQUIRY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM The Smithsonian's potential to spark learning is boundless. what better object to communicate the inspiration of his - tory than the Star-Spangled Banner? how better to learn about the importance of the world's ocean than by a visit to The Sant ocean hall? Every day, more and more of our collections are going online, while some of our curricula are used by approximately 40 percent of the nation's schools. y et we have not begun to fulfill our potential. The work ahead includes better coordination between museums, research centers, and programs, as well as upgraded technology. The Smithsonian has made good strides in connecting resources to the classroom, but we can do much more and also enhance learning beyond the classroom. while we currently use digital media to deliver some of our content, we have yet to translate the power in the physical presence of a 60-foot whale to a 12-inch computer screen, where many more people will experience it. Smithsonian regent robert kogod and his wife, Arlene, have made a generous gift that will help us create a coordinated, focused approach toward education. Their gift supports a Smithsonian staff leader who can redene our strategy to expand and leverage educational resources for maximum impact. \"Knowledge can help us survive and live a more humane life. Knowledge supports democracy and helps citizens better understand the world . And the Smithsonian has a role to play in gen - erating and sharing knowledge. Because of Robert and Arlene Kogod's gift, we will have a senior leader who can build a whole new strat- egy for education and public programming and help us better use the Internet and other digital means to deliver, develop, and foster knowledge for a new generation. We now have the unprecedented opportunity to take the educational benet of the Smithsonian to the people, across the United States and around the world. The Kogods' gift will help us do that.\" RICHARD KURIN, UndEr SECrETAry For hiSTory , ArT , And CUl TUrE EVA J. PELL, UndEr SECrETAry For SCiEnCE \"In these early years of the 21st century, we are literally defining the Smithsonian Institution's future. Education has a major presence throughout the Smithsonian, and it is important to coordinate its efforts to ensure it reaches its full potential. Strong staff lead - ership, a well- dened strategic direction, more advanced technology, and a confluence of other factors, will enable us to make better use of our great advantages. Education is one of the critical issues facing our society, and the Smithsonian is a resource for the whole world. We are very happy to be a part of this endeavor.\" ROBERT AND ARLENE KOGOD To Find oUT MorE ABoUT SMiThSoniAn EdUCATion rESoUrCES And ProgrAMS, viSiT: SMiThSoniAnEdUCATion.org REVITALIZING EDUCATION ENGAGING LEARNERS 16 17 WITH EXPERTISE,collections, and relationships that span the globe, the Smithsonian is in a unique position to promote the common language of art and creativity and unite cultures through increased knowledge and heightened understanding. CONNECTING CULTURES For curators and educators at the Freer gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler gallery, knowledge is the rst step to bridging the gap between cultures. Better yet is experiencing the emotional connection that comes from understanding a culture's story \u2014 the tales people tell and depict, the dances they perform, their language, music, and lm. on any given day, in addition to viewing a superior collection of Asian art, visitors to the Freer and Sackler galleries might nd Tibetan monks creating an intricate sand mandala, a sacred exercise that teaches patience and tranquility. These same visitors might next witness a Cambodian dancer interpreting a classic hindu story through movement and music, or attend a performance by mystic Bengali minstrels. They might listen to a visiting scholar recreating wondrous ancient temples in the mind's eye, or even work with staff to create their own origami flowers inspired by Japanese ceramics. Many additional onsite and online exhibitions and cultural programs at the galleries engage visitors in other ways, deepening their awareness and appreciation of other cultures. recently, the galleries received help in accomplishing their work through an unrestricted endowment gift from Jeffrey Cunard, a former chairman of the galleries' advisory board. initially, the gift will benet Southeast Asian art, but his broader intent is to allow the Freer and Sackler galleries the freedom to deploy their resources where they are most needed. \"Our goal is for people to be entranced by the art they encounter in our museums, and intrigued by a glimpse of living cultural traditions. We want people to be moved, and to have lasting memories that encourage them to learn. No one under - stands this better than Jeff Cunard. He has given us nan - cial support with the freedom to invest it where we feel it will do the most good.\" JULIAN RABY , dirECTor, FrEEr gAllEry oF ArT And ArThUr M. SACklEr gAllEry \"Asia is a vast region with widely disparate artistic and cultural traditions, and the Freer and Sackler galleries have a very ambitious agenda that aims to share them. Our programs are a source of endless wonder and enjoyment for tens of thousands each year. But we also have a very rich collection of Asian art that we display in the galleries, and increasingly on the Web. I have a good sense of the galleries' vision and the increase in resources needed to sustain it. It seems clear that to maintain this standard of excellence, the director and his team need the nancial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities they might otherwise have to forego.\" JEFFREY P.

This requires us to employ the best tools and technology to connect people with information quickly and efciently, a critical step in speeding the transfer of knowledge. TECHNOLOGY PROMOTES ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE in more than 160 years of sharing knowledge with the world, the Smithsonian has embraced excellence in many forms: in the scope and depth of our collections; in the caliber and expertise of our curators, scientists, and educators; and in the quality of the relationships we build with global part - ners. while our mission remains the same, we continually seek the best tools to fulll it. The Smithsonian is turning to emerging technologies to enable collaboration and information sharing, streamline organizational processes, and provide a new standard in transparency and accounta - bility. For scholars to collaborate online with Smithsonian researchers, for experts across the institution to work together on mission-critical projects, and for our leaders to communicate objectives and track performance, we must build an internal infrastructure to support the rapid transfer of information. Microsoft Corporation' s generous contribution of its SharePoint \u00aesoftware, an integrated suite of applications, is enabling Smithsonian staff to share knowledge and collaborate across disciplines and museums, accessing information and communicating online to tackle complex problems. once we master these internal conver - sations, we will broaden our scope and technologies to include the external world in a digital dialogue. \"Microsoft's gift of SharePoint licenses will enable us to break down walls between information and expertise and build one Smithsonian. Imagine a world in which scientists, curators, and educators from around the world can collaborate with Smithsonian experts, sharing information, images, and discus - sions as if they were in the same building. Pan-Institutional teams will be able to plan and execute exhibitions and other projects more quickly. By rst allowing information sharing internally, SharePoint will ultimately engage people across boundaries and disciplines, advancing the increase and diffusion of knowl- edge. It is a great leap forward.\" JEAN SHERMAN AND JIGESH PATEL, ProJECT MAnAgErS, oFFiCE oF ThE ChiEF inForMATion oFFiCEr To rEAd MorE ABoUT ThE SMiThSoniAn'S PlAnS To USE TEChnology , viSiT: Si.EdU/oCio/PdFS/ STrATEgiCovErviEw.PdF ENABLING MISSION THROUGH ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE \"Microsoft has a deep commitment to help non-prots advance their missions by deploying technology in the most efcient way possible.

Guided by its new chair, Patricia Q. Stonesifer, leadership, relevance, and execution are the principles guiding the Board. LEADERSHIP The regents supported the strong leadership team assembled by Secretary wayne Clough, including new additions dr. Eva J. Pell, under secretary for science; Johnnetta Cole, director of the national Museum of African Art; dennis w. kelly, director of the national Zoological Park; richard koshalek, director of the hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture garden; Bill Moggridge, director of Cooper-hewitt, national design Museum; Judith leonard, general counsel; and Claudine k. Brown, the rst Smithsonian director of education. These talented people, along with others already in place, bring to the Smithsonian a leadership team equal to its world-class status as a center for knowl - edge and learning. The Board of regents strengthened its own number with the addition of dr. France A. C\u00f3rdova, president of Purdue University and a leading astrophysicist, and david M. rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle group and a member of the advisory boards of both the national Museum of American history and the national Museum of natural history. RELEVANCE By approving the institution' s strategic plan in September 2009, the Board took a giant step to ensure that the Smithsonian remains relevant in the twenty-rst century. Each of the plan's four grand challenges identies an area in which the institution is uniquely qualied to make important contributions. The plan also will enable the Smithsonian to better communicate with its many audi - ences, including Congress, foundations, corporations, and donors. The Board oversaw the institution' s expanded outreach efforts in 2009, particularly on the web and through \"off-the-Mall\" venues, even as the Smithsonian continued to enhance its traditional physical presence. The soon-to-begin construction of the national Museum of African American history and Culture and the revitaliza - tion of the Arts and industries Building represent enormous opportunities to bring new and vital learning experiences to millions of visitors each year. EXECUTION in partnership with the Secretary and his leadership team, the Board focused on securing the resources necessary for the Smithsonian to thrive. in a year marked by a weakened economy, the institution's public and private support remained strong. The Board encouraged the development of new and creative partnerships with government agencies, cultural organizations, and universities. it oversaw the creation of ambitious plans for the Smithsonian's rst-ever national fund-raising campaign. The Board also supported Secretary Clough's efforts to improve business practices. it continued to strengthen its relationships with the institution's many advisory boards. Through these and other efforts, the Board is supporting a Smithsonian that is a stronger, nimbler, and a more accessible institution than at any other time in its 164-year history. inForMATion on ThE ACTiviTiES And ACCoMPliShMEnTS oF ThE SMiThSoniAn'S BoArd oF rEgEnTS iS AvAilABlE onlinE AT www.Si.EdU/ ABoUT/rEgEnTS In January 2009, Patty Stonesifer was elected chair of the Smithsonian Board of Regents.25 SMITHSONIAN ENTERPRISES REPORT Smithsonian Enterprises provides unrestricted funds to the institution and its museums through the operation of revenue- generating activities that include museum stores, restaurants, iMAX theaters, the Smithsonian Catalog, Smithsonian and Air & Space/ Smithsonian magazines, the Smithsonian Channel, Smithsonian Books, and family, adult, and student travel programs.

Following the tradition of James Smithson, their extraordinary generosity supports the institution's most critical work, guided by the challenges and priorities of the strategic plan, in scientic investigation, environmental research, preservation of collections, creation of educational materials, and interpretation of the American experience and world cultures. in 2009, Smithson Society members enjoyed exclusive Food For Thoughtlunchtime lectures, members-only receptions with Smithsonian scholars and leaders, and a memorable Annual Members' weekend reception and dinner in the newly reopened national Museum of American history. Smithson Society members embraced the Smithsonian \u2014 and the world \u2014 with curiosity and a passion for learning, while contributing $1.54 million in unrestricted support to the institution. The Contributing Membership's forty-fourth year continued a remarkable record of dedicated philanthropy while ushering in signicant program changes. one of the country's largest museum membership programs, Contributing Members' giving ensured continued excellence in museum experiences, helped share the Smithsonian's treasures with the public, advanced programs and scholarship, and furthered the institution' s mission, guided by the strategic plan. Eighty-six thousand dedicated members, despite a difcult economy, proved their commitment by providing a remarkable $13.5 million in unrestricted support to the Smithsonian. At year's end, after exhaustive study, the program announced its new name, Friends of the Smithsonian, and additional member benets. These changes are intended to better reflect members' relationship with the Smithsonian and designed to deepen their appreciation of the institution and its accomplishments.

Zicarelli This past year, the Board participated in the institution's strategic planning process, providing valuable contributions to framing the plan's priorities and focus. in addition, the Board exercised its mission of support and advocacy by assisting in the development and dissemination of programs on tropical extinction and the Smithsonian' s use of emerging technology. Throughout the year, members worked within their own communities and with the Smithsonian to increase awareness among educators and education leaders about the resources the institution offers. Members and alumni served as advisors in their areas of expertise, counseling Smithsonian leadership. By reaching out to community and cultural leaders, they strengthened the national scope of the Smithsonian. As ambassadors for the institution, they welcomed Secretary Clough to their home towns, renewing ties and making new friends for the Smithsonian in seven cities. national Board Chair l. hardwick Caldwell iii completed his three-year term, and members elected vice Chair Paul neely as his successor. Continuing their 40-year tradition of generous philanthropy, Board members and alumni gave a total of $12.1 million in gifts to projects across the institution. This gure includes more than $1 million in unrestricted Board annual giving to support Secretarial priorities. /two.lprp/zero.lprp/zero.lprp/nine.lprp SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL BOARD l. hardwick Caldwell iii Chair Peggy P.
