We aimed to identify the prominent themes about vaccine hesitancy and refusal on social media posts in Turkish during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this qualitative study, we collected public tweets (n = 551,245) that contained a vaccine-related keyword and had been published between 9 December 2020 and 8 January 2021 through the Twitter API. A random sample of tweets (n = 1041) was selected and analyzed by four researchers with the content analysis method. We found that 90.5% of the tweets were about vaccines, 22.6% (n = 213) of the tweets mentioned at least one COVID-19 vaccine by name, and the most frequently mentioned COVID-19 vaccine was CoronaVac (51.2%). We found that 22.0% (n = 207) of the tweets included at least one anti-vaccination theme. Poor scientific processes (21.7%), conspiracy theories (16.4%), and suspicions towards manufacturers (15.5%) were the most frequently mentioned themes. The most co-occurring themes were \"poor scientific process\" with \"suspicion towards manufacturers\" (n = 9), and \"suspicion towards health authorities\" (n = 5). This study may be helpful for health managers, assisting them to identify the major concerns of the population and organize preventive measures through the significant role of social media in early spread of information about vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination attitudes.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-01-21", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Hesitancy and Anti-Vaccination Attitudes during the Start of COVID-19 Vaccination Program: A Content Analysis on Twitter Data vaccination is the key prevention strategy against communicable diseases, vaccine hesitancy is becoming more prevalent and is identified as one of the top ten threats to global health by the WHO [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00161)]. Vaccine-hesitant individuals are not homogeneous and their attitudes, ranging from partial acceptance to complete refusal of various vaccines, are influenced by a variety of factors. Determinants of vaccine hesitancy have been classified into three categories, contextual influences (socio-economic, cultural, political, health system factors, etc.), individual and group influences (knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, experiences, etc.), and vaccine/vaccination-specific issues (costs, etc.). Each of these determinants can act as a barrier against vaccine hesitancy or promote such attitudes [ [1](#B1-vaccines-10-00161), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00161)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00161)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-10-00161)]. Twitter is a leading social media platform, as it hosts real-time sharing of opinions, emotions, and content, and its large body of users provides access to broad populations. Data from these sources are used for content analysis, network analysis, surveillance, and even public health interventions [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00161)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00161)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00161)]. Although the number of users creating anti-vaccine content on social media is smaller than the total number of users who share vaccine-related content, their online presence is becoming more prevalent and the amount of interactions with their content is increasing [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00161)]. The content of anti-vaccine posts often includes personal stories, negative health impacts attributed to vaccination, discussions about vaccine ingredients, distrust of the pharmaceutical industry, criticism of vaccine research, political debates, and conspiracy theories [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00161), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-00161)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-10-00161), [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00161)]. Lack of information on vaccines and distrust about the side effects, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines are all important factors in vaccine acceptance in Turkey, as they are throughout the world [ [13](#B13-vaccines-10-00161)]. Despite the bans applied by social media platforms, anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant content posted in Turkish can be found on various social media platforms. A small number of studies have shown that vaccine-hesitant content involves arguments mainly relating to religious beliefs, in addition to distrust of the pharmaceutical industry and policymakers [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00161), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-00161)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-10-00161)]. Therefore, investigating anti-vaccine content on Twitter, a social media site where information and sentiment sharing about COVID-19 is high, may thus be beneficial for obtaining more detailed information about the subject during the pandemic. As anti-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant contents are not censored on social media in Turkey, this investigation may also help guide future interventions. In this study, we aimed to identify the prominent themes about vaccine hesitancy and refusal on Twitter during the start of COVID-19 vaccination program in Turkey. 2. Materials and Methods [17](#B17-vaccines-10-00161)], 72.5% of internet users aged 16-64 have used Twitter in the past month and 77.7% of the Turkish population uses the internet. [18](#B18-vaccines-10-00161)]. Instead of accessing all tweets in a particular day, Twitter allows users only to access tweets that contain user-provided keywords. Our software sends a request to Twitter using a search query and receives data of which the contents match the query. The query used in this study was composed of the keyword \"vaccine\" (\"a\" in Turkish) and its derivatives according to Turkish grammar. The complete search query can be found in [File S1 Supplementary Material](#app1-vaccines-10-00161). Due to the restrictions of the standard Twitter API, data were collected on a weekly basis. In total, 551,245 tweets were collected in the study period. [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00161)]. We specified that an initial sample size of 1000 tweets could be adequate to reach data saturation and feasible for manual coding. If this was not sufficient to reach data saturation, we decided to sample further batches of 500 tweets until reaching saturation (the method used for the assessment of data saturation is explained below). Taking potential daily differences in a variety of tweet contents into account, the sample was selected randomly from each day in proportion with the number of tweets on that particular day. Due to rounding, the final study sample contained 1041 tweets. [20](#B20-vaccines-10-00161)]. [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00161-f001)shows the number of new themes identified by the number of tweets analyzed for each researcher. As can be seen in the figure, there was only marginal information gain (2 out of 14 themes) after approximately 60 tweets has been analyzed and potentially discovering one more theme would cost approximately a thousand new tweets to be analyzed. In the second meeting, all researchers agreed that further sampling was not required and not efficient enough given the small likelihood of discovering new information. [File S2 Supplementary Material](#app1-vaccines-10-00161). The main qualitative findings are supported by descriptive statistics, presented as numbers and percentages for categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables that are not distributed normally. 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Statistics [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00161-t001)and [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00161-t002), respectively. All tweets were published from 1000 unique accounts, of which 2.7% were verified and 11.3% were organizational users ( [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00161-t001)). Among 1041 tweets included in the study, 90.5% were about vaccines, 11.1% included at least one visual, and 21.0% included a URL ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00161-t002)). [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-00161-f002). per day was 29.0 during 11-29 December which corresponds to the time before the arrival of the first group of vaccines to Turkey. [Table 3](#vaccines-10-00161-t003). As can be seen in [Table 3](#vaccines-10-00161-t003), 22.6% (n = 213) of the tweets included at least one name of a COVID-19 vaccine; 22.0% (n = 207) of the tweets included at anti-vaccination respectively. [Table 4](#vaccines-10-00161-t004), 213 tweets included a total of 235 COVID-19 vaccine names. The most frequently mentioned COVID-19 vaccine was CoronaVac (51.2%). However, it was mostly expressed as \"the (42.3%). 3.2. Emerging Themes \"poor scientific process\" accompanied \"suspicion towards manufacturers\" (n = 9) and \"suspicion towards health authorities\" (n = 5). 3.2.1. Poor Scientific Process Example 1: Why do we get the vaccine that even [nation name] government does not use it for its own people? We are not experimental subjects. Example 2: The only way to end the pandemic is to get vaccinated. However, no scientific evidence has been presented regarding the efficacy and the safety of the current vaccines. Without safety, no vaccine should be given to large populations. 3.2.2. Conspiracy Theories Example 1: Do you really believe all of these? They all tell you what globalists order them. First, it was supposed to end in 2021 summer, but now we are in 2021 winter, and they already extend it for the next ten years. I think it will end in 2071! My final call. What about those saying that vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel? Vaccines are useless apparently. Example 2: This is only the beginning. If we ain't gonna stop all these today, their next steps might be even more dangerous. Don't you get that the real matter is not COVID, vaccine, 5G, nor mask! 3.2.3. Suspicion towards Manufacturers Example 1: While [nation name] gets the vaccines from [another nation name] for its citizens, they sell us their illegal vaccine that does not even complete phase 3. Example 2: Today, I've heard rumors about, \"[company name] and [nation name] vaccines are produced with active and passive viruses, respectively. And those who've gotten the [company name] are miserable right now.\" I don't know about their accuracy and I could not see any news about them. But, as I said, it's all getting chaotic because they do not have any kind of safety mechanism. 3.2.4. Suspicion towards Health Authorities Example 1: [scientist name] [company name] [vaccine brand] etc. You can show the dirty past of all vaccine producers and medical companies. You can countin all the doctors and their institutions as well. And all the governments that took side... Media, don't be afraid. #GLOBALDECEPTION Example 2: Dear minister, we don't believe in you anymore. You've ruined the lives of all people and artisans. They are all #GLOBALDECEPTION We all are sick of your lies and do not trust in your vaccines. And, we are not gonna get any of them. [URL] 3.2.5. Undirected Distrust Example 1: Lies about pandemic and institutions that fuel the fear among society... COVID might be a game or more of a trailer for a bigger game. Even the vaccination is a huge mystery. Example 2: It should be all followed to see where this mutation stuff will be related to. I feel like it's gonna be a reason for the mandatory vaccination instead of the second wave. Almost all of the vaccination companies have already stated that the vaccines are effective even when the virus has mutated. 3.2.6. Violation of Autonomy Example 1: It is not obligated yet we are not happy with this vaccination imposition. #CitizensAreTheState Example 2: So they all are gonna make debates through my body about the mandatory vaccination, but I am gonna shut up, not look it up and come into the line like a sheep. Is that so? 3.2.7. Unsafety Example 1: Nobody knows the side effects of that vaccine on me. I prefer not having a vaccine that may harm or kill me, just for the sake of protecting others. And we all have a right to do this, do you get that? The vaccine or the experiment that's gonna happen to me, I'll make the call for that. What do you expect? Example 2: If the vaccine will result in malformed births for the next generations. I am pretty sure it will be. (There are tons of examples for the malformed births in Africa and India because of the mRNA vaccines). In order to avoid its damages, the unvaccinated generation should not marry with the vaccinated generation. You can't see the extent of its damages. 3.2.8. Non-Necessity Example 1: Did you even end the flu with vaccine? You cannot vaccinate a virus that's mutated. All we need is to have a strong immune system. That's it. Example 2: We do not wanna get vaccination or something like that. Does anybody hear our voice??? I've survived from corona at home without any medicine. My relative that had a hard time during their recoveries also survived from it at thome. The half of my country people have survived it. I don't wanna get a vaccination for something that I've already gotten the immunity for. 3.2.9. Ineffectiveness Example 1: I think the vaccination is not the way to end the disease. Whats' important is that we need to develop medicines that can lead people to survive from this disease easily. The flu vaccinations are not%100 protective and they're never gonna be. Everybody gets caught a flu and gets well with a medicine. That's the only solution that we should focus. Example 2: Does the COVID-19 vaccine not working well? A doctor who got the vaccine 6 days ago just caught the corona virus again. 3.2.10. Influential People Example 1: [Controversial celebrity name] praised the [nation name] vaccine and said that those who discredit it create negative perception. I hope you understand why we should question this vaccine. Example 2: Don't fool yourself, none of them have gotten the vaccine because there is no such a thing as COVID. You don't wanna get this. Do you really think that they all get the vaccine? 3.2.11. Pandemic Denial Example 1: Although it might be a regular vaccine, there is no need for it because there is no such a disease. But, how are you really gonna believe whether those people in the media saying that they got vaccinated? Also, its effects should last 4-5 years at least. Example 2: Look at these photos that were just taken. Also in Wuhan... Look, how China is messing with you al. Even there is a virus for those tribe countries that have almost no people living in them, China with 2 billion people is joking with the world. No vaccine, no treatment, yet we are done with virus, they says. WAKE UP PEOPLE THERE IS NO VIRUS 3.2.12. Financial Interests of Manufacturers Example 1: Those people used to say that vaccines will be free but now trying to make profit out of them. They'll even get taxes. Example 2: They all are really trying to make profit out of it. At the beginning, they all said that vaccines will be free, and now there are rumors saying that one dose will be 10 dollars. 3.2.13. China's Oppression of Uighurs Example 1: Things have done to our Uighur Turkish brothers are never ending. Also, we are contributing to the Chinese economy by taking the vaccination from them although the Chinese government is the responsible for all pressures and tortures. These vaccinations are betrayal to our Uighurian brothers #UighursCannotBeRepatriated Example 2: Let's stop all the fuss and I am not gonna get a vaccine or not even let them into my apartment who gathers Uighurians into more than 500 different camps under the so-called a training program 3.2.14. Religious Beliefs Example 1: We are not against the vaccine. We are against the vaccines that contain haram stuff. We wanna get halal drug and halal vaccine. #Vaccine #Drug #Halal #Local #National Example 2: How's it gonna be permissable both for them and for muslims? Whats the difference if we all gonna get that piggy foetus mRNA vaccine that gonna change our genetic codes? But, see the Pope does not even wear a mask. But of course it should be an exception because mask is a symbol of slavery and not gonna work out for them. 4. Discussion [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00161)]. [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-00161-f003)). We believe that general mistrust underlies these combinations of themes. [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00161)]. Furthermore, the lack of information during the time period of interest in our study about the results of phase 3 trials of CoronaVac, which was the only COVID-19 vaccine that was delivered to Turkey at the time, might have increased the prevalence of arguments in line with this theme in our sample. [22](#B22-vaccines-10-00161)] conducted in Arab Countries and Ortiz-S\u00e1nchez et al.'s systematic review [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00161)], which was performed on certain databases to analyze networks' information about the anti-vaccine movement. Sallam et al.'s questionnaire results showed that 59.5% of the respondents believed that COVID-19 is a man-made virus and 40% of them thought that it was made to force everyone to get the vaccine [ [22](#B22-vaccines-10-00161)]. According to Salali and Uysal's research that was conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Turkey using an online survey, 18% in Turkey and 12% in the UK thought that the origin of the virus was artificial [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-00161)]. In our study, we found that 3.6% of the tweets contained a comparable claim. Moreover, Nuzhath et al.'s content analysis, which was conducted on Twitter, showed similarities with our findings. That study also identified the theme of \"conspiracy theories\" and it was found to be the second most frequent theme, as in our study. Our findings parallel their findings in that this theme involved some theories such as that the \"Vaccine is being developed to limit or control population size\", \"Vaccine will contain microchip or tracking device\", \"5G/3G technology related to COVID-19 infection and vaccine\", and \"Vaccine makers created COVID-19\" [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00161)]. A similar concern was also found in Berry et al.'s study, regarding the \"microchip\" suspicion [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00161)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00161)], and the theme of \"authority figures\" was identified in a content analysis of tweets conducted in Canada [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-00161)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00161)]. [28](#B28-vaccines-10-00161)]. This threat to individual autonomy may be one of the reasons that provokes people to share their concern about mandatory vaccination. [26](#B26-vaccines-10-00161)]. The themes of \"non-necessity\" and \"ineffectiveness\" showed similarities with the determinants \"not required\" and \"vaccines not effective\" identified in the rapid literature review that was conducted in Europe before the COVID-19 pandemic [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00161)]. The \"non-necessity\" theme is also similar to the argument that developing immunity against coronavirus is not necessary as COVID-19 infections result in low mortality rates, which emerged in the Twitter-based research of Nuzhath et al., conducted in English [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00161)]. [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00161)]. Moreover, no relationship was found between the religious beliefs and neither negative nor positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines were identified in Kilic et al.'s research with Turkish participants [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00161)]. [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-00161-f004). Vaccine-hesitant people often expressed a concern regarding an outer threat, which sometimes targeted vaccine manufacturing countries but remained ambiguous in other instances. Some of the vaccine-hesitant informants in our sample did not believe that there was a pandemic at all and viewed the pandemic to be staged or planned by powerholders. Most of our informants expressed a distrust in vaccine manufacturers. This distrust was partially due to the manufacturers' financial interest in manufacturing vaccines but could also be related to conspiracy theories. As a combined result, hesitancy has arisen regarding the necessity, effectiveness, safety, procurement, and enforcement of vaccines and vaccination. Being or feeling distant from the decision-making processes regarding vaccination programs also contributes to this hesitancy. Although some tweets imply a distrust of modern science as an institution, the bypassing of lengthy scientific procedures in vaccine development processes was a more influential reason for hesitation. These scientific concerns might be interpreted as an improvement area and the trust of those questioning public health governance and policies regarding their compliance with science can be established through more effective science communication. The perception of an untrustworthy context such as during the initial stages of vaccination against COVID-19 leads to people being more easily influenced by the behavior of other people around them, which suggests that mending public trust is an important part of intervention against vaccine hesitancy. [31](#B31-vaccines-10-00161)]. Furthermore, in accordance with this discrepancy, the percentage of fully vaccinated citizens over 18 years of age reached 78.70% during the vaccination campaign in Turkey and this number is rising [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00161)] despite the prevalence of the vaccine-hesitant content in our study. [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00161), [33](#B33-vaccines-10-00161)]. However, almost all of these doubts can be removed with scientific proofs. Although new studies published every day have repeatedly proven the positive effects of vaccines, it is thought-provoking that the underlying reasons for opposition still prevail. The common findings revealed in the studies conducted among different populations show that both the official authorities and the industry should conduct their own self-criticism. Instead of ignoring doubts and concerns, they should address them and find solutions to eliminate them. From this perspective, it is critical for authorities to allow the people to participate in the decision-making processed, to provide transparency, give clear information, and undertake appropriate risk communication for the population. [34](#B34-vaccines-10-00161)]. In this sense, the repetition of this research in different time periods is important in terms of determining the different contents of hesitation in specific time periods. [35](#B35-vaccines-10-00161)]. Thus, we can suspect the presence of a relationship between people's negative attitudes against the vaccine and exposure to a range of negative attitudes from social media. Our findings can inform further studies on this relationship. [36](#B36-vaccines-10-00161)]. This study found that groups with negative contents had more interaction with other communities, which is an important finding in terms of understanding the spread of anti-vaccine arguments. Determining how these interactions occur during the pandemic period is also important for planning the interventions. Silva et al. demonstrated how to use people's opinions and networks from social media to inform a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and support policy making [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-00161)]. Qualitative studies such as ours can be used to improve the inputs for those kinds of models. 5.
